<p><b>Aurangzeb</b> (<a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a>: <span lang="fa" dir="rtl" style="white-space: nowrap;" xml:lang="fa">اورنگ‌زیب</span>‎, <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>: <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><i>Onetime Adorning the Crown</i></span>) (<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">November 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/1/1618.html" title="1618">1618</a> – <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/0/1707.html" title="1707">1707</a>), also known as <b>Alamgir I</b>, was the ruler of the <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughal_Empire_c07c.html" title="Mughal Empire">Mughal Empire</a> from 1658 until 1707. He was the sixth Mughal ruler after <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humayun.html" title="Humayun">Humayun</a>, <a href="../../../a/k/b/Akbar.html" title="Akbar">Akbar</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahangir.html" title="Jahangir">Jahangir</a>, and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shah_Jahan_81e9.html" title="Shah Jahan">Shah Jahan</a>. Aurangzeb was remarkably pious and zealous. Strict adherence to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Sharia</a> (Islamic law)—as he interpreted them—were the foundations of his reign. He codified and instituted Sharia law throughout the empire, abandoning the religious tolerance of his predecessors. During his reign, allegedly many <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> temples were defaced and destroyed, and many non-Muslims converted to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, both by inducement and by force.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The <a href="../../../j/i/z/Jizya.html" title="Jizya">Jizya</a>, a head tax on non-Muslims, was reinstated during his rule.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb ruled India for 48 years. He expanded the Mughal Empire to its greatest extent, encompassing all but the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent. His constant policies of war, however, left the empire dangerously overextended, isolated from its strong <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput.html" title="Rajput">Rajput</a> allies, and with a population that (except for the Muslim minority) expressed resentment, if not outright rebellion, to his reign.</p>
<p>He remains one of the most controversial figures in Indian history. His religious policies continue to inspire conflict between religious and political groups in India, Pakistan and elsewhere. He is generally regarded as the last great Mughal ruler. His successors, the 'Later Mughals', lacked his strong hand and the Hindu <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha_Empire_f811.html" title="Maratha Empire">Maratha Empire</a> mostly replaced Mughal rule during the rest of the 18th century.</p>

<p>Aurangzeb (full name: <i>Abu Muzaffar Muhiuddin Muhammad Aurangzeb Alamgir</i> --<a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a>: ابو مظفر محی الدین محمد اورنگزیب عالمگیر) was the third son of the fifth great <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughal.html" title="Mughal">Mughal</a> emperor <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shah_Jahan_81e9.html" title="Shah Jahan">Shah Jahan</a> (builder of the <a href="../../../t/a/j/Taj_Mahal_9d41.html" title="Taj Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>) and Arjumand Bānū Begum (also known as <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumtaz_Mahal_e69c.html" title="Mumtaz Mahal">Mumtaz Mahal</a>). After a rebellion by his father, part of Aurangzeb's childhood was spent as a virtual hostage at his grandfather <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahangir.html" title="Jahangir">Jahangir</a>'s court.</p>
<p>After Jahangir's death in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1627.html" title="1627">1627</a>, Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents. Shah Jahan followed the Mughal practice of assigning authority to his sons, and in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1634.html" title="1634">1634</a> made Aurangzeb <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subahdar.html" title="Subahdar">Subahdar</a> (governor) of the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deccan.html" title="Deccan">Deccan</a>. He moved to Kirki, which in time he renamed <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurangabad.html" title="Aurangabad">Aurangabad</a>. In <a href="../../../1/6/3/1637.html" title="1637">1637</a>, he married Rabia Daurrani. During this period the Deccan was relatively peaceful. In the Mughal court, however, Shah Jahan began to show greater and greater favoritism to his eldest son <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dara_Shikoh_ae50.html" title="Dara Shikoh">Dara Shikoh</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/4/1644.html" title="1644">1644</a>, Aurangzeb's sister <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahanara_Begum_f8ce.html" title="Jahanara Begum">Jahanara Begum</a> was accidentally burned in <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agra.html" title="Agra">Agra</a>. This event precipitated a family crisis which had political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure when returning to Agra three weeks after the event, instead of returning immediately on hearing of the accident. Shah Jahan dismissed him as the governor of Deccan. Aurangzeb later claimed (<a href="../../../1/6/5/1654.html" title="1654">1654</a>) he had resigned in protest of his father favoring Dara.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb's fortunes continued to decline. In <a href="../../../1/6/4/1645.html" title="1645">1645</a>, he was barred from the court for seven months. Later, Shah Jahan appointed him governor of <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarat.html" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>. He performed well and was rewarded. In <a href="../../../1/6/4/1647.html" title="1647">1647</a>, Shah Jahan made him governor of <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkh.html" title="Balkh">Balkh</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badakhshan.html" title="Badakhshan">Badakhshan</a> (near modern <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkmenistan.html" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>), replacing Aurangzeb's ineffective brother <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murad_Baksh_65e6.html" title="Murad Baksh">Murad Baksh</a>. These areas were at the time under attack from a various forces. Aurangzeb's military skill proved successful, and the story of how he spread his prayer rug and prayed in the midst of battle brought him much fame.</p>
<p>He was appointed governor of <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multan.html" title="Multan">Multan</a> alongside Osman Junaid and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindh.html" title="Sindh">Sindh</a> and began a protracted military struggle against the <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safavid.html" title="Safavid">Safavid</a> army in an effort to capture the city of <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kandahar.html" title="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>. He failed, and fell again into his father's disfavor.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/5/1652.html" title="1652">1652</a>, Aurangzeb was re-appointed governor of the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deccan.html" title="Deccan">Deccan</a>. But both man and place had changed. The Deccan produced poor tax revenue for the Mughals. In his previous term, Aurangzeb ignored the problem, allowing state-sanctioned corruption and extortion to grow. This time Aurangzeb set about reforming the system, but his efforts often placed additional burdens on the locals and were poorly received.</p>
<p>It was during this second governorship that Aurangzeb first recounts destroying a <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> temple. In addition, Aurangzeb's officers began treating non-Muslims harshly, and he defended these practices in letters to Shah Jahan's court. The practices would become themes in Aurangzeb's rule as emperor.</p>
<p>In an effort to raise additional revenues, Aurangzeb attacked the border kingdoms of <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golconda.html" title="Golconda">Golconda</a> (<a href="../../../1/6/5/1657.html" title="1657">1657</a>), and <a href="../../../b/i/j/Bijapur_Sultanate_605a.html" title="Bijapur Sultanate">Bijapur</a> (<a href="../../../1/6/5/1658.html" title="1658">1658</a>). Both times, Shah Jahan called off the attacks near the moment of Aurangzeb's triumph. Even at the time it was believed that the withdrawals had been ordered by Prince Dara, in Shah Jahan's name.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shah_Jahan_81e9.html" title="Shah Jahan">Shah Jahan</a> fell ill in <a href="../../../1/6/5/1657.html" title="1657">1657</a>, and was widely reported to have died. With this news, the struggle for succession began. Aurangzeb's eldest brother, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dara_Shikoh_ae50.html" title="Dara Shikoh">Dara Shikoh</a>, was regarded as heir apparent, but the succession proved far from certain. When Shah Jahan supposedly died, his second son, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shah_Shuja_9d04.html" title="Shah Shuja">Shah Shuja</a> declared himself emperor in <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengal.html" title="Bengal">Bengal</a>. Imperial armies sent by Dara and Shah Jahan soon restrained this effort, and Shuja retreated.</p>
<p>Soon after, Shuja's youngest brother <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murad_Baksh_65e6.html" title="Murad Baksh">Murad Baksh</a>, with secret promises of support from Aurangzeb, declared himself emperor in <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarat.html" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>. Aurangzeb, ostensibly in support of Murad, marched north from Aurangabad, gathering support from nobles and generals. Following a series of victories, Aurangzeb declared that Dara had illegally usurped the throne. Shah Jahan, determined that Dara would succeed him, handed over control of his empire to Dara. A Hindu lord opposed to Aurangzeb and Murad, <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharaja_Jaswant_Singh_b70c.html" title="Maharaja Jaswant Singh">Maharaja Jaswant Singh</a>, battled them both at Dharmatpur near <a href="../../../u/j/j/Ujjain.html" title="Ujjain">Ujjain</a>, leaving them heavily weakened. Aurangzeb eventually defeated Singh and concentrated his forces on Dara. A series of bloody battles followed, with troops loyal to Aurangzeb battering Dara's armies at <a href="http://horsesandswords.blogspot.com/2006/01/battle-of-samugarh.html" class="external text" title="http://horsesandswords.blogspot.com/2006/01/battle-of-samugarh.html" rel="nofollow">Samugarh</a>. In a few months, Aurangzeb's forces surrounded <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agra.html" title="Agra">Agra</a>. Fearing for his life, Dara departed for <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>, leaving behind Shah Jahan. The old emperor surrendered the <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agra_Fort_81c3.html" title="Agra Fort">Red Fort</a> of Agra to Aurangzeb's nobles, but Aurangzeb refused any meeting with his father, declaring that Dara was his enemy.</p>
<p>In a sudden reversal, Aurangzeb then had Murad arrested after intoxicating him and later executed him;<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Murad's former supporters, instead of fighting for Murad, defected to Aurangzeb. Meanwhile, Dara gathered his forces, and moved to Punjab. The army sent against Shuja was trapped in the east, its generals <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jai_Singh_I_0808.html" title="Jai Singh I">Jai Singh I</a> and Diler Khan, submitted to Aurangzeb, but allowed Dara's son Sulaiman to escape via the Himalayan foothills and join his father in Punjab. Aurangzeb offered Shuja the governorship of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengal.html" title="Bengal">Bengal</a>. This move had the effect of isolating Dara and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb. Shuja, however, uncertain of Aurangzeb's sincerity, continued to battle his brother, but his forces suffered a series of defeats at Aurangzeb's hands. At length, Shuja went into exile in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arakan.html" title="Arakan">Arakan</a> (in present-day <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>) where he disappeared, and was presumed to be dead.</p>
<p>With Shuja and Murad disposed of, and with his father Shah Jahan confined in Agra, Aurangzeb pursued Dara, chasing him across the northwest bounds of the empire. After a series of battles, defeats and retreats, Dara was betrayed by one of his generals, who arrested and bound him. In <a href="../../../1/6/5/1659.html" title="1659">1659</a>, Aurangzeb arranged a formal coronation in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>. He had Dara openly marched in chains back to Delhi; when Dara finally arrived, he had his brother executed. Legends about the cruelty of this execution abound, including stories that Aurangzeb had Dara's severed head sent to the dying Shah Jahan. With his succession secured, Aurangzeb kept Shah Jahan under house arrest at the Red Fort in Agra. Legends concerning this imprisonment abound, for the fort is ironically close to Shah Jahan's great architectural masterpiece, the <a href="../../../t/a/j/Taj_Mahal_9d41.html" title="Taj Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurangzeb.html" title="Edit section: Enforcement of Islamic law">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Enforcement of Islamic law</span></h3>
<p>The Mughals had for the most part been tolerant of non-Muslims (compared to Aurangzeb), allowing them to practice their customs and religion without too much interference. Though certain Muslim laws had been in place -- prohibitions against building new Hindu temples, the poll tax on non-Muslims (the <a href="../../../j/i/z/Jizyah.html" title="Jizyah">Jizyah</a>), was repealed by Emperor <a href="../../../a/k/b/Akbar.html" title="Akbar">Akbar</a> in 1562. Akbar also encouraged political tolerance toward the non-Muslim majority.</p>
<p>Until Aurangzeb's reign, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> had been guided by mystical <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufi.html" title="Sufi">Sufi</a> precepts. Although Sunni in ancestry, the emperors from <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humayun.html" title="Humayun">Humayun</a> on had tolerated or openly embraced the activities of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chisti.html" title="Chisti">Chisti</a> Sufis. But Aurangzeb abandoned many of the more liberal viewpoints of his predecessors. He espoused a more fundamentalist interpretation of Islam and a behavior based on the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Sharia</a> (Islamic law), which he set about codifying through edicts and policies. His <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatawa-e-Alamgiri_a65d.html" title="Fatawa-e-Alamgiri">Fatawa-e-Alamgiri</a>, is a 33 volume compilation of these edicts.</p>
<p>Under Aurangzeb, Mughal court life changed dramatically. According to his interpretation (in consultation with fundamentalist clerics), Islam did not allow <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a>. Thus, he banished court musicians, dancers and singers (Surprisingly, he is well accomplished in playing <a href="../../../v/e/e/Veena.html" title="Veena">veena</a>, a stringed instrument). Further, based on Muslim precepts forbidding images, he stopped the production of representational artwork, including the miniature painting that had reached its zenith before his rule. Soldiers and citizens were also given free rein to deface architectural images such as faces, flowers and vines -- even on the walls of Mughal palaces. Untold thousands of representational images were destroyed in this way. Aurangzeb abandoned the Hindu-inspired practices of former Mughal emperors, especially the practice of 'darshan', or public appearances to bestow blessings, which had been commonplace since the time of Akbar, as well as lavish celebrations of the Emperor's birthday.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb began to enact and enforce a series of edicts and with punishments. Most significantly, Aurangzeb initiated laws which sometimes interfered with non-Muslim worship. These included the destruction of several temples (mostly Hindu), a prohibition of certain religious gatherings, collection of the <a href="../../../j/i/z/Jizya.html" title="Jizya">jizya</a> tax, the closing of non-Islamic religious schools, and prohibition of practices deemed immoral by him, such as temple dances. Often the punishment for breaking these laws was death.</p>
<p>There were a great many rebellions during Aurangzebs's reign, including those by the Rajput states of Marwar and Mewar, and the <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhs.html" title="Sikhs">Sikhs</a>. Things came to such a head that <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Teg_Bahadur_c78e.html" title="Guru Teg Bahadur">Guru Teg Bahadur</a>, the 9th Guru of the Sikhs was tortured and executed by Aurangzeb for refusing to accept Islam, a martyrdom which is mourned to this day by the Sikh community. The 10th Guru of the Sikhs, <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Gobind_Singh_522b.html" title="Guru Gobind Singh">Guru Gobind Singh</a> led an open revolt against Aurangzeb. His efforts to conquer the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathas.html" title="Marathas">Marathas</a> also met with fierce resistance.</p>
<p>The climate of religious orthodoxy is often cited as the reason for these rebellions, as well as for the collapse of the Mughal empire after Aurangzeb. But many historians today are re-assessing the period, and offer economic and political reasons for the many rebellions and the disintegration that followed, rather than religious, including the fact that the empire had become too huge and unwieldy, also that Aurangzeb's long wars of expansion, especially his decades in the Deccan, seriously strained the imperial treasury, while the many new nobles created and promoted by him (many of them Deccanis) did not share the old loyalty to the empire. Above all, the peasantry was steadily getting bled to death.</p>
<p>Also, it is useful to note that even amidst the orthodoxy, a great many top imperial officers continued to be Hindu, including Aurangzeb's highest general Mirza Raja Jai Singh. The number of Hindu mansabdars actually went up in Aurangzeb's time to 33% in the fourth decade of his rule, from 24.5% under his father Shah Jahan.</p>

Such scenes would be rare in the latter part of his reign as he was permanently camped in the Deccan, fighting wars.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>From the start of his reign up until his death, Aurangzeb engaged in almost constant warfare. He built up a massive army, and began a program of military expansion at all the boundaries of his empire.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb pushed into the northwest -- into <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjab_region.html" title="Punjab region">Punjab</a>, and what is now <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. He also drove south, conquering Bijapur and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golconda.html" title="Golconda">Golconda</a>, his old enemies. He further attempted to suppress the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> territories, which had recently been liberated from Bijapur by <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shivaji.html" title="Shivaji">Shivaji</a>.</p>
<p>But the combination of military expansion and religious intolerance had far deeper consequences. Though he succeeded in expanding Mughal control, it was at an enormous cost in lives and treasure. And as the empire expanded in size, the chain of command grew weaker.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikhs</a> of Punjab grew both in strength and numbers in rebellion against Aurangzeb's armies. When the minor Muslim kingdoms of Golconda and Bijapur fell beneath Aurangzeb's might, rebellious Hindus flocked to join <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shivaji.html" title="Shivaji">Shivaji</a> and the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha_Empire_f811.html" title="Maratha Empire">Maratha Empire</a>. For the last 27 years of his life, Aurangzeb engaged in constant battles in the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deccan.html" title="Deccan">Deccan</a>, at enormous expense.</p>
<p>Even Aurangzeb's own armies grew restive -- particularly the fierce <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput.html" title="Rajput">Rajputs</a>, who were his main source of strength. Aurangzeb gave a wide berth to the Rajputs, who were mostly Hindu. While they fought for Aurangzeb during his life, mostly out of fear, on his death they immediately revolted against the Empire, an essential after effect of Aurangzeb's Islamic fundamentalist policies.</p>
<p>With much of his attention on military matters, Aurangzeb's political power waned, and his provincial governors and generals grew in authority.</p>

<p>The forcible conversion of non-Muslims to Islam was a policy objective under Aurangzeb's rule.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aurangzeb's ultimate aim was conversion of non-Muslims to Islam. Whenever possible the emperor gave out robes of honor, cash gifts, and promotions to converts.

<p>In economic and political terms, Aurangzeb's rule significantly favored Muslims over non-Muslims,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> and he interfered with non-Muslim religious practice through sweeping and often violent methods.

<p>During his reign, many hundreds -- perhaps many thousands -- of temples were desecrated: facades and interiors were defaced and their <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murti.html" title="Murti">murtis</a> (idols) looted. In many cases, temples were destroyed entirely; in numerous instances mosques were built on their foundations, sometimes using the same stones.His edicts show that he authorized and encouraged these acts. The history of the Mughal reign under Aurangzeb was chronicled as the Maāsir-i-ʻālamgiri, which states that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aurangzeb issued a general order to destroy all centers of Hindu learnings including Varnasi and destroyed the temple at Mathura and rename it as Islamabad<sup id="_ref-Harbans_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harbans" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Maasir_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Maasir" title="">[11]</a></sup></li>

<li>In Udaipur all Hindus of the town were killed as they vowed to defend the temple of Udaipur from destruction.172 temples were destroyed in Udaipur.<sup id="_ref-Maasir_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Maasir" title="">[11]</a></sup></li>
<li>66 temples were pulled down in Amber. All Hindu clerks were dismissed from the office of the Imperial empire.</li>

</ol>
<p>From the beginning of his reign, Aurangzeb permitted and even encouraged the defacement and destruction of Hindu temples. Other edicts added to the impact. In <a href="../../../1/6/6/1665.html" title="1665">1665</a> he forbade Hindus to display illuminations at Diwali festivals.<sup id="_ref-Mehta_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mehta" title="">[12]</a></sup> Hindu religious fairs were outlawed in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1668.html" title="1668">1668</a>. The following year, he prohibited construction of new Hindu temples as well as the repair of existing ones. In <a href="../../../1/6/7/1671.html" title="1671">1671</a> Aurangzeb issued an order that only Muslims could be landlords of crown lands. He ordered provincial Viceroys to dismiss all Hindu clerks. In <a href="../../../1/6/7/1674.html" title="1674">1674</a> certain lands owned by Hindus in Gujarat were confiscated. The customs duties levied on merchants was doubled for non-Muslims. In <a href="../../../1/6/7/1679.html" title="1679">1679</a>, contrary to the advice of many of his court nobles and theologians, Aurangzeb reimposed the <a href="../../../j/i/z/Jizya.html" title="Jizya">Jizya</a> tax on all non-Muslims.<sup id="_ref-Mehta_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mehta" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Speaking of the devastating persecution of the Hindu and his architectural symbols,<a href="../../../v/2E/s/V.S._Naipaul_6579.html" title="V.S. Naipaul">V.S. Naipaul</a> has written <i>" This is such a big and bad event that people still have to find polite, destiny-defying ways of speaking about it"</i></p>
<p>Among those that Aurangzeb is said to have destroyed were two most sacred to Hindus, in <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varanasi.html" title="Varanasi">Varanasi</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathura.html" title="Mathura">Mathura</a>. In both cases, he had large mosques built on the sites.

In <a href="../../../1/6/6/1661.html" title="1661">1661</a> Aurangzeb ordered the demolition of the temple, and constructed the Katra Masjid mosque.

And, following the practise of earlier emperors, he continued to confer jagirs upon some Hindu temples, such as the Someshwar Nath Mahadev temple in Allahabad, Jangum Badi Shiva temple in Banaras, and Umanand temple in Gauhati. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[14]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is again a disputed issue. Some (including Hindutva organisations like the RSS) hold that Aurangzeb's religious expansionist policies and his discriminatory laws, caused a momentous change in India in which peoples began to identify and align themselves according to their religions, a development would influence all subsequent Indian history. Many <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist_historiography.html" title="Marxist historiography">Marxist historiographers</a> like <a href="../../../i/r/f/Irfan_Habib_21c1.html" title="Irfan Habib">Irfan Habib</a> (who refers to a severe agrarian crisis), Athar Ali (who blames the never-ending Deccan wars), etc, believe that the real crisis was in the political and economic policies. And there are those like Satish Chandra who believe that the Mughal empire was already weakened (a jagirdari crisis) before Aurangzeb came to the throne, so it was only his steadfast commitment to strong rule and expansion that kept it from falling apart during his reign itself. In fact Athar Ali holds that the Islamicist propaganda of his reign was just that, propaganda to cover up the dubious methods he had used to come to power, and then the failed military expansions.</p>

<p>Many subjects rebelled against Aurangzeb's policies, among them his own son, Prince Akbar.</p>
<p>In 1667, the Yusufzais revolted near Peshawar and were crushed.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/6/1668.html" title="1668">1668</a> the Hindu <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jat.html" title="Jat">Jats</a> in the Agra district revolted.

<p>In 1670, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shivaji.html" title="Shivaji">Shivaji</a>, who had been defeated in 1666 by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, and brought to the Imperial Court at <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agra.html" title="Agra">Agra</a>, looted <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surat.html" title="Surat">Surat</a> again, thus re-opening war with the Mughals.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/7/1672.html" title="1672">1672</a> the Satnamis, a Kabirpanthi sect concentrated in an area near Delhi, staged an armed revolt, taking over the administration of Narnaul, and defeating Mughal forces in an advance on Delhi. Aurangzeb sent an army of ten thousand, including his Imperial Guard, and put the rebellion down with great loss of life.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards the Afghan Afridi clans in the northwest also revolted, and Aurangzeb was forced to lead his army personally to Hasan Abdal to subdue them.</p>
<p>When its Maharaja Jaswant Singh of <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jodhpur.html" title="Jodhpur">Jodhpur</a> died in <a href="../../../1/6/7/1679.html" title="1679">1679</a>, a conflict ensued over who would be the next Raja, Aurangzeb's choice of a nephew of the former Maharaja not being accepted by other members of Jaswant Singh's family. They rebelled, but in vain. Aurangzeb seized control of <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jodhpur.html" title="Jodhpur">Jodhpur</a>, destroying many Hindu temples. He also moved on Udaipur, which was the only other state of Rajputana to support the rebellion. There was never a clear resolution to this conflict, although it is noted that the other Rajputs, including the celebrated Kachwaha Rajput clan of Mirza Raja Jai Singh, also the Bhattis, Haras and Rathods, remained loyal. On the other hand, Aurangzeb's own third son, Prince Akbar, joined the rebels, along with a few Muslim Mansabdar supporters, in the hope of dethroning his father and becoming emperor. (Once again the easy divide of Muslim Aurangzeb versus 'all the Hindus' is called into question.) The rebels were however defeated and Akbar fled south to the shelter of the Maratha Sambhaji, Shivaji's successor. When they were defeated as well, and Sambhaji killed, he fled abroad where he died.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurangzeb.html" title="Edit section: The Deccan wars and the rise of the Marathas">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Deccan wars and the rise of the Marathas</span></h3>
<p>In the time of Shah Jahan, the Deccan had been controlled by three Muslim kingdoms: Ahmednagar, Bijapur and Golconda. Following a series of battles, Ahmendnagar was effectively divided, with large portions of the kingdom ceded to the Mughals and the balance to Bijapur. One of Ahmednagar's generals, a Hindu <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> named <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahaji.html" title="Shahaji">Shahaji</a>, retreated to Bijapur. Shahaji appointed his wife and young son <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shivaji.html" title="Shivaji">Shivaji</a> in <a href="../../../p/u/n/Pune.html" title="Pune">Pune</a> to look after his jagir.</p>
<p>In 1657, while Aurangzeb attacked Golconda and Bijapur, Shivaji, using guerrilla tactics, took control of three Bijapuri forts formerly controlled by his father. With these victories, Shivaji assumed defacto leadership of many independent Maratha clans. The Marathas harried the flanks of the warring Bijapuris and Mughals, gaining weapons, forts, and territories. During the war of succession, Shivaji's small and ill-equipped army survived an all out Bijapuri attack, and Shivaji personally killed the Bijapuri general, <a href="../../../a/f/z/Afzul_Khan_b983.html" title="Afzul Khan">Afzul Khan</a>. With this event, the Marathas transformed into a powerful military force, capturing more and more Bijapuri and Mughal territory.</p>
<p>Following his coronation in <a href="../../../1/6/5/1659.html" title="1659">1659</a>, Aurangzeb sent his trusted general and maternal uncle <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaista_Khan_3755.html" title="Shaista Khan">Shaista Khan</a> to the Deccan to recover his lost forts. Shaista Khan drove into Marathi territory, and took up residence in <a href="../../../p/u/n/Pune.html" title="Pune">Pune</a>. In a daring raid, Shivaji attacked the governor's residence in Pune, killed Shaista Khan's son, even hacking off Shaista Khan's thumb as he fled. Once more the Marathis rallied to his leadership, taking back the territory.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb for the next few years ignored the rise of the Marathas. Shivaji led by inspiration, not by official authority, and the Marathas continued to capture forts belonging to both Mughals and Bijapur. At last Aurangzeb sent his Jaipuri general <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jai_Singh_c220.html" title="Jai Singh">Jai Singh</a>, a Hindu, to attack the Marathas.</p>
<p>Jai Singh's blistering attacks were so successful that he was able to persuade Shivaji to agree to peace by becoming a Mughal vassal. But when Shivaji and his son accompanied Jai Singh to Agra to meet Aurangzeb, confusion occurred, ending in an altercation at he fealty ceremony. As a result, Shivaji and his son <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sambhaji.html" title="Sambhaji">Sambhaji</a> were placed under house arrest in Agra, from which they daringly managed to escape.</p>
<p>Shivaji returned to the Deccan, successfully drove out the Mughal armies, and was crowned <a href="../../../c/h/h/Chhatrapati.html" title="Chhatrapati">Chhatrapati</a> or Emperor of the Maratha Empire in <a href="../../../1/6/7/1674.html" title="1674">1674</a>. While Aurangzeb continued to send troops against him, Shivaji expanded Maratha control throughout the Deccan until his death in <a href="../../../1/6/8/1680.html" title="1680">1680</a>.</p>
<p>Sambhaji succeeded in <a href="../../../1/6/8/1681.html" title="1681">1681</a>. Though he was less effective militarily and politically, Mughal efforts to control the Deccan continued to fail.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb's son <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sultan_Muhammad_Akbar_d669.html" title="Sultan Muhammad Akbar">Akbar</a> left the Mughal court and joined with Sambhaji, inspiring some Mughal forces to join the Marathas. Aurangzeb in response moved his court to Aurangabad and took over command of the Deccan campaign. More battles ensued, and Akbar fled to Persia.</p>
<p>For nine years, Aurangzeb couldn't win a single fort from the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a>. But in <a href="../../../1/6/8/1689.html" title="1689">1689</a> Aurangzeb captured <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sambhaji.html" title="Sambhaji">Sambhaji</a> by treachery and publicly tortured and killed him. His brother <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajaram%2C_Chhatrapati_9336.html" title="Rajaram, Chhatrapati">Rajaram</a> succeeded, but the empire fell into disarray. Surprisingly, however, this collapse provided the Marathas with great military advantage. Maratha Sardars (commanders) fought individual battles against the Mughals, and territory changed hands again and again during years of endless warfare. As there was no central authority among the Marathas, Aurangzeb was forced to contest every inch of territory, at great cost in lives and treasure. Even as Aurangzeb drove west, deep into Maratha territory (notably conquering <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satara.html" title="Satara">Satara</a>), the Marathas expanded attacks eastward into Mughal lands, including Mughal-held <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malwa.html" title="Malwa">Malwa</a> and <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyderabad_State_df88.html" title="Hyderabad State">Hyderabad</a>. Once, the Marathas attacked the imperial camp in the night, and cut off the ropes of the Emperor's tent. The Emperor escaped being crushed by the heavy tent only because he happened to spend that night in another tent.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb waged continual war for more than two decades with no resolution. After his death, new leadership arose among the Marathas, who soon became unified under the rule of the <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshwa.html" title="Peshwa">Peshwas</a> during the reign of Shivaji's grandson, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahu.html" title="Shahu">Shahu</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurangzeb.html" title="Edit section: The Pashtun rebellion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Pashtun rebellion</span></h3>
<p>Along with the Rajputs, the Pashtun tribesmen of the Empire were considered the bedrock of the Mughal Army as well as crucial defenders of the Mughal Empire from the threat of invasion from the West. The Pashtun revolt in 1672 was triggered when soldiers under the orders of the Mughal Governor Amir Khan attempted to molest women of the <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safi.html" title="Safi">Safi</a> tribe in modern day <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kunar_Province_d5b0.html" title="Kunar Province">Kunar</a>. The Safi tribes attacked the soldiers. This attack provoked a reprisal, which triggered a general revolt of most of the tribes. Attempting to reassert his authority, Amir Khan led a large Mughal Army to near the <a href="../../../k/h/y/Khyber_pass.html" title="Khyber pass">Khyber pass</a>. There the army was surrounded by tribesmen and routed, with only four men -- including the Governor -- managing to escape.</p>
<p>After that the revolt spread, with the Mughals suffering a near total collapse of their authority along the Pashtun belt. Particularly felt was the closure of the important Attock to Kabul trade route along the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Trunk_road_6663.html" title="Grand Trunk road">Grand Trunk road</a>. By 1674 the situation had deteriorated to the extent that Aurangzeb himself camped at Attock to personally take charge. Switching to diplomacy and bribery along with force of arms, the Mughals eventually split the rebellion and while they never managed to wield effective authority outside the main trade route, the revolt was partially suppressed. However the long term anarchy on the Mughal frontier that prevailed as a consequence ensured that Nadir Shah's forces half a century later faced little resistance on the road to Delhi.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurangzeb.html" title="Edit section: Defiance of the Sikhs and the rise of the Khalsa">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Defiance of the Sikhs and the rise of the Khalsa</span></h3>
<p>Since its founding by <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Nanak_1360.html" title="Guru Nanak">Guru Nanak</a> in the 1500s, <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikhism</a> grew in popularity throughout India, particularly in the Punjab. Even Emperor <a href="../../../a/k/b/Akbar.html" title="Akbar">Akbar</a> is said to have been a great admirer of the third Guru, and to have donated land to him for the creation of the <a href="../../../a/m/r/Amritsar.html" title="Amritsar">Amritsar</a> tank. But in the years following the persecution and death of the fifth <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Arjan_Dev_ea32.html" title="Guru Arjan Dev">Guru Arjan Dev</a> by Aurangzeb's grandfather <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahangir.html" title="Jahangir">Jahangir</a>, the Sikh-Mughal conflict grew. Some historians believe that the root of this conflict was not religious but political, in the fact that the Gurus had supported Prince Khusrao over Jehangir in the latter's battle for the throne, and then Dara over Aurangzeb in the next generation. They are also reported to have started collecting taxes in the Punjab region.</p>
<p>Early in Aurangzeb's reign, various insurgent groups of Sikhs engaged Mughal troops in increasingly bloody battles. In 1670, the ninth <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikh</a> Guru, <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Tegh_Bahadur_1371.html" title="Guru Tegh Bahadur">Guru Tegh Bahadur</a> encamped in Delhi, receiving large numbers of followers, which is said to have attracted the ire of Aurangzeb.</p>
<p>Sikhs and Kashmiri Pandits recount that in <a href="../../../1/6/7/1675.html" title="1675">1675</a> a group of Kashmiri brahmins, who were of the Hindu faith, were being pressured by Muslim authorities to convert to Islam and approached Guru Tegh Bahadur with their dilemma. To demonstrate a spirit of unity and tolerance, the Guru agreed to help the brahmins: He told them to inform Aurangzeb that the brahmins would convert only if Guru Tegh Bahadur himself was converted.</p>
<p>His response led to his death. The Guru and his diciples were tortured by various methods, boiled alive, burned alive, sawn in half and scalped. Needless to say, Aurangzeb decided to try more brutal methods to force Tegh Bahadur Sahib to accept Islam. He was kept in chains and imprisoned for three days in an iron cage designed to be shorter than the prisoner's height, with sharp spikes pointing inwards, so that the victim could neither stand, nor sit, nor lean against the walls of the cage<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[16]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The execution of Guru Tegh Bahadur infuriated the Sikhs. In response, his son and successor, <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Gobind_Singh_522b.html" title="Guru Gobind Singh">Guru Gobind Singh</a> further militarized his followers.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb installed his son <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahadur_Shah_a770.html" title="Bahadur Shah">Bahadur Shah</a> as governor of the northwest territories, including Sikh-controlled parts of Punjab. The new governor relaxed enforcement of Aurangzeb's edicts, and an uneasy peace ensued. However, Guru Gobind Singh had determined that the Sikhs should actively prepare to defend their territories and their faith. In 1699 he established the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalsa.html" title="Khalsa">Khalsa</a> a Sikh order of "saint-soldiers" or "warrior-monks", ready to die for their cause.</p>
<p>This development alarmed not only the Mughals, but the nearby Rajputs. In a temporary alliance, both groups attacked Guru Gobind Singh and his followers. The united Mughal and Rajput armies laid siege to the fort at Anandpur Sahib. Although they faced certain death, the Sikhs refused to surrender. In an attempt to dislodge the Sikhs, Aurangzeb vowed that the Guru and his Sikhs would be allowed to leave Anandpur safely. Aurangzeb is said to have validated this promise in writing. Unconfirmed by scholars, this account of the promise is unlikely; however, seeing the suffering of his followers, Guru Gobind Singh Ji had made plans to sneak away. It is reported that in the absence of any formal surrender by the Sikhs, as they abandoned the fort under the cover of darkness, the Mughals were alerted and enagaged the battle to ensue again.</p>
<p>The Mughals, although suffering some mighty losses, apparently killed all four of Guru Gobind Singh's sons and decimated much of the Sikh army. Only Guru Gobind Singh and forty others escaped. Guru Gobind Singh in response sent Aurangzeb an eloquent yet defiant letter entitled the <a href="../../../z/a/f/Zafarnama.html" title="Zafarnama">Zafarnama</a> (<i>Notification of Victory</i>), accusing the emperor of treachery, and claiming a moral victory.</p>
<p>On receipt of this letter, Aurangzeb is said to have invited Guru Gobind Singh to meet in Ahmednagar, but Aurangzeb died before Guru Gobind Singh arrived.</p>

<p>Aurangzeb's influence continues through the centuries, affecting not only India, but Asia, and the world. He was the first ruler to attempt to impose Sharia law on a non-Muslim country. His critics, principally Hindu, decry this as intolerance, while his mostly Muslim supporters applaud him, some calling him a <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_Pir_b987.html" title="Islam Pir">Pir</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliph</a>. He engaged in nearly perpetual war, justifying the ensuing death and destruction on moral and religious grounds. He eventually succeeded in the imposition of Islamic Sharia in his realm, but alienated many constituencies, not only non-Muslims, but also native <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27ites.html" title="Shi'ites">Shi'ites</a>. This led to increased militancy by the Marathas, the Sikhs, and Rajputs, who along with other territories broke from the empire after his death, and to disputes among Indian Muslims. The destruction of Hindu temples remains a dark stain on Muslim/Hindu relations to this day.</p>
<p>Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb did consider the royal treasury as a trust of the citizens of his empire and did not use it for personal expenses or extravagant building projects. He left few buildings, save for a modest mausoleum for his first wife, <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bibi_Ka_Maqbara_8815.html" title="Bibi Ka Maqbara">Bibi Ka Maqbara</a>, sometimes called the mini-Taj, in Aurangabad. He also created the <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badshahi_Masjid_fa87.html" title="Badshahi Masjid">Badshahi Masjid</a> mosque (Imperial or Alamgiri Mosque) in <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahore.html" title="Lahore">Lahore</a>, which was once the largest outside of Mecca. He also added a small marble mosque known as the <i><a href="../../../m/o/t/Moti_Masjid_6001.html" title="Moti Masjid">Moti Masjid</a></i> (Pearl Mosque) to the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi_Fort_f303.html" title="Delhi Fort">Red Fort</a> complex in Delhi. His constant warfare, however, drove his empire to the brink of bankruptcy just as much as the wasteful personal spending and opulence of his predecessors.</p>

<p>He alienated many of his children and wives, driving some into exile and imprisoning others. At the ebb of his life, he expressed his loneliness and perhaps a regret for his militant intolerant rule. His personal piety, however, is undeniable. Unlike the often alcohol- and women-absorbed personal lives of his Mughal predecessors, he led an extremely simple and pious life. He followed Muslim precepts with his typical determination, and even memorized the entire <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>. He knitted <a href="../../../h/a/j/Haj.html" title="Haj">haj</a> caps and copied out the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> throughout his life and sold these anonymously. He used the proceeds, and only these, to fund his modest resting place. He died in <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmednagar.html" title="Ahmednagar">Ahmednagar</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/0/1707.html" title="1707">1707</a> at the age of 90, having outlived many of his children. His modest open-air grave, in <a href="../../../k/u/l/Kuldabad.html" title="Kuldabad">Kuldabad</a>, expresses his strict and deep interpretation of Islamic beliefs.</p>
<p>After Aurangzeb's death, his son <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahadur_Shah_I_9f6d.html" title="Bahadur Shah I">Bahadur Shah I</a> took the throne. The Mughal Empire, due both to Aurangzeb's overextension and cruelty and to Bahadur's weak military and leadership qualities, entered a long decline. Immediately after Bahadur Shah occupied the throne, the Maratha Empire (held at bay by Aurangzeb, albeit at a high human and monetary cost) consolidated and launched effective invasions of Mughal territory, seizing power from the weak emperor. Within 100 years of his death, the Mughal Emperor would simply be a puppet of the first, the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha_Empire_f811.html" title="Maratha Empire">Maratha Empire</a> and then, the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_East_India_Company_534d.html" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a>, with little power beyond Delhi and ignored by most Indian princes.</p>
