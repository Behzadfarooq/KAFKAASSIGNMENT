<p>Actually, it might be that bison that still lives in the Polish hunting reserve...<a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></p>
<p>We are on the right track here, a Wisent is <i>Bison bonasus</i>... <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<p>Doesn't everyone agree that this image (<i>left</i>) does not belong on this page? Any defenders? <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 21:17, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is spelled "Aurochs" in Webster's <i>New World Dictionary of the American Language, College Edition.</i> (German Auerochs, Old High German O.H.G. urohso ur- )</p>
<p>Yahoo powered by google shows&#160;: Auroch= appr 1700 x Aurochs= appr 3600x Auerochs , the German spelling shows = website zoologie, tu (University) Munich forrest http://zoologie.forst.tu-Muenchen.de/HEITLAND/BSWT/MAMMALIA/UNGULATA/BOVIDAE/BOS/bos.primigenus.html This site states that the last on lived in Masuren Masuria ,not Poland . user:H.J.</p>

<hr />
<p>user:H.J., you are correct that it is aurochs, both singular and plural . I will move this now. By the way, the link you have above does not work for me. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Drye_7d5e.html" title="User:Paul Drye">Paul Drye</a></p>
<p>Further detail on the Auroch or Aurochs thing -- the "S" on the end is an artifact. "Ochs" as in "Ox" not "more than one Och". It's an "Aur Ox", to use modern spelling. Though, no, the plural is not "Aur Oxen"&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Drye_7d5e.html" title="User:Paul Drye">Paul Drye</a></p>
<p><br />
--In fact the modern german name is Auerochse, not Auerochs, with the plural Auerochsen.</p>
<p>I think the etymology of the name and relation to the modern word "Ox" is interesting enough to go into the body of the article. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Millar_a107.html" title="User:Alan Millar">Alan Millar</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Ok -- I think it has been mentioned above that Aurochs might be the correct name. BUT DAMMIT, DON'T EVEN START WITH THE MASURIA IS PRUSSIA STUFF. IN 1627 IT WAS BLOODY POLAND, ALL RIGHT??? I ACTUALLY READ THE STUFF ON THREE WEBSITES. THE SOURCE IS FROM MASURIA, BUT THE AUTHOR IS A MEMBER OF THE POLISH COURT, TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN POLAND. THE KING OF POLAND RESERVED THE RIGHT TO BE SOLE HUNTER OF THE AUROCHS. THE AUROCHS ONLY LIVED IN THE POLISH ROYAL FOREST. <b>IT WAS NOT IN PRUSSIA AT THE TIME THE LAST AUROCHS WAS KILLED, NOR FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE OF CENTURIES BEFORE.</b> Please, for my sanity, stop trying to assert that all of northern central Europe is, was, and always has been Prussia. It isn't, wasn't, and has at times been. That's the best you can prove. Boundaries change. <a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></p>
<hr />
<p>You did not read it all. When you do, you can ask the tu , Munich, I stated what they have stated Masuren , and not Masovia or Masovien. That is why I asked the question on <strong class="selflink">/talk</strong>. user:H.J.</p>
<p>I think you missed the point... <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<p>Gee, I dunno, user:H.J.. Maybe because the whole bloody article is written in German? In English it is always written Masovia. In 1627, Masovia or Masuren or whatever it is in whatever language you like, WAS IN POLAND. The Aurochs died in the Polish King's private hunting grounds -- were they in Prussia? I think not.<a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Time for a cup of tea, JHK? Or something a little stronger?&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Sorry , Masuren or Masurenland , Masurische Seen Platte (English Masovia) always has been and is in southern part of Prussia, to the north of Masovia. user:H.J.</p>
<p>I do not believe it! Victor Meldrew</p>
<hr />
<p>Let me get this straight, user:H.J....you are saying here, absolutely, in front of God (or gods or any other appropriate NPOV deity or lack thereof) and all your fellow Wikipedians, that Masovia or, in German Masuren, has NEVER been within the official borders of the Kingdom (or any other type of government in its history) of Poland? Think carefully -- what credibility you have left depends upon your answer...<a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Alan -- All of the websites I checked pretty uniformly said the Aurochs looked like the Lascaux cave paintings. The modern re-creation also looks like that. I think the picture from the 1911 source might be wrong -- it looks more like pictures of the Wisent to me. Would it be ok to remove it? <a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></p>
<p>Yes, the picture I found is not <i>Bos primigenius</i>, it is <i>Bison bonasus</i>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Webster's 1911 referred to <i>Bison bonasus</i> as the aurochs. It looks like the more up-to-date usage is that aurochs is <i>Bos primigenius</i>, and wisent is <i>Bison bonasus</i>. Does that sound right? --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Millar_a107.html" title="User:Alan Millar">Alan Millar</a></p>
<hr />
<p>That's what I found...<a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></p>
<hr />
<p>JHK , you do not show that you have contacted the website to clear if they meant Masovia, while they state Masuren . user:H.J.</p>
<hr />
<p>The link is wrong. The hunting reserve where the last aurochs was killed was just outside Warsaw. The royal forest of Jaktorów to be precise. Very much in Masovia. -- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Drye_7d5e.html" title="User:Paul Drye">Paul Drye</a></p>
<hr />
<p>To <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Drye_7d5e.html" title="User:Paul Drye">Paul Drye</a> If it was just outside of Warsaw, it is correct to say Masovia. Where did you read this&#160;? Please let me know. Thank you user:H.J.</p>

<p>I found it in a few places on the web. For some reason most of them are in French, but an English one is:</p>

<p>Thanks,Paul, I just found it on aristotle. It says that the last aurochs died of natural cause user:H.J.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, there seems to be a split of opinion as to whether the last one was shot or just died. I tend to believe the paper on Aristotle, as it seems quite well researched, but I'm trying to find a few more sources in the hopes of clearing it up. -- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Drye_7d5e.html" title="User:Paul Drye">Paul Drye</a></dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Remember... when all seems bad, remember that <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything2.html" title="Everything2">everything2</a>'s primary writeup on Aurochs ( <a href="http://www.everything2.com/?node=aurochs" class="external free" title="http://www.everything2.com/?node=aurochs" rel="nofollow">http://www.everything2.com/?node=aurochs</a> ) is about <a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_The_Gathering_240a.html" title="Magic: The Gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a>! But it's interesting to note that Webster 1913 seemed to believe Aurochs were ' <i>nearly</i> exinct'...</p>
<hr />
<p>Thank you, both of you , I had heard about the 're-creation' (early zoology) and continuation of the Aurochs. I am glad that you pointed me to the everything2 site, especially that my best search engine sofar <a href="http://www.webtop.com" class="external free" title="http://www.webtop.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.webtop.com</a> just went down the drain. user:H.J.</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<p>Small clarification here, and an apology for yelling. When I revised the Auroch entry, I revised it after reading that the last Aurochs was killed in Masovia. Didn't even notice that the original entry had the wrong place altogether. It didn't occur to me at the time that the usual "it was in Prussia" discussion had been sidetracked by the misinformation that this happened in an entirely different province -- one that is in Prussia -- than the one I was talking about, which is in Poland.

<p><i>Ancient cave dwellings show rock paintings and carvings of magical strength connected with the aurochs.</i></p>
<p>I happen to agree with this. However, I can't figure out how we "paint or carve magical strength". We need to rephrase this and put it back. Thanks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It sounds like a right load of old Aurochs to me too. I will see whether we can't paint or carve this magically into shape... <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>In these and many other early art-works, the aurochs are attributed with possessing magical qualities.</i></p>
<p>How the <i>heck</i> are we supposed to infer this from cave paintings? Maybe the artists meant to attribute the aurochs with being very organized, or attractively shaped, or well worth the effort of barbecuing.</p>
<p>They are certainly not worth barbecuing: they have been in the freezer far too long. Frankly, my take is this: they are painted ergo they are worthy of representation. If they are merely <i>attributed (etc)</i>, this covers most of the bases since we don't need to get into long and tedious discussions about the role of the palaeolithic hunter/magician nor the converse view that the paintings were nothing to do with magic whatsoever but were in fact the palaeolithic equivalent of car mags, depicting things that men like looking at in their spare time. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, long, but not everyone would find them "tedious", though I don't mean to have the conversation here. It's just that people can be pretty blithe about saying what art from other cultures means, with paleolithic art a great example of this.

<dd>Correct. The illustration from Webster we've been showing here at <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurochs.html" title="Aurochs">Aurochs</a> is an <i>American</i>, not even "Lithianian", bison.

<p>Dear all, I appreciate your interest in aurochs, because for many years I studied this bovine species; its history, morphology and ecology were all part of my study. That is why I can inform you that aurochs and European bison are two different bovine species. The first one is extinct, the other is still alive. The last aurochs lived in the Forest of Jaktorów, a royal forest near Warsaw, in the Province of Masovia (Poland). Masuria, in the Northeast of Poland, formerly was Prussian area, afterwards conquered by the Germans and nowadays Polish. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate about asking me.</p>
<p>Cheers Cis</p>

Hi Paul, The site I gave is partly in Dutch and partly in English. I have changed the introduction path. The (partial) English text is the following:</p>
<p>'This site provides information about the research into the history, morphology and ecology of the aurochs (Bos primigenius) by Cis van Vuure. After a many years’ research, the writing started in April 1998 and ended in April 2000. Eventually in 2003, we managed to publish this research in the form of a nice, illustrated (Dutch) book. Finally we found Pensoft Publishers willing to publish the English version, entitled ‘Retracing the aurochs – history, morphology and ecology of an extinct wild ox’. Halfway this year the book will be available. If you are interested in it and want to be put on the mailing list, please send me an email'.</p>
<p><br />
This is not a commercial book, at least not for me: I spent so much money and effort that I shall never be compensated completely for it. This book tells the comprehensive story about all aspects of the aurochs and its relatives, and also of Heck cattle, the so-called bred-back aurochs. This was the only way to research and unmask all those mysteries around the aurochs.</p>

<p>"According to the Paleontologisk Museum, University of Oslo, aurochs evolved in India some two million years ago, migrated into the Middle East and further into Asia, and reached Europe about 250,000 years ago."</p>
<p>False. Aurochs reached <b>Germany</b> and northern Europe about 250,000 years ago, but they occurs in the Iberian Peninsula since 700,000 years ago or more. Indeed, inmediate ancestor of aurochs, <i>Bos acutifrons</i>, lived in India, but the first <i>Bos taurus primigenius</i> are from central Spain. Please, visit this link:</p>

<hr />
<p>That is indeed an error. I've edited the URL in the previous post here on this page. The old URL will be gone soon. That page is part of my website (<a href="http://extinct.petermaas.nl" class="external text" title="http://extinct.petermaas.nl" rel="nofollow">The Extinction Website</a>). The main source for the information on my website about the aurochs was and is the research done by Cis van Vuure. Personally I have the Dutch version, but the English version has become available this year. I can recomment this book to everyone who is interested in the aurochs. I personally have not seen such a complete and comprehensive work on the aurochs before. You can visit the website of Cis van Vuure at: <a href="http://members.chello.nl/~t.vanvuure/oeros/oeros.html" class="external text" title="http://members.chello.nl/~t.vanvuure/oeros/oeros.html" rel="nofollow">RESEARCH INTO THE AUROCHS</a>. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmaas_8441.html" title="User:Pmaas">Pmaas</a> 20:28, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/r/Talk%7EAurochs_18b4.html" title="Edit section: Binomial name Error">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Binomial name Error</span></h2>
<p>The page says as binomial name the following: <i>Bos taurus</i> Bojanus, 1827. This is of course incorrect as it than should be <i>Bos taurus</i> Linnaeus, 1758. Bojanus named the aurochs: <i>Bos primigenius</i> Bojanus, 1827.</p>
<p>Linnaeus gave the European domesticated cattle breeds its scientific name <i>Bos taurus</i> Linnaeus, 1758. He knew that the wild ancestor of domesticated cattle breeds had lived in Europe and maybe still lived at the time. We know this because he had classified 'urus' (= aurochs) under the same species name. Linnaeus saw the aurochs and the European domesticated cattle as one and the same species. In the time of Linnaeus the memory of the aurochs was almost completely disappeared. There was some confusion and discussion on the number of wild cattle species that existed in Europe. Like Bojanus, some said that only one species existed, namely the European bison or wisent (<i>Bison bonasus</i>). Others said that there were two species, namely the European bison and the aurochs. In the beginning of the 19th century many bones of aurochs were excavated and one complete skeleton existed. Bojanus named a new species from this skeleton: <i>Bos primigenius</i> Bojanus, 1827. (Van Vuure, 2003)</p>
<p>Nowadays we know that <i>Bos primigenius</i> and <i>Bos taurus</i> belong to the same species, so conform to the Code of the International Commission of Zoological Nomenclature was the scientific name of the aurochs <i>Bos primigenius</i> changed into the name given by Linnaeus <i>Bos taurus</i> by Wilson and Reeder in 1993. Some scientists had criticism on this change of the scientific name of the aurochs. They wanted that there would be made an exception for domesticated animals.</p>
<p>In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature "conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms", confirming <i>Bos primigenius</i> for the Aurochs. Taxonomists who consider domesticated cattle a subspecies of the wild Aurochs should use <i>Bos primigenius taurus</i>; the name <i>Bos taurus</i> remains available for domestic cattle where it is considered to be a separate species. (International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 2003)</p>
<p>The aurochs should be named as subspecies: <i>Bos primigenius namadicus</i> (Falconer, 1859), <i>Bos primigenius mauretanicus</i> (Thomas, 1881) and <i>Bos primigenius primigenius</i> (Bojanus, 1827). <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmaas_8441.html" title="User:Pmaas">Pmaas</a> 14:13, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>How big was an aurochs? weight-wise? And how much bigger than domestic cow was it? <a href="../../../b/a/i/User%7EBaiter_c1df.html" title="User:Baiter">Baiter</a> 05:46, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The aurochs was much larger than the domesticated cows of now (the different breeds differ in size). Previously people thought that the shoulder height of an aurochs bull was approximately 200 cm and that of a cow 180 cm (Herre, 1953). Now scientists have calculated on the basis of the length of the humerus (upper leg bone) that the shoulder height of an aurochs bull probably varied between 160 and 180 cm, and that of an aurochs cow around 150 cm. <a href="http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/aurochs.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/aurochs.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmaas_8441.html" title="User:Pmaas">Pmaas</a> 16:52, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks... but that doesn't say anything about weight. I'm under the impression some domesticated bulls weigh 1000kg. Can an aurochs really have weighed more than that? What about a cape buffalo? <a href="../../../b/a/i/User%7EBaiter_c1df.html" title="User:Baiter">Baiter</a> 22:12, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From reading the book on Cis van Vuure's research into the aurochs (2002,2003 &amp; 2005), I can say the following: About the weight, Matolcsi (1970) and Bergstrom &amp; Van Wijngaarden-Bakker (1983) have tried to find a relation between the weight of certain bones of domesticated cattle and its total weight. However, this relation showed very influenced by age, breed and/or food condition. So it was hard to predict a weight. Even if it worked (on these fresh bones) it is hard to say, that it would have worked on the (sub)fossil bones of the aurochs. When we look to the weight of the Wisent (European Bison) and the Banteng, than we see that wisent cows vary in weight between 320 to 540 kg end wisent bulls between 530 and 920 kg. Hoogerwerf (1970) mentiones that Banteng bulls have a weight between 500 and 900 kg. So the weights vary extremely! If the aurochs had also a similar weight, seems likely when we look to their size! However, it remains speculative! We can't be sure! <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmaas_8441.html" title="User:Pmaas">Pmaas</a> 09:04, 25 March 2006 (UTC)
