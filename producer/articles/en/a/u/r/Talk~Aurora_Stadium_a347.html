<p><i>THE MAKING OF TASSIE'S BIGGEST SPORT ICON</i></p>
<p>In the early 1920s the folks of Launceston proudly admired the conversion of a swamp into a giant open-air sports field. After 80 years of small improvements, York Park metamorphosed in to a modern AFL stadium capable of hosting World Cup-standard events is even more dramatic. SOPHIE FOWLER looks at the evolution of a country ground to a modern-day Colosseum.</p>
<p><br />
THE idea of dumping your old tyres and grass clippings at York Park could be seen as sacrilege these days but there was a time when it was commonplace.</p>
<p>The site was once a tip.</p>
<p>Having emerged from equally unglamorous beginnings as a swamp, York Park became a showground before cementing its place in the community as a sport ground and people's venue.</p>
<p>Named in honour of the Duke and Duchess of York, who visited Tasmania during the Federation celebration in 1901, the ground was originally developed for football, cricket, tennis, bowling, cycling and foot-racing.</p>
<p>The park was officially opened by the St Andrews Caledonian Society, at its New Year's Day sport day in 1921.</p>
<p>Eighty-five years later, the venue now known as Aurora Stadium has been transformed.</p>
<p>In fact, the ground has undergone a number of transformations over time but none more significant than those of the last seven years.</p>
<p>Redevelopments have ensured that the park received the global attention it deserves after having hosted everything from an Ike and Tina Turner concert to an evangelism performance by Billy Graham as well as vigoro, gymkhana, soccer and rugby events.</p>
<p>But it was the introduction of AFL to Tasmania and Aurora Stadium that really put the venue on the map and provided the catalyst for a worthy $20 million make-over.</p>
<p>Aurora Stadium ground manager Robert Groenewegan remembers the start.</p>
<p>"Redevelopment started in 1999 as a result of the money promised in the 1998 Federal election," he recalled.</p>
<p>"So you would have been able to park your car next to the boundary fence up until then. It's hard to believe now."</p>
<p>Mr Groenewegan said the stadium had exceeded his expectations and continued to out-do itself, which in turn meant continued improvements - a cycle that has continued since the ground's initial development.</p>
<p>"In the early days when we just had the middle part of the Gunns stand built and the light towers, I used to walk out and just think the place was absolutely marvellous because I couldn't believe we'd got to that stage. It just snowballed after that," he said.</p>
<p>"For the early AFL games we bunked in some temporary seating but by 2002 we thought we better stop bunking in infrastructure and build some so we introduced the terrace seating. They were all out in the open and needed a roof over them so the rooves were another whole project. We were reasonably protected from the weather then but were really lacking in corporate facilities so bit by bit we had to really work that up and redeveloped the function room."</p>
<p>Mr Groenewegan said that the addition of lights had given the ground great versatility and the stadium now included a function space that was comparable to the best in the country, a media area, coaches' boxes and range of facilities needed to host an AFL game that were second to none.</p>
<p>" I do pinch myself sometimes when I think about how far we've come," he said.</p>
<p>Community support had been integral to the success of the stadium and had been very strong, according to Mr Groenewegan.</p>
<p>He said he was proud to have been able to provide a range of events in return for the public's loyalty.</p>
<p>"I'm pretty proud of the fact that we've been able to use it for things other than sport," he said.</p>
<p>"We had the big function on New Year's Eve which went really well, we had the (stunt bike team) Krusty Demons which was a huge challenge because we had an AFL game the following week and we've got a military tattoo coming up.</p>
<p>"I think the community are starting to say, `We want to use the ground for more things' and we're working really hard to try and bring more events here.</p>
<p>"It really is a community place at the end of the day. It always has been and we want to keep it that way."</p>
<p>Despite some controversy over the name, Mr Groenewegan said he had also received positive feedback from the public in regard to the stadium's most recent addition - the Jim Bacon gates.</p>
<p>"Most people I've spoken to are thrilled that we've been able to recognise Jim," he said.</p>
<p>"There's been some people that have indicated that they should have been named after some footballers that have made a good contribution but I see our Hall of Fame as the spot to acknowledge them.</p>
<p>"Jim played an integral role right from the start. He was a major driver and deserved some recognition."</p>
