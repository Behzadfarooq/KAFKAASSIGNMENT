<p>Ok, lets go with what SatoSura or whateva his name is said. Lets forget the differences, and make as little reference in comparing the AC and GGS articles, its just stupid, and wasting wiki time, ok?</p>

<dd>The president image - make sure it isnt copyrighted - coz thats just crap to deal with (GFDL is so easy - if you have one then use that), maybe put it into the WA section and have it on the right - but make sure you have a caption under it so it doesnt look completely stupid. <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 11:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, we should go to peer-review before GA nom. definately. We need to get third-party references (outside the JSHAA webpage), include all states, the organisations role in govt, school sports etc etc, extend history a bit, include all other relevant information. Before we go to peer-review we should get admins/experienced editors to look at the article, so we know where we are going.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Tomorrow, im going to add all of the relevant categories, templates, wikilinks and other such materials to the article to get all of that sorted, and.</li>
<li>Over the next week or so, we need to get all of the states information into the article (including those states that dont have a website - that will be a challenge) <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 12:31, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>We cannot have the daughter articles named differently! people always make an issue out of it, like, you cant have (for example): Victoria JSHAA Members, and then List of WA JSHAA Members, they must be either (state) JSHAA Members OR, List of (state) JSHAA Members - so which one you choose, so they must be the same except the name of the state - ill start the queensland bit, and post it in the talk page for you to throw in, coz we dont want edit conflicts. <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 10:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC) Forgive me, im working on South Australia <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 10:50, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, ill fix the daughter articles, they are all going to named from now on as "List of (insert state name) JSHAA Members"
<dl>
<dd>Fixed the member states pages, ill go through and put all of the talk page info on their relevant talk pages, and then start getting some info on South Australia - although it looks pretty bleak - did u get info on the member schools from an external site or the JSHAA or JSHAA State one? <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 11:04, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Auroranorth, I noticed you've been updating some bio article talk pages. A couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no need to include every parameter - they generally default to 'no', so those are not needed. With these types of templates, you generally only include a '=yes' if you want something different to show. Experiment in your sandbox or by using Show preview to see what I mean.</li>
<li>Don't sign the talk page. Adding a template to a talk page is not like a discussion. You should go back to those page now and remove your signature.</li>
</ol>

<dd><i>If you cast your eyes over to this page, you'll notice that we've got around 100,000 articles to assess - so it's kind of a cut and paste job. Since the = no parameter does not show up, what is the harm in doing this? Auroranorth 12:20, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</i>
<dl>
<dd>Good to see your signature is working ;) To answer your question, technically none, but it just adds clutter to the page when you add redundant parameters and may upset other editors. I wouldn't do it as it looks tardy. If you plan on doing lots of articles you may find you get other editors complaining.

<p>Before you get into real problems and get blocked for nuisance editing (yes you can get it) . Forget Afd - try actually starting an article or a hundred from scratch before you even questions others validity, youre going into wiki back to front. Just get the experience of what it is like to (a) find a subject - check the subject on search - and there is nothing remotely like it (b) start the article - give it a category, give it adequate V and N (or now ATT) (c) develop the article with citations and references - and do that more than once before you even go down the afd road. Or - if you feel so confident read <b>all the policies</b> - regarding the process - and show in some way that you have read all of them, go and look at afd's in process. Aggressive outside admins would have blocked you by now for the two you have done so far - as a nuisance editor. You are very very lucky that the admins who have encountered you have chosen not to block you. Think, think, read more again on the issues, then very carefully think again about what you are doing on wikipedia - take the 'articles i have afd' <i>off</i> your user page -as far as wikipedia is concerned you are still in your nappies - and theyve been messed a few times <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">Satu</a><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">Suro</a> 12:27, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The debate is now closed. I suggest you read our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> before nominating any more articles for deletion. Even if an article did lack suitable references (which that didn't), this would never be grounds for deletion of an article about an individual who meets the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> criteria. I know you have been tagging articles for the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIOGRAPHY_cf6c.html" title="WP:BIOGRAPHY">WP:BIOGRAPHY</a> project and I'm sure you would have seen many articles that are much more poorly written than Carpenter's. But, as long as the person is notable, the article remains regardless. By all means tag unreferenced articles with {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../c/n/_/Template%7ECn_09e7.html" title="Template:Cn">cn</a>}} or better still, research and improve the article.

<p>Sorry for not using your "desk", but I couldn't figure out which section to put it in. In the article <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daylight_saving_time_around_the_world.html" title="Daylight saving time around the world">Daylight saving time around the world</a>, you appear to have removed some facts about media coverage of the Western Australian trial - mainly, indicating who supported what. Rather than getting into a revert war with another editor, I would suggest discussing it on the talk page for the article. I'm going to put back the claim in question with a "citation needed" tag for the TVW-7 survey, as it appears to speak a lot more strongly to Western Australian opposition to the trial than any wording we could place in. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 14:11, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Firstly, this is your talk page. It is a community expectation that people can reach you by posting here. Sorry, but you don't get to close it and direct us elsewhere.</p>
<p>Secondly, your article ratings are causing tension within the community. From what I can tell, every experienced editor in WP:WA agrees that your assessments of article quality and importance are not accurate. You need more editing experience before you are qualified to evaluate the quality and importance of your own work and the work of others. I'm asking you nicely to please stop assessing articles, and to withdraw from the Good Article assessment process. Once you've spent a year writing articles, and personally taken an article to FA status, then you should have a much better idea of what community standards of quality and importance are.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I 100% agree. You don't have the experience yet to assess other peoples work. An article that has got to GAC or FAC stage does not just happen and the editors have often put their heart and soul into getting it there. I'm sorry to be brutal, but it is inappropriate for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Auroranorth&amp;oldid=56108681" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Auroranorth&amp;oldid=56108681" rel="nofollow">11 or 12 year old school boy</a> to be telling these people what they need to do to improve it. Based on your recent edit history, you have no understanding of editing, quality and assessment standards at Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest that you tackle some of the maintenance tasks like Hesperian has suggested below. If you want to work on an article, do so by all means but you need to accept that you may only be able to take it to a certain stage and that FA or GA status may not be a realistic possibility. I will think of something though and have one or two ideas already. I'll get back to you after I give it a bit more thought. —<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 11:13, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with what is being said here. I think if you want to have credibility when you are doing ratings you have to be able to point to work of your own that others in the Wikipedia community have deemed worthy. I had a look through your ratings last night and many of them were unnecessarily critical or harsh - I looked at the same articles and many of them had only a few issues and were only in need of helpful feedback. In a couple of cases you even disrupted or circumvented the long established GA process. I notice today you have quoted <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a> to people - what consensus means is that you have to negotiate with other editors to reach the best solution. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielT5_5528.html" title="User:DanielT5">DanielT5</a> 14:08, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Speaking personally, I would be far more comfortable if someone rating articles themselves had experience in producing quality articles. I would agree broadly with Hesperian's and Moondyne's comments above. What I would recommend doing is finding an interest, something for which spending time researching it and getting it right won't actually be an arduous task but a fun one where you end up feeling like you have genuinely gained something from the process as well as added to Wikipedia's store of knowledge. Your spelling and grammar is well ahead of most adults let alone most your age, so I think if you can focus on achieving your potential here, and realise that everyone else here is here to improve the encyclopaedia just like you, even if they hold differing opinions, you'll be a great editor. It takes time and effort though, doesn't just happen overnight. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 12:52, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd add that I agree with Hesperian, you have to be interested; it becomes pretty boring if you lose interest, then just move onto something else. It is supposed to be fun. Some articles come together alot more easily than others. It <i>really</i> helps if it is something you are really familiar with and can quickly decide what should be in the article or not, and what sounds sensible. cheers, <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Casliber</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECasliber_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Casliber">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Casliber_4aa0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Casliber">contribs</a> 11:12, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Research and write a stub article on every lake over (say) <s>one</s> <i>ten</i> square kilometres - you could click on the coordinates link and view the map for each from Google earth to asses its approximate size. Search for each lake by name in the Geoscience of Australia Place Name Search and add the results url to each entry in the remarks column. Go to your library and see if you can find some books on any of the larger lakes. —<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 12:30, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Auroranorth, you ought to include an edit summary for every edit you make. But if you won't do that, you <b>must</b> at least provide an edit summary for all your contentious edits. If you nominate an article for speedy deletion, for example, you <b>must</b> provide an edit summary, so that it shows up on people's watchlists telling them what you've done. <a href="../../../h/e/s/User_talk%7EHesperian_5634.html" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> 11:55, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, i've noticed a number of recent edits you've made to this article and I need to bring up some issues with you. First and foremost, do not remove fact tags from the article unless you are going to cite a source for the statement that has been requested. The article in question makes quite a number of statements about the operations of the school and it's administration, and it would be best to ensure these are suitably sourced. Secondly, can you please ensure the neutrality of the language you use. There is some language you have used which is less than neutral and i've gone through and corrected it as such. Take a comparison of my edits to see what I mean. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewinchester_2be0.html" title="User:Thewinchester">thewinchester</a> 00:49, 5 March 2007 (UTC) <span id="63299452690"></span></p>

<dd>Unfortunately, i do believe that the three admins are correct. I thought it was Auror - because of the way you asked me about "him" and how you wanted to edit the GGS article because he left. Auroranorth, please take what has happened as a warning - dont try and mess with the community - it serves no purpose. In my eyes you have lost alot of respect, and undoubtedly in the eyes of the community too. Do not return to wiki until you want to be serious. Good luck. <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">SM</a><a href="../../../s/m/b/User_talk%7ESmbarnzy_6a65.html" title="User talk:Smbarnzy">BarnZy</a> 12:54, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I now repeat this statement, almost two years later.</p>
<p>There is no reason to continue here. I may see you in a year, but for now I will refrain from visiting Wikipedia. I was once enthusiastic about Wikipedia, but because of people such as Hesperian and Moondyne (I'm not afraid to say names), I have decided that Wikipedia is an unfriendly place.
