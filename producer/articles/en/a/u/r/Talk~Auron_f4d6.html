<p>Yes, Auron was an unsent... I left that out of the article because it was SUCH a big spoiler I didn't know if it was fair to put it in the article. However, you are right the spoiler warning does mean that we can add this, and it is relevent information.</p>

<p>In the article it says that the Auron featured is more likely the older version. I disagree with that because he gained his injuries 10 years prior to FFX by Yunalesca's Reflect(?) attack and aged with those injuries. Hogtree 09:33, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You do know that the FF game storylines and KH storyline has nothing to do with each other? The FF characters are only cameos in the KH series. This has been stated by Tetsuya Nomura (the director of the KH series) himself. You're thinking too much into it. That would mean that Tidus and Yuna would have a connection with Auron in the KH series and that IS NOT possible, because Tidus is a young boy from Destiny Islands and Yuna is a fairy from Hollow Bastion. The memories in Auron's status in KH2 was only used for fan-service. In the KH series, Tidus and Wakka know each other at a young age, but in FFX, they first met when they were much older. You can't connect the storylines together. It is impossible. NeoSeifer</p>
<p>Okay will someone try to clean up the kingdom hearts section. i'd try but im not sure what to say. by the way it could be that Tidus and Wakka are named after the Characters in FFX, and act like them out of hero worship. (there have been dumber ideas. case in point the person who thinks that Yuna Rikku and Paine were reborn as fairies because they were so pure, HA HA HA) as for the fairies it's not hard to imagine magic creatures being shapeshifters and decideing that they liked the FFX-2 Characters so much that they shapeshifted into them and called each other by those names. (it seems like somthing a trio of annoying childlike creatures would do. i mean when i was a kid i spent a lot of my time pretending to be my favorite characters and probalby would have shapeshifted to them if i could) then it would be perfectly plausible for Auron to be the origional one at least in relationship with the other characters.</p>
<dl>
<dd>...wow. That was <i>really</i> stupid. In case you didn't know, Yuna, Rikku, and Paine died when their worlds were destroyed and were reborn as fairies because they were so pure...or something to that effect.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(response: where the hell did you hear that?)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and the Tidus and Wakka thing is <i>especially</i> stupid. You must in denial or <i>something</i>.<a href="../../../u/r/u/User%7EUrutapu_0994.html" title="User:Urutapu">urutapu</a> 02:09, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(okay how many friends do you have. and no Your dog doesn't count, nor does your hand. and denial and creative thought are very differnt things. just offering an idea)</p>
<dl>
<dd>perfectly plausible? ni ta ma de, you must be deluded... its perfectly plausible that rikku droped a k, got a sex change, and become mean and evil.... and that a clone was made of her that became a fairy... you guys are crazy... -<a href="../../../x/o/r/User%7EXornok_b13e.html" title="User:Xornok">Xornok</a> 02:06, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>(that might make a good fanfiction)</p>
<p>come on I was just offering the idea that i think would work in my fanfiction (okay so that might not make it qualify but hey gotta start somewhere). by the way why would the idea of Tidus and Wakka acting like the FFX characters out of hero worship be stupid? and Rikku and Riku have nothing to do with each other, one is an annoying dumb blond steryotype. the other is the "bad boy, antihero" archtype taken with abosolutly no creative thought.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well sorry. But this is Wikipedia. Not your stupid, never-could-happen, likely full of impossible pairings FANFINCTION. There's no "Final Fantasy video game" in its own universe. God. <a href="../../../u/r/u/User%7EUrutapu_0994.html" title="User:Urutapu">urutapu</a> 05:03, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hey dude your right, however what i said was in the discussion thing. this is a hot topic for me i admit i was kinda an a-hole about it though. in my attempt at defense however the only pairings in my fanfiction are Sora and Kairi, Tidus and Yuna, Namine and Roxas (if you call these impossible i'll die of laughter) but yeah dude your right fandom has no place on Wikipeda. it is not a discussion board, and i won't treat it as such.</p>
<p>Auron had grey hair.</p>
<p>That has to be one of the most stupid things I've ever read (about the YRP fairies being reborn). Nomura said that the FF character ARE NOT tied to their original selves from their respective FF games and are only cameos in the KH series. I believe his word has more official value than yours. Please. Don't make up theories about things you really don't know about. Pure heart reincarnated fairies... of all the idiotic things. And as for the Tidus and Wakka thing, it really isn't stupid if you can do simple math. In FFX, Tidus is 17 and Wakka is 23. In KH1, Tidus is 13 and Wakka is 15. See the age difference between the 2 in each game? Alright, then. Get the facts straight before you respond to me. NeoSeifer</p>
<p>Are we entirely sure hat Sora <i>destroyed</i> the Auron doll in KH2? I thought he just threw it to Auron and Auron 'absorbed' it. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_James_7345.html" title="User:Will James">Will James</a> 06:43, 25 November 2006 (UTC</p>

<p>Although Auron does keep one of his eyes shut most of the time, I've seen times when he's opened it...</p>
<p>For example: look at the cutscene where you first see Auron in the blitzball stadium in Spira. He clearly has both eyes open. I would like somebody to remove that part about him losing his eye unless they have solid proof. In the game, it never mentions a single thing about him "losing his eye." He just got severely injured and died shortly afterwards. Just because he has a little scar on his eye and keeps it shut most (but not all) of the time doesn't mean that he lost his eye. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.60.132.49_98eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.60.132.49">65.60.132.49</a> (talk) 21:10, 25 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>The article currently lists Auron's race as "Human, Unsent". I don't believe the latter should be put in Auron's stats, as it is a large spoiler for those that have not gotten to the end of the game. In addition to that, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm near positive that Unsents are not official <i>races</i>, technically, in the game. It is rather a state of the soul, not a race of peoples. I may be getting too technical, but based on those points, I'm going to take the unsent part out of his stats.</p>
<p>Also, why are there no longer any spoiler warnings in the article? I think this article definitely needs some, so I'm going to insert those also.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any thoughts?</p>
