<p>I want to add something to the Gibson sighting section that poses a serious question to this formation. How would a KC-135 Stratotanker offload fuel in liquid methane form to the Aurora? This puts serious holes in the Gibson sighting. The Gibson sighting needs to be subjected to heavy censure.</p>

<p>Who says this vehicle used liquid methane? You seem to forget that everything about this vehicle is pure speculation.</p>

<p>In order to go mach 6+ you would not be using a turbofan, and higher speed scram/ramjets cannot be run easily on kerosene.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that the "Spotting" of the wedge is dubious. On one hand he claims to see a KC-135 with the old engines, on the other hand we get a nebulous description of a flying wedge. I think casting doubt with regards to how the types of fuel required to fuel scram/ram jets and the fact this unlikely offload able from a KC-135 is warranted.</p>
<p>The other possibility is that a KC-135Q which can offload JP7 fuel for the P&amp;W J58 engines could be what is involved here. I believe most Q's were turned into KC-135T after a re-engining.</p>
<p>I just get the sense from all the talk here that this was probably an SR-71 under a KC-135Q or KC-135T. Even though the SR-71 had been retired by April 1989 and by some other reports "The United States Air Force retired its fleet of SR-71s on January 26, 1990", the SR-71 was clearly restorable as it was revived from 1995 to 1998.</p>
<p>To me this article should focus more on facts, like the line item on the budget - not "sightings." Much has been done in the article to boost the sightings credibility, something should be done to deconsruct the speculation as well.</p>

<p>Ramjets will happily run on kerosene, so your JP7 (a triple-distilled kerosene with teflon additive) speculation is more than plausible, but you are assuming (again) that this vehicle, as described, does Mach 6+. Check out a Handley Page HP.115: same planform, very subsonic. You also assume ram /scram jets in use. This is again speculation. You could also speculate that it could just be boring old J58s (a bypass turbojet) or an over/under combination engine as planned for the XF-103.</p>
<p>It was not an SR-71. Nor was the tanker a re-engined model. In the sighting situation as described the formation was silhouetted against high level cloud, essentially an aircraft recognition gift, but with no detail visible. Also, a Q was at Mildenhall around the same time.</p>

<dd>I followed discussions on this subject since the nineties, when speculations about the existence of Aurora came up. Although I appreciated any attempts from aerospace-buffs to make sense of all these sonic booms and sightings and found it sensible to assume the existence of a secret hypersonic reserach program, there was one thing I never understood. Usually, in all these discussions the retirement of the SR-71 was used as a major argument for the existence of a hypersonic follow-up. However, from a purely operational point of view, it would have been much more sensible for the US military in the eighties to develop a SR-71 follow-up with the same top-speed but much more stealth capability. According to infos reported in Bill Sweetman's "Aurora". back in the eighties the soviets were developing anti-aircraft-missiles with the capability to intercept the SR-71. As the F-117 was in development at the same time it would have been logically for the US military to lean on this stealth technology as the most promising option for a SR-71 follow-up. That doesn't exclude that they were also starting programs for Hypersonic technology, SSTO or TSTO concepts. It makes sense that the USAF gave these concepts a serious priority after the challenger desaster. But as these concepts were still at their very beginnings at this time, and as aircraft development usually takes a decade or so, it would have been unresonably to see them as the only realistic option for a new recon aircraft that would have been needed until the end of the eighties.</dd>
<dd>Therefore, if a follow-up was in service at the time when the SR-71s were mothballed in 1991, it would have probably been a very stealthy Mach 3+, not a more or less still experimental hypersonic whatsoever. And to my opinion, this non-hypersonic but highly stealthy SR-71-follow-up was the plane that Chris Gibson observed in 1989 over the North Sea and that was mentioned - but censored - in the UAP-Study of the British MoD. 141.2.22.211 13:01, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article is self-admittedly pure speculation, and is in desperate need of references and weeding out of weasel words. Sentences such as <i>There is a recent report that it may use a pulse detonation wave engine.</i> are just laughable without a link to the report. I can only spot one solid fact in this article: namely, that an item marked "Aurora" appeared on a Pentagon budget. Could some knowledgeable aircraft buff mark all the other claims with links to who is doing the claiming? <b><span style="color:orange">jms</span><span style="color:blueviolet">tylr</span></b> 12:30, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I took out some of the wilder claims and toned down some of the language. Basically this is an urban myth story. John</dd>
</dl>
<p>It also bears stating that the speeds attained by this alleged aircraft are approximate to those of the X-15. At a certain point the altitude required to attain a certain speed with reasonable efficiency and heat control becomes so high that the craft becomes a spacecraft. The whole idea of this Aurora nonsense is flawed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>The basic problem is clearly visible: this article (like others about black projects, i.e. Blackstar, TR-3 Manta) is not refering to real entities but to hypothesis. Concepts like Blackstar, Aurora, et al., are conceptual constructions, not observations. They are constructed by airplane-buffs to make sense out of a bundle of rumours, hearsay, sightings (alleged or real) and a very small number of hard facts (budget lines, sonic booms, retirement of SR-71, etc.). The hypothetical status is indicated in the introduction, and that's ok so far.</dd>
<dd>However, what's still missing in the rest of the article, is this: The available "data" (I will call it so just for the argument) is not really conclusive. Especially, there is no evident pattern in the data, as the single observations and statements are not in a way empirically interrelated which is independent from the hypothesis one uses to interpret them. For example, if psychiatrists are detecting a new syndrom, they are describing a pattern of symptoms which are associated by causal relations and which can be <i>observed</i> in this special pattern. The validity of such a hypothetical pattern can be empirically tested by statistical methods, i.e. Cluster analysis. But this is not the case for the data we're speaking about in the field of black projects.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I just wanted to demonstrate in my posting to the section above, Aurora is for example not the only possible explanation for the Gibson-sighting. One can easily make a case of it's own from the Gibson-sighting. And there's no way to decide which classification is true or false. The same is true for the UAP-report of the british MoD. It's sensible to interpret a certain, censored part of this report as evidence for the existence of two "black" US-planes and for the assumption, that these planes could have been visble to observers in the UK at one time or another. But this evidence does in no way deliver any further informations. As it was censored, it is absolutely unclear which planes they had exactly mentioned in their report. So one could use it as "support" for Aurora, or for Blackstar, or for any other hypothetical plane, or for any combination.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And that's what's - in my humble opinion - still wrong with this article. It's not only explaining the meaning of a concept that has relevance for understanding certain discussions in the subcultures of airplane-buffs and others. That's something the wikipedia should do. But I have the impression, that this article as a whole (with the exception of the introduction) suggests a level of empirical validity for the Aurora-hypothesis that is simply not justified. There should a least be a "Final conclusion" underlining again the inconclusiveness of the "data". It would be even better, if "data" and "interpretations" or "Interpretations proposed by different authors" would be described in different sections. 141.2.22.211 14:31, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In this case 790 you have misread the article. Read it again and you will see that this is not a BBC paper but a British Ministry of Defence secret document which has recently been declassified in response to a Freedom of Information request from the academic David Clarke. The first reference in the article takes you directly to the MoD website where you can pore through the hundreds of pages of the UAP report. The little crosses were drawn by someone in MoD - presumably someone with a very high security clearance - before the rest of the report was declassified. The idea of some Defence Intelligence spook sitting there with a ruler drawing lines of crosses by hand is comical but nonetheless it is exactly what happened. I have asked MoD to reveal what is in those lines but of course they have declined to do so. The Americans usually white out text which they want to redact before declassifying reports, The British usually put marker lines through the text before release - although that sometimes can leave clues which allow us to work out the original meaning. None of this tells us whether Aurora or anything similar exists - all it tells us is that the British MoD discussed whether two covert American projects might be mistaken for UFOs - and they still do not want to reveal their speculation about those projects.

What could be the relevance of a document they would leave to such a dork to prepare it before publication? -- <a href="../../../7/9/0/User%7E790.html" title="User:790">790</a> 17:57, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm always right but seriously "ralevant" is a surprisingly common mistake. You'll find it in printed documents issued by Harvard University, World Bank and US Department of Defense let alone handwritten notes which are more like quick email comments often full of mistakes as I'm sure you would acknowledge - your use of "this" instead of "these" twice for instance. As a veteran of many an FOI request I can tell you that the "not relevant" applies to the names of officers which are redacted on the grounds that they are irrelevant not to the relevance of the document. Defence Intelligence spent a long time putting together this report. Whether you or I think that was a worthwhile expenditure of British taxpayers money is neither here nor there. It is a proper report which aimed to settle the question of the UFO question to the satisfaction of the UK MoD.Newsnightmeirion 22:39, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
