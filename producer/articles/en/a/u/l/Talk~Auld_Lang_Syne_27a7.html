<p><i>Gies</i> is indeed a Scots word (pronounced "geeze") and means <i>gives</i> as in "He gies a bane tae the dug" meaning "He gives a bone to the dog" in English. However <i>gie's</i> in the line "gie's a haund" is pronounced "geese" and is a contraction of "gie us a haund", meaning "give me a hand" in English. That is why it should have an apostrophe. It's a similar case to "I'll" which also has a different pronunciation and meaning depending on whether the apostrophe is present or absent. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 16:39, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's also interesting to note that my two volumes of Burns poetry, an early 20th century Collins one and a late 19th century Nelson one each have different versions of this poem. Not only do the words differ but the verses are in a different order in each book. The Nelson edition spells "guid" and "gie's" properly; uses "days of auld lang syne" for the first verse but nowhere else; and puts the "pint-stoup" verse at the end of the poem. The Collins edition doesn't use the phrase "for days of auld lang syne" at all and puts the "pint-stoup" verse in second place. The Wikipedia currently has a third version based on the Collins but with "days of" added to several of the verses. It looks like we need to do more research in order to find out what Burns intended the lyrics to be. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 17:52, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There have been repeated references in this article to the "Good Old Song" (a/k/a "Good Ole Song") as the University of Virginia's "fight song." It's not the fight song; it's the alma mater. The tune of this song hardly fits a fight song. UVA's actual fight song is the "Cavalier Song," although I'd wager that 95% of our fans don't know the words. Either way, please stop changing the article to refer to it as a fight song. <a href="../../../1/9/9/User%7E1995hoo.html" title="User:1995hoo">1995hoo</a> 15:54, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll try but there is some variation according to which dialect of Scots you speak. IPA tends to be a bit too specific in these cases. Plus my IPA is a bit vague. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 17:54, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The above is a very valid concern, IPA isn't really going to work for this -- I started trying to translate it to IPA, but stumbled as soon as I came across the word "auld". I (fae Dundee/Fife) say (and sing) something like "awld" (IPA [ɒld]), but Derek (fae Aiberdeen) obviously says something like "aald" (IPA [ald]). Similar problems come up with words like "tae" and "surely", which get different pronunciations depending on where you come from. Also there are a lot of words like "acquaintance" and "be" which don't differ in pronunciation from English. Might it be better, rather than having the pronunciation guide, to put in a link to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_language.html#Pronunciation" title="Scots language">Scots_language#Pronunciation</a> there and let the reader work it out? Or maybe someone could do a recording of a recital (rather than a sung version, for clarity) and put it up? I'd do it, but I a) don't know how to record OGG b) don't have a microphone. <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendor_eb4d.html" title="User:Mendor">Mendor</a> 02:09, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not really. "Sake" doesn't come into it. The simplest translation of the phrase "Auld lang syne is "Long ago".

<dd>Okay.

<dd>My original intention with the minimal <i>Anglicized translation</i> was to present a version that an English speaker could understand, with out actually changing what the song sounds like, hence keeping <i>Auld Lang Syne</i>, which everyone sings without translation – even if they do mangle it&#160;:-) I.E. these were the lyrics I gave to some friends when they wanted the "correct" version of the song, but also wanted to know what they were singing. The title's meaning had been pretty well covered in the text, so I left it as we would sing it, and it certainly sounded better than everybody trying to sing in Scots, especially when none of us knew what the words are supposed to sound like.&#160;:-) —<a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMJBurrage_fc1b.html" title="User:MJBurrage">MJBurrage</a> • <a href="../../../m/j/b/User_talk%7EMJBurrage_43c7.html" title="User talk:MJBurrage"><small>TALK</small></a> • 16:43, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This comment about Isaiah 65:17 is based on a quote that appears to be taken from the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2065:17;&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2065:17;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">New International Version</a>of the Bible <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo&amp;vid=31&amp;lang=2" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo&amp;vid=31&amp;lang=2" rel="nofollow">published in 1978</a>. The Author of this comment has not quoted his source so we can't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" rel="nofollow">Verify</a> it.</p>
<p>Nor could I find a version Isaiah of 65:17 that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns" rel="nofollow">Robert Burns (1759-96)</a> would have had access too, that matched the text quoted. (The <a href="http://www.spcm.org/english/KJV/B23C065.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.spcm.org/english/KJV/B23C065.htm" rel="nofollow">King James version</a>is different).</p>
<p>Also "<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/seem" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/seem" rel="nofollow">seem</a> to be an allusion" is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory" rel="nofollow">theory</a>. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia policy</a> a source for a theory should be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" rel="nofollow">cited</a>.</p>
<p>For these two reasons I felt that imitate removal was justified.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I added the tidbit about it being sung at midnight in the introduction, as this is what the song is most popularly known for. I noticed someone changed New Year's Day to New Year's Eve, and wanted to point out that it is sung at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Day, not eve, as the day has changed. That's the whole point. Herr Lip 20:00, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone added the following as a seperate page. It can be merged with this page but it doesnt seem reasonable to add every parody of lyrics. Removing link to new page</p>
<p>Should old acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind? Should old acquaintance be forgot, and auld lang syne&#160;?</p>

<dd>CHORUS:</dd>
<dd>For auld lang syne, my dear,</dd>
<dd>for auld lang syne,</dd>
<dd>we'll take a cup o’ kindness yet,</dd>
<dd>for auld lang syne.</dd>
</dl>
<p>We two have waded in the brook, in days of bright sunshine, but oceans now beteween us lie; since auld lang syne.</p>
<dl>
<dd>CHORUS</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now here’s a hand my trusty friend, And give a cup of thine! We’ll take a take a cup of kindness yet, for auld lang syne.</p>

<dd>CHORUS</dd>

I think of all the great high hopes, I had when I was young; and now who are these sad old farts, I find myself among?</p>
