<p>A question has arisen in <a href="../../../p/a/c/Talk%7EPacific_Ocean_b8e8.html" title="Talk:Pacific Ocean">Talk:Pacific Ocean</a> as to whether it's fair to say (as <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ocean_bdb7.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> does) that Australia is "<b>in</b>" that Ocean. Australia is bounded on the west by the Indian Ocean, no? And on the south by the Southern Ocean, by the Oz definition of that.

<dd>The most likely reason for Australia being specified as being in the pacific is because where the majority of the population is which is in the eastern states, they face the pacific ocean, as a result it would be our dominant trading port, however you have a point. Perhaps Australia should have its own mini-ocean, to settle the dispute.</dd>

<dd><i>These reforms have coincided with strong total factor productivity growth in the Australian economy.

<p>On the date of earliest human arrival, I haven't seen any evidence to support a date of 80,000 years ago, or for that matter 60,000 years ago.

<dd>There is evidence of occupation over 100,000 years ago, Robert, but it comes from a single site, and has been strongly disputed. It doesn't seem to be taken seriously anymore. Most experts now seem to think that the correct date falls between 40,000 and 60,000 years. Flannery has mentioned various dates over his career (as new evidence comes to hand) the 47,000 in the article you linked to; 53,000 in a recent book. (I'm not sure which figure - the 47,000 or the 53,000 - represents Flannery's current view.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Michael Archer in <i>Going Native</i> (Hodder, 2004) more-or-less accepts around 50,000 years as a given, but goes on to say that many Australian archaeologists believe that significantly older dates are plausible - dates in the order of 55,000 to 75,000 years ago. Archer writes: <i>Given the Flores discoveries and their consequences for understanding the dispersal capabilities of</i> H.ergaster <i>and/or</i> H. erectus <i>immediately on our doorstep, we can't see why the real dates for human arrival in Australia shouldn't turn out to be much earlier than currently accepted, even well in excess of 100,000 years.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Archer laments the rise in sea levels that mean that the most likely sites to investigate for evidence of early occupation - i.e., seashore sites - are 120 metres underwater now. Nevertheless, he is confident that evidence can still be found further inland, and will be found eventually.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Despite all the above, both Archer and Flannery agree that the oldest <i>firm</i> dates we have are around 50,000 years ago, give or take. Older dates than this remain speculative. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 23:58, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From my understanding, New Zealand isn't a part of any true continent, but is a part of Oceania or Australasia, which is a 'region', one which also contains the continent of Australia.

<p>Excellent, so the UK's not in Europe - at last! Guess this all depends on whether you're talking about some kind of 'geographic' definition of a contintent, or whether you're deviding the world into 8 continents which contain all the landmass of the world. If the first then Australia is it's own (geographic) continent (i.e. a very very big island), but if the second then Australia is part of Oceania, just as the the UK is part of the continent of Europe but the British Isles sit on the edge of the European continent.

<p>She is Queen of England, and only is Queen of Australia by name only, nothing more.</p>

It would be negligent to not note that she is 'Queen of Australia' - the supposed pinnacle of our legal system. As such, a picture of her is obligitory - though perhaps the picture could be changed to one where she is actually acting in her prescribed role (the few times she does). I reject that she be pictured more than once, or anywhere other than beside the information regarding her 'royal' self.

Plus, the fact is also that the lady has no more power in the UK than she does in Australia (or anywhere else outside of the House of Windsor and it's hangers-on) - in the UK a law requires Royal Assent - but she knows that if she does not give it then she risks losing her job. All the rest is pomp and ceremony.

<dd>Yes, I do know the difference, British can mean anyone from the island of Great Britain whilst someone from England the sub-nation is English. However, because this is talking about Australia, that is irrelevant. As there is a large difference between English and British, there is also a large difference between a proper head-of-state, and a merely legal one. I will repeat once again, the photo is irrelevant, there is no point to be proven, a reminder in the text is quite adequate. It is bad enough that we have a foreigner as our theoretical head-of-state, let alone glorifying it by inputting a picture of the head-of-state. john howard's picture is essential, and if there need be another one, then put the governor-general there. by having the picture there it is a creating a pro-monarchist bias in the page, and this should not be encouraged under any circumstance.</dd>

<dd>The fact is that the Queen is the <i>de jure</i> head of state, albeit represented in every <i>de facto</i> instance by the Governor-General. Like-it-or-not. Personally I don't - but the facts are the facts until (and if and when) things change. There is a monarchist following in Australia - and they currently have their way. The job of the encyclopaedia is to accurately depict the historical and current state of affairs. When it changes then the text/illustrations will change. Ultimately it doesn't matter whether there are any images of <i>any</i> officials or not. The majority of the country articles do not. Maybe they should - who knows? If the other countries start including pictures of the heads of state I am of the opinion that both the <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> should be included. Even if either of those happen to be either <i>a)</i> a foreigner or <i>b)</i> one who gets the job because of their hereditary position and <i>c)</i> there is a substantial portion of people in the country who disagree with either <i>a)</i> or <i>b)</i> or both. You have to tell things how they are - but that does not mean you can't also mention that not everyone agrees with how things are. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnArmagh_d26a.html" title="User:JohnArmagh">JohnArmagh</a> 11:36, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">moving template to article</span></h2>
<p>unless somebody strenously objects, i'm going to move the parameterised template (above) in the article and remove the hard-coded box. it's now being more widely deployed (including on the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> page) and has most of the kinks worked out and looks good. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClarkk_d41a.html" title="User:Clarkk">clarkk</a> 11:31, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>nope, i copied the ones that were originally on the page into the template. could you point go through the article history and link to version you are talking about, then we could both fix it. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClarkk_d41a.html" title="User:Clarkk">clarkk</a> 05:20, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>two issues, one does the australian flag image have to be so big? when i click on it, all i see is a union jack, if i was in the wrong mood, i would consider that offensive, but i then realised that the australian flag was FAR bigger than it needed to be. also, why do the GDP statistics have to be so precise, they look much more tidy if they are rounded off to the nearest $100 million for the GDP and the nearest $100 for the per capita GDP.</dd>

<dd>Well, its best to have a large image so it can be resized on the fly to an appropriate size for several articles... - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 10:54, Jan 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my attempts to portray accurate flags, symbols, et al. for all countries listed in Wikipedia, I've redrawn, recoloured, and resized (to a consistent fly width) Australia's flag. Note that flag images can be placed in higher-resolution alternate formats for anyone to use in the WikiMedia Commons. Moreover, the use of image size tags in articles can have images appear larger or smaller. Anyhow, enjoy! - E Pluribus Anthony 01:54, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Surely there can be more and better photographs on this page than the two that are currently there: Queen Elizabeth and John Howard! There are so many choices: countryside, photos of regular people, cities, beaches, etc etc. Somebody should really add photos to this page. Look at other countries' pages for a sense of what's possible. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 20:17, Feb 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Constitutional role of the Queen</span></h2>
<p>The article stated: <i>in practice virtually the entire constitutional role of the monarch is performed independently by the Governor-General</i>. This was misleading, because the constitutional role of the monarch in Australia is extremely limited. About all she does and can do is to appoint the Governor-General, and she has no discretion in the matter. The prerogative powers that the Queen exercises in the UK are explicitly given to the Governor-General in the constitution, and they derive from the people rather than the Queen. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Skyring</a> 10:02, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>That was the best choice, I think. I've nothing against the orgaisation, it's just that it should have been placed somewhere overtly relevant to do it justice.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 03:31, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
