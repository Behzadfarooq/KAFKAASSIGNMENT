<dd>That was a lot of good work. Most of the time it was all happening so quickly that it was difficult to see what was being vandalised before it was reverted. Two usernames with vaguely Australian sounding themes that were created during that time were Shrimpy777 and Ssurfer. (he or she made edits about throwing shrimp on the barbie). It might be worth keeping an eye on them. I have to log off now.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lyrebird 'folklore' debate</span></h2>
<p>There has been a debate on the <a href="../../../l/y/r/Lyrebird.html" title="Lyrebird">Lyrebird</a> article page, where an editor keeps taking information about Australian <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folklore.html" title="Folklore">folklore</a>, dating back to the late <a href="../../../1/8/0/1800.html" title="1800">1800</a>'s with regard to lyrebirds, and transferring the information to the <a href="../../../l/y/r/Talk%7ELyrebird_22a8.html" title="Talk:Lyrebird">Talk:Lyrebird</a> because there is no given source to go with the folklore comment. The debated issue is an item, put on the Lyrebird article page by another editor, and tells about:</p>
<p><i>a lyrebird who regularly stopped logging operations by mimicking a fire alarm</i>.</p>
<p>I feel that the information should be on the main article, and not just 'tucked away' on the discussion page, where people who may be interested may not be able to find it. Folkfore is handed down from generation to generation by 'word of mouth' and, as such, deserves its place on the main article, irrespective of whether, or not, there is a verifiable source for the information.</p>
<p>Could I please have input by other Australian Wikipedians about this, and whether anybody knows of any source material with regard to this. Thank you. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 16:24, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Lyrebirds are certainly known for their mimicry. This Museum Victoria article refers to them mimicking chainsaws and cars see <a href="http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/forest/animals/lyrebird.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/forest/animals/lyrebird.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This NSW National Parks article says that they have been known to mimic alarms see <a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/npws.nsf/Content/Lyrebirds" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/npws.nsf/Content/Lyrebirds" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 22:51, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your input about this. I appreciate it very much. The lyrebirds' amazing mimicking ability is well verified and comments to this fact have been on the page from the start. There are numerous references, and external links (including a link to the article you mentioned) to articles about this, some of which have links to actual recordings of lyrebirds' calls, where the person who clicks onto these can hear the multitude of calls made by lyrebirds.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Even when the story was first put into the article about the lyrebird, it was made explicitly clear that the story may not be true. The original statement read:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Australian folklore is rich with tales of lyrebird mimicry: if the story of a male lyrebird that used to regularly halt 19th Century logging operations by mimicing the fire siren is not true, a hundred others are.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The editor under discussion removed the statement because of a lack of verifiable source. It would appear that the comment that the editor has a problem with, when he has been removing the comment, is the lack of verification of the story about bird's calling actually stopping the logging.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The last time that he removed the comment from the article, the information had been placed in a separate subsection called <i>Fact or fiction</i>. In that subsection, it was again made explicit that the story may not be true, but that it was a part of folklore. It read:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>===Fact or fiction===</i></dd>
<dd><i>Australian <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folklore.html" title="Folklore">folklore</a> is rich with tales of lyrebird mimicry. One is the story of a male lyrebird that used to regularly halt <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> logging operations by mimicking the fire siren. Even if these particular stories may not be true, a hundred others are.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The editor immediately removed it as an "unverified anecdote", in spite of the explicit remarks that the story may not be true.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have absolutely no doubt that if the story is placed on the page under the section heading of "Urban Myth", the editor would <i>still</i> remove the story as an unverified anecdote. This is the reason why I am asking for help with this. What is to be done now, when even explicitly describing the story as folklore is not enough to satisfy the editor under discussion? <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 00:32, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At the very least, I reckon there needs to be verification that the tale is part of the folklore (ie has made it into dead trees). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 02:24, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If this is the 'yardstick' whereby the item should be measured as being a viable entry onto an article page, could somebody please help with this, if it is at all possible. I have spent hours searching for the verification which is being asked here, on both the internet and with books (which can be seen from the large number of references and external links I have put on the lyrebird article page). I was not the person who mentioned the logging incident on the lyrebird article. I am just trying to help. It is easy to ask for verification, but difficult to put in the 'hard slog' to get results to prove such verification. There are also many lyrebird books out there to be read. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 05:05, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I too get annoyed when the propeller heads start seeking verification on certain types of statements that simply do not need them. With over 500,000 articles in en.wiki, we can all be assured that at least 10% of these are about idiotic subjects (source not verified) and/or make idiotic claims - so the reference police should be tracking these 10% or more down rather than worrying themselves about a harmless little story about a lyrebird's legendary capability to mimic. Having said that, the original line that was in the article could probably be made to sound a bit more encyclopaedic and less like a fireside yarn - but I see no reason why its basic substance could not be contained within the principle article, as opposed to the talk page. As an example of propeller head verification, the talk page of the aussie rules article recently had one of our compatriots asking us to verify the claim that aussie rules had been as popular as the two rugby codes in the ACT and south-western NSW over many decades - why should something as obvious and well known as that require any form of substantiation? Articles in wikipedia would become unreadable if everything as obvious as that was going to require citations. Sydney is on the east coast of Australia (so says the Jacaranda Atlas). Indonesia is to the north of Australia (so says the Jacaranda Atlas). The principal language of the Netherlands is Dutch (or so we are able to gather from their daily newspapers). Sicily is triangular in shape (Mario Puzo says so). Elvis made a lot of corny musicals in the 60s (implied in the Encyclopaedia of Rock, heaven forbid should any of us think that at all). <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27angelo_d931.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 11:13, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Pippu that having citations through the article like that is a bit ridiculous, but that doesn't mean that more things shouldn't be substantiated, with citations in a list of references at the end. I think the folklore comment really does need some sort of verification, not because I don't believe, but because if we don't draw the line here, we're heading down a slippery slope. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> 17:44, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ok, fair enough, I apologise. I still wonder whether verification is necessary for information that is widely known. Do all challenges need a response, or only those that provide a cogent argument that provides an indication that the information may be incorrect, or at least flawed in some way - or is it enough for someone to simply say: show me where that is written (as if seeing something written somehwere represented some sort of magical harbinger). For instance, I recall reading a book written in the 1930s by an emanate Australian academic advising against accepting immigrants from Sicily because all traces of nordic blood had been infected by inferior african and asiatic blood. Does this form the basis of a sound encyclpaedic article simply because it was published in a book? <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27angelo_d931.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 01:21, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>== Oldest person to have served as a politician in Australia? == i am gay</p>
<p>I'm currently writing an article on <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleaver_Bunton_82fe.html" title="Cleaver Bunton">Cleaver Bunton</a>, the independent NSW Senator who replaced <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lionel_Murphy_23be.html" title="Lionel Murphy">Lionel Murphy</a> and thus played a part in the 1975 constitional crisis. He lived to the ripe old age of 96 which leads me to wonder whether anyone else who has served in federal, state or territory politics has lived longer than Bunton's 96 years and 262 days? I've had a scout around our articles on Australian politicians and found no one older but lord knows we are still missing a few.

<p>I have a set of the Biographical Registers of all the state / colonial parliaments, which give birth and death dates for most members, but it would take a lot of time to go through them all looking for longest-lived members.

<dd>Thanks for the feedback everyone. I meant the greatest age of anyone who ever served as an MP, rather than the eldest serving politician (if that makes it at all clearer).

<dd>1. Get elected to federal parliament</dd>

<p>Reg was a loyal Menzies factotum all his life and was notoriously the most boring man in Parliament.

<dd>Well, he states that:
<dl>
<dd><i>They also use the most charming of debating techniques, which is to allow you to make a long list of salient points and pull in a wide range of empirical observations to back up your argument, and then ignore them completely. Then they respond with something along the lines of "Are you being paid to say that by Microsoft, or just doing a mate a favour?" (to quote one email received this week on the topic of open source software development).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Is he referring to Wikipedia, or is he referring to the open source movement? This whole opinion piece seems very confused to me:
<dl>
<dd>"That has led to a furious period of navel-gazing at the site, with people arguing about whether things should be deleted or kept, and whether anonymous editing is a good idea, or whether pseudononymous editing is OK."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Then he writes:
<dl>
<dd>"But it's always worth asking yourself, before launching into the 124th flame of the evening for someone who has dared to question the rightness of your pet project, whether the other side might, for once, be right in their criticism. It is a radical idea, I know. But that's the only way cult thinking gets broken down. Personally, I'm all for it."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So what is it? Are we navel gazing, or are we trying to deal with a particularly bad problem? No offense to Charles on this one, he does make some valid points (we do get rather hot and bothered when we get criticised sometimes...

<dd>Meh. WP is remarkably well-mannered, as far as projects for internet obsessives go, from what I've seen. He says <i>On all sides you will find people who are willing to argue to the death.</i> I don't think people argue on WP with any more or less passion than they do about anything else. Take politics for example. The only difference is on the web, everything is recorded forever (or at least, a long time). If you have a heated argument in a pub for half an hour, at the end it just floats away into the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ether.html" title="Ether">ether</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Schools</span></h2>
<p>I've been thinking about trying to tackle the schools issue in Australia recently, and since I've got a bit of time, I'd like to try and do something about it. I like the way we've done things with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_the_Australian_Capital_Territory_ce34.html" title="List of schools in the Australian Capital Territory">List of schools in the Australian Capital Territory</a>, which has created quite an informative table, and I'd somehow like to roll this out across the rest of the country.</p>
<p>However, all the schools in the ACT only fit onto one page because it's small, and I'm not sure how to divide up the pages for the other states. List of schools in Geelong? List of schools in north-east Victoria? Any other suggestions? <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:01, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Probably the best thing is to look at the category that each of the Departments uses. For example, NSW divides its schools up amongst a number of regions see <a href="http://www.schools.nsw.edu.au/regions/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.schools.nsw.edu.au/regions/index.php" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 03:22, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is something that I have been working on for a while now. Firstly, a bit of background. Initially, there was just the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Australia_3773.html" title="List of schools in Australia">List of schools in Australia</a> which was created by <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeisham_a3ab.html" title="User:Lukeisham">User:Lukeisham</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_17.html" title="April 17">17 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> and had the six states and the two territories as section headers and a handful of schools under each. After adding a few schools from my home state of New South Wales, I soon realised that that list was going to be far too large. So on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_7.html" title="September 7">7 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, I broke up the list into 8 separate pages, namely:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_the_Australian_Capital_Territory_ce34.html" title="List of schools in the Australian Capital Territory">List of schools in the Australian Capital Territory</a></li>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In addition to the above, I also created 8 categories:

<dl>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>as well as an Australian school stub and an appropriate category:

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I then moved all of the schools to the appropriate pages and then just listed the 8 pages (similar to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_high_schools_in_the_United_States_aea8.html" title="Lists of high schools in the United States">Lists of high schools in the United States</a>). You then moved the page, Ambi to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_schools_in_Australia_3b2f.html" title="Lists of schools in Australia">Lists of schools in Australia</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_18.html" title="October 18">18 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, then I started working on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_New_South_Wales_d77d.html" title="List of schools in New South Wales">List of schools in New South Wales</a>. I then devised a table, which Ambi alluded to above, which lists the school's name, the suburb or town of where the school is located, the years that it caters for eg. K-6, 7-12 etc, the year that the school was founded and link to the school's website (if available).</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I planted the table on the ACT list to see what kind of reception that it would get. I'm glad to see that it was picked up and now that list is looking great. So, I definitely feel that the table should be used on the other pages.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, in regard to whether the lists need to be broken down further, well I don't know. We could make "List of schools in [insert capital city]", but clearly defined capital city borders do not exist, which is why I chose to break them up into the states and territories. However, we could list them as Government and Non-Government schools (which looks like the way NSW is going to go). We also have an addition list called <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_selective_high_schools_in_New_South_Wales_6bf9.html" title="List of selective high schools in New South Wales">List of selective high schools in New South Wales</a> (where these schools also appear on the full list).</dd>

<dd>Personally, I like Capitalistroadster's idea, as it would allow us to basically stick to the ACT format (keeping both government and non-government on the one page) and would order things rather nicely. I think that would most likely work well for NSW, because the official regions actually make logical sense. I'm not so sure about the Victorian ones (does anyone else refer to "Loddon Mallee" as a region?) however. The other thing we could do, apart from going the way of listing all government schools together and having pages divided by letter, is to do the city thing (List of schools in Newcastle, List of schools in Coffs Harbour), but that might have the potential to get a bit disorganised. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 23:54, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I actually think that Australian legislatures works better. Houses of parliament is vague. It implies the chamber or house rather than the whole institution (as in, Legislative Assembly, House of Assembly, Legislative Council, Senate, House of Reps - ratehr than 'Parliament of South Australia'), but it could imply the building - Parliament House Canberra, Spring Street, North Terrace - wherever.

<dd>Enochlau is right. Wikimedia foundation would have to be approved by the tax office as not-for-profit charitable organisation, would have to be subject to audits and (I think) certain management structures, require a constitution and so on. And would need to be in Australia. ... and I don't know about international treaties, but I don't think that any apply. ... It briefly occurred to me that we (in the very general sense) could establish an Australian foundation for the purposes of tax deductibility, but it would require establishing a board with a constitution, get recognition from the tax office, etc ... and then I quickly stopped thinking about it. if anybody wanted to kick the idea around, perhaps i could be persuaded to give the idea some more thought. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 23:55, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed it will require lots of work! I think under 'Register of Cultural Organisations', Wikimedia Australia would have to have a finger in all those pies, however we'd have to say one main thing that we do or could do. EG: "The purpose of Wikimedia Australia is to produce ..." However, the main criteria which applies to us would be 'literature' as an encylopedia is a piece of literature. I think we can try for it, certainly before the end of the next financial year (June 30 2006). Our ABN industry is probably Communication Services/Education/Cultural and Recreation purposes, and I think we would be an incorporated entity, if not a company or a partnership. But if there's a Board of Trustees, does that mean that Wikimedia Australia is a trust, then (like the main Wikimedia Foundation)? What kind of trust? There are at least half-a-dozen categories!

<dd>Definitely shouldn't be there. For one thing, we don't know the religion of many PMs (or especially politicians). I believe John Howard's supposed to be Anglican, but how often does he go to Church? Should we put him down as "Anglican"?

<li>If we were writing this in the 1950s, some may want to know which denomination of (Judeo-)Christianity they were, but the differences within denominations is nowadays greater than differences between denominations.

<dd>I agree. I remember reading a while back a discussion about whether an article should mention that its subject is homosexual, and they all agreed that it should only be mentioned if that's an important part of that person (i.e. they fight for homosexual rights etc). So, unless the politician's religious affiliation affects his role as a parliamentarian, then leave it out. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 09:43, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think this is getting two issues crossed. Should a politician's religious affiliation be mentioned in the infobox? No. It's not that important, particularly in the religious environment explained above. But should it be mentioned in the article? Absolutely. There's no excuse for hiding perfectly pertinent information. (Incidentally, the example Enochlau mentions is a nonsense - there is no such consensus on LGBT issues, and if anyone tried to do that, I suspect it would be fiercely reverted). <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:30, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My memory serves me wrong then. Although, why would it be fiercely reverted? Suppose Joe Doe is a person well known in the stockmarket. It just happens he's a homosexual. Why should that be mentioned in the article? Do we mention that John Howard is heterosexual in his article then? I don't mean to change policy here, but I'm just curious as to the distinction. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 10:59, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm mulling over the questions raised above (with respect to whether things should be mentioned in an article) for a different reason. Today, I found out via <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/Sport/Questions-for-Torah-Bright/2005/05/22/1116700581606.html" class="external text" title="http://www.smh.com.au/news/Sport/Questions-for-Torah-Bright/2005/05/22/1116700581606.html" rel="nofollow">Sun-Herald: Questions for Torah Bright</a> that snowboarder <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah_Bright_1f6a.html" title="Torah Bright">Torah Bright</a> is a Mormon. As she volunteered the information in response to a separate question, I concluded that it wouldn't be a violition of her privacy to mention it in her article. But that doesn't answer whether mentioning her religion is relevant to the article. I guess I found the tidbit interesting as snowboarders are perceived by some as brats and yobbos, and that (non-lapsed) Mormons are perceived as being unlikely to be brattish or yobbo-ish.</p>
<p>To get to the point (too late!), I guess one reason people may mention that X person is from Y ethnic/sexual/religious group is so that people doing their own research can confirm or deny their idea of what people from group Y are like. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 11:40, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If we can cite it, then it belongs in the article - simple as that. Wikipedia is not censored. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 11:50, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, we do mention that John Howard is married, and say a bit about Janette. That sort of personal information about partners, etc could be included in any biographical article, although the statement "X was/is homosexual" probably isn't worth including by itself. Religious beliefs/affiliations are similar personal details that should be mentioned, but aren't somethign that belongs in an infobox. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 12:04, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>After several edit conflicts: It's not quite as simple as censorship or no censhorship - there is the issue of relevance.

<dd>(edit conflict) It's good, but as Ambi says, perhaps some formatting will be good. Could you move it into the Template namespace please so we can all start tweaking at it?&#160;:) And what should we do with the Group of Eight template? I'd suggest get rid of it, it's unnecessary; instead just have Group of Eight as a category? I wouldn't say it's extra, unnecesary metadata - it encourages people to jump around and explore. To give it some utility, perhaps the template should group them by state. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 12:25, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While the template is not strictly necessary, it does serve as an easy on-page navigation guide. Categories like Australian Universities, which only have a few tens of members, are ideal for representation in a navigational template. If there were a few hundred universities, then only a list or category would be viable. But as there aren't, and as long as the whole thematic category can be displayed in one place (without the user, who may be unfamiliar with categories, having to move to another page) it should be.<br />

<dd>Not that I know of. Taking photos yourself isn't <i>necessarily</i> impractical, however. It would be to do so for <i>everyone</i>, but it may be feasible to take photos of at least the most important people, as long as you've got a semi-decent digital camera with some form of zoom. That's what they've been doing with baseball (and probably other sports) in the US, and I think the same would be feasible here. I plan to take some photos when the 2006 <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Bank_Trophy_509d.html" title="Commonwealth Bank Trophy">Commonwealth Bank Trophy</a> season starts, but as I'm sans my own camera at the moment, I'll probably be only to do so at the Melbourne games. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 11:37, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Australian towns info box</span></h2>
<p>I have created an info box for Austration towns. It can be found at Template:Infobox_Australian_Town and its usage is illustrated and described on the discussion page. I have the data and am in the process uploading for some New South Welsh towns, including Batemans Bay, Gundagai, Tumut, Queanbeyan, Captains Flat, Cowra, Young, Moruya, Narooma. I am on somewhat of an enforced wiki go slow as I am on holidays dialling up on very unreliable connections - not sure whether it is the ISP or the phone line - as a result I won't be able to engage in much discussion on the info box until after the new Year.

<dd>I am against the use of this infobox. I see no reason we can't use Template:Infobox_Australian_City for these places. Note: some of the places you have listed are actually cities. I also feel this new town infobox goes into way too much detail that would be best covered in the text of the article. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></small> 22:29, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The city info box would be inappropriate to my mind to use for smaller cities such as Queanbeyan and Nowra, although I note that it is in use for Queanbeyan. The term for example in relation to such places is not "Jurisdiction", but "Local Government Area"; as major cities encompass several LGAs, it is obviously a clear distinction between the two types of locality targetted. When people are researching Queanbeyan or Nowra, they are unlikely to be trying to establish the timezone offset. When or whether the railway reached the town/ small city, which highway(s) it is on, and details of its establishment are all useful information that apply equally to Queanbeyan or Bungendore. The town info box recognises that some places have been declared cities. All parameters (except name) in the town info box are optional. As data gets added to the article in prose form, it could be removed from the info box, however, I think the data in the info box is a useful at a glance summary. Looking at Gundagai for example, it is not too lengthy even though it duplicates material in the article, it summarises it. There is no way the City info box would be useful for the Gundagai article, nor is it likely that it could be developed such that it would be equally useful for say Adelaide and Gundagai.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 11:25, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with your argument. How can you argue that these almost trivial historical dates and facts are relavent for the infobox of a small city and not for a large one? I agree there is a problem with the wording in the city infobox not being applicable across non-capital cities and it should be fixed. I think the advantage of having a consistent infobox across all city and town articles is not something to be thrown away lightly. There might possibly be room to expand the city infobox slightly to better suit smaller cities and towns. I would appreciate it if some others could voice an opinion on this, but it seems pretty quiet around here at the moment. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></small> 11:42, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aside from the above opinions, I think this infobox is too large with some un-necessary parameters for any article. I think there might be an argument for a towns infobox to fill the void between the City Infobox and the Suburbs Infobox.

<p>In <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Games_%28Australian_TV%29_f6cd.html" title="The Games (Australian TV)">The Games (Australian TV)</a>, John Howard (the actor) is described as liberal. I know the word is not non-existant in Australian English, but it is a bit confusing. One problem is that it means something different to the US English meaning. The Australian meaning would translate to the US word "libertarian" (in that it usually supports <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laissez_faire.html" title="Laissez faire">laissez faire</a> economics), while in the US, the word is also used to describe those who support government welfare. Another problem is the difference between the "small l" and "big l" liberal.</p>
<p>Is John Howard a liberal in the Australian English sense of the word, or merely in the US English sense?</p>
<p>Are there any stylistic guides on wikipedia for Australian English?

<dd>I haven't heard of her and I don't find a failed attempt at local election plus being a delegate to the State Conference of the Labor Party notable. Heck, my father has been a delegate to the Liberal Party's conference at least half-a-dozen times, and he'd never qualify as notable (except maybe to me:)). Furthermore, if this was AFDd I would probably vote delete on the strength of the author's bizarre and sickening fixation with her evidenced in his offensive blog. That, for me, tips the scale.
