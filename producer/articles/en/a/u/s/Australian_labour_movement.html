<p>The history of the <b>Australian labour movement</b> reaches back to the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> and the movement has a long tradition of organised unions of workers and links to political activity. Over time the term has encompased both the notion of an "industrial wing" which is comprised of the union movement and a "political wing" or the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, the mainstream of the union movement is comprised of those unions that are affiliated to the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Council_of_Trade_Unions_9b9d.html" title="Australian Council of Trade Unions">Australian Council of Trade Unions</a>. These unions are commonly the product of a significant process of ammalgamation undertaken in the late 1980s and early 1990's. The Australian labour movement has a long history that has at various times been more or less fractured than it is today.</p>

<p>Workers to Australia initially came from England under what was called <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penal_transportation.html" title="Penal transportation">Penal transportation</a>, as prisoners under the condition of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a>.

<p>Craft unions in Australia began in the early 19th century as <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craft_union.html" title="Craft union">craft</a> associations of highly skilled urban workers who sought to combine (form a <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_union.html" title="Labour union">labour union</a>), to increase their wages and lower their hours.</p>
<p>Conditions of the time were governed by the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_and_Servant_Act_92a1.html" title="Master and Servant Act">Master and Servant Act</a>. Employees in Australia in 1840 who left their employment without permission were subject to being hunted down under the Bushrangers Act. As little as one hour’s absence by a free servant without permission could precipitate a punishment of prison or the treadmill. In the Melbourne jurisdiction, in the years 1835 to 1845, when labour shortages were acute, over 20% of prison inmates were convicted under the New South Wales <i>Master and Servant Act</i> for offences including leaving place of work without permission and being found in hotels.</p>

<p>As the craft union movement broadened, less skilled and rural workers began to organise. Four great strikes convulsed the continent of Australia in this period: the <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890_Australian_Maritime_Dispute_3790.html" title="1890 Australian Maritime Dispute">1890 Maritime strike</a>; the <a href="../../../1/8/9/1891_Australian_shearers_strike_3950.html" title="1891 Australian shearers strike">1891 Shearers strike</a>; the 1892 Broken Hill Miners strike; and the 1894 Shearers strike.

Each of these industrial conflicts was seen as a demoralising blow for the labour movement. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lane_38dd.html" title="William Lane">William Lane</a> and many others sought refuge in building a new society called <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Australia_6e91.html" title="New Australia">New Australia</a> in Paraguay.

<p>The early labour movement was much broader than trade unions. As there was no social welfare, many workers and their families were members of a <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friendly_society.html" title="Friendly society">Friendly society</a> to insure against sickness, accident or unemployment. In fact, Unions had a far smaller membership than did Friendly Societies in Australia, according to Green and Cromwell. They explain that "At the turn of the (<i>twentieth</i>) century, when the friendly societies were serving well over 30 per cent of the population, fewer than one worker in ten (2.5 per cent of the total population) was a trade union member." (<i>Mutual Aid or Welfare State. Australia's Friendly Societies</i>). Reports of community events and labour processions regularly detailed the active participation of <i>trade societies</i> and <i>friendly societies</i>. Friendly societies were an important part of the Labour movement, but their contribution has mostly been ignored by Labour Historians, according to a researcher in this field, Dr Bob James.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_labour_movement.html" title="Edit section: Growth of the trade and industrial unions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Growth of the trade and industrial unions</span></h2>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century the union movement was in disarray across Australia. Only a few tough craft unions had survived. The majority of workers were un-unionised. A variety of skilled organisers turned this around, and achieved remarkably high union membership density rates by 1914.</p>
<p>The threats of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_cat.html" title="Wild cat">wild cat</a> industrial action on a national level convinced the Federal Parliament to adopt a system of compulsory registration of unions, and compulsory arbitration in disputes. This system came into place in 1906 and dictated the terrain of industrial relations conflicts and unionism until the 1990s.</p>
<p>In part this was caused by two new ideas of unionism: <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_unionism.html" title="Trade unionism">trade unionism</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_unionism.html" title="Industrial unionism">industrial unionism</a>. Trade unionists sought to organise all people engaged in the same trade on job sites. Rather than simply organising the ditch diggers into one craft union and the dirt movers into another craft union, trade unionists sought to organise all people who moved earth into one union.</p>
<p>Industrial unionism went one step further, claiming that all workers on one worksite, diggers, plasterers, engine drivers, cleaners, caterers, engineers, accountants and clerks should belong to one union, as part of a "construction industry." Industrial unionists sought to organise all workers into <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Big_Union_4d51.html" title="One Big Union">One Big Union</a> which could then conduct a strike across the entire society and peacefully usher in socialism. The <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912_Brisbane_General_Strike_db3f.html" title="1912 Brisbane General Strike">1912 Brisbane General Strike</a> showed the combined power of the labour movement, effectively operating as an alternative social administration for five weeks, undermining the power of the conservative government.</p>
<p>At the time there was no real conflict or division between the trade and industrial union mentality. Many supporters of the ALP in the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trades_Hall_bd14.html" title="Trades Hall">Trades and Labour Councils</a> were radical, militant and supported socialism. Both ideas of unionism shared the idea of organising the unskilled to win against the bosses.</p>

<p>The chief proponent of industrial unionism in Australia was the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World_366b.html" title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the World</a>, which actively sought out conflicts with management. The IWW also acted on a political plane, opposing <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription_in_Australia_b6b6.html#Boyhood_Conscription" title="Conscription in Australia">boyhood conscription</a>, then the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">first world war</a>. The Australian labour movement united around opposition to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Conscription_f6d2.html" title="Australian Conscription">conscription</a>, largely due to vocal opposition by the IWW and Catholic archbishop of Melbourne, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Mannix_3c46.html" title="Daniel Mannix">Daniel Mannix</a>. Two referendum proposals to introduce conscription by Labor Prime Minister <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Hughes_3492.html" title="Billy Hughes">Billy Hughes</a> were defeated, making Australia the only nation at war during the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> not to introduce conscription.</p>
<p>The Labor Governments of Hughes in the Federal sphere, and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Holman_cedb.html" title="William Holman">William Holman</a> in New South Wales, were held in low regard by much of the labour movement due to their policies on military conscription.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_23.html" title="September 23">September 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a> twelve members of the IWW (most of them active organisers) were arrested and charged with treason under an archaic law known as the <i>Treason Felony Act (1848)</i>. As four buildings had been deliberately damaged by fire, the charge of arson was added to the charges. They became known as the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Twelve_b4de.html" title="Sydney Twelve">Sydney Twelve</a> with many unions and people in the labour movement actively campaigning for their release for several years.</p>
<p>The <i>Unlawful Associations Act (1916)</i> was rushed through Federal Parliament in late December and the IWW was declared an illegal organisation. The IWW simply changed its name to <i>Workers' Defence and Release Committee</i>, and continued as normal. In late July <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> the Act was amended resulting in any organisation or individual able to be easily proscribed. In return the IWW ran a '<a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_speech_movement.html" title="Free speech movement">free speech movement</a>' campaign in which over 80 members in Sydney were sentenced to 6 months hard labour (the maximum) for simply proclaiming their membership, which was enough to scare many others away from open defiance. Those not born in Australia were subsequently deported at the end of their sentences, mostly to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a>. A chain of international protests about the Sydney Twelve IWW prisoners followed. (<i>Sydney's Burning (An Australian Political Conspiracy)</i>)</p>
<p>At the end of the first world war in Australia there were a number of major industrial and political actions which threatened the stability of society. In <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a> counter-revolutionary and racist riots broke out in the red flag riots, when it was made illegal to fly or wear the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_flag.html" title="Red flag">red flag</a>, except as a sign of danger. The New South Wales General Strike of 1917 started on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, by railway workers over the introduction of the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_management.html" title="Scientific management">Taylor system</a> of determining where work could be speeded-up. It was the most widespread labour upheaval since the 1890s, and ended when mining workers returned to work on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_15.html" title="October 15">October 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>.</p>

<p>Strikes in this period were common place, and remained threatening to the Commonwealth government until <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a> and the passage of the <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog-collar_act.html" title="Dog-collar act">Dog-collar act</a> against the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maritime_Union_of_Australia_ffa3.html" title="Maritime Union of Australia">Waterside Workers Federation</a>. Of particular note is the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923_Victorian_Police_strike_c786.html" title="1923 Victorian Police strike">1923 Victorian Police strike</a>.</p>
<p>Trade union movement membership reached its peak in 1927, according to Green and Cromwell, when trade union membership "comprised less than 15 per cent of the whole population, only 47 per cent of the workforce."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_labour_movement.html" title="Edit section: Depression and attacks on unions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Depression and attacks on unions</span></h2>
<p>After the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_Workers_Act_1928_a9f5.html" title="Transport Workers Act 1928">Transport Workers Act 1928</a> (more widely known as <i>The Dog Collar Act</i>) was passed, the Australian union movement sought to protect itself by forming the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Council_of_Trade_Unions_9b9d.html" title="Australian Council of Trade Unions">Australian Council of Trade Unions</a>. By this point the idea of trade unionism had won out over industrial unionism. This was in part encouraged by the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission_50b9.html" title="Australian Industrial Relations Commission">Industrial courts</a> who freely gave registration to small, shop and trade specific unions. While the Communist Party of Australia would always argue for industrial unions, the idea of industrial unions mouldered until the 1960s, and only received support from the <a href="../../../a/c/t/ACTU_a360.html" title="ACTU">ACTU</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">ALP</a> in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The dog-collar act was used to break up strong unions, in forestry and in dock-working. These unions were perceived to be revolutionary, or at least militant. At the same time the fragmented trade unions sought to maintain member conditions in an environment of massive unemployment. For instance, rates of male unemployment in the industrial city of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle%2C_NSW_8be4.html" title="Newcastle, NSW">Newcastle</a> never dropped below 20% throughout the 1920s. When the depression hit, formal unemployment rates rose above 30%.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929_Timber_Workers_strike_0ea2.html" title="1929 Timber Workers strike">1929 Timber Workers strike</a> was the first large strike after the onset of the Great Depression when <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lionel_Lukin_%28judge%29_7eab.html" title="Lionel Lukin (judge)">Justice Lukin</a> handed down a new timber industry award that increased the working week from 44 to 48 hours and reduced wages. During the strike Lukin ordered a secret ballot to be held which was the first attempt to enforce a secret ballot in an industrial dispute.</p>
<p>A fifteen month lockout during 1929-1930 of miners on the Northern New South Wales Coalfields was particularly bitter. The <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rothbury_Riot_902d.html" title="Rothbury Riot">Rothbury Riot</a> resulted in police shooting at miners, killing Norman Brown and seriously injurying many more.</p>
<p>The trade union response to unemployment was not inspiring. Before the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Depression</a> some strong trade unions would provide welfare for unemployed members, and seek jobs for them. The depression rendered this system useless where it existed at all. (Union welfare primarily existed in seasonal work with militant unions, like dock-working. It was precisely these unions that were attacked by the dog-collar act).</p>
<p>In response to the depression the remains of the IWW set up a union for the unemployed. This idea was quickly taken up by both the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Australia_a69d.html" title="Communist Party of Australia">CPA</a> and the ALP who both established associations (not organised as unions of workers) for the unemployed. The militance of unemployed workers who identified with the CPA or ALP, and the spirit of universal unionism which remained from the IWW, changed these movements of the unemployed into effective unions. The unemployed unions attacked local councils, and occasionally landlords, in order to win conditions. Infamously, a series of CPA inspired riots occurred against evictions in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtown%2C_NSW_8fd7.html" title="Newtown, NSW">Newtown</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankstown%2C_New_South_Wales_ae00.html" title="Bankstown, New South Wales">Bankstown</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle%2C_NSW_8be4.html" title="Newcastle, NSW">Newcastle</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wollongong%2C_NSW_f6ab.html" title="Wollongong, NSW">Wollongong</a>. The unemployed movements did not win significant employment, payment or condition victories for the unemployed workers. No future union of the unemployed would ever match the achievements of the unemployed unions of the 1930s.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_labour_movement.html" title="Edit section: Second World War and after">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second World War and after</span></h2>
<p>The second world war created a significant feeling of sympathy for the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> amongst Australian workers, and the CPA attempted to take advantage of this by industrial agitation after the war in the 1948 Queensland Railways Strike and the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949_Australian_coal_strike_1011.html" title="1949 Australian coal strike">1949 Australian coal strike</a> (the first time the military were used in peacetime to break a strike), and disputes on the waterfront and in the meat industry. This attempt to seize control of the union movement failed and was the start of the decline in communist leadership and influence in the labour movement. At the same time, agitation by Catholic organisations such as the National Civic Council (or <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupers.html" title="Groupers">Groupers</a>) started setting up of industrial groups within unions to counter the influence of communists.</p>
<p>The 1950s and 1960s period was generally one of industrial peace, dictated by preference agreements and <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closed_shop.html" title="Closed shop">closed shops</a>. This period saw union membership keep pace with the growth of the workforce.</p>
<p>The post war years saw the Australian labour movement support <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> in their fight for human rights, cultural rights and native title, through supporting the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946_Pilbara_strike_b5f1.html" title="1946 Pilbara strike">1946 Pilbara strike</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gurindji_Strike_2ec3.html" title="The Gurindji Strike">The Gurindji Strike</a> at Wave Hill in the Northern Territory, equal pay for aborigines and Torris Strait Islanders, and support for the <a href="../../../n/o/o/Noonkanbah.html" title="Noonkanbah">Noonkanbah</a> people in their land rights dispute with the Western Australian Government over mining companies disturbing sacred sites<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/car/1997/3/speeches/seminar1/george.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/car/1997/3/speeches/seminar1/george.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1960s a number of militant unions became locked in contests with governments and employers. Governments relied on penal powers to keep union activists in line. The <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_strike.html" title="General strike">general strike</a> over <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarrie_O%27Shea_504e.html" title="Clarrie O'Shea">Clarrie O'Shea</a>'s imprisonment broke the government law and ushered in a period of rising union demands. These demands existed in a context of a general social radicalisation under <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gough_Whitlam_3876.html" title="Gough Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Fraser_2bbe.html" title="Malcolm Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a>.</p>
<p>The militant wave was broken by the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a>'s Wages and Prices Accord in 1984 under Labor Prime Minister <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hawke_e803.html" title="Bob Hawke">Bob Hawke</a>. After 1984 industrial militance declined, and a newly amalgamated trade union movement presided over falls in real wages. The <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_Australian_pilots%27_strike_0cf8.html" title="1989 Australian pilots' strike">1989 Australian pilots' strike</a> saw the Federal Labor Government using RAAF planes and pilots to break industrial action by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, taken outside the Wages and Prices accord.</p>
<p>With the 1996 election of the Federal Government under Prime Minister <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> increasing pressure has been brought to bear on industrial relations reforms to reduce the industrial power of Australian trade unions. This has included the introduction of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Workplace_Agreement_35ea.html" title="Australian Workplace Agreement">Australian Workplace Agreements</a> - individual contractual agreements on pay and conditions between an employee and employer - and the reduction of minimum conditions contained in Industrial awards. One of the first targets of the conservative Government was to undermine the power of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maritime_Union_of_Australia_ffa3.html" title="Maritime Union of Australia">Maritime Union of Australia</a>, through breaking its closed shop on waterfront labour. The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_Australian_waterfront_dispute_aac2.html" title="1998 Australian waterfront dispute">1998 Australian waterfront dispute</a> resulted with stevedoring firm, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Corporation_59fd.html" title="Patrick Corporation">Patrick Corporation</a> under CEO Chris Corrigan, attempting to sack its entire waterfront workforce of 1400 people through company restructuring. The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Council_of_Trade_Unions_9b9d.html" title="Australian Council of Trade Unions">Australian Council of Trade Unions</a> condemned the sacking as a gross act of collusion between Patrick, the Government, and the National Farmers Federation, and with the threat of legal action against the Government and Patrick Corporation, a settlement was negotiated to allow some reform with the MUA retaining its effective closed shop.</p>
<p>The last quarter of the twentieth century has seen the proportion of employees in the workforce belonging to a union falling from 51 per cent in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> to about 23 per cent in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>

<p>After the Howard Government's 2004 election victory, and with a majority in the Senate since <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">1 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, changes to industrial laws to further undermine the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective_bargaining.html" title="Collective bargaining">collective bargaining</a> power of trade unions look set to continue.
