<p>you cannot cite a blog as a valid source!</p>
<p>Well, there are <b>actual zoo curators</b> in those forums (not blogs) that give tips for people having problems keeping snakes. They are the ones making accusations of animal abuse. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankyboy5_1146.html" title="User:Frankyboy5">Frankyboy5</a> 07:11, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Right, well I could write an entry in that blog claiming that I am indeed a zoo curator, but that does no mean that I am validated. Allow me to demonstrate, I am telling you that <b>I AM AN ASTRONAUT</b> and that to get to the moon you will need some sort of spacecraft. Am I really an astronaut? No, but Neil Armstrong was one and no one can question that. He might be able to tell you how to get to the moon, but I can't (not accurately). If you must use unvalidated claims, it would be more fair if you include citations from those who have more favourable opinions of Austin Stevens along side of the negative comments. Until there is some sort of middle ground here that is not a biased, I will not withdraw my claim that the article is biased and/or inaccurate.</p>
<p>They give people tips on how to take care of their snakes <a href="http://community.discovery.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/234104363/m/505105384" class="external autonumber" title="http://community.discovery.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/234104363/m/505105384" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. They are also making accusations of animal abuse and one who's name is Jim Harrison is a curator of the Kentucky Reptile Zoo<a href="http://www.geocities.com/kentuckyreptilezoo/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/kentuckyreptilezoo/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Another is Terry Phillips (aka Southpark's Terrance and Phillip), Curator of reptiles at Reptile Gardens<a href="http://www.reptile-gardens.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.reptile-gardens.com/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. You need to sign you comments too with 4 of these~. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankyboy5_1146.html" title="User:Frankyboy5">Frankyboy5</a> 04:04, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One thing is clear about all this, you are extemely biased against Mr. Stevens (An odd biased actually). If you were not, you would include both sides of the argument; rather, than you biased view. In fact, what you have done is quite simple. You have validated some impossible to prove quotes in an un-officially sanctioned forum, and used them to strenghten your argument. However, all Wikipedia desires is the facts; and because you have none, I cannot allow your biased review of Mr. Stevens to stand. If you were honest you would include quotes from "reptile enthusiasts" that enjoy his programme, as opposed to only those who fit your viewpoint. Any college professor would look your additions and sources and flunk you. User:Alfaromeo147GTA</p>
<p>Well, here's something you shouldn't have added, you were making almost like a vandal would because you are putting <b>JUNK</b> in the article. Sayin things that are personal opinion is similar to vandalism. The article is not biased. Why???? Because I kinda like this guy's show and I have noticed the controversy by some people. I found that nobody had taken any action against him but that these people are reputable because they have given actual tips in the forums. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankyboy5_1146.html" title="User:Frankyboy5">Frankyboy5</a> 02:22, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It does not matter, you cannot verify that your sources are legitimate. Therefore, what you are putting in the article is, as you say <b>JUNK</b>. You are one person who has single handedly put what you think is important in the article. Do you not realize that some idiot might come along and actually believe that the show is staged, simply because it is in <b>your</b> article. In addition, your additions are not written as well as possible, and I firmly belive that you do not like Mr. Stevens. I admit that things such as his introduction are absurd, but you cannot call into question the validity of the show simply because you read a blog. I am no reptile expert but I could give the advice of the forum bloggers and claim to be an expert. I ask that you forthwith change the biased nature of the article and that you then withdraw from editing the piece. User:Alfaromeo147GTA</p>
<p>I actually like his shows but they do look staged. The films are good looking but some think that the animals look too "perfect" and therfore they are probably captive and people even claim they have the animals used in his program <a href="http://www.fieldherpforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=444" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fieldherpforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=444" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. It's not my article. The one about his show was made by me though. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankyboy5_1146.html" title="User:Frankyboy5">Frankyboy5</a> 05:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Wouldn't it be easier to end this pointless discussion by just cutting away the controvery section? There's no solid proof to indicate he provoked the snake to attack him. Seems like a whole bunch of speculation to me. It seems like most of the "proof" came from "zoo curators" in some forum, the first question I gotta ask is if there's proof they ARE zoo curators? If they are then ask them to join this discussion, to explain why/how exactly would Austin Stevens provoke a snake to attack himself. If the animals were indeed "perfect", why on earth would he provoke them attack? It doesn't make sense to bring a tame, well trained animal along if you want to stage a bite, since they are typically more mild mannered. This brings up another question&#160;: Why on earth would he want a snake to bite him? Getting bitten by a snake and being sent into a hospital isn't exactly a normal person's idea of a good time.User:DarkArkz</p>
<p>Absolutely Agreed User:Alfaromeo147GTA</p>
<p>I am glad that the controversey section has been removed, I think that a solid plurality of viewers prefers it that way. We need a picture though.</p>
