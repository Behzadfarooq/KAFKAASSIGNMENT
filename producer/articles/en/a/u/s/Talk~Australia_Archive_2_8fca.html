<p>Republic: "A state in which the supreme power rests in the people and their elected representatives or officers, as opposed to one governed by a king or the like". <i>Shorter Oxford Dictionary</i>.

<p>Thank you Zoe, yes indeed. He also forgets that a "commonwealth" is by definition a "Republic".</p>

<p>It is possible to be a republic and be part of the British Commonwealth - India is just that. Australia is not.</p>
<p>The queen <i>is</i> the head of state of Australia (and represented by the Governor-General). Australia is <i>not</i> a republic. Daeron will need to take a close look at the Australian Constitution. If he keeps up this "Australia is a republic" stance , he'll get reported as an annoying user. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArno_4ba5.html" title="User:Arno">Arno</a> 06:59 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Get it through your head, we can apoint 'Micky Mouse' as the Head of State</dd>
</dl>
<p>to meet visiting heads of state from other countries. That still doesn't change the fact that Australia is a republic governed by representatives elected by the people of Australia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your fantasy that Australia is a monarchy because it choses to use a royal linerage as the official head of state, is laughable.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In theory, as power has moved from absolute monarchs to parliamentary systems under constitutional monarchies, <i>all</i> democratic states are republics, ie, ruled by their republics. So the definition is now <i>explicitly</i> linked to the issue of the manner in which a head of state is chosen. States where some method of democratic election the head of state exists are defined as republics. States where there is no democratic selection, but the head of state, a monarch holds office by inheritance are taken by definition to be monarchies; the only exceptions are where there are a number of royal families and they between them elect one of their own to be monarch. But in those states, the people have no role in selecting the monarch, it is merely a choice made by the royal families. One or two such states exist. So in reality, Zoe, a republic <i>cannot</i> have a king. That's a basic point taught in every political science textbook. Australia, as its own laws and its constitution states, has a monarch, Queen Elizabeth II. Therefore it is a monarchy. And as power resides in a government (albeit acting in the Crown's name) answerable to parliament, it is a <i>constitutional monarchy</i>. Whether it should be is a different matter. But it is, and will remain a constitutional monarchy until a referendum changes the constitutution to replace an inherited throne by a head of state elected in some manner. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 07:01 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yup: that's what a commonwealth is allright. No doubt about it, Australia is a commonwealth. Or, to put the whole thing in a nutshell, the Commonwealth of Australia is a constitutional monarchy. Which is exactly what the entry says now. Seeing this bit is right, let's leave it this way. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 10:19 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So you admit that Australia is a REPUBLIC. A state where the people or their elected representatives govern the country. Nothing to do with whether there are or are not monarchs on the planet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>IF (head of state) = (monarch) THEN (form of government) = (monarchy). Seriously, how difficult is this to understand? <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 11:39 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>(head of state) = person at tea-party</dd>
<dd>(form of government) = who rules = elected representatives.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Seriously, how difficult is this to understand? The Queen could jump up and down outside a SS or any other office and demand the doors open for her - but they won't. She has *less* rights in this country than most anyone else because she isn't even a citizen - she can not vote, give orders, or make any demands. READ a DICTIONARY!!! She is NOT the supreme authority, and you are mis-representing the truth to suit your personal goals.</p>
<pre>
Monarchy = n. state ruled by sovereign; his rule.

<p>Now <b>STOP</b> trying to trick the world into believing our government is not a republic! A <b>commonwealth</b> is by definition a type of republic, the word republic needs to be added so that some people like you will understand that the voters are the supreme authority in this country.</p>
<hr />
<p>From "The Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary" (third edition reprint - 1999):</p>
<p>republic:</p>
<ul>
<li>a nation in which supreme power is held by the people or their elected representatives or by an elected or nominated president, not by a monarch etc.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You see, <b>supreme power is not held by a monarch</b></dd>
<dd>She can't open a Fish&amp;Chip shop, she has no authority nor control.</dd>
</dl>
<p>monarchy:</p>
<ul>
<li>a form of government with the monarch at the head;</li>
<li>a nation with this.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>at the head</b> as in control of government!</dd>
</dl>
<p>In my own country, Belgium, supreme power is held by the elected representatives of the people (the prime minister and his cabinet). We do have a king, but his role is overwhelmingly ceremonial. According to the given definition of republic my country is a republic. According to the given definition of monarchy my country is not a monarchy (the king is a head of state, not a head of government). <b>I have never ever heard or read anyone refer to it as such.</b> Officially, Belgium is a constitutional monarchy. It is also the first time I see a reference to Australia being a republic (at the present time). I seriously doubt that the definitions given in the dictionaries are the same as what is generally understood to be a republic and a monarchy. Dictionaries should follow common usage, not dictate it. <a href="../../../d/h/u/User%7EDhum_Dhum_eaee.html" title="User:Dhum Dhum">D.D.</a> 11:55 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your first problem is that you have fixated the US model as meaning "republic" in your mind. A <b>republic</b> merely means <i>that utimate authority lies with the people or their representives</i>, anything else is an extension like a "constitutional monarchy" instead of "monarchy". I never said Australia had a 'Presidental Republic', just a Republic form of government.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am an Australian and Australia is refered to as a commonwealth and republic all the time. I've never once heard anyone talk about what law or budget the monarch is going to decide upon - because its not her position to do so in our government - it's a republic. Likewise you may be familiar with Kangaroos jumping down the streets of Sydney -- but actually living here I know that is a fiction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Trust me, I know that your last statement is a fiction too. During 3 separate visits I've spent about a year travelling around Australia. I've probably been to a lot of places in your country you haven't even heard of :-) But, anyway, that's beside the point. I just wanted to put things straight that I haven't got this caricaturesque vision of Australia in my mind. <a href="../../../d/h/u/User%7EDhum_Dhum_eaee.html" title="User:Dhum Dhum">D.D.</a> 15:27 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm a little confused by your comment, DD. As you say, Belgium is a constitutional monarchy just like Australia. I have always assumed that the King has two roles (a) do nothing and let the elected Prime Minister govern (except in <i>very</i> special circumstances), and (b) open bridges, kiss babies, and attend important funerals. If you read the given definitions, they are perfectly clear: a <b>republic</b> has a form of government where supreme power is held by an elected representative of the people. A <b>monarchy</b> has a form of government where supreme power is held by a king (or queen, prince, whatever). Most modern monarchies are, like Belgium and Australia, <b>constitutional monarchies</b>, where the king holds power in theory (and could actually exercise it as a last resort) but in practice only acts on the advice of the head of government (the prime minister or equivalent). There seems to be nothing wrong with the definitions. Where is the problem you see? <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 12:13 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The problem is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The king is not the head of government (see definition of monarchy and your reply), but the head of state. In a number of countries these two positions are held by one and the same person. Not in Australia and not in Belgium.</li>
<li>You say that "... where the king holds power in theory (and could actually exercise it as a last resort) but in practice only acts on the advice of the head of government ..." I do not agree on the part between brackets ("and could actually exercise it as a last resort"). Governor-general John Kerr who represented Queen Elizabeth II in Australia did just that in 1975 by dismissing the Gough Whitlam government. I honestly don't know if the Belgian king has the power to dismiss the government. A few years ago an abortion law was passed by our parliament. Constitutionally, our former king, Baudouin I had to give his assent to it, but he couldn't because he had a personal conscience problem. A solution was then devised, and for one day the king was judged "unable to reign". The law was passed without the formal approval of the king, and the next day he could "reign" again. To me, that doesn't sound as if the king can exercise power as a last resort. He has to do what the government tells him to do, otherwise he risks to saddle the country with a constitutional crisis. All that to say that supreme power lies not with the monarch (not even as a last resort) but with the elected representatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps there is a difference between the Australian (British) and the Belgian monarchies. But, by all means, Australia is a constitutional monarchy, not (yet) a republic. <a href="../../../d/h/u/User%7EDhum_Dhum_eaee.html" title="User:Dhum Dhum">D.D.</a> 12:57 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, just so. There are republics that have the HofG and the HofS in the same person, others that have the two roles seperate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kerr's sin was that he broke the rules and <i>used</i> his theoretical power. Some people argue that the circumstance was such that Kerr had little choice and did as best he could in a difficult situation, but his actions caused a storm of bitter controversy which endures to this day. (Don't trust the Wikipedia entry on <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gough_Whitlam_3876.html" title="Gough Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> - it's riddled with JTD's erudite but badly mistaken views from 10,000 milies away - I must get back to GW and fix it one day.) As soon as he retired, Kerr was hounded out of the country: spat on, shouted down at public meetings, hated in a way that ordinary politicians are not. The closest thing I can use to describe the way people on the left of politics felt (and to some extent still do feel) about Kerr as opposed to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Fraser_2bbe.html" title="Malcolm Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a> or other players in the drama of 1975 would be to compare it to the difference between the way people here felt about the Germans or the Turks in WWI (hated them, maybe, but respected them too as worthy enemies) and the way they felt about the Japanese in WW2 after their appalling atrocities became public knowledge (a much more visceral and viscious hatred, with no trace of respect at all). Kerr was hated like a traitor: like an umpire who cheats, or a policeman who takes bribes: in the view of many Australians he was <i>paid</i> to enforce fair play, it was his <i>job</i> and he betrayed that trust. Politicians are generally expected to be dishonest and unscrupulous, Governer Generals are not. Although many people supported Kerr's action (essentially, most of those on the side of politics that benefted) the rage that many Australians felt was such that no Governer General would ever dare repeat the stunt. Fair dinkum, it would risk civil war.</dd>
</dl>
<p>UTC, are you labour voter <b>still</b> upset about that?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I've never voted Labor in my life. But I know how Labor people feel about the matter. They will never forget it, not until the people who were there at the time all die off. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>1) The Governor-general and <b>NOT</b> the Queen is able to exercise that power. There is no precedent for it and it would never be recognised. She has no control not even to say deal another hand. 2) That power is STILL subject to the people because th GG would be out on his ear if he made a wrong call. As it happened, the ALP lost that election with the largest majority in Australian history against it.</p>
<p>The Queen has no control of the governments decisions or powers. By all means, Australia is a republic which uses the term "constitutional monarchy" because it was a hundred years ago. You can no longer appeal to the privy council nor does England appoint our Governor Generals - those days are long since gone and the people are the supreme authority in this country, a republic.</p>

<p>I've seen some bizarre arguments on Wiki, but arguing that Australia is a republic has got to be the most bizzare, factually incorrect to date. For the record, I'm done some formal checking with sources.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is not bizarre, clearly you are not an Australian all of whom should be familiar with the issues.'</i></dd>
<dd>As a study guide for you I would suggest you refer to: <a href="http://www.uow.edu.au/law/civics/subjectovws/republico.html" class="external free" title="http://www.uow.edu.au/law/civics/subjectovws/republico.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uow.edu.au/law/civics/subjectovws/republico.html</a> <a href="http://www.corowaconference.com.au/The%20Peoples%20Conference/Conference" class="external free" title="http://www.corowaconference.com.au/The%20Peoples%20Conference/Conference" rel="nofollow">http://www.corowaconference.com.au/The%20Peoples%20Conference/Conference</a> 2001/comment37.htm (perhaps you understand what the corowa conference was?) If you understood the political motives involved, it would help you understand that any attempt to ridicule the subject is inhertantly dishonest. FYI: the stated prime aim of the <i>Australian Republican Movement</i> is working to ensure Australia becomes a Republic with an Australian as Head of State. Do you understand that sentence? It is about removing the 'Head of State', nothing to do with the actual government or how the land is governed. Do you understand that a two party country has roughly a 50/50 voter split between ALP and Coalition - that when the most holy of holies an ALP Prime Minister swears that the position of Governor General will be destroyed for dismissing the Whitlam government, that it becomes the duty of every ALP supporter to support the removal of that position. That's why 50% of the country rattles on about 'the need to remove the Governor General'.</dd>

Why did it have a referendum to become a republic, a referendum that was lost?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because the country is already a republic and the people did not decide to change the title from 'Commonwealth' to 'Republic', nor to drop the Queen at the cost of creating a social class elite in this country at this time. Any other questions?</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Why did leading republicans issue a statement bemoaning the fact that Australia was still <i>not</i> a republic in 2000?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>The facts could not be more clearcut. AUSTRALIA IS A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY. EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY IS VESTED IN THE CROWN AND EXERCISED BY A GOVERNMENT, HEADED BY THE PRIME MINISTER, WHO ACTS AS A MINISTER OF THE AUSTRALIAN CROWN.</b> Q.E.D. Issue closed.</p>

<dd>The facts could not be more clearcut. <b>The Commonwealth of Australia</b> is a <b>commonwealth republic</b> with a constitution and monarchy head of state. What is so difficult to understand? The document was written in the offical wording of the day; show me one instruction from the Queen or Britain in the last fifty years, or show me one 'power' that the Queen could enact. Only the Governor General can decide upon or enact his very limited powers; and he is appointed and dismissed by the Prime Minister, an elected representive of the people.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>The REASON for the Republic Debate</b> is because young Australians keep getting told &amp; upset by foreign know-it-alls that Australia is a monarchy. It is not a monarchy, it is a constitutional monarchy which is a <i>commonwealth</i> and <i>republic</i> in <i>both</i> tradition and practice.</dd>

<p>Show one facet of a Republic which Australia does not fullfill; Commonwealth was just the Australian word for republic by the common people for the common good as defined by common usage of those terms (<i>commonwealth</i> and <i>republic</i>) as recorded in every Australian dictionary from 1902 to today.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ok - lts summarise.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Australian constitution and Australian law says Australia is a constitutional monarchy.</li>
<li>The Australian government says it is a constitutional monarchy.</li>
<li>Leading republicans like Paul Keating, Malcolm Turnball, and ALL the members of the Republic Advisory Committee say it is a constitutional monarchy.</li>
<li>The RAC's own report said it is a constitutional monarchy.</li>
<li>Its Attorney-General in the republic debate said it is a constitutional monarchy.</li>
<li>It is described as a constitutional monarchy in every international legal document.</li>
<li>Every encyclopedia WITHOUT EXCEPTION says it is a constitutional monarchy.</li>
<li>Every academic (legal, political science, etc) says it is a constitutional monarchy.</li>
<li>The Letter of Credence presented by the Australian Ambassador to the President of Ireland says it is a constitutional monarchy.</li>
<li>Everyone who has visited the page but you say it is a constitutional monarchy.</li>
<li>The diplomatic corp record it as a constitutional monarchy.</li>
<li>By every political science definition it is a constitutional monarchy.</li>
</ol>
<p>As to dictionaries which you seem so incapable of understanding, they all make clear if you knew how to read them that a commonwealth <i>may</i> be a republic, but a commonweath doesn't automatically mean a republic. As to your claim that Australia is a republic with a queen, that really is scraping the barrel for ideas. A state with a queen by definition is a monarchy. It CANNOT BE A REPUBLIC. Claiming a state with a queen is a republic is as ludicrous as talking about a Jewish Muslim. They are mutually exclusive terms. You cannot be both.</p>
<p>The answer is clear. IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY. If you can't grasp that, that is a reflection on you. You need a beginners guide to constitutional law, a beginners guide to political science, a beginners guide to studying history but most of all a beginners guide to elementary cop-on.

<dd>Hmmmm... So if Australia is a "republic with a queen", then I guess the United States must be a "monarchy with a president". :) <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></dd>

<p>Well after reading the above and already knowing the definition of "republic" I am convinced that it is imprecise to say that Australia is a republic since republic-like aspects of its government are covered by the "constitutional" part of "constitutional monarchy". --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>

<p>In the interests of controversy (I love a good argument! :&gt;), definitions from the full OED (I get access to OED Online, my university has a subscription):</p>
<p>Republic:</p>
<p>"2. a. A state in which the supreme power rests in the people and their elected representatives or officers, as opposed to one governed by a king or similar ruler; a commonwealth. Now also applied loosely to any state which claims this designation."</p>
<p>Monarchy:</p>
<p>"2. A state having a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in a single person. Formerly, also, a nation or state having dominating power over all other states.</p>
<p>absolute or despotic m., a government by the absolute will of the monarch. constitutional m. (see CONSTITUTIONAL a. 4b). elective m., one in which the monarch is determined by election as opposed to heredity. hereditary m., one in which the sovereign power descends by hereditary right. limited m. (see LIMITED 2)."</p>
<p>Constitutional:</p>
<p>"b. Of a sovereign: Ruling according to a constitution or constitutional forms which limit his arbitrary power; said also of sovereignty or government so exercised."</p>

<p>That is exactly it. According to Australian constitutional law, executive authority is vested in the Crown and exercised by a cabinet called the Executive Council on legal authority of the sovereign, the monarch <i>not</i> in its own authority or on the authority of parliament, which, under your quoted definition, matches - <i>A state having a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in a single person.</i></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Meaning</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Australia is a constitutional monarchy under <i>all</i> definitions;
<ul>
<li>It has a queen</li>
<li>Executive authority is vested in the Queen</li>
<li>The Queen is part of the Legislature</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>The Governor-General is not a head of state. He/she is the representative of the Queen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The word Commonwealth as created in the 'preamble' (the term isn't used, but that it how that section of the constitution is normally referred to) to describe the federal union created in 1900. The word's meaning depends on its context. As it relates to a 'Commonwealth under the Crown' by definition it cannot mean a republic, because by definition a republic cannot have a crown. (The Commonwealth of Nations, for example, is not a republic.)</li>
