<p>Many of the topics listed under <i>other topics</i> are listed under ==Miscellaneous topics== on all other country template. I have standardized that for this article. Do not revert.</p>

<p>Don't want to address my concerns? So you want this to be a flame war? Okay, then, what other country templates have you regularly edited? Why dont you just stop buggerising about with the page until you have familiarised yourself with the country template?</p>
<p>I've looked over the articles I rearranged. They belong where I put them in order to standardize the template. <b>No other articles have this silly format <i>other topics</i> listed under <i>main article</i>.</b> --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 22:47, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was quite deliberately not "answering your concerns", Jiang. Tim Starling already answered them: I intervened here not as a direct participant, but in order to maintain the established and successful page layout - in other words, this is essentially a dispute between you and Tim Starling. I stepped in when I saw that you had reverted Tim's revert of your unwise changes. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 22:56, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>What was the explaination? "it's not really something different to see, it's part of the same topic"? My issue here is with a lack of standardization and relation between lumped articles. If it were the <i>same</i> topic, the "Other topics" label would not be necessary. How is <i>other topics</i> different from <i>see also</i>? Why should these articles be listed under the <i>main article</i> heading instead of below the section? What makes this situation so special that it is inapproprate for <i>all</i> other articles I have seen in WP?</p>
<p>I don't see the logic behind lumping the articles under the topics they are placed under. Like all other countries, these articles are basically copied text from the CIA factbook/state dept. What makes Australia's transporation statistics so special that it should be listed under "demographics" rather than "miscellaneous". What's wrong with a miscenllaneous section?</p>
<p>If you and Tim believe the template needs to be changed, go argue that at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Countries_c1c1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Countries">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject_Countries</a>. Don't unilaterally change the agreed upon style and format and make WP inconsistent. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 23:11, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Look, I don't have time for this shit right now - I have to go. Meanwhile, just look over the mess you are making. For example, right in the first topic (history) you have blown away the section with a great deal of Australian political history: Australian Prime Ministers. Your "work WITH me" edit summaries are highly misleading - you had the oportunity to work WITH Tim, but chose not to. You had the opportunity to DISCUSS your proposed changes with the people who work in this topic area, but chose not to. For now, just go ahead and bugger it up, I'll fix it when I get back tonight. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>We can only choose one section to put the PM article in. The PM article has closer relation with politics (since even the history is over the history of the role, ie, a political history) than with history in general, which has more to do with a wider range of events. Note the the PM articles for the UK, Canada, New Zealand (and probably more) are incorporated into the text of the politics section, as I have done here. The article focuses on what powers the PM has, not the policies of various past PM's. This makes it a political article.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Protected</span></h2>
<p>I have protected this page. Of couse, the protection is entirely symbolic in this case.</p>
<p>I provide these data for the interest of the disputants:</p>
<ul>
<li>The miscellaneous links section is indeed part of WikiProject Countries. (See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countries_3570.html#Miscellaneous_topics" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countries">WikiProject Countries#Miscellaneous topics</a>.) Having this section is the norm among country articles to which the template has been applied.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Inspecting <a href="../../../k/u/w/Kuwait.html" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxembourg.html" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, I never found a list of "other topics". There was a smattering of "see also" lists; these were found at the bottom of the relevant sections, with the exception of the "see also" list under <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html#Politics" title="Romania">Romania#Politics</a>. (There was a "see also" in the middle of a table in Mexico; but since it pertains only to a single table entry, it's not really germaine.)</li>
</ul>
<p>On another topic, this whole conflict reminds me a lot of the recent edit war over VfD. Two experienced and trustworthy contributors get overexcited and somehow forget that <i>anyone's</i> change is easily undone. It just doesn't make sense to get into a revert war - it's wasted effort! It doesn't matter what format the article is in for a few hours today or tomorrow; continuous reverting is a hostile action, and is entirely counterproductive to the disputants' efforts to understand and address each other's concerns. -- <a href="../../../c/y/a/User%7ECyan_b70d.html" title="User:Cyan">Cyan</a> 00:55, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for protecting the page, Cyan. However, you have protected the <i>wrong version</i>. In the case of a dispute, it is conventional and proper to use the last version <i>prior to the dispute</i>, and most certainly not the version that the instigator of the dispute is insisting on. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<p>The page history was a little too messy to determine which version was pre-edit war, what with Jiang's edit being reverted by Tim Starling, whose changes were then reverted by Jiang and then reverted back and forth by Jiang and yourself, and other contributors making small changes in the middle. Under the premise that the question of which particular version is preserved for the cooling-off period is far less important than just moving the action to the talk page, I simply protected it in the condition I found it. In short, neither revision was "wrong" - both were temporary, and the version I protected on was luck of the draw. -- <a href="../../../c/y/a/User%7ECyan_b70d.html" title="User:Cyan">Cyan</a> 21:05, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually on first inspection I'm inclined to agree with Tannin re: placement of "Military of..." and some other sections. However, we should respect the fine work in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countries_3570.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countries">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countries</a> and stick with their format. Lots of thought and debate there have created a good boilerplate. Think of it as freedom -- instead of wasting time on format, spend your energies on putting in good content, which is the value you bring to this article. Also, threatening to use sysop powers to protect a page you're involved with is clearly against community policy, so don't do it. You'll have morning-after guilt. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 00:13, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>

<dd>Whilst I personally prefer Tannin's version, other countries are listing their "see also's" at the end rather than directly under the "main article" link. See <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> for example.

<dd>It is NOT "Tannin's version", Angela. Read the edit history, please. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></dd>

<dd>I meant the version you were arguing for, not <i>your</i> version as such. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let's get one thing straight right away. We are <b>not</b> talking about <i>my</i> version here, nor have <i>I</i> been involved in the dispute, until I stepped in to protect <i>other people's</i> work from Jiang's revert-on-sight policy. (Read the edit history: it's all there.) I would indeed have protected the page earlier today - it is the duty of all sysops to stop revert-happy stupidities, and to do our best to allow the peope who create and improve content to get on with things free from interference by the likes of Jiang. Unfortunately, I had a 9:00AM appointment, and while protecting a page takes practically no time at all, it takes more time than I had available to post a properly detailed sest of reasons. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>You are very much involved in the dispute and it would have been wrong for either one of you to protect the page. As well as editing the page, you have been expressing strong opinions on the talk page. Both of these things make you involved. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>On returning, I see that someone has protected <b>the wrong version</b>! This is crazy. If Jiang wants to horn in here (where he has no expertise and has never contributed anything of note), then the onus is on <i>him</i> to persuade the people who <i>are</i> working on these pages that his suggestions are good ones. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>There is no "wrong version". The guidelines for protecting a page state that an admin <i>may</i> edit the page in order to revert to an old version, but they do not say that this must be done. I assume Cyan protected the page as it happened to be when he decided to protect it. I very much doubt he purposely waited for Jiang to make an edit before protecting it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, let us turn to the meat of the matter, and examine the merits of the Jiang insists on so mindlessly:</p>
<p>Right at the top, <b>he deletes the links</b> to two important Australian history topics: <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Constitutional_History_a6bb.html" title="Australian Constitutional History">Australian Constitutional History</a>, and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Prime_Ministers_3e8a.html" title="Australian Prime Ministers">Australian Prime Ministers</a>. Next he <b>deletes the links</b> aain: this time to three articles about political matters, only one of which gets a mention in the "see also" section he adds. I don't think anyone has an objection to setting a good, standard format and sticking to it - but deleting important links purely in order to mindlessly impose a particular format is not a good idea.</p>
<p><i>Insisting</i> on doing this in the face of objections (rather than being prepared to discuss things and work towards a mutually acceptable result) is very poor behaviour indeed. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 09:34, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are not required to be the original author to partake in an edit war. As long as you side with a certain content (or in this case, formatting), you are taking a side. If you were truly neutral, you would not care which version is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is true that this formatting was originally inserted by Tim Starling and not you. However, this was not the <i>original</i> formatting. The current format ("my format") was present when the template was first implemented until Tim changed it against the established conventions. I can say too that I am preventing Tim Starling (not that I have anything against him) from "buggering up the work of <i>other people</i>" - all the people who created the country template.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Attacking me for lacking crediblity is a fallacy. I probably have worked with the country template more than you have. (This is besides the point. There is no need to prove to each other who has more experience here.) You still fail to convince <i>us</i> <b>why this article deserves an exception to the established convention</b>. Please discuss the issues. Don't attack the person.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Those links you claim have been deleted all are still on the page. Please check again. Now who is trying to elicit an explaination from whom? You're not convinving anyone here. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 09:47, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The format is not an issue I care about either way. Well, Tim's version is better, but it's really a small point. However, deleting links is another question entirely. Restore the links you deleted, and (so far as I care) you can have any format you want (within reason). But, of course, this may or may not meet with the approval of other interested parties. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 09:55, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You don't have to. I don't have to. I just thought it would help since you seem to be having some difficulty seeing (or scrolling). Maybe the PM link is not prominent enough. The text should be reworded to include "Prime Minister of Australia" as a phrase so the entire link can be seen. Other than that, nothing is hidden. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 10:09, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, let's try this. With your agreement, I'll unprotect the page and make what I see as the minimum required changes to it (i.e., edit your version so that the links work sensibly, as opposed to a complete revert of it). That should take 5 minutes or so. Then, you run your eye over the changes. If you are happy with them, problem solved. If we can't agree on them, then we revert to the current version (it really should be Tim's version, but I'll let that point go for the time being) and protect it again. Fair enough?</p>

<p>Summary of Tannin's edits and my comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>moved "Australian Constitutional History" from <i>see also</i> under history section to part of the <i>main articles</i> list. - although I'd rather not have it there, reserving the main article to the <b>main</b> article, I don't really mind since this <i>is</i> a history article</li>
<li>Added "Republic Advisory Committee" and "Foreign relations of Australia" to the <i>see also</i> list of the politics section - First, "Republic Advisory Committee" is already there. Don't link it twice on the same line! Second, foreign relations should be at the miscellaneous section since that is how the template has it. I see how it relates to politics, but moving it there would require we change the template (and have some mention of foreign relations be added to the discussion of government in that section).</li>
<li>Moved "Australian birds" from the <i>see also</i> list to the <i>main article list Flora and Fauna - Please reserve</i> main articles <i>for just that. Birds are only a subset of the fauna, obviously not qualifying as a "main" article.Perhaps the link could be incorporated into the text, which only discusses flora at this moment.</i></li>

<dd>Crap. Australian birds are quite extraordinary, and have great significance. The linked article does not yet explain this (someone, probably me, should do a major re-write), but (a) Australia has ~900 species, significantly more than you would expect from its small land ara relative to other continents, particularly so given that the continent is so barren. and (b) the development of birds in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-New_Guinea_b540.html" title="Australia-New Guinea">Australia-New Guinea</a> was crucial to the development of bird life worldwide: more than half of all living birds are passerines: i.e., they are directly descended from the birds of Australasia. So far as worldwide significance goes, Australian plants are <i>not</i> important, and neither are Australian mammals, reptiles, or any other group. The birds, however, <i>are</i>. In short, if you don't understand a subject, you shouldn't try to edit it. If you do edit it anyway, that's fine, but be prepared to accept corrections to your work from people who do know what they are taliking about. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 04:16, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just because Australian birds are unique does not elevate them to a higher category. If australian birds could munch off the heads of humans, they would still be birds. Being special does not make them "all animals." It's not about the importance. It's about the scope of the article. If you think birds are so important, create a new section. If the section is not entitled "birds", it can't be considered a "main article." Get you vocabulary straight. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 05:28, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Even if we put <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_birds.html" title="Australian birds">Australian birds</a> in the main articles of "Flora and Fauna", people may not realise how important it is. A subsection "birds" under "Flora and Fauna" does a better job than that.

<dd>This is why page protection in an argument between two sysops is a bad idea. Jiang just ignored it anyway.

<p>Are you sure? As far as I can tell, Jiang's sole edit after I protected it was in the period where Tannin had unprotected it to see if Jiang would start reverting again.</p>
<p>When I enacted the protection, I realized that the people who would be most tangibly affected were the innocent bystanders. I felt this was unfortunate, but necessary. My goal was to move the action out of the article namespace and into the talk namespace; even though the protection was symbolic, in the sense that it had no hard-security-type binding power on the disputing parties, I believe it was effective nonetheless.

<p>This might sound odd, but I'm surprised at the Jervis Bay Territory being treated like a 'regular' territory. Sure, it is one, but it's not at the same 'level' as NT or the ACT.

The article <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> also spells out that "a continent ... is a large continuous mass of land... ." It says that Oceania and Australasia are terms used to define the region including Australia and the Pacific Islands. The article <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceania.html" title="Oceania">Oceania</a> also mentions that the islands of Oceania do not form part of a true continent.

<p>I am considering reverting this; even if it is true, I don't think that <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violet_Crumble_f4f7.html" title="Violet Crumble">Violet Crumble</a> warrants a link as an Australian-related article - it's just another chocolate bar. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 02:46, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What about the Continent?</span></h2>
<p>I was reading the Australia page, and I cannot figure out why there is no distinction between Australia the continent and Australia the country. Since many people confuse Oceania and Australia, should this not be made more clear? Just a thought.</p>
<p>--LuYu</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi LuYu. The country and the continent are coextensive, so 'Geography of Australia' should describe both the country and the continent adequately. Having said that, I would not be opposed to a separate treatment of the continent and the country, so long as <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> remains as the country article. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 07:49, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
