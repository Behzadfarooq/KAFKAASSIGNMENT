<p>I've been doing some thinking, and the result of my thinking is confusion: In terms of greater WWII history, the bombing of darwin and the mini-subs in sydney harbour are unimportant (i mean its hardly in the same league as dresden or nagasaki or whatever) and so not deserving of its own article, however in terms of Australian history it is very important (being the only time that the commonwealth of Australia has ever been attacked, or had any serious threat of invasion) and so it does deserve its own article. So what to do? any thoughts? i had the one idea of creating a page seperate from WWII called <i>australia's involvement in WWII</i>, but that then doesnt really focus on what i was just talking about so i dunno. Any more experienced wikipedians care to comment? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_bellman_55cf.html" title="User:The bellman">The bellman</a> 09:10, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that these were all extremely important to Australians, and as such each should have their own articles written about these events. I don't think its wise to compare the relative importance of these events to Nagasaki and the D-Day landing. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 13:09, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, what coverage do they have in the broader war articles? They need coverage in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin%2C_Australia_35aa.html" title="Darwin, Australia">Darwin</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broome.html" title="Broome">Broome</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townsville%2C_Queensland_aacf.html" title="Townsville, Queensland">Townsville</a>'s respective articles, and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_military_history.html" title="Australian military history">Australian military history</a> (which we don't have, but would be nice, as it'd fit in as part of a global series of national military history articles - as well as the broader war articles. The other thing which might help here I think is what I've been talking about doing with <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Australia_5246.html" title="History of Australia">History of Australia</a>.</dd>

<dd>I've only looked at the Darwin and WWII(pacific) articles, but they each only have one sentence each, which is perhaps appropriate for WWII, but seems very lacking for darwin. I'll try and fix Darwin up soon <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_bellman_55cf.html" title="User:The bellman">The bellman</a> 12:10, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At the moment, it's only broken up into two articles - before 1901 and after 1901. I think we could have at least ten - the same number we have for the United States. This would enable us to have an article on, say, 1930-1950, or an even shorter period, which would inevitably focus largely on WWII. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:00, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I question whether trying for so many chronological divisions is making a rod for our own back. Overview articles are by far the hardest things to write in Wikipedia, and the longer the overview, the harder it gets. I personally think that detail is probably better placed in articles on more specific areas, for instance, in articles on gold rushes, or specific geographical areas like histories of specific cities and towns.</dd>

<dd>If you did wish to subdivide Australian history further, might I suggest that some suitable points to subdivide on: 1788 (first white settlement of note), 1851 (discovery of gold), 1901 (federation), 1945 (end of WWII), and maybe 1970 (end of the Menzian snooze). I'm not convinced any more divisions would be helpful at this point.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 01:24, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For now, I think you're quite right. For the most part, they'd be good places to split it up. I don't like having the 1901 split though, because that tends to cut the whole federation thing in half. Perhaps 1905? <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 04:25, 4 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks - it's been on my to-do list for a while. Are we officially not using AUSPIC images anymore? <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 01:35, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Auspic have twice told me on the phone that the images from the aph.gov.au website can be reproduced for non-commercial purposes, but they have not confirmed this in writing as I asked, so I am not using them for now. Also I have taken an oath not to upload any photos except those I took myself, because I am sick of arging with copyright-fetishists. In any case the Senate ones are very poor. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:17, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a bit of a point of contention between Adam and myself (I'm the copyright-fetishist he's referring to I believe), because when I contacted the MIS services who look after the aph.gov.au site they told me that I need permission to reproduce material. Incidently (and for the record), I hate Australian copyright! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 10:35, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, AUSPIC *= aph.gov.au, which is where the conundrum lies. While you need specific permission to copy from the latter, they get their pictures from AUSPIC, who appear to be different. That said, as AUSPIC's license is noncommercial anyway, and because they haven't confirmed this in writing, I agree that we should stay away from them in future. As Adam notes, the quality of the Senate pictures (all the lower house MPs being done) is pretty terrible for some reason.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Organisation of articles</span></h2>
<p>Ive been doing some thinking (dangerous i know) and have decided that a lot of my posts recently have been about the correct way to organise articles. ie. when should an article be a self standing article, and when should it be a sub-section of another article, for example should the bombing of darwin be a seperate article or just a part of the articles WWII(pacific), <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin%2C_Northern_Territory_5a73.html" title="Darwin, Northern Territory">darwin</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_history.html" title="Australian history">Australian history</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_military_history.html" title="Australian military history">Australian military history</a>, and japanese military history. The same thing with the fuzzy-wuzzys i am not sure if they deserve thier own article or not. SO, does anyone know if there is a wikipedia style page discussing how things should be organised/catogorised etc.? i apoligise for my stupid newbie questions. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_bellman_55cf.html" title="User:The bellman">The bellman</a> 02:11, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd be inclined to wonder if there's enough information for a seperate article on the bombings - IMO, it'd probably be better off as a section somewhere. And with the fuzzy-wuzzys - if this was placed into another article, then we eliminate the naming issues. Oh, and there is a Wikipedia style page for discussing these things - here!&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 02:18, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think the only feasible way is to keep an eye on the topics. For instance, there is a question asked in the images section by someone (still gotta reply that actually) and so we should keep this topic.

<dd>Thanks and and ive modified it; also while we have a section about wikiproject sydney, i may as well hijack it and change the subject. There was talk b4 about a national get together, which may well have been premature, however, then there was talk of city-wide get togethers which may also have been premature. SO, i am proposing as a step on the way toward a city-wide get together (which is a step toward a national get together, which is a step toward creating an australian wikipedia chapter, which is a step toward world domination&#160;:P ) anyone who is interested in doing some research on next weeks ACOTW (which i believe we agreed would be <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Chang_9200.html" title="Victor Chang">Victor Chang</a>) meet at the Sydney state library for that reason some time next week. I know that <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> went for last weeks collaboration, and (I THINK) was interested in going again this week, and i am interested in going, and i hope that maybe some other sydneysiders would like to come, and that we could make this a weekly get together of sorts. And i suggest that if this is sucsessful others try to set up similar get togethers at thier state (or in camberra's case national, and in darwin's case teritorial) libraries.

But I think it's usefulness is limited the bigger it gets. Let's focus on one small batch and keep the rest at the Complete list. It'll also let us use the template in other places, like new Aussie wikipedians talk pages as a welcome, and the like. I would say let's make it a little smaller, maybe 15 items per column - 15 to create, 30 to expand, however many reviews/images fit. Just a suggestion for a smoother ride. <b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User_talk%7ETPK_8851.html" title="User talk:TPK">T.</a></b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK">P.K.</a> <small>16:27, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</small></p>

As to the politics and culture articles - I copied them from the Canadian one. I don't think they're a bad idea, but they haven't been created over there anything.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Voter's Guide at Wikibooks</span></h2>
<p>Hello Aussies. I'm making a <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Voter%27s_Guide" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Voter%27s_Guide" rel="nofollow">Voter's Guide</a> project over at Wikibooks. I'm an American and am focusing on getting some stuff ready for the US midterms in 2006 (I'm assuming the upcoming election is too soon to accomplish much) and I see on <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> that an Australian election will be occurring in about two months. If anybody is interested, I am creating some US framework now, which can be used/adapted for Australian elections as appropriate. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 01:13, Oct 4, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oops, it has been brought to my attention that I should study my months, as current events indicates that the upcoming Australian elections are significantly less than two months away, contrary to my original, bizarre reading. In any event, there will likely be another one, so the invitation still stands. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 01:28, Oct 4, 2004 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Checklist of Members of the House of Representatives 1901-2004</span></h2>
<p>There will be some problems with this checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people will appear twice, since they served in both the House and the Senate</li>
<li>Some names will appear twice because two MPs had the same name (eg the two <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Beazley_97c0.html" title="Kim Beazley">Kim Beazleys</a>). You will need to check at my website to figure out who these were.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Setting up an Australian Wikimedia chapter?</span></h2>
<p>I get the impression that there is a sufficient level of interest in setting up an Australian Wikimedia chapter, so I'm keen to seriously look into what's required.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, becoming a proper incorporated body will cost a couple of hundred dollars; not quite trivial, but not a huge expense either. We'd have to write and approve a constitution, appoint initial office bearers, and so on.</p>
<p>Initially, this would allow us a more convenient method to raise funds locally; in the longer term, it would serve as an official body we could use to apply for Australian grants, act as a good contact point for the Australian media, set up our own servers (for instance, sooner or later I expect Mediawiki will support distributed content cacheing). Not to mention it would be a good body to organise non-virtual get-togethers and suchlike!</p>
<p>What do you all think? Has anybody set up an association like this before? --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 01:15, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm certainly interested, but once it comes down to the nitty gritty legal details I don't think I would have the time, I spend more time mucking about on here than I should! I would be willing to do routine things like paying membership fees and putting my names on lists of signatures, or whatever is needed in that regard, but I don't even have time to participate at my local <a href="../../../l/u/g/LUG_b1f2.html" title="LUG">LUG</a>, and I'm notably lazy when I'm not at a keyboard&#160;:P I *would* be potentionally interested in a Melbourne based meetup though, given it was on a weekend and I had a few weeks notice! -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 05:02, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<li>I think it'd be an excellent idea, but it would require someone with the appropriate knowledge being willing to do the groundwork. Oh, and another advantage of doing this is that we may be able to (like in the US) secure tax-deductible status. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 07:22, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)

And this is despite the Greens outpolling them by a ratio of four to one in Victoria. And it looks like said guy will have control of the Senate. I did get smashed last night.

<p>I am *not* looking forward to having to revising the Australian political articles.

<p>Just to clarify my comment of last night. I dont really think that all voters are idiots, just that there is so much apathy in the electorate. Out of the THREE THOUSAND ballots cast in the senate in my booth, only TWENTY were under the line. Two of these were donkey votes, and another three came from myself and members of my family (who wouldnt normally have voted in this booth other than the fact i was working in it). That for people who normaly voted in that booth, only FIFTEEN serious below the line senate papers were filled in out of THREE THOUSAND.</p>
<p>I still feel completely numb and raw and completely disempowered from howards victory. I feel like just completely ignoring all things political and just burying my head in the sand. God help us if family first gets a seat. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_bellman_55cf.html" title="User:The bellman">The bellman</a> 10:00, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Short of some kind of miracle, the bastards will get in in Victoria, on Democrat preferences, which no one predicted. So it looks like they may well end up with the balance of power - or else the Libs will get a majority. So we're doubly screwed. I voted above the line this time.

<dd>Funnily enough, I came so close to voting above the line for the first time in my life, and the one reason I didn't was that I was voting Green, but wanted to put the Democrats below Labor to punish them for their despicable deal with Family First.

<p>Gosh, who says Wikipedians have a left-wing bias? I also spent 14 hours on a polling booth (not to mention six weeks in a campaign office), and am now feeling pretty sad, though not really surprised.

<dd>It's ironic really. I've turned to the left, after being fairly right-wing for a while. I guess I just saw the light.
