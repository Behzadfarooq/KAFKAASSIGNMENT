<h2><span class="mw-headline">pull vs pool</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The distinction between pairs like <i>pull</i> and <i>pool</i>, <i>full</i> and <i>fool</i> is lost by speakers from South Australia.</li>
</ul>
<p>205.188.116.14 has just added that the distinction between these words is lost. I'd like to see some evidence of this because I've never heard them merge in the 37 years and 4 states I've lived in in Australia. In the people around me "pool" is not usually pronounced /pu:l/ as the dictionaries have it either. Personally I pronounce "pull" as /pUl/ and "pool" as /pU:l/. Same vowel quality, different length. Not at all merged. — <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippietrail_ecc5.html" title="User:Hippietrail">Hippietrail</a> 02:18, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would agree, at least as far as WA is concerned. Others may hear it differently. I remember reading somewhere that the "pool=pull" thing is a South Australian regionalism. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 11:15, May 30, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As a (adoptive) South Australian, I disagree. The pronounciation of "pull" and "pool" is not entirely synonymous. They sound similar, but "pool" is elongated.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 12:58, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a South Australian, I disagree. Whilst the sounds of the words might be more similar than say Qld or NSW natives, we still don't merge the two pairs. Victorians also pronounce these pairs the same way as South Australians. However what is unique to South Australian speech is the shortened "ou", eg as in "thank you" (see excellent article: <a href="http://www.australianstudies.dk/Filer/Vowel%20change%20in%20AustraliaHQ.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.australianstudies.dk/Filer/Vowel%20change%20in%20AustraliaHQ.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.australianstudies.dk/Filer/Vowel%20change%20in%20AustraliaHQ.pdf</a>, particularly pages 75; Also see <a href="http://www.newcastle.edu.au/school/lang-media/news/als2003/conference%20proceedings/fCox.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.newcastle.edu.au/school/lang-media/news/als2003/conference%20proceedings/fCox.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.newcastle.edu.au/school/lang-media/news/als2003/conference%20proceedings/fCox.pdf</a>, page 11, in particular.) - Frances 6/6/05</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Features which aren't specific to AusE</span></h2>
<p>The following points have been added to the <i>Phonology</i> section.</p>
<ul>
<li>The distinction between <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/oː/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/oə/</span> in pairs like <i>horse</i> and <i>hoarse</i>, <i>for</i> and <i>four</i>, <i>war</i> and <i>wore</i>, etc. is lost.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Yod-dropping occurs after the consonants /s/, /z/, /l/, /T/, /r\/, /S/, /dZ/ and /tS/ in <i>suit</i>, <i>Zeus</i>, <i>lute</i>, <i>enthusiasm</i>, <i>rude</i>, <i>chute</i>, <i>June</i> and <i>chew</i>. The word class which is labeled /iw/ in the initial position of ANAE is the reflex of Middle English /iu/, which was derived from a large variety of sources (Jespersen 1949:3.8).</li>
</ul>
<p>(1) OE iw as in TiwesdÊg åTuesdayπ</p>
<p>(2) OE e:ow as in e:ow, åyouπ</p>
<p>(3) French iu, as in riule åruleπ</p>
<p>(4) French unstressed e+u, as n seur åsureπ</p>
<p>(5) French u, as in rude,</p>
<p>(6) French. ui, as in fruit</p>
<p>(7) French iv, as in OF sivre -&gt; M.E. sewe, åsueπ</p>
<ul>
<li>The distinction between <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/w/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʍ/</span> in <i>wine</i> and <i>whine</i>, <i>witch</i> and <i>which</i>, etc. is lost in Australian English.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are all quite true and valid points but they are true and valid for just about any dialect of English. There are very few dialects which preserve the distinction between <i>which</i> and <i>witch</i>. Also very few are the dialects which preserve the distinction between <i>horse</i> and <i>hoarse</i>. Yod dropping in AusE is identical to that in RP.</p>
<p>If we include a mention of every respect in which AusE differs from each and every other dialect of English, we'll end up with a very long list. This list won't seem to make sense to the average reader who's never heard of these dialectical features. It distracts the reader from the point of the article: Australian English (not Scots, Welsh English nor East Anglian). Moreover, it is simply a duplication of points mentioned in <i><a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonemic_differentiation.html" title="Phonemic differentiation">Phonemic differentiation</a></i>.</p>
<p>Instead of listing all of these features which are not specific to AusE it would be better to give the link to the article in which they belong: <i><a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonemic_differentiation.html" title="Phonemic differentiation">Phonemic differentiation</a></i>. I suggest that only the differences between AusE and NZE and RP be mentioned. NZE, because it's the most similar to AusE and for our close cultural ties. RP, because it is a well recognised and well understood dialect.</p>

<p>203.164.189.46 said, <b>yod dropping does not belong here, alot of Australian don't do the yod dropping</b>. So, does that mean that there are Australians that distinguish <i>soot</i> and <i>suit</i>, <i>loot</i> and <i>lute</i>, <i>rood</i> and <i>rude</i>, <i>choose</i> and <i>chews</i>, Pronounce <i>Zeus</i> as <i>zyoos</i> etc.? I've never heard an Australian talk like that. Smith 5Jun05</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since so many users of the internet around the world are familar with <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_American_db80.html" title="General American">General American</a> English, I think that should probably also be a point of comparison.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For what it's worth I've never heard any Australians make "suit" and "soot" sound at all similar. Does any English speaker anywhere do that? The other examples of yod dropping do seem correct though.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 07:28, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Grant,</p>
<p>I'd agree about using <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_American_db80.html" title="General American">General American</a>. It is very well known.</p>
<p>Smith,</p>
<p>Yes, we drop some yods, you're correct but I still agree with 203.164.189.46 that yod dropping doesn't belong here. The yods we drop are just the same ones as are dropped in almost all dialects of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_English_14ee.html" title="Commonwealth English">Commonwealth English</a>. Therefore, I argue, that there's a more appropriate place for details like these.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 6Jun05</p>
<p>But 203.164.189.46 said that some Australians don't do the yod-dropping. I was wondering if that is true, because all Australians I've heard do the same yod-dropping as I do, except that yods are not dropped after /n/, /t/ and /d/. Conservative RP does have yod-pronouncing after /l/, /s/, /T/ and /z/ in <i>lute</i>, <i>suit</i>, <i>enthusiasm</i> and <i>Zeus</i>, but has the usual yod-dropping after /r/, /dZ/, /tS/, /S/ and /Z/, so conservative RP has less yod-dropping than <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>, but also less yod-dropping than modern RP. By <a href="../../../r/e/c/Received_Pronunciation_c480.html" title="Received Pronunciation"><i>RP</i></a>. do you mean modern RP or conservative RP or both? Also <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_English_14ee.html" title="Commonwealth English">commonwealth English</a> is kind of hard to define, because the spelling in Canada is similar to that outside of North American, but the pronunciation is more similar to that in America.</p>
<p>Smith 6Jun05</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Jimp and 203.164.189.46 that yod dropping doesn't belong here. Perhaps just mention <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yod_dropping.html" title="Yod dropping">yod dropping</a> as a link only. Yod dropping in Australia is similar to that in Britain, not North America. Many Australians produce what is called <b>yod coalescence</b> where the clusters <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[dj]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tj]</span> become <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[dʒ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tʃ]</span> respectively, and occur at the beginning or within a word; the clusters <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[sj]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[zj]</span> become <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʃ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʒ]</span> respectively, and only occur within a word, becoming <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[z]</span> respectively when at the beginning of a word.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Do you work as a tore guide?</span></h2>
<p>Quote-<i>The vowel in words like tour, pure has diverged according to the whim of the speaker, either remaining as /ʊə/, or becoming either /ʉːə/ (a sequence of two separate monophthongs) or /oː/ (a long monophthong).</i></p>
<p>In those accents where /ʊə/ becomes /oː/, does it merge with the vowel in <i>storm</i> making <i>moor</i> and <i>more</i>, and <i>tour</i> and <i>tore</i> homonyms?</p>
<p>- Smith 9Jun05</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is what the article seems to imply. I don't think that this is the case. As far as I'm aware <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/oː/</span> applies only to certain words. For me <i>moor</i> and <i>more</i> are homonyms as are <i>poor</i> and <i>pore</i> (along with <i>pour</i> and <i>paw</i>). However, <i>tour</i> is homophonous with <i>tore</i> nor does <i>pure</i> sound like /p/ plus <i>your</i>. This is not a case of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʊə/</span>'s becoming <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/oː/</span> at all. What's happeninng is that such words as <i>poor</i> and <i>moor</i> are being pronounced with an entirely different phoneme. This needs a rewrite. Thanx Smith for bringing this up; I'd been just about to mention it m'self. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> (i.e. Jim) 9Jun05</dd>

<dd>There is nothing wrong with this statement. First, I got this information from <a href="http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/transcription/broad_transcription/broad_transcription.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/transcription/broad_transcription/broad_transcription.html" rel="nofollow">Phonemic (Broad) Transcription of Australian English</a> (see <i>Diagnostic chart of General Australian English Vowels</i>). Second, <i>tournament</i> is a word that this happens to, it is either pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ˈtʊənəmənt/</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ˈtoːnəmənt/</span>, I've heard both pronunciations. <i>Tour</i> is pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/tʊə/</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ˈtʉːə/</span> or less commonly <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/toː/</span>. <i>Pure</i> is either pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/pjʊə/</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ˈpjʉːə/</span>. For me <i>tour</i> is <b>not</b> homophonous with <i>tore</i>; <i>moor</i> and <i>more</i> <b>are</b> homonyms and are both pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/moː/</span>, and I believe this is true for most Australians. Of course some <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʊə/</span>'s became <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/oː/</span>, don't you use dictionaries, or listen to older Australians for these changes? That is why <i>either</i> is used, because for some speakers <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʊə/</span> becomes <b>either</b> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʉːə/</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/oː/</span>. Both <i>poor</i> and <i>moor</i> use the /oː/ vowel and <b>do not</b> use a entirely different phoneme. – <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">AxSkov</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/x/s/User_talk%7EAxSkov_04ac.html" title="User talk:AxSkov">T</a></small>) <small>12:39, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>By <i>entirely different phoneme</i> I meant the vowel in <i>raw</i>, <i>for</i>, etc. not a whole new one just for these words. It's entirely different in the sense that it's not <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʊə/</span>. Okay, so on close reading the statement is not false: you can interpret it to mean the vowel split and, in some instances merged to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/oː/</span>. However, I just don't feel that this is clear enough with the sentence as it is. I know what's going on but if I didn't, I might be inclined to think, apon reading this point, that some Aussies have merged all <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʊə/</span>'s to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/oː/</span>. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 10Jun05</dd>

<dd>Okay, I see what you mean.

<dd>There seem to be two versions of that paragraph - I put back the long one yesterday. The two words have the same vowel (I think I put my tongue in the same place), but pull is short, and pool is long. They do not sound the same.</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>In South Australia, pull and pool are merged in position i.e. the quality distinction is lost, pull is pronounced /pʊl/ and pool is pronounced /pʊːl/, but they're not (usually) pronounced the same contrary to belief by people that hear South Australians pronounce them very similarly and think that they're pronouncing them the same. Pairs like pull/pool, full/fool etc. are distinguished only by length in South Australia.</p>

<dd>If rhoticity is happening at all, which I seriously doubt, it would not be coming from the decendants of Irish immigrants/convicts, but from the influence of American pop-culture.

And</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;Age&#160;: 18 Location where you grew up, or location where you learned English: Australia Mine are mostly the same as Raza's except for these:</p>
<p>1. Do you distinguish pronunciation between:</p>
<ul>
<li>flour and flower no</li>

<ul>
<li>the first vowel in <i>furry</i> and <i>hurry</i> yes</li>

<ul>
<li>center of a peach - stone</li>
<li>tiny candies put on top of an ice cream cone or cupcake - sprinkles, Hundreds &amp; Thousands&gt;&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's my question:</p>
<p>Are these general features of Australians English?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would say there's some oddities in them, particularly the first. In particular, I've never heard a normal Australian distinguish wine/whine, flour/flower (I'd be hard pressed to tell how in a non-rhotic accent!), bred/bread (but see other talk posts about that), libel/bible (I have no idea how this might be done), roil/royal or taut/taught (nor this), nor have I heard an Australian not distinguish bad/lad, not doing which sounds Kiwi (if as /bed/, /led/) or British, or furry/hurry. IOW, TMK my English is normal&#160;:) I'm a 20 year-old from Victoria, and here's my list of diffs (if different from one, it's included, so all disagreements should be listed. I hope):
<ul>
<li>wine and whine No</li>
<li>flour and flower No</li>
<li>the first vowel in <i>furry</i> and <i>hurry</i> Yes</li>
<li>the vowels in <i>bad</i> and <i>lad</i> Yes</li>
<li><i>bred</i> and <i>bread</i> No</li>
<li>The <i>i</i> in <i>libel</i> and the <i>i</i> in <i>Bible</i> No</li>
<li><i>roil</i> and <i>royal</i> No</li>
<li><i>taut</i> and <i>taught</i> no</li>
</ul>

<dd>2. Do the following sentences sound okay to you? (Don't worry about "technically" correct grammar, just tell me if these sound allright in your opinion, or if you use them.)
<ul>
<li>We are in five. Yes (assuming you mean cinema number, else I have no idea what it means)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. Write the word that you use to refer to these:
<ul>
<li>source of water over the sink or tub -- tap</li>
<li>center of a peach -- stone</li>

<dd>Hmm, there used to be a contrast between 'wine' and 'whine', with the latter having an aspirated 'w'. I think this woud be very rare nowadays. I remember when I was young (1960's) some old people having this contrast on (eg) witch/which. I think it's pretty well gone now, and even when it was around I suspect it was a high-prestige 'correctness' thing and not in common use. - <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougg_6a66.html" title="User:Dougg">Dougg</a> 01:20, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
