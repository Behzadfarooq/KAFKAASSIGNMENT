<p>Why no picture content?</p>
<p>Articles don't progress to good or feature status without them. Many feature articles have a picture or pictures in each section.</p>
<p>I have added pictures (State Symbols of respective countries) and they have been taken down. The same pictures appear on many Aus and Indo-related pages, starting with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> etc..</p>
<p>User Merbabu most recently took them from the 'treaty relations' section. Treaty relations occur between Governments therefore such pics are appropriate. Tags on such pictures add to encyclopaedic content.</p>
<p>The best pictures should appear at top of page to grab attention and generate interest.</p>
<p>I am preparing a map of Indo-Aus region for top of page and my plan of design would be to place Aus-related pictures down left side balanced by Indo-related on right side.</p>
<p>Comments welcome.</p>
<p>Issue of picture removals listed for third opinion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Third_opinion#Active_disagreements" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Third_opinion#Active_disagreements" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Third_opinion#Active_disagreements</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidYork71_16ab.html" title="User:DavidYork71">DavidYork71</a> 04:25, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Initially i shrank rather than removed the oversized pictures and noted in my edit summary that i wasn't sure their inclusion was warranted. Ie, they are clearly put there for <i>decorative</i> rather than <i>informative</i> purposes. A picture of a country's coat of arms does NOT inform about it's bilateral relations with another.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, with respect to your comments at the Third Opinion board, i was NOT the first person to remove the pics. Thus, you have your third opinion. Better form, in my opinion, would to have notified myself if you are going to mention me as being in a dispute.<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 05:20, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>this terminology is broader than 'treaties', additional to treaties in for it encompases engagements to reach agreements which did not result in agreements or which resulted in agreements which did not go into force and stale treaties etc</p>

<p>I apologise if there is alredy an article that covers this, and if there is, please delete this one.</p>
<p>I also apologise for any disputed neautrality. I personally believe that the neautrality should be disputed and i intend to rectify the situation within the next three days. by thursday this article will be a fully formed wikipedia article with refrences, much more information, much more relevant information and a more neautral outlook. For now i simply wanted to get a few facts in and start the article.</p>
<p>I was also wondering if there was an article on how the climatic and geographical factors of indonesia affect Australias climate and more specificaly Perths climate.</p>

<p>This article is currently really, really shallow. It certainly glosses over the difficult relationship between that began during WW2 when Sukarno was installed as a Japanese puppet ruler and then decided to side with the Soviet Union after the war ended. The article should cover the aforementioned along with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation</li>
<li>The West's fear (Australia's in particular) that a Soviet backed Indonesia could cause further conflict in the region</li>
<li>Suharto's bloody rise to power and the Free World's support thereof</li>
<li>Implicit and later explicit support from the Australian government of Indonesia's decision to annex East Timor</li>
<li>Suharto's fall from power, which lead to Australia's UN backed campaign to liberate East Timor following the Indonesian military's ruthless occupation and destruction of it's infrastructure. Make sure to explain the deep mutual resentment that developed in the political cultures of both nations.</li>
<li>Several other incidents that have harmed or helped relations including the Bali Bombings and subsequent criminal prosecutions, Chapelle Corby, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's rise to power (he was the only major candidate who refused to play the anti-Australian demagogue in order to win votes), the Tsunami and Australia's unprecedented billion dollar aid package.</li>

<p>Who can provide information here about what the Indonesia embassy says about travel to Australia, to balance the Australian embassy warning against travel to Indonesia. Firstly i dont know where to find it and if it exists, second it may be -probably is- in Bahasa language<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidYork71_16ab.html" title="User:DavidYork71">DavidYork71</a> 07:47, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm now finished with working on this article but still would like to find some information with currency about a. indonesian public opinions surveys re opinions of Australia and Australians b. similar Aus surveys re Indo and Indonesians c. facts (size, composition) about the Indo community residing in Australia, and vice versa d. reference for the statistic claiming the number of Indonesian students in Australia e. what's the scale of Indonesian news coverage of Aus and vice versa, commitment to coverage by national broadcasters</p>
<p>This picture of Gorton/Suharto is now up. That was around the time of signing the 'Cultural Agreement'.</p>
<p>There could be further development about how the events of 1975 in Timor affected things. There were certainly street protests in Australia cities. The Aus govt was twofaced and out of step with the public there because Whitlam assured Suharto that he wouldn't move against Indonesia whatever they did while he came out in public deploring the violence and saying the Timorese should have a vote. Whitlam scorned the idea of Timor's independence.</p>
<p>Another low point was 1965 when Sukarno was playing racial politics with his speeches against foreigners, colonialism, the West, etc. ... failed ploy to distract Indonesian people from domestic crisis.</p>
<p>Can't be said that the relationship's 'good' when Indonesia is such an unsafe place for Australians to visit. Not a good outcome from past aid commitments and all the scheme of cooperation arrangements between the two govts, IMO. At least Indonesians in Australia aren't tageted for kidnaps and terrorist assault because of their foreign appearance. Once again love to know what the Indo govt travel advisory says.</p>
<p>Thanks to Merbabu and others for editing collaboration.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidYork71_16ab.html" title="User:DavidYork71">DavidYork71</a> 07:47, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I removed the idiotic commentary suggesting that it was unsafe for Australians to travel there and that this showed Indonesia was ungrateful for Australia's aid contribution. Oh, the Indonesian language is known as 'Indonesian'. The Indonesian word <i><a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahasa.html" title="Bahasa">bahasa</a></i> means 'language'. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 09:13, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The respective degree of contributions to ad hoc disaster relief appeals affecting either country is relevant to assessing the degree of mutuality in this relationship. Also the issue of violence and victimisation affecting those who visit either way has some relevance to describing an aspect of it - which is why I've asked for the official Indonesian view on the safety of its nationals travelling to Australia. If it's known to you, please add in. The conclusion that Indonesia is especially unsafe for Australians (even after the $Bns commitments under AIP etc) is coming from the most recent DFAT travel advisory which does not seem to regard <i>any</i> part of Indonesia as safe for Australian visitors. Compare it with the advisory for New Zealand (<a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/New_Zealand" class="external free" title="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/New_Zealand</a>) Another aspect is threats and bombing attacks against the AUST Embassy, Jakarta; while I've not heard of similar behaviour by Australians against the INDO Embassy, Canberra. All is relevant and should be included for building a comprehensive picture to give encylopaedic content to the article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidYork71_16ab.html" title="User:DavidYork71">DavidYork71</a> 12:37, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've commented in the edit summaries why I've removed your <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> that Indonesia doesn't reciprocate aid. Why don't you think Indonesia reciprocates? It's govt is bankrupt, and its GDP/capita is a small fraction of AUstralias - once again, rich country vs. poor country. Why would Indonesia give money to AUstralia farmers? That's hilarious and your own <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Furthermore, don't contrast Australian aid donations and perceived danger to Australians from terrorism unless you can find a source. It's your own opinion and thus invalid for wikipedia. It's not very difficult, really. the DFAT warnings are referenced, but they are a primary source. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 12:56, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User Merbabu has adopted a consistent policy of expurgating references to murders of 90-odd Australians in Indonesia in recent years from this article. These were widely reported occurrences and have some reference to the subject matter. He has claimed 'original research', and 'unreferenced'.</p>
<p>The same user previously has made abusive commentary in edit summaries, arising from his judgement about my presentation of information from DFAT</p>
<p>I have reintroduced this material with my original reference, in the introductory section. My original references were to other wiki articles, and those reference were removed by MichaelJLowe in this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia-Indonesia_relations&amp;diff=112023184&amp;oldid=112021816" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia-Indonesia_relations&amp;diff=112023184&amp;oldid=112021816" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>It was also claimed that the intro statement of the nature 'deepening Australian AID commitment to Indonesia in recent years', put by me, was 'unreferenced'. I had thought to tag additional references there was superfluous because the ensuing content of article (in the section 'Australian Aid etc' with many references added by me) clearly provides the foundation for that characterisation. For sake of consensus I now have bracketed a hyperlink from that statement to the 'Australian Aid..' section.</p>
<p>The remarks about travel safety have always been referenced (with reference tag and/or quotes) to the Feb 2007 Indonesia DFAT travel advisory. This remains so. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidYork71_16ab.html" title="User:DavidYork71">DavidYork71</a> 16:32, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Firstly, this is the first time you have actually responded to repeated reasoning in edit summaries, article discussion and your own talk page. That is way too late given that you have reinserted the info over and over.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, i have <b>not once</b> removed the referenced travel advisory. Rather I have removed your original research interpretations of it and your own opinionated <b>connection</b> of it to Australian aid. Also, you opinion that Indonesia should provide aid to Australian farmers.</dd>
<dd>As I have explained every time, this you still fail to provide one single reference for the <b>connections</b>. Once again, i put it to you that such a <b>connection</b> is your own original research, and that the quotes such as the following have no place in an encyclopedia: <i>Despite Australia's significant unreciprocated contributions of development aid to Indonesia over a lengthy period and foreshadowed into the future, Indonesia remains an unsafe environment for Australians</i> This is your own unproven <b>connections</b> and only the Australian govt's assertion that it is unsafe. We cannot report that "it is unsafe" although you may say "the Australian govt advises it is unsafe because A, B, C, etc". Despite your I have not removed referenced material about AUstralia govt warnings. I will continue to remove any statement as "Indonesia is unsafe for AUstralians." This is typical: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia-Indonesia_relations&amp;diff=110315578&amp;oldid=110314814" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia-Indonesia_relations&amp;diff=110315578&amp;oldid=110314814" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</dd>
<dd>I really don't see what is so difficult about this. I have made a number of suggestions on your now archived talk page. In my opinion you have some fundamental misunderstandings about what a wikipedia article is about. It is not about advancing a position - i've tried to explain this and it is severely frustrating to have to remove the same original research and blatant POV again and again. And I have continually been editing poor writing style. I will now be seeking admins to monitor this issue as it has gone on long enough. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 06:40, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
