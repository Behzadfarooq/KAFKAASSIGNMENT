<p>After the disintegration of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austro-Hungarian_Empire_f989.html" title="Austro-Hungarian Empire">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a> (following <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>), the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">state of Austria</a> - comprising, by and large, the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German-speaking</a> parts of the former empire - became constituted as a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_democracy.html" title="Parliamentary democracy">parliamentary democracy</a>. Two major factions dominated politics in the new nation: <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialists</a> (represented politically by the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Austria_1e35.html" title="Social Democratic Party of Austria">Social Democratic Party of Austria</a>) and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservatives</a> (politically represented by the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Social_Party_%28Austria%29_7ca4.html" title="Christian Social Party (Austria)">Christian Social Party</a>). The socialists found their strongholds in the working-class districts of the cities, while the conservatives could build on the support of the rural population and of most of the upper classes. The conservatives also maintained close alliances with the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, and could count among their ranks some leading clerics.</p>
<p>As in most of the nascent <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> democracies of the time, politics in Austria took on a highly ideological flavour. Both the socialist and the conservative camp did not merely consist of political parties, but possessed far-ranging power structures, including their own <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramilitary.html" title="Paramilitary">paramilitary</a> forces. The conservatives began organizing the <i><a href="../../../h/e/i/Heimwehr.html" title="Heimwehr">Heimwehr</a></i> ('home guard') in 1921-1923; the Social Democrats organized paramilitaries called the <i>Schutzbund</i> ('protection league') after 1923. Altercations and clashes between these forces (at political rallies, etc.) occurred frequently.</p>
<p>A first major incident ensued early in 1927, when members of the <i>Frontkämpfervereinigung</i> ("Front Combat Union" - a paramilitary association likewise affiliated with the conservative camp) shot and killed an eight-year-old boy and a war-veteran marching with the Schutzbund in a counter-demonstration in Schattendorf (Burgenland). In July a jury acquitted three defendants in the case, which led to outrage in the leftist camp and to the so-called <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_Revolt_of_1927_818a.html" title="July Revolt of 1927">July Revolt of 1927</a>. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">15 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> a <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_strike.html" title="General strike">general strike</a> occurred, and demonstrations took place in the capital. After the storming of a police station, security forces started shooting at demonstrators. An <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angry_mob.html" title="Angry mob">angry mob</a> then set fire to the Palace of Justice (<i>Justizpalast</i>), seen as a symbol of a flawed and partial judicial system. Altogether, 89 people (85 of them demonstrators) lost their lives in the conflict, and many hundreds suffered injury. Surprisingly, the violence soon died down and the factions took their battle from the streets back into the political institutions.</p>
<p>However, the travails of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Republic_0361.html" title="First Republic">First Republic</a> only got worse in the following years. The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> also showed its effects in Austria, resulting in high unemployment and massive inflation. In addition, from <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> - the year <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> became Chancellor of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> - <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">National Socialist</a> sympathizers (who wanted a unification of Austria with Hitler's Germany) threatened the Austrian state from within.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_4.html" title="March 4">March 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, Christian Socialist <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor_of_Austria_2f62.html" title="Chancellor of Austria">Chancellor</a> <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engelbert_Dollfuss_5068.html" title="Engelbert Dollfuss">Engelbert Dollfuss</a> suspended the Austrian Parliament. In a close vote (on railway workers' wages) in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Council_of_Austria_4988.html" title="National Council of Austria">National Council</a>, each of the three presidents of parliament resigned their position in order to cast a ballot, leaving nobody to preside over the meeting. Even though the bylaws could have resolved this situation, Dollfuss used this opportunity to declare that parliament had ceased to function, and blocked all attempts to reconvene it. The Social Democratic Party had thus lost its major platform for political action. The conservatives, who had lost some local elections recently and feared that they soon would lose power on the national level, could now rule by decree on the basis of a <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> emergency law, without checks on their power, and began to suspend civil liberties. They banned the Schutzbund - the socialist paramilitary organization - and imprisoned many of its members.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">12 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, a forced search in the city of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linz.html" title="Linz">Linz</a> of premises belonging to the Social Democratic Party sparked off armed conflict between government forces (police and paramilitaries) and the outlawed, but still existent, socialist paramilitaries. Skirmishes between the two camps spread to other cities and towns in Austria, with the heat of the action occurring in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>. There, members of the Schutzbund barricaded themselves in city council housing estates (<a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemeindebauten.html" title="Gemeindebauten">Gemeindebauten</a>), the symbols and strongholds for the socialist movement in Austria. Police and paramilitaries took up positions outside these complexes and opened fire. Fighting also occurred in industrial towns such as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steyr.html" title="Steyr">Steyr</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sankt_P%C3%B6lten_f636.html" title="Sankt Pölten">Sankt Pölten</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weiz.html" title="Weiz">Weiz</a>, Eggenberg bei Graz, <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kapfenberg.html" title="Kapfenberg">Kapfenberg</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruck_an_der_Mur_ac58.html" title="Bruck an der Mur">Bruck an der Mur</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graz.html" title="Graz">Graz</a>, <a href="../../../e/b/e/Ebensee.html" title="Ebensee">Ebensee</a> and <a href="../../../w/%C3%B6/r/W%C3%B6rgl.html" title="Wörgl">Wörgl</a>.</p>
<p>An apparently decisive moment in the events came with the entry of the Austrian military into the conflict. Though the army remained still a comparatively independent institution, the military leadership decided to follow the government’s calls to assist the police in its actions against the socialist paramilitaries. Under fire now by the army's light artillery, the socialist fighters soon surrendered. The fights in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> and the cities of <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Austria_6922.html" title="Upper Austria">Upper Austria</a> ended by February 13, but continued heavily in Styrian cities, especially in <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruck_an_der_Mur_ac58.html" title="Bruck an der Mur">Bruck an der Mur</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judenburg.html" title="Judenburg">Judenburg</a>, until February 14 or 15. After that there were only small groups of socialists fighting against the military, or fleeing from it. By <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_16.html" title="February 16">16 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> the Austrian Civil War had ended.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_Civil_War_11f1.html" title="Edit section: The fallout">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The fallout</span></h2>
<p>Several hundred people (including paramilitaries, members of the security forces and civilians) died in the armed conflict; more than a thousand suffered wounds. The authorities tried several leaders under the provisions of martial law and executed them. Leading socialist politicians managed to escape the country. The incidents of February 1934 were taken as a pretext by the government to prohibit the Social Democratic Party and its affiliated <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_unions.html" title="Trade unions">trade unions</a> altogether. In May, the conservatives broke with any pretence of still working inside of the constitutional framework. They declared the democratic constitution invalid and put in its place a corporatist constitution modeled along the lines of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mussolini.html" title="Mussolini">Mussolini</a>'s fascist <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>. The authoritarian regime in place was called <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrofascism.html" title="Austrofascism">Austrofascism</a> or <i><a href="../../../s/t/%C3%A4/St%C3%A4ndestaat.html" title="Ständestaat">Ständestaat</a></i>. The <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotic_Front_%28Austria%29_fbc3.html" title="Patriotic Front (Austria)">Patriotic Front</a> (<i>Vaterländische Front</i>), into which the Heimwehr and the Christian Social Party were merged, became the only legal political party.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_Civil_War_11f1.html" title="Edit section: Long-term effects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Long-term effects</span></h2>
<p>Though small in scale in an international comparison (and small in scale indeed in the light of the horrible events of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> which soon followed), the Austrian Civil War nevertheless proved a decisive moment in the history of the Republic. After World War II, when Austria re-emerged on the political landscape as a sovereign nation, politics again fell under the domination of the Social Democrats and the conservatives, who now formed a party called the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_People%27s_Party_16e7.html" title="Austrian People's Party">Austrian People's Party</a> (ÖVP). However, so as to avoid a repeat of the bitter divisions of the First Republic, the leaders of the Second Republic were determined to put the idea of broad consensus at the heart of the new political system. The concept of the 'Grand Coalition' was introduced, in which the two major parties (Social Democrats and People's Party) shared in the government and avoided open confrontation. This system brought with it stability and continuity, but ultimately lead to other political repercussions (also see <i><a href="../../../p/r/o/Proporz.html" title="Proporz">Proporz</a></i>). But the events of the Austrian Civil War had persuaded many in the political establishment (and, indeed, the population at large) that a slow pace of political reform was a small price to pay for social calm.</p>
<p>However, Austrian political parties often stand accused of having done little to come to terms with the past. In particular, representatives of the Austrian People's Party sometimes argue the necessity of the abolition of democracy in order to fight <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, and the party's parliamentary faction still has a picture of Dollfuss, the chancellor who suspended parliament, in its office rooms.</p>
