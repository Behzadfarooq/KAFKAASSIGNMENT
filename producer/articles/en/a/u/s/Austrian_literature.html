	    <p><b>Austrian literature</b> is the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German language</a> literature written in Austria. We can speak about Austrian literature in the strict sense from the year <a href="../../../1/8/0/1803.html" title="1803">1803</a> on when <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_3c65.html" title="Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor">Francis II</a> disbanded <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Empire_f314.html" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and established <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_Empire_a475.html" title="Austrian Empire">Austrian Empire</a>. A more liberal definition incorporates all the literary works written on the territory of historical Austria and German speaking authors who were tightly connected with the country. The Austrian literature must be considered in close connection with German literature in general and the borderline between proper German literature and the Austrian one is fuzzy.</p>

<p>There are and have been many tries to work out a complete definition of Austrian literature. Something most people can agree on is that there are certain differences and distinctive motives common in this literature which make it stand apart from other literary traditions.</p>
<p>The Austrian literature can be divided into two main divisions, namely the period up until the mid-20th century, and the period subsequent, in which both the Austro-Hungarian and German empires were gone. Austria went from being a major European power, to being a small country. In addition, there is a body of literature which some would deem Austrian, but is not written in German.</p>
<p>Complementing its status as a land of artists, Austria is a country where great poets, writers and novelists lived and created their literary works. It was the home of novelists / short-story writers <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Schnitzler_efa5.html" title="Arthur Schnitzler">Arthur Schnitzler</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Halm_688f.html" title="Friedrich Halm">Friedrich Halm</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefan_Zweig_d4fd.html" title="Stefan Zweig">Stefan Zweig</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Kafka_d4e6.html" title="Franz Kafka">Franz Kafka</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Bernhard_8677.html" title="Thomas Bernhard">Thomas Bernhard</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Roth_7ad9.html" title="Joseph Roth">Joseph Roth</a>, or <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Musil_73c2.html" title="Robert Musil">Robert Musil</a>, of poets <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Trakl_77c8.html" title="Georg Trakl">Georg Trakl</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Werfel_b569.html" title="Franz Werfel">Franz Werfel</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Grillparzer_adac.html" title="Franz Grillparzer">Franz Grillparzer</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainer_Maria_Rilke_b8b3.html" title="Rainer Maria Rilke">Rainer Maria Rilke</a> or <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adalbert_Stifter_6e5a.html" title="Adalbert Stifter">Adalbert Stifter</a>.

<p>This article tries to provide some definitions which together may give a better understanding of authors and literature in Austria and its territorial predecessors.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_literature.html" title="Edit section: The search for a definition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The search for a definition</span></h2>
<p>The main problem of defining a dynamic development may be that any definition will fall short of the various currents which lead to a certain type of literature. Through the centuries, there have been many different approaches, but most of them have been criticised to be biased - cultural, ideological or political. The Austrian literature developed out of a symbiosis of different regional traditions and languages.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, there was a homogeneous zone along the Danube river, spanning from Bavaria down to the eastern territories. Travellers and bards moved along this route, bringing with them new influences. At the same time Alps had their forbidding little valleys, which were virtually untouched - they developed their own regional culture.</p>
<p>This is important, because it remains characteristic through the centuries. On the one hand, there were writers strictly in the tradition of a region (like towns, countries etc.), language or culture, on the other hand there was a continuous influence on each others writing and thinking.</p>
<p>The multi-ethnic <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austro-Hungarian_Empire_f989.html" title="Austro-Hungarian Empire">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a> should therefore not be reduced to the German parts of the empire. There were large ethnic or religious minorities in nearly all regional capitals, like <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a> or <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> - microcosmoses with their own traditions and characteristics.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Kafka_d4e6.html" title="Franz Kafka">Franz Kafka</a> may be a good example: while in some of his writings he was declaring himself to be "German" this was meant more in relation to the ethnic minority living in Prague than as a declaration for another part of the empire. The official language in the school Franz went to was German, in private he spoke Czech, most of his works were written in German while private letters, like the ones to his lover Milena Jesenská were written in Czech. So perhaps he was a "German-speaking-secular-Jewish-born-in-Prague-Austro-Hungarian-Austro-Czech writer" - a term which best shows the difficulties that are to be faced.</p>
<p>Besides the national differences between the provinces, there were also different regions which influenced the writing style. There were Alps with their distinctive traditions, the deep woods, the coastal regions around Trieste (now Italy and Slovenia) and the Croatian islands, which served as the Austro-Hungarian equivalent to the French Cote d'Azur, a centre for writers, painters and other artists.</p>

<p>Before and during the early Middle Ages poetry was spread verbally most of the time. Out of this reason it has been lost nearly completely. The texts conserved are limited to the scripts in monasteries.<br />
Materials were expensive and their production difficult. Therefore nearly only works of value - and that often meant religious texts - were written down. In addition most texts were also translated into latin before the were put down (e.g. Germanic tribal laws).<br />
Different sources however suggest that there also existed aristocratic historical records (like Heldenlieder), lyric folklore (dance, love songs, spells). Only by accident individual texts were preserved in monasteries. Examples for this are the "Merseburger Zaubersprüche", two Germanic spells being the only written proofs for pagan religion in the German speaking lands. The "Hildebrandslied" is important as voucher of Germanic hero literature.</p>
<p>The first German texts were written to translate Latin religious books around <a href="../../../7/5/0/750.html" title="750">750</a> in the early <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictine.html" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> communities in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melk.html" title="Melk">Melk</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salzburg.html" title="Salzburg">Salzburg</a> were carrying on notable literary and religious activities. <a href="../../../a/v/a/Ava_%28poet%29.html" title="Ava (poet)">Ava</a> (1060-1127), who was the first known female writing in German, wrote in this religiously inspired tradition and lived in the territories which were then and now within borders of Austria.</p>

<p>With the crusades around <a href="../../../1/1/6/1160.html" title="1160">1160</a>, the knights became more important and prosperous. The oral <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesang.html" title="Minnesang">minnesang</a> was a new form, dealing with their live. The topics of the ballads were also more worldly with themes ranging from love and war to political criticism. There was a lot of travelling along the Danube river, with travelling bards (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnes%C3%A4nger.html" title="Minnesänger">Minnesänger</a>) bringing news and new songs. The towns were getting rich and independent. The first representants of this movement and first known male writers in German were <a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_von_K%C3%BCrenberg_0a49.html" title="Der von Kürenberg">Der von Kürenberg</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dietmar_von_Aist_e837.html" title="Dietmar von Aist">Dietmar von Aist</a> (12th century). At the end of 12th century one of the most important literary works of the times, <a href="../../../n/i/b/Nibelungenlied.html" title="Nibelungenlied">Nibelungenlied</a>, emerged. It was created by an unknown minnesang poet most probably in the territories of Austria. As the tradition of minnesang grew, the older poets started teaching younger ones. For example probably the most known German bard <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walther_von_der_Vogelweide_224f.html" title="Walther von der Vogelweide">Walther von der Vogelweide</a> (13ht century) learnt his craft from <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reinmar_von_Hagenau_e3d8.html" title="Reinmar von Hagenau">Reinmar von Hagenau</a> at the court in Vienna. Among other known minnesang poets are <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neidhart.html" title="Neidhart">Neidhart</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jans_der_Enikel_0af1.html" title="Jans der Enikel">Jans der Enikel</a>, <a href="../../../u/l/r/Ulrich_von_Liechtenstein_029a.html" title="Ulrich von Liechtenstein">Ulrich von Liechtenstein</a>, and <a href="../../../o/s/w/Oswald_von_Wolkenstein_4f4f.html" title="Oswald von Wolkenstein">Oswald von Wolkenstein</a>.</p>
<p>In the 12th century, <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a> was also developing. Seifried Helbling was an example of a writer who wrote texts of this type.</p>
<p>Later on the minnesang, that was cultivated by knights, became a craft practised by burghers – <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meistersinger.html" title="Meistersinger">meistersingers</a>. Its centre was more to the west, in <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg.html" title="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>. Michael Beheim was a meistersinger poet strongly connected with the court in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>. Yet another form that developed at that time was <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drama.html" title="Drama">drama</a>. Especially, presentations of <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passion_%28Christianity%29_76ef.html" title="Passion (Christianity)">Passion</a> were regularly played. <i>Das Wiener Passionsspiel</i> is worth mentioning here.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_literature.html" title="Edit section: Renaissance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Renaissance</span></h3>
<p>Around 1600, the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanism.html" title="Humanism">humanism</a>, with his rediscovery of the ancient cultures and ideals spread from <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> throughout Europe. Emperor <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximilian_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_e28f.html" title="Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor">Maximilian I</a> was a big supporter of this movement. He managed to gather around his court in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> humanists such as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conrad_Celtes_317e.html" title="Conrad Celtes">Conrad Celtes</a> – the founder of <i>Collegium Poetarum</i> or in the later time <i>poet laureat</i> <a href="../../../v/a/d/Vadian.html" title="Vadian">Vadian</a> (Joachim von Watt) who wrote in Latin. Eleonore of Austria translated to German a widely read French adventure novel <i>Pontus et la belle Sidonie</i>. Big figures of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> of that time <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_of_Cusa_8167.html" title="Nicholas of Cusa">Nicholas of Cusa</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrus_Canisius_2799.html" title="Petrus Canisius">Petrus Canisius</a> were connected with Austrian court and a few of their works wrote in German.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_literature.html" title="Edit section: Baroque">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Baroque</span></h3>
<p>The 30 year war gripped Europe the and the writers reacted: while some of them dealt with the gruel situation or turned to God, others wrote about a beautiful and peaceful world readers could flee to. The humorous stories (Schelmenromane) brought smiles to the suffering people. <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_a_Sancta_Clara_8045.html" title="Abraham a Sancta Clara">Abraham a Sancta Clara</a> (around 1650) wrote religious and comical works. Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg (around 1650) wrote religious poems at that time.</p>
<p>As a reaction to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">protestant</a> movements of Renaissance, many catholic schools emerged on the territories of Austria. These colleges lead by the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit_order.html" title="Jesuit order">Jesuit order</a> developed plays and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">operas</a> that were based on Italian style and impressed most by their luxurious equipment. Sermon was an important genre of the catholic literature of baroque. The mentioned above Benedictine monk Abraham a Sancta Clara was a notable preacher of the times. A jesuit, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Scherer_3fa5.html" title="Georg Scherer">Georg Scherer</a>, is another example of a monk the sermons of whom were published and had a wider audience.</p>
<p>Another literaric form were improvised plays called "Hanswurstspiele". This direction was represented by Josef Anton Stranitzky, Gottfried Prehauser, Joachim Perinet and Josef Felix von Kurz-Bernardon.</p>
<p>Examples of baroque epic are the knight novels and "Schelmenromane" of Johann Beer, which represent a realistic description of the reality at that time.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_literature.html" title="Edit section: Enlightenment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Enlightenment</span></h3>
<p>With the start of <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Enlightenment_2fd3.html" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> around <a href="../../../1/7/2/1720.html" title="1720">1720</a>, philosophy and the need of literature to educate the reader (Lehrdichtung, Bildungsroman) were two new and strong motivations for literature.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and his school of thinking was revived. These ideas developed on the territories of Austria during the rule of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Theresa_of_Austria_c27a.html" title="Maria Theresa of Austria">Maria Theresa</a> and her son <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_44e5.html" title="Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor">Joseph II</a>. Around <a href="../../../1/7/9/1790.html" title="1790">1790</a> the ideas of Enlightenment were firmly rooted and the ancient classic cultures (Greek and Roman) were the inspiration for poets, artists, architects and writers. Harmony and Beauty were some of the ideals of that time.</p>
<p>The Austrian literature also was under the strong influence of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> and strongly connected with the criticism towards clergy. All these circumstences caused that the litarature started to be more educative and instructional. The satire started to be one of the most frequently used literary genres.</p>
<p>The literary life of Enlightenment concentrated around an <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almanac.html" title="Almanac">almanac</a> <i>Wienerischer Musen-Almanach</i>. It was started in <a href="../../../1/7/7/1777.html" title="1777">1777</a> (from <a href="../../../1/7/8/1786.html" title="1786">1786</a> under a changed title <i>Wiener Musen-Almanach</i>) by Joseph Franz von Ratschky and Gottlieb von Leon. Aloys Blumauer was also its editor since <a href="../../../1/7/8/1781.html" title="1781">1781</a> (he even edited a few editions alone).<br />
A notable place in the Austrian literature of this period has Johann Baptist von Alxinger who wrote <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chivalry.html" title="Chivalry">chivalric</a> <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_poetry.html" title="Epic poetry">epics</a> <i>Doolin von Maynz</i> (<a href="../../../1/7/8/1787.html" title="1787">1787</a>) and <i>Bliomberis</i> (<a href="../../../1/7/9/1791.html" title="1791">1791</a>) which were inspired by the tradition of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a>. Alxinger also wrote poetry based on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-clericalism.html" title="Anti-clericalism">anticlerical</a> ideas.<br />
The writings of a might-have-been monk Johann Pezzl also had a profile of this kind. He wrote journalistic and epic texts.<br />
Classical vision of poetry promoted by Joseph Schreyvogel strongly influenced later authors (for instance <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Grillparzer_adac.html" title="Franz Grillparzer">Franz Grillparzer</a>). Schreyvogel improved considerably the quality of the Austrian theatre. He was a dramatic adviser at the Wiener Burgtheater from 1814-32.<br />
Another important dramatist was Johann Nepomuk von Kalchberg, but historical themes of his dramas give his work the flavour of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanticism.html" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>.</p>

<p>Around 1790 these ideas were firmly rooted and the ancient classic cultures (Greek and Roman) were the inspiration for poets, artists, architects and writers. Harmony and Beauty were some of the ideals of that time. There was a lot of philosophical and aesthetic writing which accumulated in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanticism.html" title="Romanticism">Romantic</a> era around 1820 (mostly writers from the nobility). With the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> going on, a lot of people wanted literature which took them away in a fantasy world. A lot of religious writing was also providing people with new hope.

<p><b>Biedermeier</b> refers to work in the fields of literature, music, the visual arts and interior design in the period between the years <a href="../../../1/8/1/1815.html" title="1815">1815</a> (Vienna Congress), the end of the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, and <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a>, the year of the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutions_of_1848.html" title="Revolutions of 1848">European revolutions</a> and contrasts with the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanticism.html" title="Romanticism">Romantic</a> era which preceded it.</p>
<p>Biedermeier can be identified with two trends in early nineteenth-century German history.</p>
<p>The first trend is growing urbanization and industrialization leading to a new urban middle class. The early <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lied.html" title="Lied">Lieder</a> of Schubert, which were performable at the piano without substantial musical training, serve as examples. Further, Biedermeier writers were mainly middle-class, as opposed to the Romantics, who were mainly drawn from the nobility.</p>
<p>The second trend is the growing political oppression following the end of the Napoleonic Wars prompting people to concentrate on the domestic and (at least in public) the non-political. The strict publication rules and the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a> had the consequence, that the main topics written about were unpolitical, eg Historical Fiction or Books about the quiet life in the countryside. This does not mean that there was not a lot of political discussion going on, but it happened at home and in the presence of close friends. This explosive situation finally lead to the revolutions in Europe in the year <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a>.</p>
<p>Poets of that time in Austria-Hungary were <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolaus_Lenau_3c53.html" title="Nikolaus Lenau">Nikolaus Lenau</a> (1802-1850) or the poems of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adalbert_Stifter_6e5a.html" title="Adalbert Stifter">Adalbert Stifter</a> und <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Grillparzer_adac.html" title="Franz Grillparzer">Franz Grillparzer</a>.</p>
<p>Writers of that time were <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annette_von_Droste-H%C3%BClshoff_fb70.html" title="Annette von Droste-Hülshoff">Annette von Droste-Hülshoff</a> (1797-1848) ("<a href="../../../d/i/e/Die_Judenbuche_aaa8.html" title="Die Judenbuche">Die Judenbuche</a>"), who wrote some of their works at the lake "Bodensee" in the three country triangle Austria, Switzerland and Germany or <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adalbert_Stifter_6e5a.html" title="Adalbert Stifter">Adalbert Stifter</a> (1805-1868) in Austria.</p>
<p>Play-writers at that time were <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Grillparzer_adac.html" title="Franz Grillparzer">Franz Grillparzer</a> (1791-1872), <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Halm_688f.html" title="Friedrich Halm">Friedrich Halm</a> (1806-1871), also an accomplished writer of "Novellen" (novellas / short stories), <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Nestroy_2181.html" title="Johann Nestroy">Johann Nepomuk Nestroy</a> (1801-1862) and <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Raimund_5f3a.html" title="Ferdinand Raimund">Ferdinand Raimund</a> (1790-1836). Grillparzer wrote tragedies in the tradition of the "Weimarer Klassik", Nestroy and Raimund were representatives for the "<a href="../../../w/i/e/Wien.html" title="Wien">Wiener</a> Volksstück" mainly played at the vienese theater "<a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkstheater_Wien_8349.html" title="Volkstheater Wien">Volkstheater Wien</a>".</p>
<p>The end of biedermeier is marked by the writings of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adalbert_Stifter_6e5a.html" title="Adalbert Stifter">Adalbert Stifter</a>. His first work <i>Nachsommer</i> was published in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1857.html" title="1857">1857</a>, but was still believed to be on of the finest works of biedermeier. Stifter not only influenced <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Rosegger_3a28.html" title="Peter Rosegger">Rosegger</a> or <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Ganghofer_3121.html" title="Ludwig Ganghofer">Ganghofer</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Heyse_68da.html" title="Paul Heyse">Heyse</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustav_Freytag_e5a5.html" title="Gustav Freytag">Freytag</a> and Wildenbruch, but also later writers (the time of "Bürgerlichen Realismus") like <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodor_Storm_06fd.html" title="Theodor Storm">Storm</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodor_Fontane_78e9.html" title="Theodor Fontane">Fontane</a> and through them <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Mann_7f52.html" title="Thomas Mann">Thomas Mann</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_Hesse_69e1.html" title="Hermann Hesse">Hesse</a>.</p>
