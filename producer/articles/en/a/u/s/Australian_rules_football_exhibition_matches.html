<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football_exhibition_matches.html" title="Edit section: International expansion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">International expansion</span></h2>
<p>After the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Football_League_a3a4.html" title="Victorian Football League">Victorian Football League</a>, realising that finding new markets were essential to the prosperity of the competition began to belatedly pursue a series of international exhibition matches to raise the profile of the game overseas.</p>
<p>The longest and most persistent of these was <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, which was seen as an opportunity primarily due to the high number of ex-patriate Australians living there, and the availability of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> grounds.</p>
<p>Serious efforts to grow the game were not realised until the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. Games played in this decade began to spawn infant leagues in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> named the "Aussie Bowl", the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, which have been represented at the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_International_Cup_edd9.html" title="Australian Football International Cup">Australian Football International Cup</a> since 2002.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, regular exhibition matches became part of the growth strategy of the renamed <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Australian Football League</a>, which began to realise that the effects of globalisation would threaten the future of the sport in the face of world sports like <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a>. The focus of the AFL in this decade was <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>.</p>

The event has been annual as the "AFL Challenge Trophy" since 2002 and although it has not always been annual event, a small amount of interest in the games has grown amongst locals.</p>
<p>Since sell-out game in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> in early 2006, club officials of the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Swans_645f.html" title="Sydney Swans">Sydney Swans</a> have called for regular games (similar to the London matches) including the possibility of a premiership match.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Australian_Football_League_7e37.html" title="West Australian Football League">WAFL</a> has also announced intentions to play an exhibition match in <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> in late 2006 between the grand finalists. <a href="http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php?story=20050914204500829&amp;query=mumbai" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php?story=20050914204500829&amp;query=mumbai" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>Australian rules football was introduced early in the 1880s to most of the states of Australia through a series of exhibition matches.</p>
<p>Leagues quickly formed in all states, and in many of these states, the code has become the most popular sport.</p>
<p>Although drawing significant crowds and interest early, the states of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> elected at official level to adopt the <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_football.html" title="Rugby football">rugby</a> codes in 1908. This was widely recognised as being due to the game's association with the tag "Melbourne Rules" or "Victorian Rules" and the fierce rivalry that <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> has with <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. With a lack of players, and grounds, support for Australian rules football decreased dramatically.</p>
<p>Support in these states has since grown in recent years, with "Australian Rules" gaining the status of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_sport.html" title="National sport">national sport</a> and local clubs established in the national competition in both Queensland and New South Wales during 1980s. Although the game is followed by the majority of the Australian population and states, there are still many in New South Wales (the most populous state) that associate the game with Melbourne or "the game they play in Victoria". For other states without teams in the national competition, the AFL has tried to maintain participation through regular exhibition games.</p>

<p>With no team in the national competition, and heavy competition with <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a>, the VFL/AFL has maintained a strong following in the Northern Territory through exhibition matches. Like the Kangaroos in Canberra, the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Bulldogs_899a.html" title="Western Bulldogs">Western Bulldogs</a> have recently expermented with <i>home</i> games in Darwin at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marrara_Oval_58b7.html" title="Marrara Oval">Marrara Oval</a>. Other exhibition matches have included the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aboriginal_All-Stars_a047.html" title="Aboriginal All-Stars">Aboriginal All-Stars</a> in pre-season practice matches against various AFL clubs. The games at Marrara have averaged about 10,000 spectators, with a record of 17,500 witnessing the Aboriginal All-Stars vs Carlton match in 2002. <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Springs_00f0.html" title="Alice Springs">Alice Springs</a> has also hosted pre-season matches. In 2004, an AFL pre-season Regional Challenge match between <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collingwood_Football_Club_b05a.html" title="Collingwood Football Club">Collingwood Football Club</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club_3729.html" title="Port Adelaide Football Club">Port Adelaide Football Club</a> at <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traeger_Park_8722.html" title="Traeger Park">Traeger Park</a> attracted a sell-out crowd of 10,000.</p>

<p>Australian rules football is very popular in <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, however there is no team in the national competition due to lack of corporate spornsorship. The population is sparsely spread and possibly not able to support an AFL team despite several bids and backing of the Tasmanian government. The <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmanian_Devils_c1a4.html" title="Tasmanian Devils">Tasmanian Devils</a> were recently created to participate in the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Football_League_a3a4.html" title="Victorian Football League">Victorian Football League</a> and has a large following, but has not quelled the desire for elite matches. As a result, many exhibition matches have been played in Tasmania.</p>
<p>The first VFL match was played on the 14th of June 1952 at <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Hobart_Oval_1f0a.html" title="North Hobart Oval">North Hobart Oval</a> between Fitzroy and Melbourne before 18,387 fans.</p>
<p>Since 2001, both <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawthorn_Football_Club_2b9f.html" title="Hawthorn Football Club">Hawthorn</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Kilda_Football_Club_4bfa.html" title="St Kilda Football Club">St Kilda</a> have played AFL <i>home</i> games at <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurora_Stadium_6376.html" title="Aurora Stadium">Aurora Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../l/a/u/Launceston%2C_Tasmania_4d2f.html" title="Launceston, Tasmania">Launceston, Tasmania</a>. Average crowds of around 15,000 have attended these games, with a record of 18,112 witnessing Hawthorn vs Port Adelaide in 2002.</p>
