<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Talk%7EAustralian_Broadcasting_Corporation_Rewrite_6387.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The ABC started in 1932 as a collection of 12 radio stations operating as the Australian Broadcasting Commission, modelled on the BBC. Over the next four years, these largely isolated stations were gradually brought together into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays, coordinated by a centralised bureacracy. During its first decades, the programming schedules included music, news and current affairs, sport, drama, children's programs, and school broadcasts. Because recording technology was relatively primitive, most programs were broadcast live, including music. For this purpose, the ABC established broadcasting orchestras in each state, and in some centres employed choruses and dance bands.</p>
<p>During the Second World War, the ABC continued to recruit staff, including a greater proportion of women. The organisation established reporting and recording facilities in numerous overseas locations, including the Middle East, Greece and the Asia-Pacific region. During the war, the ABC's news bulletins attained a reputation for authority and independence, and from 1942 onwards, were broadcast three times daily through all national and most commercial transmitters. The ABC's ability to speak to all Australians across a huge, sparsely populated country, was now recognised as an essential part of the nation's infrastructure. During and after the war, the ABC was given statutory powers that reinforced its independence from the government and enhanced its news gathering role. From 1946, the ABC was required to broadcast selected parliamentary sessions live, despite the disruption this caused to regular programming.</p>
<p>During the 1950s, the variety and quantity of programming increased significantly, including light entertainment, sports coverage, talk programs, and features—early forms of what became know as radio documentaries. The ABC's coverage of rural affairs was significantly enhanced by the deployment of journalists and broadcasters in major country areas. The increasing availability of landlines and teleprinters allowed the organisation to gather and broadcast news and other program material with much greater efficiency than in the previous two decades. By the 1950s, as many as 13 national news bulletins were broadcast daily.</p>
<p>In 1953, the federal Television Act was passed, providing the initial regulatory framework for both ABC and commercial television networks. In late 1956, the ABC started regular television broadcasts from Sydney and Melbourne, just in time to cover the Summer Olympic Games in Melbourne. Within a year, ABC-TV was broadcasting from each of the six state capitals. Over its first decade, the network developed a wide range of programming that included news bulletins, light entertainment, children's and educational programs, and the performing arts. By the early 60s, videotape equipment was used in all of the ABC's major centres, and during that decade, direct television relays were laid, first from Melbourne and Sydney, and Canberra and Sydney, then between all major centres except for Perth and Hobart; by 1972, all State capitals were linked, allowing simultaneous viewing and national programming. In 1975, colour television was introduced in Australia.</p>
<p>The authority and influence of the ABC have been most strongly felt in news and current affairs, in which the organisation's innovations have set the standard for Australian broadcasting. In 1961, ABC-TV started a weekly current affairs program <i>Four corners</i>, which was characterised by a new, vigorous investigative reporting style of political and social issues that were occasionally ahead of public opinion. Six year later, the weeknight television current affairs program, <i>This day tonight</i>, and its counterpart on radio, <i>PM</i>, were introduced. Many people regard these programs, and others like them, to be essential parts of Australian public life, in which politicians and other public figures and organisations are subject to rigorous interviewing and reportage that aims to be balanced. The ABC also focused on producing radio and television talk programs that explore a wide range of national and international issues. Prominent among these is <i>The Science Show</i>, which started in 1975 on ABC Radio. In 1975, colour television was introduced in Australia, and within a decade, the ABC had moved into satellie broadcasting, greatly enhancing its ability to serve as a national broadcaster.</p>

<p>In 1975, the ABC introduced a 24 hour-a-day rock station in Sydney, which was eventually broadcast nationally as the <i>Triple-J</i> network. A year later, a national classical music network was established on the FM band, broadcasting from Adelaide. Radio Australia continued to thrive as a voice of authority in the Asia-Pacific region. In 1983, the organisation was changed from 'Commission' to 'Corporation' with the passing of a new ABC Act by federal parliament. The ABC underwent significant restructuring during the 1980s,</p>
<p>The ABC also focused on producing radio and television documentaries exploring a wide range of social and political issues. Prominent among these were the weekly radio programs <i>The science show</i> and <i>Coming out ready or not</i>, dealing with women's issues; both started in 1975. During the 1980s, program production in indigeous affairs, comedy, social history and current affairs was significantly expanded. During the 1980s, there was considerable pressure on the organisation to increase its production of Australian drama, which trebled from 1986–91 with the assistance of coproduction, cofinancing, and pre-sales arrangements. Since this time, ABC dramas have explored numerous themes related to the unique aspects of the Australian experience; these themes have not been covered by commercial and foreign producers to the same extent, and thus the ABC has played an important role in the evolution of Australia's national identity.</p>
<p>The ABC continued to be active in Australia's music world, chiefly through its six state-based symphony orchestras. The organisation managed an active concert schedule, both orchestral concerts and recitals, in the six state capitals, and coordinated the deployment of the world's prominent soloists in these schedules. However, during the 1980s, there was increasing pressure for the orchestras to be divested; this occurred in&#160;?1990 with the formation of Symphony Australia, an umbrella organisation that coordinated the now independent state-based orchestras.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, the ABC set in motion plans to consolidate its disorganised arrangement of property and buildings in Sydney and Melbourne into single sites in each city. In Sydney, the radio and orchestral operations moved to a single site in Sydney's inner-city suburb of Ultimo in 1991, joined by ABC-TV operations in&#160;?2002. In Melbourne, the ABC Southbank Centre was finished in 1994, and now houses the radio division in Victoria and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The 1990s saw the expansion of the ABC's network of ABC shops, which sell a wide range of program-related merchandise, including books, CDs and DVDs. During the same decade, ABC online was established as a valuable adjunct to the organisation's broadcasting endeavours. It is now possible for anyone in the world to access a huge amount of information, including transcripts and audio and video streams of many programs, on the net. By the early 1990s, all major ABC broadcasting outlets moved to 24 hour-a-day operation, and regional radio coverage in Australia was extended with 80 new transmitters. Live television broadcasts of selected parliamentary sessions started in&#160;?1995, and ABC NewsRadio, a continuous news network when parliament is not sitting, was launched in&#160;?1996. Australia Television International was established as an authoritative, popular, non-commercial resource in east Asia, and Radio Australia increased its international reach. In 1995, D-Cart digital technology developed by ABC Radio, excited worldwide interest and was sold to European, North American and Asian markets. The ABC used D-Radio, the first fully digital audio system for the first time, broadcasting on Triple J. In the first decade of the new century, the ABC has continued its process of computerising and digitising production, post-production and transmission.</p>

<p>TEMPORARY FLOATING TEXT Despite government funding, the ABC is largely independent.</p>
<p>The name was changed to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1983 with the passage of the <i>Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983.</i></p>
<p>The ABC is run by a government-appointed board, but programming and editorial decisions are made at arm's length from the government of the day.</p>
<p>Like the relationship between the BBC and the UK government, there is often tension in the relationship between the ABC and the federal parliament. The political balance of the ABC's news and current affairs coverage is often debated, in particular, by some members of the political right who claim that the coverage favours the left. Ironically, many of the ABC's political antagonists are keen members of its audience, possibly as a result of its relatively authoritative investigative journalism, lack of commercially-driven bias, and serious programming in comparison to its commercial counterparts.</p>

<p>The ABC operates a single nationwide TV channel, <b>ABC TV</b>. Each state and territory has a slightly different version of ABC TV. The differences between these are small, consisting of a nightly news program, a weekly current affairs program, a weekly sports program during winter, state election specials and the very rare other program. These regional versions are listed below with the name of their main transmitter.</p>

<p>ABC TV broadcasts a wide range of content, to match the broad social makeup of Australia.

It screens prodominantly repeated ABC news and current affairs programs, compilations of ABC news bulletin stories with some additional reporting, children's programming, music documentaries and state football.</p>

<p>In the early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> the ABC was part of a consortium that owned the subscription TV rights to a lot of popular foreign programming, including that of <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickelodeon_%28TV_Channel%29_eeaa.html" title="Nickelodeon (TV Channel)">Nickelodeon</a>. It was also going to launch a commercial news channel in conjunction with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Fairfax_Holdings_dbd9.html" title="John Fairfax Holdings">Fairfax</a> and a Canadian cable company. However, these plans all fell apart before anything substantial came of them. At least one interview filmed for the news channel was eventually aired on ABC TV.</p>
