<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_in_South_Africa%2C_5th_ODI%2C_2006_88e8.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>For some years, there had been an intense rivalry between the two teams in One-Day Internationals, dating from the semi-final of the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_Cricket_World_Cup_b5ca.html" title="1999 Cricket World Cup">1999 Cricket World Cup</a>, where South Africa could only tie against Australia in a match they needed to win to progress to the final. Some followers of cricket considered that to be the greatest game of all time <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. Earlier in the 2005–06 season, South Africa had toured Australia, where they had failed to reach the final of the three-team <a href="../../../v/b/_/VB_Series_2005-06_2c75.html" title="VB Series 2005-06">one-day series</a>, including losing three of their four matches against Australia. They had also lost the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_cricket_team_in_Australia_in_2005-06_983a.html" title="South African cricket team in Australia in 2005-06">three Test series</a> 2-0. It was also of constant irritation to the South Africans that the Australians were referring to them as 'chokers'.</p>
<p>This match was the final match of a <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_cricket_team_in_South_Africa_in_2005-06_8c4b.html" title="Australian cricket team in South Africa in 2005-06">five match series</a> in South Africa. South Africa had won the first two matches comfortably, but Australia had fought back to win the next two, making this match the deciding match. Australia had to play the series without their best one-day bowler, <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_McGrath_73db.html" title="Glenn McGrath">Glenn McGrath</a>, whose wife was suffering from cancer. The South African team also missed their best one-day bowler, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaun_Pollock_ee9e.html" title="Shaun Pollock">Shaun Pollock</a> in the final match due to a back strain. The absence of these two bowlers who possess two of the best <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_statistics.html#Bowling_statistics" title="Cricket statistics">economy rates</a> in one-day cricket may arguably have contributed to the large number of runs scored in the match.</p>
<p><a name="The_Match" id="The_Match"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_in_South_Africa%2C_5th_ODI%2C_2006_88e8.html" title="Edit section: The Match">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Match</span></h2>
<p>The Australian captain chose to bat after winning the toss. <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Gilchrist_ed25.html" title="Adam Gilchrist">Adam Gilchrist</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Katich_f7f4.html" title="Simon Katich">Simon Katich</a> got the side off to a good start, both scoring fifties. A great catch by <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Hall_220b.html" title="Andrew Hall">Andrew Hall</a> diving to his left removed Gilchrist in the 16th over, while the partnership was on 97. Ponting then scored one of the greatest innings ever seen at the Wanderers ground, his highest score. He reached 100 off 73 balls, his fastest century, and then got to 164 from 105, including 9 sixes and 13 fours. He was finally dismissed after his drive shot was caught by <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeta_Dippenaar_0a4b.html" title="Boeta Dippenaar">Boeta Dippenaar</a> in the 48th over. A promoted <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Hussey_d262.html" title="Michael Hussey">Michael Hussey</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Symonds_3d27.html" title="Andrew Symonds">Andrew Symonds</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Lee_9c83.html" title="Brett Lee">Brett Lee</a> helped the side past the world record and to become the first side to ever score 400 runs in a One-Day International. Ponting and Katich put on 139 runs for the second wicket, before Katich was caught at <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_man.html" title="Third man">third man</a> by <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Telemachus_36a5.html" title="Roger Telemachus">Roger Telemachus</a> after a delivery by <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makhaya_Ntini_7153.html" title="Makhaya Ntini">Makhaya Ntini</a>. By the end of the innings, South Africa were under pressure with Telemachus beginning the 49th over with four no-balls. Australia made 40 runs off its last two overs. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> News sites were already reporting how Australia had smashed the world record before the game had finished. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the series at two all, South Africa went out batting, giving it their all, requiring 8.7 an over from the start. The early loss of Dippenaar for 1 probably helped the cause, as Dippenaar was not seen as a batsman who could score quickly. <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herschelle_Gibbs_28c7.html" title="Herschelle Gibbs">Herschelle Gibbs</a>, batting at number 3, played what is surely one of the greatest One-Day International innings ever seen. Gibbs reached his 16th ODI hundred in 79 balls, beating his own South African record for the fastest scoring of a hundred that had previously been off 84 balls against Zimbabwe. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> Gibbs scored the second highest total by a South African with 175 off 111 balls. He and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graeme_Smith_527f.html" title="Graeme Smith">Graeme Smith</a> had a 187 run partnership, bringing the South Africans back into the game. When Smith was out for 90, Gibbs shared another strong partnership, this time with <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_de_Villiers_84a9.html" title="Abraham de Villiers">AB de Villiers</a>. Australia kept the pressure on after Gibbs' dismissal with consistent wickets, but big hitting by <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_van_der_Wath_0c15.html" title="Johannes van der Wath">Johannes van der Wath</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Boucher_d170.html" title="Mark Boucher">Mark Boucher</a> kept the Proteas in the hunt. Nathan Bracken, in contrasting fashion to the rest of the match, bowled particularly well collecting 5 wickets and keeping his economy a respectable 6.7. By the final over of the match, South Africa needed 7 off 6, with Boucher on strike. He pushed a single, giving the strike to <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Hall_220b.html" title="Andrew Hall">Andrew Hall</a> who hit a four away, leaving 2 required off four balls. However he was out caught attempting to repeat the shot, leaving the side at 433-9. Ntini, the number 11 batsman, managed to get the bowler, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Lee_9c83.html" title="Brett Lee">Brett Lee</a>, away for a single to third man and tie the scores. Boucher then hit a four the next ball (getting his 19th fifty in ODI cricket), with commentator <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Greig_4c6a.html" title="Tony Greig">Tony Greig</a> exclaiming "one of the great one day matches of all time".</p>
<p>Both Ponting and Gibbs were awarded the Man of the Match, but Ponting declined it, saying that it belonged to Gibbs. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaun_Pollock_ee9e.html" title="Shaun Pollock">Shaun Pollock</a> was named Man of the Series, although he was resting for a back injury during this game.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_in_South_Africa%2C_5th_ODI%2C_2006_88e8.html" title="Edit section: Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
<p>According to Neil Manthorp of the South African website SuperCricket <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup>, the game was also notable for a number of eerily precise prognostications advanced by members of the South African team:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the team had reassembled in the changing room during the lunch break, South African vice-captain Jacques Kallis is reported to have said, ostensibly in jest: "It's a 450 wicket, guys...they're about 15 short!"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Herschelle Gibbs, who scored a remarkable innings of 175, told journalists later that he had woken up feeling "different" and that he knew it was going to be a special day for him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Following the dismissal of Graeme Smith and with South Africa on 190-2, the injured Shaun Pollock turned to Makhaya Ntini and said - for no apparent reason: "George, you are going to hit the winning four. You're going to be there at the end." Ntini didn't hit the winning four, but did hit the tying single and was very much there at the end as he watched Boucher hit the winning four from the other end.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With Herscelle Gibbs out for 175 and South Africa at 299-4, Ashwell Prince is reported to have suddenly exclaimed: "Oh my God, we're going to win this by one wicket!"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>While the Australian innings was progressing, South African commentator and former Proteas allrounder <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Symcox_6f51.html" title="Pat Symcox">Pat Symcox</a> commented that they would see the first 400 total scored in a match.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Radio sport commentator and former Springbok cricketer Hylton Ackermann burst into tears at the end of the game when South Africa won and he was still on air.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An Australian punter placed a bet of AU$20,000 on Australia to win during the innings break at the odds of $1.01. He therefore stood to win only $200. <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>The huge score has led <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Waugh_54d6.html" title="Steve Waugh">Steve Waugh</a> to say that 500 in an innings is the next possibility. Others have said that that scores like this are bad for the sport, with <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Richards_00d8.html" title="Barry Richards">Barry Richards</a> saying <i>There is such a propensity for hitting boundaries that bowlers have been taken out of game</i>. This was said despite <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathan_Bracken_403a.html" title="Nathan Bracken">Nathan Bracken</a> picking up career best bowling figures.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricinfo.html" title="Cricinfo">Cricinfo</a>'s headline for the match was <i>South Africa win the greatest game</i>, while the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Morning_Herald_ca72.html" title="Sydney Morning Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a> called the match <i>The greatest the world has seen</i> <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup>; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Advertiser_9a22.html" title="The Advertiser">The Advertiser</a> called it the <i>Greatest of all time</i> <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup>; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a> <i>The best one dayer</i> <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup>; iafrica called it <i>The greatest match ever</i> <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup>; iol <i>the greatest match ever played.</i> <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
