<p>The <b><a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Riot_of_1879_d3ac.html" title="Sydney Riot of 1879">Sydney Riot of 1879</a></b> was one of the earliest <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot.html" title="Riot">riots</a> at an international <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> match. It occurred at the Association Ground, Moore Park now known as the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Cricket_Ground_b665.html" title="Sydney Cricket Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a>. The game was between a touring <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_cricket_team.html" title="English cricket team">English</a> team captained by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Harris%2C_4th_Baron_Harris_bdbb.html" title="Robert Harris, 4th Baron Harris">Lord Harris</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Cricket_Association_dc4b.html" title="New South Wales Cricket Association">New South Wales Cricket Association</a> led by <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Gregory_%28cricketer%29_de09.html" title="Dave Gregory (cricketer)">Dave Gregory</a>. The riot was sparked off by a controversial umpiring decision, when Australian star batsman <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Murdoch_f2c4.html" title="Billy Murdoch">Billy Murdoch</a> was controversially <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dismissal_%28cricket%29.html" title="Dismissal (cricket)">given out</a> by umpire <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Coulthard_f1e8.html" title="George Coulthard">George Coulthard</a> (pictured). It was alleged that betting men in the New South Wales pavilion encouraged Gregory to make a stand and disrupt the game. The immediate aftermath of the riot saw the England team cancel the remaining games due to be played in Sydney. There was also much comment in both the local and English press. Later a letter from Lord Harris about the incident was printed in the English newspapers, and caused a new outrage in New South Wales when it was later printed in the colonial press. The New South Wales Cricket Association then volleyed off a reply, which further damaged relations. The riot led to a breakdown of goodwill that threatened the immediate future of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_cricket_team.html" title="English cricket team">England</a>-<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_cricket_team.html" title="Australian cricket team">Australia</a> cricket tours.

It is the sole representative of its <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_%28biology%29.html" title="Family (biology)">family</a> (<i>Ornithorhynchidae</i>) and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genus.html" title="Genus">genus</a> (<i>Ornithorhynchus</i>), though a number of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotreme.html#Fossil_Monotremes" title="Monotreme">fossilised relatives</a> have been found, some of them also in the <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> genus. The platypus is considered to be one of the strangest <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specimen.html" title="Specimen">specimens</a> of the animal kingdom: a <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venom_%28poison%29.html" title="Venom (poison)">venomous</a>, egg-laying, duck-billed mammal.

It was thought that somebody had sewn a duck's beak onto the body of a beaver-like animal. Scientists were also divided over whether the female platypus laid eggs, until this was later confirmed in Australia. Its uniqueness makes it a recognizable symbol of Australia (along with the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroo.html" title="Kangaroo">kangaroo</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/a/Koala.html" title="Koala">koala</a>); the platypus is featured on the <a href="../../../o/b/v/Obverse_and_reverse.html" title="Obverse and reverse">reverse</a> of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_coins.html" title="Australian coins">Australian 20-cent coin</a>.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclone_Tracy_1ccc.html" title="Cyclone Tracy">Cyclone Tracy</a></b> was a <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_cyclone.html" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> that devastated <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin%2C_Northern_Territory_5a73.html" title="Darwin, Northern Territory">Darwin</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, from <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_24.html" title="December 24">December 24</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>. It was recorded by <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a></i> as being a "disaster of the first magnitude...without parallel in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Australia_5246.html" title="History of Australia">Australia's history</a>." It killed 65 people and destroyed over 70 percent of Darwin's buildings, leaving over 20,000 people homeless. Most of Darwin's population was evacuated to <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/y/Whyalla%2C_South_Australia_c008.html" title="Whyalla, South Australia">Whyalla</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Springs_00f0.html" title="Alice Springs">Alice Springs</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, and many never returned to Darwin. The town was subsequently rebuilt with newer materials and techniques. Cyclone Tracy was at least a <a href="../../../s/a/f/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale_3656.html" title="Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale">Category 4 storm</a>, although there is evidence to suggest that it had reached Category 5 when it reached Darwin. Cyclone Tracy, due to its severity, has entered into Australian <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_culture.html" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a> in a way that no other meteorological event had before, or has since. Probably the most famous work that it has inspired is the song by Bill Cate, "Santa Never Made it into Darwin". Composed in 1974 to raise money for the relief and reconstruction effort, the song became so wide-known that in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> the <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hoodoo_Gurus_a75a.html" title="Hoodoo Gurus">Hoodoo Gurus</a> released a song entitled "<a href="../../../h/i/d/Hideki_Tojo_0712.html" title="Hideki Tojo">Tojo</a> Never Made it to Darwin", inspired by Bill Cate's song and about the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> bombing of Darwin in <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_War_bded.html" title="Pacific War">World War II</a>.</p>

The area was first settled in 1839 by Peter Anderson, a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scots</a> migrant, who named it Burnside after his property's location adjacent to Second Creek (in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Gaelic_language_83df.html" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Scots</a>, 'Burn' means creek or stream). The <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnside%2C_South_Australia_f286.html" title="Burnside, South Australia">village of Burnside</a> was established shortly after, and the Burnside Council District was gazetted in 1856, separating itself from the larger East Torrens Council. The mainstays of the early Burnside economy were <a href="../../../v/i/t/Viticulture.html" title="Viticulture">viticulture</a>, mining and olive groves; <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Osmond%2C_South_Australia_881d.html" title="Glen Osmond, South Australia">Glen Osmond</a> boasted substantial mineral deposits, and vineyards were established at <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magill%2C_South_Australia_5f51.html" title="Magill, South Australia">Magill</a>.

With strong growth and development throughout the region, Burnside was then proclaimed a city in 1943. The 1960s brought to Burnside a community library and a swimming centre; both were further expanded and upgraded between 1997 and 2001. Today, Burnside is one of Adelaide's most sought-after regions in which to live.</p>

Many argued that it was a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some claimed not to understand what all the fuss was about. Several laws of cricket were changed to prevent similar tactics being used again.</p>

The game was between a touring <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_cricket_team.html" title="English cricket team">English</a> team captained by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Harris%2C_4th_Baron_Harris_bdbb.html" title="Robert Harris, 4th Baron Harris">Lord Harris</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Cricket_Association_dc4b.html" title="New South Wales Cricket Association">New South Wales Cricket Association</a> led by <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Gregory_%28cricketer%29_de09.html" title="Dave Gregory (cricketer)">Dave Gregory</a>.

It was alleged that betting men in the New South Wales pavilion encouraged Gregory to make a stand and disrupt the game. The immediate aftermath of the riot saw the England team cancel the remaining games due to be played in Sydney. There was also much comment in both the local and English press. Later a letter from Lord Harris about the incident was printed in the English newspapers, and caused a new outrage in New South Wales when it was later printed in the colonial press. The New South Wales Cricket Association then volleyed off a reply, which further damaged relations. The riot led to a breakdown of goodwill that threatened the immediate future of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_cricket_team.html" title="English cricket team">England</a>-<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_cricket_team.html" title="Australian cricket team">Australia</a> cricket tours.

The soft-feathered, brown birds reach up to 2 m in height and weigh up to 45 kg. The Emu is common over most of mainland Australia, although it avoids heavily-populated areas, dense forest and very arid areas.

The issue in the case was whether indefinite immigration detention was lawful, and the court ultimately decided that it was. The court considered two main questions, firstly, whether the <i><a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration_to_Australia_6c98.html" title="Immigration to Australia">Migration Act 1958</a></i> (the legislation which governs immigration in Australia) permitted a person in Al-Kateb's situation to be detained indefinitely, and secondly, if it did, whether that was permissible under the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Australia_c872.html" title="Constitution of Australia">Constitution of Australia</a>.

The area was first settled in 1839 by Peter Anderson, a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scots</a> migrant, who named it Burnside after his property's location adjacent to Second Creek (in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Gaelic_language_83df.html" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Scots</a>, 'Burn' means creek or stream). The <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnside%2C_South_Australia_f286.html" title="Burnside, South Australia">village of Burnside</a> was established shortly after, and the Burnside Council District was gazetted in 1856, separating itself from the larger East Torrens Council. The mainstays of the early Burnside economy were <a href="../../../v/i/t/Viticulture.html" title="Viticulture">viticulture</a>, mining and olive groves; <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Osmond%2C_South_Australia_881d.html" title="Glen Osmond, South Australia">Glen Osmond</a> boasted substantial mineral deposits, and vineyards were established at <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magill%2C_South_Australia_5f51.html" title="Magill, South Australia">Magill</a>.

With strong growth and development throughout the region, Burnside was then proclaimed a city in 1943. The 1960s brought to Burnside a community library and a swimming centre; both were further expanded and upgraded between 1997 and 2001. Today, Burnside is one of Adelaide's most sought-after regions in which to live.</p>
