<h2><span class="mw-headline">The "Penal" Colony of NSW</span></h2>
<p>New South Wales was not (despite the wikipedia article) settled as the "Penal Colony" of NSW, it was then and thereafter known simply as the "Colony" of New South Wales. Early colonial rulers were no doubt averse to the idea that a colony should be pidgeon-holed to such an extent that it affected the colony's status. It's important to recognise that free settlers and British Government officials in NSW played an important role in the early years of European settlement. Therefore, we should use the correct official name of "The Colony of New South Wales" in the article. -AI.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nowhere does the article state "The Penal Colony of New South Wales" was the colony's official name. It states the uncontestable iron-clad fact that New South Wales was settled as <i>a</i> <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penal_colony.html" title="Penal colony">penal colony</a>.

<p>American makes the soccer world cup very often, but on their site they don't claim to be particularly strong. I don't think any other in the world who has only made the soccer world cup 2 times as 'particularly strong'. I think saying that we do makes us look embarassing.</p>

It unites the nation and is a public expression of joy and pride in being Australian. The Australian National Anthem is used at important public ceremonies, sporting and community events. In 1974 ‘Advance Australia Fair’ was adopted as the Australian National Anthem; however in 1976 ‘God Save The Queen’ was reinstated. In 1977 the Australian Electoral Office conducted a poll for the national anthem tune in conjunction with a referendum. The tune ‘Advance Australia Fair’ was the preferred option. In 1981 the National Australia Day Council recommended that the Australian National Anthem consist of two verses of ‘Advance Australia Fair ‘with some modification. In 1984 the Australian National Anthem, consisting of the tune of ‘Advance Australia Fair’ and the verses as drafted by the National Australia Day Council, was proclaimed.</p>

<dd>Having a sub-section is one thing, although as Peta says there are downsides to that. Adding a redundant item to a heading is another matter.

In the Australian context it is definitely not time, and may never be, have you ever heard of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Australian Football League</a>? Some papers are now using "Football" to mean soccer - but you will find that all the Southern papers, i.e. Victorian, South Australian, Western Australian and Tasmanian, i.e. representing half of Australia's population, continue to refer to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_Football_e502.html" title="Association Football">Association Football</a> as soccer (as all of Canada, the USA and New Zealand continues to do). And while Wikipedia continues to contain an article called <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> which (quite rightly) refers to the general meaning of the word, and the meaning most understood by the majority of the English speaking world, then one can only conclude that that time has not yet come. Who knows, there may come a time when crowds at regular soccer games nudge 90,000, when club memberships top 50,000, when crowds at games are split almost 50/50 between males and females, when half of Australia watches the grand final on tele, etc. Although if Australian soccer was true to its roots, there would be no grand final! The top team would simply take all, and we could enjoy dozens of nil all draws in the lead up to the exciting finish to the season (when the champion team had been decided 12 weeks earlier). <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">πίππύ δ'Ω∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 03:54, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Sorry. Read the discussion in the australian soccer page after i was on this page. I didnt realise ppl had such strong feelings about it! I'm in Qld and ppl don't seem to have to much difficulty with "football" meaning "soccer". I guess cos we have traditionally called rugby (league) football and now we have afl and rugby union popular and also called football, so one more doesn't add too much to the confusion already existing over the word. when you say you are going to the footbal on weekend here no one really knows where you're going. aussietiger 02:58, 12 August 2006</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a> is called <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a> because if it wasn't, people would confuse it with <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL_01f4.html" title="AFL">AFL</a> you may have heard people say that <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> are the only countries in the world that call the sport soccer, but that just supports my claim because Australia and USA are the only countries that have their own version of football (USA-Grid iron, australia-AFL)!</p>

<p>A recent reverting of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> article rather than attempting to either <a href="../../../a/u/s/Talk%7EAustralia_2196.html" title="Talk:Australia">discuss</a> or improve the article has been performed. The revert seem to have been performed by someone because they did not understand that the "Commonwealth of Australia" and the "Australian Continent" are two distinct concepts, the first is a government ruling various lands and islands, but the second is an area determined by the geographic term <i>continent</i>.</p>
<p>To clarify the situation, the British isles are part of Europe, Japan is part of Asia, and New Guinea is a continental island of the Australian continent just like the smaller island of Tasmania is because they are both sitting on the Australian continental shelf. Even commonly accepted biological indicator species such as wallabies, kangaroos, echidna, and cassowary are endemic to continental Australia including New Guinea, not to the CoA. Just like Sumatra, Java, and the Lesser Sunda Islands are on the Asian continental shelf. Continental land masses are measured by their amount of land above the current sea level, that includes any parts which have become temporary islands.</p>
<p>The fact that the <b>Commonwealth of Australia</b> occupies almost 90% of the continent is not a large or important issue, but Wikipedia should not be promoting the mistaken mythos of the CoA ruling the entire continent either.58.107.9.159 02:40, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you should be careful in ascribing motivations for the revert. The revert clearly did not think that the "Commonwealth of Australia" and the "Australian Continent" were the same thing, as it says the Commonwealth also includes several islands. There are several definitions of "continent", and that sentence seems to be using one that excludes islands. This was perhaps clearer in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=21130961" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=21130961" rel="nofollow">earlier versions</a>. It may be better not to use this definition of continent, but if so, we need to find better wording than simply inserting an approximate 90% in the sentence. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 11:18, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Currently the text says <i>"comprising the mainland of the world's smallest continent and a number of islands in the Southern, Indian, and Pacific Oceans."</i> This may be pedantically correct, however it suggests that New Guinea, the second largest island in the world, is not a mainland, which is kind of absurd and very counter-intuitive. It seems that the continent of Australia includes at least 2 mainlands. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 10:32, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Judging by the history on this page, there is a date war (January 1 vs. 1 January). It seems like native Australians write the former, but perhaps the person who (first) wrote them was not. If indeed they write the former, maybe the date conventions should be set that way. I can tell you an article about the United States written in British English would never stand.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Racism</span></h2>
<p>Am discusted to see there is not one mention of the word 'racism'. You are not advertising Australia, but stating fact. Racism is a major issue in Australia's society and history, like South Africa in a way. 600,000 Aboriginals have died upon white settlement with racism being a major contributor. We cannot forget the Muslim's being attacked at Bondi nor OneNation's 25% share of the vote. I know there are links to the Stolen Generation on there.

<p>There was no riot at Bondi. it was Cronulla. Anyway its a dumb thing to put in a entry on a country. Australia is racist?.... compared to who? Japan? China? Germany? South Africa? France? the three subnations of the US, With global movement of people, all countries have some level of tension between the old and the new. drop it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Under "Demographics" there is a statement on racial inequality and human rights - this seems reasonable for an article that summarises a range of matters relating to Australia (if more can be added elsewhere in the article without upsetting its current flow and readability, please offer some ideas below). I know that there was a specific article written on the race riots and I am sure you would find other material on related matters if you look for it. Having said all that, as a general proposition, I would agree that Wikipedia is naturally biased towards an Anglo-American perspective of the world, but I do think a significant proportion of contributors make an effort to balance that tendency. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">πίππύ δ'Ω∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 13:47, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the paragraph on sport, you might notice that there are three other codes of football listed as popular in Australia (Australian rules football is obvious, rugby league and rugby union less so). Rugby and Australian rules were called football in Australia even before the Football Association was formed, and the association version did not become popular for a long time, so the others have traditionally been called football as a result. If you think that mentioning the other codes doesn't make it clear enough, perhaps you could suggest how an explanation could be put in the paragragh nicely? <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 15:04, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is called football in most countries is more properly called Association Football, to distinguish it from Rugby Football, Australian Football, American Football, Gaelic Football, and no doubt others. Soccer is a recognised abreviation of Association Football, better to use in the context where the code is the least popular of four codes (although this last point may be changing). --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 00:25, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
