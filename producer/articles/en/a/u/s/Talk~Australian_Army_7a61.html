<p>Question. Why doesn't the Australian Army have the Royal prefix like the Navy and Air Force? -<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenta_b06b.html" title="User:Penta">Penta</a> 06:48, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Possibly for the same reason the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> doesn't have the "Royal" prefix. But I don't know what that reason is. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff</a> 06:55, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>My guess would be that the Army did not have a unified command - units originally tended to be under specific lords quasi-independent of the king. We note that a number of individual old units are "Royal" though, those being the "King's Own". The Navy was always more like the personal fleet of the king - no "Duke of Lancaster's Frigate Squadron"&#160;:-) or the like, and then RAF copied consciously. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 07:56, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Question. Why doesn't the Australian Army have the Royal prefix like the Navy and Air Force?</p>
<p>The Answer-</p>
<p>The answer lies in the fact that the Navy and the Air Force are homogeneous bodies whilst the Australian Army is an elemental organization made up of a number of corps, services and departments. Our Defence Force is based on the British system where a person can enlist straight into either the navy or the air force but one cannot join the ‘army’. In the United Kingdom a person is enlisted straight into either a regiment or a corps (eg. the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Grenadier Guards, or the Royal Corps of Transport)and recruit training is carried out by that formation. No one joins the ‘Army’ as such.</p>

<dd>The army does not have a prefix, because it is not "the army". The Australian army is broken down into a series of corps, such as the Royal Australian Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, Royal Australian Ordnance Corps etc. That's where all your royalty is!</dd>

<dd>I prefer having the detailed history in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Australian_Imperial_Force_c8e8.html" title="First Australian Imperial Force">1st AIF</a> article and a more concise version in this article. Otherwise the WWI section is going to outweigh the neighbouring peacetime periods. Certainly there is no need to duplicate paragraphs. I am happy to work on the WWI content. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff/Gsl</a> 00:13, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Geoff. I think the WW1 section does need trimming down, but I do think we need mentions of battles there, which -- after all -- is what many people are interested in. I think the "war sections" should be bigger than the peacetime ones, considering that the article is about an army. (By the way, I like the pages on Generals Bridges and Bennett.) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 11:36, Jul 19, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Makes sense to me. As I said, I am happy to work on WWI but didn't want to butt in while you were fleshing out the article. I do intend to write a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_history_of_Australia_during_World_War_I_42da.html" title="Military history of Australia during World War I">Military history of Australia during World War I</a> which should provide an intermediate level of detail between this article (plus navy &amp; political content) and the specific battle/unit/officer articles. As for the generals, Bridges isn't one of mine but I had a need for an article on Bennett so when I noticed you needed one as well, I got it started. I will do his WWI career but feel free to write the WWII sections (of which I know little). <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff/Gsl</a> 05:01, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

The section under infantry says that the RAR is one large regiment of six battalions. This is a bit misleading as the infantry regiments aren't the same as other regiments. I'm not sure how to word this. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrettr_d531.html" title="User:Brettr">Brettr</a> 08:52, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)</p>
<p>Simply mention that the Australian Army is modelled after the the British system, so that infantry regiments contain multiple battalions but that armour, artillery, engineer, special forces, etc 'Regiments' are the size of a single battalion. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELamontCranston_0ab7.html" title="User:LamontCranston">LamontCranston</a> 04:31, 2005 Aug 20 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why does this article mention a possible increase in the number of Australia's Bradley armoured fighting vehicles? I am sure the Australian Army never had any, nor does it currently have any plans to acquire them.</p>

<li>This article is starting to get quite long (or so the warning says every time you edit it). Perhaps it's time to make the History and/or Structure section(s) a separate article and collapse the relevant section(s) in this article? I would recommend making structure of the army a separate article and just including an overview of it in this article with a link to the new article (e.g. Stucture of the Australian Army). - <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBambul_fa6f.html" title="User:Bambul">Bambul</a> 11:40, June 15, 2005 (UTC)

<p>This section is a mishmash of corps and units. Are the terms "combat support arms" and "Combat Service Support" (used under the heading "Units of the Regular Army") part of army doctrine. The terms I was taught are simple combat arms (inc sigs, sappers and aviation) and service corps. These terms sound very dubious to me, I can't imagine labelling the new attack helicopter units as "combat supprt".</p>
<p>Yes, they are... for example "10 FSB" (10 Force Support) "3 CSSB" (3 Combat Service Support Battalion). Also, 5/7 RAR is becomming demalgamated.</p>
<p>To back up the last note, yes the terms "combat support" and "Combat Service Support" are officially used as part of army doctrine. As for saying that you cant see the new attack helicopter as being "combat support" its not. I have it on good authority that Aviation is now designated as a combat corps. However, relegating the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery as "combat support" Figure that one out!</p>

<p>To whoever (IP 203.16.225.80) keeps changing the statistics to only 71 Leopard tanks, the ADF has 90 Leopard gun tanks. Or at least the Anzac Steel page on the Leopard thinks so: <a href="http://anzacsteel.hobbyvista.com/Armoured%20Vehicles/leopardph_1.htm" class="external free" title="http://anzacsteel.hobbyvista.com/Armoured%20Vehicles/leopardph_1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://anzacsteel.hobbyvista.com/Armoured%20Vehicles/leopardph_1.htm</a></p>
<p>As does several other sites such as Defense Industry Daily: <a href="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/2005/11/gd-receives-final-416m-delivery-order-for-australian-m1a1-tanks/index.php" class="external free" title="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/2005/11/gd-receives-final-416m-delivery-order-for-australian-m1a1-tanks/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/2005/11/gd-receives-final-416m-delivery-order-for-australian-m1a1-tanks/index.php</a></p>
<p>and a couple of more important pages like the Australian Army's own newspaper: <a href="http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1060/topstories/story11.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1060/topstories/story11.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1060/topstories/story11.htm</a></p>
<p>and the Australian National Audit Office: <a href="http://www.anao.gov.au/WebSite.nsf/Publications/555F03062BE2B6B7CA25700B0077785A" class="external free" title="http://www.anao.gov.au/WebSite.nsf/Publications/555F03062BE2B6B7CA25700B0077785A" rel="nofollow">http://www.anao.gov.au/WebSite.nsf/Publications/555F03062BE2B6B7CA25700B0077785A</a> see under Section 4 "Track Manoeuvre Systems Program Office" which incidentally also indicates only 59 M1s are being bought.</p>
<p>The ADF has 71 Leopard 1 Main Battle Tanks, the other 19 are recovery vehicles or something. Everything I've read says 71 Main Battle Tanks, not 90. Suck shit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Straight to abuse, how nice. Obviously you haven't bothered to read the 4 links I provided. There are 90 AS1 gun tanks, 5 bridge layers and 8 ARVs. Ways 05:02, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>ROE people!!! be nice. im going with 90 <a href="../../../e/e/v/User%7EEevo_cd0b.html" title="User:Eevo">Eevo</a> 21:24, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> on a pogo stick have your bloody 90 Leopards I don't really even care!</p>
<ul>
<li>Eloquent to the end I see, the tanks aren't mine they belong to the Australian Government and you very clearly did care or you would not have spent the time to edit the number in the first place. If Wikipedia is to be at all useful it had better at least be accurate and not based on the ill-informed opinion of an anonymous editor. Ways 14:26, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Look I'm sorry for the harsh language, I was a bit pissed off being challenged about my knowledge of the Australian army. Its just everything I've ever read said 71 Leopard tanks, but it looks I was wrong. Lets move on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fair enough. If it helps any I have a distant memory of being told once they only operate around seventy of the ones they have, the balance are either in storage/rebuild/overhaul or issued as replacement vehicles when one needs to be overhauled, or at the School of Armour. But I couldn't tell you which. Ways 05:47, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, well where getting rid of them now, we should of got <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopard_2.html" title="Leopard 2">Leopard 2</a>'s in stead of Abrams. And besides, why did we only buy 59 Abrams?</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not really sure, I think it works out as around 4 squadrons (3 operational plus 1 for the School) plus an HQ section. Depending on which way the political wind is blowing there may be a subsequent purchase of aditional vehicles as there was for Centurion and Leopard after a couple of years, but I wouldn't count on it. It's a bit late to change now anyway, the first Abrams have arrived <a href="http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2006/sep/20060922.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2006/sep/20060922.cfm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Ways 06:40, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well I guess we'll have to wait and see. Besides, Tanks are expensive to run, seeing as the amount of fuel they consume. Apparently Abrams take 40 litres of fuel to start up. Won't be to good when fuel becomes really expensive.</p>

<p>In regards to the bit about recruiting in the main article. Despite the media beatup about falling recruitments the facts are that recruitment is falling in <b>PROFESSIONAL</b> occupations in the Army, like Doctors, Nurses, Dentists etc They are still recruiting the dumb ones&#160;;)</p>
<p>Numbers especially for infantry are that large that the School of Cool, aka the School of Infantry is actually full and that Diggers are getting their IET training directly at the Battalions now. I'd suggest checking this fact out and amending your article&#160;:) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_59.167.215.163_2fab.html" title="Special:Contributions/59.167.215.163">59.167.215.163</a> (talk) 16:06, 10 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
