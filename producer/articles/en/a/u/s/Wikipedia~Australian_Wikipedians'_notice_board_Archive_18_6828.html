<dd>If you were using the photo in Australia, it would be in the public domain, since it was taken before <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, regardless of where it was first published.

<dd>I thought the consensus was that if it was originally published in Australia and it's PD in Australia, it'd be PD in the states. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 01:09, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I don't think Thebainer's conclusion is right.

<dd>Sounds like a good idea. If the photographer was Australian or employed directly by The Bulletin (not freelance) then it is most probably an Australian work. It would be strange for the copyright to be owned by an Australian but governed by foriegn copyright rules (though being strange is probably not a good way to judge these things). I am also not sure if the photo is owned by a foreign copyright owner if it's publishment in an Australian magazine would mean it falls out of copyright in Australia a set time after being published, although if it was still under copyright in it's home countrie the US would have to honour that... This stuff is too complicated for it's own good. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></small> 01:36, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Andjam and Martyman, you're right for stuff produced and published entirely within Australia. Stuff that's PD in the home country before 1978 is PD in the US. This photo was taken overseas, and there's also the question of when it was first published, so Australian law may not be the only applicable law here. As you've already said, it's necessary to establish details like that first. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 01:40, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Football again</span></h2>
<p>Okay, here's my proposal. If it gets support here, I'd like to tack on an additional proposal, which is basically a stick with a nail in it, weilded appropriately against anyone who tries any childish (like the page-blanking I saw earlier).</p>
<ol>
<li>When football is referred to, it shall be "football (soccer)", just like every other bloody article on Wikipedia. There shall be no more fighting over whether it ought to be football <i>or</i> soccer, and attempts to say "soccer (football)" will be treated with the contempt and violent beatings they deserve.</li>
<li>"Football" on its own, then, will only be used for football codes <i>in general</i>: AFL, rugby union, rugby league, football, and, if necessary (God forbid) Gaelic footy and gridiron as well. This means that football-related categories remain, but as top-level cats with subcats relating to the particular codes, rather than fighting over whether "Football players" should be AFLers, footballers, whatever.</li>
<li>Cut and paste moves, page blanking, creation of duplicate articles, etc. is lame, and will all be undone, as soon as I (and any other administrator who feels like helping) gets the time.</li>
<li>Thrrrrp.</li>
<li>If anyone disagrees with me, come up with a better proposal. "But football is what the rest of the world calls it!" or "how dear those soccer fanatic interlopers claim the rights to our sacred word!" are <i>not</i> better proposals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyone got any comments? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 18:38, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No wonder this is running hot in football forums. People are riled. I just found this page from an edit history and God damn. I'm trying to convince people to take this to thefootballwiki.com so it gets into the right search queries in google in time for The World Cup. Redirects won't appear when searching for "Australian football". Why does it matter that it's called football anyway? How does this affect rubgy league (the greatest game of all)? I beleive that of the 48 English speaking football naitons, only 5 use the word soccer. The most popular football league in the world is the English Premier League and there are no soccer clubs there. Everyone knows that you need to type "Liverpool football club" to find the team, otherwise you get the name of the city. Also, there is debate about switching to the word football in the USA. <a href="../../../f/2E/c/F.C._Dallas_7730.html" title="F.C. Dallas">F.C. Dallas</a> being an example while others have dropped the word soccer from thier name all together. Call your sport what you like? I don't care. I hope we beat <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil_national_football_team.html" title="Brazil national football team">Brasil</a>, but we probably won't.&#160;;) As long as we do better than last time.&#160;:) Bye. --<a href="../../../e/x/e/User%7EExecutive.koala_ebd4.html" title="User:Executive.koala">Executive.koala</a> 19:41, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
From the FC Dallas website. '<i>"'</i><b>What does FC in FC Dallas stand for?</b> F stands for "Futbol" which is the globally used term for the sport, and C stands for "Club" which again is the accurate reference to a team globally. As people across the metroplex will learn in the coming months and years, there are a variety of terms that more accurately describe the sport; such as Futbol Club when referring to the team itself." I wish we would use <b>fútbol</b> in Australia, but the racists would scream <i>wog</i>. --<a href="../../../e/x/e/User%7EExecutive.koala_ebd4.html" title="User:Executive.koala">Executive.koala</a> 19:53, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wasn't aware of this discussion either until now.

<dd>Strong support - but it's probably already spinning out of control. There are two fronts to combat here: those that wish to appropriate the term "football" for themselves, and quite separate to this group, are those who do not wish to see Australian rules football mentioned in the same illustrious light as soccer, gridiron and rugby (cough, cough). Interestingly, this latter group are in fact all Australians - no prizes for guessing what their motivations are. I wish all and sundry luck. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 02:19, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with your proposal, although I think once "football (soccer)" or "Australian rules football" has been used in an article (I'd imagine usually in the lead section) and that article refers only to that sport (eg for <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_FC_57b8.html" title="Sydney FC">Sydney FC</a> or <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Swans_645f.html" title="Sydney Swans">Sydney Swans</a>), "football" can freely be used. Something needs to be done about page names too, but don't ask me! <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbinomonkey_5636.html" title="User:Albinomonkey">AlbinoMonkey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/l/b/User_talk%7EAlbinomonkey_dabe.html" title="User talk:Albinomonkey">Talk</a>)</sup> 03:26, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Ta, guys. AlbinoMonkey, I agree.</p>
<p>I've spent the last couple of hours making a start on getting all this into shape (you can see the results in various football cats/articles, and my contribs). There's still a <i>long</i> way to go. At the moment, most of the crap is confined to football (soccer)-related articles, but sooner or later the other codes will require work, too. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 15:48, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On Friday night I did a lot of work on moving Australian soccer articles to the correct categories, most of which has been undone by Executive.koala and an anonymous editor. I guess it would be wildly optimistic to expect them to undo their handiwork. Does anyone know how we go about getting a bot to do it, or some other timesaving method? I'm mainly referring to Category:Australian football clubs and Category:Australian football players, which to my mind should be supercategories made up of the ones for the respective codes. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 23:40, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Executive.koala, apart from your misleading comments about the use of the word "soccer", you are missing a significant part of the point. Even if it is always referred to as "football", it is not the only code referred to as football in Australia, so disambiguations and subcategories are appropriate. Of course, when naming articles aboutbodies, rather than topics, we use the name of the body, so neither <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_Federation_Australia_39fa.html" title="Football Federation Australia">Football Federation Australia</a> nor <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_Hall_of_Fame_910a.html" title="Australian Football Hall of Fame">Australian Football Hall of Fame</a> spell out which code is referred to. If the FFA creates something called the Australian Football Hall of Fame as well, then disambiguation would be necessary, but that isn't the case. It's hard to see why you think there are double standards.</dd>

If <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football (soccer)</a> can't use Australian football, the Aussie Rules shouldn't use it either, for exactly the same reason. So when you're done wasting your time changing all of the football links, you can do the same to the Aussie Rules links. --<a href="../../../e/x/e/User%7EExecutive.koala_ebd4.html" title="User:Executive.koala">Executive.koala</a> 21:09, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A soccer hall of fame? c'mon, let's get serious! I can really imagine hundreds of thousands of Australians with teary eyes winding their way through a soccer hall of fame. "I remember that nil all draw". "I was there the day so and so took a dive and won a penalty which gave us that magnificent 1-0 victory". "Remember how so and so would do a somersault, roll over a dozen times and then grab his ankle with such an anguished look on his face that his opponent got the yellow card everytime". "Oh look, I remember that nil all draw as well - it was an incredible game, there was not a single shot on goal all night, such tension, such professionalism, it was an extraordinary display of skill". "Oh look, that was the night we won 3-1 - it's still the highest scoring game of soccer on record." "This is the last game ever played in the NSL, such an historic event, there was so much emotion that night, to think that the comp survived a whole 26 seasons, the history of it all - it brings a lump to your throat." <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 23:25, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm less knowledgable of this issue, but if you have the references to show that that is its official name, then you make a fair point. No one would argue that that name is used officially to describe the national team of another football code (I don't think, but I could be wrong). "Australian Football" means something very specific in Australia, but I would think that <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_national_football_team.html" title="Australian national football team">Australian national football team</a> clearly does not refer to anything related to Australian Football, and could perhaps be used to describe the socceroos (if that is its official name). While on the subject, I note that it says something about the term "socceroos" being the official nick name - but I had thought that Lowy was trying to distance the FFA from the nick name - perhaps "traditional nick name" or "popular nick name" might be better. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 08:41, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It seems to me that one is called the "Australian Football Hall of Fame", and the other was started as the "Australian Soccer Hall of Fame", but since the change in name of the FFA, they are referring to it as the "Football Hall of Fame" or "FFA - Football Hall of Fame". They are not stupid enough to call it the "Australian Football Hall of Fame", as there is already something with that name. Maybe some disambiguation is required, but if so it should be "Football Hall of Fame (Australia)" or "Football Hall of Fame (Australian soccer)" or something like that. The disambiguation should definitely not come in the middle of the official name. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 10:43, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Appuntu. There is only one <b>Australian Football Hall of Fame</b> - the others have a different name and the titles of their articles should carry that name. The logical extension of all this idiocy is that some bright spark will decide that <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Australian Football League</a> should be clarified for disambiguation, and will be retitled Austrlaian Football League (Australian rules football). Too far fetched? Too idiotic? Don't bet on it! We've already had afficionados of the other codes argue that the adjective "Australian" should not be used to describe <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a> because it was invented in Victoria!! <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 11:15, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agree with the Australian Football League (Australian rules football) being an idiotic idea (or using the original name Victorian Rules Football when talking about Aussie Rules).

<dd>That's the problem - it's not clear what the official name is - which was why I proposed the Australian Football (soccer) Hall of Fame in the first place.

<p>I have noticed that in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnamese_Australian_532b.html" title="Vietnamese Australian">Vietnamese Australian</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanese_Australian_0fc0.html" title="Lebanese Australian">Lebanese Australian</a> there are criminals listed under the list of notables (<a href="../../../n/g/u/Nguyen_Tuong_Van_973b.html" title="Nguyen Tuong Van">Nguyen Tuong Van</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilal_Skaf_2fd8.html" title="Bilal Skaf">Bilal Skaf</a>). However anons keep on removing Bilal Skaf from the Lebanese article, and one has put a message on the talk page that criminals don't represent ethnic groups. The other ethnic articles do not have any mentions of gangsters and criminals, but examples could easily, eg, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Chan_cd9a.html" title="Andrew Chan">Andrew Chan</a> and Melbourne underworld people, etc. What is the policy on this sort of stuff? Because some of the articles sound like glorification? Is it appropriate to include notorious figures?

<dd>I don't like the media's obsessions with labelling criminals by their ethnicity, but this is another matter. This isn't a list of people "representing" ethnic groups, it's a list of notable people. Criminals can be notable. The list should include the governors, premiers, footballers, etc and criminals, if they are notable. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 10:00, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For events that are held regularly in Australian locations, but maybe aren't as big as the Royal shows and Footy Finals, but not technically Festivals, is there somewhere to put them?

<dd>The article as it stands is very POV and editorial-style (gotta love the image caption, "Mackie has fans excited for the future"). It's also got links to at least two redlinked images. It <i>does</i> need rewriting to sound like a dispassionate encyclopaedia article; however, Harro5's version is, well, <i>very</i> short. I think rewriting rather than cutting out the too-excited bits would have been a better option, personally, but I'm not willing to do the work either, so ... <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 12:56, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We're an encyclopedia, and can't editorialise unless we are quoting someone notable (eg. Caroline Wilson from <i>The Age</i> if it's football). Boomtish believes that writing in flourishing language about how talented someone was during their junior career - citing no sources - and listing individual statistics from games is worth adding to Wikipedia; I disagree, and when I reverted, I kept all fact that would be used in a standard Wikipedia article. I'm not going to discuss this matter any more, and hope Rogerthat realises while I love writing about football, my first allegiance on Wikipedia is to the project and its accepted conventions for writing biographies. If a similar article were written for a US politician, there would likely be an absolute uproar resulting in RFCs, revert wars and general ugliness. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harr</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">o</font></a><b><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html" title="User talk:Harro5">5</a></b> 06:49, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

I had a quick look at some of your most recent edits on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Judd_6cbc.html" title="Chris Judd">Chris Judd</a>. On the one hand, you were right in deleting this clumsy sentence: <i>And this was all despite having had two shoulder reconstructions before the age of 18</i> - but hopefully you did so only because it was clumsy - I would have thought that the fact that he has achieved so much in AFL football at such a young age after having two shoulder reconstructions before the age of 18 is at least a little bit noteworthy and surely merits a mention somewhere in the article. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 07:12, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am certainly biased, but if we are going for a road picture I like this one <a href="../../../w/a/r/Image%7EWarriBridgeKingsHighway.JPG_6dd5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/d/d4/WarriBridgeKingsHighway.JPG/40px-WarriBridgeKingsHighway.JPG" alt="" width="40" height="30" longdesc="../../../w/a/r/Image%7EWarriBridgeKingsHighway.JPG_6dd5.html" /></a>, because it includes a good balance of sky, Australian vegetation (and colours) and direction of road. The <a href="../../../k/a/n/Image%7EKangaroo_sign_in_australia.jpg_0da5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Kangaroo_sign_in_australia.jpg/40px-Kangaroo_sign_in_australia.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="30" longdesc="../../../k/a/n/Image%7EKangaroo_sign_in_australia.jpg_0da5.html" /></a> is not bad but perhaps needs brightening for the purposes of an icon.

<dd>I'd be happy with the kangaroo sign too, but to be effective at that size it should have a plain background - either white, or nothing but sky - to avoid any distraction from the basic roo-and-sign iconage. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 23:40, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the kangaroo is the best choice, but I agree that it needs lightening and a cleaner background.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">SMH Article</span></h2>
<p>I recently posted a reference to the following SMH article in the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Talk%7EFootball_91b5.html" title="Talk:Football">Talk:Football</a> page, the latter having attracted much attention of late (unfortunately). Now I know many of you are sick to death of this topic - but if I can't discuss footy matters on this notice board - then where do you suggest I go pray tell? This is the article: <a href="http://smh.com.au/news/heckler/play-by-the-rules-and-keep-your-hands-off-our-football/2006/03/06/1141493607962.html" class="external text" title="http://smh.com.au/news/heckler/play-by-the-rules-and-keep-your-hands-off-our-football/2006/03/06/1141493607962.html" rel="nofollow">Lloyd Swanton, March 7, 2006, "Play by the rules and keep your hands off our football"</a> . It is of interest for the following reasons:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. It touches on an issue (or a series of related issues) that has been running hot in the aforementioned talk page and to a lesser extent in this page.</dd>
<dd>2. It refers to the top 6 oldest football clubs (of any code) in the world, being: Melbourne 1858, Geelong 1859, Notts County 1862, Stoke City 1863, Carlton 1864, Nottingham Forest 1865. Also adding that: <i>"Middle-aged" AFL clubs like Essendon and St Kilda are older than any senior clubs in Germany and Argentina. A "young" club like Collingwood (1892) is older than any Italian soccer club, and Port Adelaide (1870) older than any Brazilian club.</i></dd>
<dd>3. It helps reinforce the point that in any article covering the history of football (term used generically, as it always should be in Australia and by Australians), including (in particular) the history of its organisation, its institutions, its rules, etc. the fact that the Australian football clubs are so old in world terms is certainly of note and should be mentioned in this article (as it currently is, but others are trying to negate the worth of that importance, to date unconvincingly).</dd>
<dd>4. It is interesting that it is, of all things, a <b>Sydney</b> paper that is helping to pour cold water over the view that Australian rules football is not an Australian game (but a Victorian game), seeing that even the Port Adelaide footy club is older than the vast majority of football clubs of any code throughout the world - and by a long shot at that.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, this is all tiresome, but it is equally tiresome to hear these silly arguments being made in the talk page of what is an excellent general article on <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> (to which I have made zero contributions, other than raising the flag and trumpeting its merits). These silly arguments are being made by at least one Australian (more often than not, masquerading as more than one Australian, but that is another story) - and therefore, it is only right that I air these views on this notice board, with apologies to all who believe that sport is the opiate of the masses, brings out the very worst in people, etc. etc. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 02:26, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_Winter_Olympians_7eaf.html" title="List of Australian Winter Olympians">List of Australian Winter Olympians</a>, several people have namesakes, with two namesakes being adult models <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danielle_Carr_fff9.html" title="Danielle Carr">Danielle Carr</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Smith_bc4e.html" title="Christine Smith">Christine Smith</a>.

<dd>Holy...looks like there's an article on every Playmate of the Month ever.

I don't think the criticism is particularly relevant or well-founded, any more than including any of Blair's criticism of others on his blog in those Wikipedia articles. While Tim Blair may just be notable enough for an article, I don't think he's notable enough to be quoted as criticising anybody, and neither is BrookesNews.

<p>A dispute over whether it is appropriate to utilize an inflammatory quotation of John Howard's in an international forum such as WP (a quote that was clearly intended for a domestic audience being as it appeared in a radio interview) has arisen. The section of <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_politics_in_Australia_e402.html" title="Gun politics in Australia">Gun politics in Australia</a> in dispute is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">Howard</a> Government strongly favours gun control, and under their influence legislation has steadily become more restrictive. Prime Minister John Howard is known to have a personal dislike of legal firearms use and ownership in general, and has stated publicly that he "hates guns", that "ordinary citizens should not have weapons", and that firearm ownership by ordinary citizens is an "American disease". While addressing a gathering of shooters in <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sale%2C_Victoria_7366.html" title="Sale, Victoria">Sale, Victoria</a> in June 1996, he raised considerable controversy by wearing a poorly-concealed <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullet-proof_vest.html" title="Bullet-proof vest">bullet-proof vest</a> to the rally."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue is on calling the American 2nd Amendment Right for the people to bear arms, and the US Constitution, an "American disease". This is not appropriate for an international audience, as it is extremely offensive to Americans.</p>
<p>One alternative wording that has been discussed is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">Howard</a> Government strongly favours gun control, and under their influence legislation has steadily become more restrictive.

<dd>I see nothing intrinsically wrong with the first quote. However, there is no source, so until someone sources it the second option is better.

<dd>Speaking as a US citizen, I think the first of the two blockquotes (specifically including the "American disease" quotation) is fine. I'm sure Howard didn't specifically intend it to offend Americans; every Australian knows how highly Howard values relations with the US. But nevertheless, he has made it very clear that on this particular issue, he does <i>not</i> agree with the USA's approach to gun ownership. If that's 'offensive' (I don't find it so), it's an offensive <i>fact</i>, and a relevant one; Wikipedia is full of such facts. IMHO, the quote shows the vehemence of Howard's views on this point, and isn't that what that paragraph is <i>about</i>?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Australian people subcategories</span></h2>
<p>To me, these subcategories are in a bit of a mess.</p>
<p>I think we could revamp the Australian people subcategories by making two new subcats "Australian immigrants" (people born outside Australia who now identify as Australian and live in Oz) and "Australian emmigrants" (people born in Oz but who identify more as some other nationality and live outside Australia).</p>
<p>These categories would have nothing to do with ethnicity, but cats such as "Australians in China" or "Australian-Brazilians" should be subcategories of "Australian emmigrants" or simply not categories at all. Possibly some really useless-sounding categories like "English-Australians" should definitely go. If need be make it specific like "Australians of Western European ancestry".</p>
<p>Any more ideas to overhaul the Australian people subcategories? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 05:15, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>As a minor point that could save some trouble, "emigrants" has only one "m". I notice some categories have used "diaspora" instead of "emigrants", e.g. <a href="../../../c/r/o/Category%7ECroatian_diaspora_828b.html" title="Category:Croatian diaspora">Category:Croatian diaspora</a>. I prefer "emigrants" myself, but perhaps I'm missing an important but subtle difference in meaning. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 05:54, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am not fond of the diaspora word to be used generally - it has a specific meaning. I would rather refer to say community, but to cover those of the second and third generation. For example a Vietnamese-Australian might be born here but still be very much part of the local Vietnamese community and identify with that community as well as being Australian. The diaspora tends to refer to that community across international boundaries. I believe some diaspora identify more as such and maintain their connections despite which country they are in more than others. The Jewish and Chinese diaspora are more well known compared to the German dispora who perhaps adapt better to their places of immigration. In Australia, however, members of the Chinese diaspora would normally be referred to as being Chinese-Australians or Australian-Chinese.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 18:55, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I agree diaspora is a bit of a flowery word and not that useful. The category names may as well be precise. An advantage of Wikipedia is that categories can be nested - in near-perfect subsets - quite a long way to achieve leaf-node categories that are useful to humans. Most of the intervening categories will be useful much more in the future when we are adding sexy decision support and browsing tools to Wikipedia. All that to explain why I still think we can simply use the very technical category names "Australian immigrants" and "Australian emigrants". Ideally subcategories of these would be used most often tho. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 05:24, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting question (even for a dyed in the wool, one-eyed aussie rules supporter such as myself). On the one hand, I accept the argument that it, and articles of its ilk, are not sufficiently notable. On the other hand, a lot of quirky, idiotic things appear to pass as notable amongst the broader wikipedia community. The article count is now so high that we've probably lost complete track of how much superficial idiocy is floating around in the guise of a wikipedia article. As a small but related aside: at what point do we stop writing about footy clubs in Australia? at VFL/VFA level? at state level? do amateur clubs get a guernsey (remembering that some, like University, are certainly notable in the history of the old VFL). We are currently involved in doing articles on anyone who has ever played one AFL/VFL game - and I am wondering why such a person (who may never have even touched the footy in their one and only game) should be any more notable than, say, an American aussie rules team that may have won their comp three years running. Lastly, most of these North American clubs have their own websites - brings us back into that whole mirky area. I haven't really left an opinion one way or the other, maybe because I reckon that the concept of notability is inconsistently applied right across wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 03:05, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's hard to know where to draw the line of notability. I echo the thoughts of Pippu and Jiminy that there is a large degree of inconsistency - even though Blnguyen, you are trying to set a precedent, I doubt it will be followed by others (for example, two different <a href="../../../2/0/_/20_to_1.html" title="20 to 1">20 to 1</a> articles both went under AfD in the space of two weeks). By the way Bl, the sport is known as <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a> - AFL refers to the main league (the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Australian Football League</a>). <b><a href="../../../a/f/l/WP%7EAFL_72f6.html" title="WP:AFL"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rogerthat_2a3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rogerthat"><font color="red">o</font></a><a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerthat_6fee.html" title="User:Rogerthat"><font color="darkblue">gerthat</font></a></b> <i><sup><a href="../../../r/o/g/User_talk%7ERogerthat_5be9.html" title="User talk:Rogerthat"><font color="black">Talk</font></a></sup></i> 09:22, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At what do you stop writing about clubs? Probably when (a) we run out of reliable sources or (b) we run out of puff. If a reputable source is writing about a club, then they've made a decision that the club is notable.</p>
<p>I guess my attitude towards notability is that if an article isn't vanity, attack, advertising, or non-verifiable, and the creator isn't a single-issue contributor, then someone must have thought the person was notable.</p>
<p>On the topic of notability, I haven't created an article about Australian ski jumper Tony Mihelcic because I don't know if he's notable enough. (I first heard of him on his personal web site) Any opinions? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 10:39, 21 March 2006 (UTC) <small>(Minor note: <a href="../../../s/k/i/Ski_jumping.html" title="Ski jumping">ski jumping</a> is what Eddie the Eagle did, not what Alisa Camplin does)</small></p>

<p>My <i>personal</i> opinion on notability for sportspeople is roughly the precedent set by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Formula_One_4955.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Formula One">WikiProject Formula One</a> that everyone who has ever started one F1 race gets an article. I extend that to mean everyone who has competed in an international or national top-level race/game/match passes my notability test. "Top-level" is of course also subjective, but includes first-class cricket matches, Olympic, Commonwealth and Friendly Games, <i>recognised</i> world championships in just about anything. For teams, the league they play in and the place they represent should both have comprehensive articles that would become too large by merging the team info before I'd say the team is worthy of an article in its own right. Teams in national leagues, or state leagues of major sports (in that place) are roughly the level I'd stop at. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 14:09, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seems fair and reasonable, in particular, it's no use going to individual clubs if the article on the league consists of half a dozen paras - most subject matters in Wikipedia follow a similar principle and it is a fairly objective one (although there remains no shortage of superficial, idiotic articles floating around out there). <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 03:47, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Only because I thought it would be a matter of time before people would start asking these very questions. When does someone get a guernsey? Is there a minimum number of games required to be played? Are the reserves enough? Being on a team's official list at some stage? (remembering that in the good old days, VFL teams would have lists of 70 players, over half never getting a senior game). At what standard of play do we deem someone too boring to write about? VFA? VAFA? ACTAFL? Then the question of overseas clubs is only a short step away from these sorts of questions. It sort of makes sense that a similar discussion would need to occur in the project page (we certainly have touched on this, but probably have not had it out fully). <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 13:06, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no problems with my comments in this discussion moving to the AFL project page, or with it staying here. My opinion would be players who have ever been on the list for an AFL match <i>should</i> have an article for that project to be complete. That should probably extend to all the players on the official list even if they were never listed for a game. Reserves is not a top-level competition (by definition) and by itself does not qualify a person to have an article. For <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a>, I think the "top level" competitions are <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">AFL</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Australian_National_Football_League_e043.html" title="South Australian National Football League">SANFL</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Australian_Football_League_7e37.html" title="West Australian Football League">WAFL</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Football_League_a3a4.html" title="Victorian Football League">VFL</a> (both of them), <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_International_Cup_edd9.html" title="Australian Football International Cup">International Cup</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_matches_in_Australian_rules_football_c6f8.html" title="Interstate matches in Australian rules football">Interstate matches in Australian rules football</a>. The <a href="../../../n/a/b/NAB_Cup_86a5.html" title="NAB Cup">NAB Cup</a> and predecessors might count. Being a top level competition means I think the teams and players could have an article written about them, and that would be a satisfactory claim of notability. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:29, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tasmanian electorate names</span></h2>

<p>I'd like to suggest two options:</p>

<dd>I agree with The Bainer that they should be kept separate.

<dd>In a mad fit of <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">being bold</a>, I have changed my mind and use a variation on option 2 - using the formats <b>Division of Bass</b> for federal electorates and <b>Division of Bass (state)</b> for the state electorates. I have moved the articles, and will fix double redirects now - I'll get around to fixing all other links later on tonight. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 04:55, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Start of the footy season</span></h2>
<p>My fellow wikipedians - the long wait is over - no longer need you spend your leisure hours on wikipedia - you can now dedicate yourself to the things that really count in life - like watching the footy! Yes, the game we all love, our national code, our indigenous code, our very own game - commenced last night. Sandwiched in between the end of the Commonwealth games and the Australian Grand Prix, what excuse does one have to sit in front of a computer screen? To top it all off, I understand that the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trugo.html" title="Trugo">Trugo</a> season is reaching an exciting conclusion. I wish you all a great season, may your team do as well as you expect (which is not much if you are a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlton_Blues_feca.html" title="Carlton Blues">Blues</a> fan) and I look forward to seeing you all next October (or early September) when I next will get the chance to frequent your wonderful notice board. Speaking of all things cerebral, I recently started <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Sicily_917c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Sicily">WikiProject Sicily</a>, in case anyone out there has the slightest interest. Writing about Sicily while watching the <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL_01f4.html" title="AFL">AFL</a> - tell me - does it get any better? <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 01:38, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The year's starting to fall into place now, the Comm Games are over, the GP is over (both great events but strangely timed). So many sporting events packed into the last month or so, impossible to keep up with. After spending much of the off-season writing stuff about football, hopefully this will inspire others to get on board. <b><a href="../../../a/f/l/WP%7EAFL_72f6.html" title="WP:AFL"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rogerthat_2a3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rogerthat"><font color="red">o</font></a><a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerthat_6fee.html" title="User:Rogerthat"><font color="darkblue">gerthat</font></a></b> <i><sup><a href="../../../r/o/g/User_talk%7ERogerthat_5be9.html" title="User talk:Rogerthat"><font color="black">Talk</font></a></sup></i> 11:52, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
