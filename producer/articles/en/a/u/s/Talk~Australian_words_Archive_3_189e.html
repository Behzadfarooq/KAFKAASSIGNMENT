<h2><span class="mw-headline">Barrack</span></h2>
<p>I took out reference to barrack in Australian English being the "exact opposite" to the British meaning because to me, the Australian meaning is not an exact opposite so much as an extension of the original meaning. In the Australian sense barrack still does include hooting and jeering a sporting team, though usually thought of as supportive hooting for your own team, part of barracking in the Australian sense still includes derisive jeering of the other team. When someone says 'my voice is worn out from barracking all day' this can include shouting for your own team and against the other. thats why i took out the "exact opposite" reference.

<dd>All I am saying is that in the Australian sense, barracking generally means supporting the team, but the action of barracking can include yelling both for and against. An Australian might barrack for their team, which may include hooting and jeering against the competition, and even hooting and jeering against their own team when they are losing. And sinse the original meaning is "jeering against" the Australian meaning is not the exact opposite but partly overlaps. However it does not sound like you'll ever agree, so if you change it back I'll leave it. Precinct13 22:13, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mark?</span></h2>
<p>I have cleaned-up the new entry <i>mark</i> (<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Rules_Football_546f.html" title="Australian Rules Football">Australian Rules Football</a>) but is this really an <i>Australian word</i>? Really its a formalised element of AFL, enshrined and formally listed and named in the rules, so not really an Aust word as such. If anything it is a sporting or football term. Precinct13 05:43, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The OED defines 'mark' as a catch but only in the context of AFL, as does the Macquarie-it appears to be a uniquely Victorian word. No other sport, worldwide, uses it this way. Its possible etymology may be seen here- <a href="http://www.aboriginalfootball.com.au/marngrook.html" class="external free" title="http://www.aboriginalfootball.com.au/marngrook.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aboriginalfootball.com.au/marngrook.html</a> Please disabuse me of any errors.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_A._Warbuton_2073.html" title="User:Eric A.

<dd>"Victorian"?! Two points: 1. The <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark.html" title="Mark">mark</a> came to Aussie rules from rugby union and the concept was even in the earliest forms of soccer (see <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> for more on this). 2. Aussie rules has been the most popular winter sport in Tas, SA and WA for more than 100 years. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 15:20, September 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The OED states that 'mark' as 'a catch' has its earliest use in AFL(see defn.31 A&amp;B)It appears that AFL transfered the idea of a 'heel mark' to 'a catch' first thus:</p>
<p><i>31. a. Austral. Rules Football. The catching of a ball directly from a kick of at least ten metres, thus winning a free-kick to be taken from that point; the spot from which such a free-kick is taken.</i></p>
<p>1859 in C. C. Mullen Hist. Austral. Rules Football (1959) 11 A mark is made when a player catches the ball before it hits the ground and after it has been clearly kicked by another player. 1965 Sun-Herald (Sydney) 4 July 51 Geelong Rover, Terry Farman, won a trophy for the best mark taken by his team. 1969 Sun-Herald (Sydney) 13 July 48/1 Close took a beautiful one-handed mark, his tenth for the game,..but kicked only a point. 1988 Rugby News Nov. 23/3 Why not follow the practice in Aussie Rules where a mark is simply a clean catch, although you still have to shout ‘mark’.</p>
<p>b. Rugby Union. Originally: a heel-mark in the ground made by a player who has caught the ball direct from a kick, knock-on, or forward throw by an opponent, thereby claiming a free-kick from that point. Subsequently: a clean catch taken by a player within his or her twenty-two metres area, direct from a kick by an opponent. Modern rules no longer require a heel-mark to be made; the catcher instead shouts ‘Mark!’ in order to claim a free-kick.</p>
<p>"1862 Rulebk. in J. Macrory Running with Ball (1991) xi. 97 If any of the other side have caught it and made his mark they are obliged to stop charging. 1867 Rugby School Football Laws 2 A Fair Catch is a catch from a kick, or a knock on from the hand..of the opposite side, or a throw on, when the catcher makes a mark with his heel. 1896 Field 1 Feb. 173/1 A goal had also been kicked by Finlay from a mark. 1960 E. S. HIGHAM &amp; W. J. HIGHAM High Speed Rugby xiii. 183 The method of making a fair-catch is to make a mark on the ground with the heel as the ball is caught, and to call: ‘Mark!’<i>"</i> I always was led to believe that what is known as a 'mark' in VFL was a 'catch' in rugby.</p>
<p>Thus I still maintain that 'mark' as a 'catch' was first used in AFL and has its origin in Victoria. What do you think? <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_A._Warbuton_2073.html" title="User:Eric A. Warbuton">Eric A. Warbuton</a> 03:57, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I think it come from the shout of "mark" in rugby which (as I understand it) was made even when the heel mark was used. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 13:19, September 6, 2005 (UTC)

<p><a name="Camp" id="Camp"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Camp</span></h2>
<p>I restored the previous meaning of camp. Reason: As I understand it, up until the 1970s the term for a homosexual man was "camp", as in, "I am camp", "He's camp", "Are you camp?". The American term "gay" was either yet to be invented or heard of in Australia, and camp was the word commonly used. In addition to this it was also used in its standard sense of humourously overstated and exaggerated gentures and mannerisms. So I restored it because the earlier sense I've described is the one that is Australian and it is also the one that is extinct, having now been replaced by "gay". Use of "camp" as an adjective is more the standard international usage in use today so to me the inclusion of the term here at all is because of the old, Australian, use of the term as a noun. Precinct13 00:13, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>What you have said is partly true, however I have never heard it in the form 'he is a camp' So its not a true concrete noun like say 'he is a queer'. Above you say its a 'term'. Meaning what? In the form 'he's camp' it means --he is effeminate or he practices in homosexuality. A small but important difference. Could best be described as an adjectival noun. The use was/is also british english. And its still used in that form today-but probably only by people over 40. And then, to introduce another problem, theres the true adjective 'campy'. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_A._Warbuton_2073.html" title="User:Eric A. Warbuton">Eric A.

<dd>In reply to your question "Meaning what? In the form 'he's camp' it means --he is effeminate or he practices in homosexuality. A small but important difference." I would say that, until the 1970s in Aust, it meant that the person practices homosexuality. Later, after the word "gay" caught on sometime in the 1970s, the meaning would have more meant that he is effeminate. I've not personally encountered any of this, but have read several reports by people around at the time who describe the words used in this way and the change in meaning that occured sometime in the 1970s. Yes it was and is in British English, but then many of the terms here, like "mate", "bloody" are as well. The word campy refers more to theatricality and exaggerated performance or behaviour, and is probably related to the later, more universal meaning of the word camp that came in to play after "gay" came in to use in Aust and the general meaning of the word "camp" shifted.

<p>Have checked Macquarie Dict. and it does have meaning for a conrete noun ie. he is a camp. I regret wasting your time- its just it was very obscure and I'd never come across it before in either conversation or writing.

<dd>No problem. Yes it is obscure, and seems to be totally extinct in this sense. Apparently out of use since the 1970s. Yeah the discussion pages can be good. Precinct13 08:14, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">bum, dreamtime and sheltershed</span></h2>
<p>I would say that 'bum' (as used in 'to borrow') is a recent americanism-people round me all 'bot'-all ages. No one 'bums'. So can we give 'bot' precedence. Also 'dreamtime' is a translation of the arrente word alcheringa. It is not a 'literal' translation which would be probably impossible. The language and cultural differences are too large. Finally is it true that 'undercover area' is actually used in common speech? To me it sounds like a bureaucratic euphemism, issued from an Education dept.</p>
<p><a name="bum" id="bum"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">bum</span></h3>
<p>Well, it's far more common in my experience for people to <i>bum</i> smokes etc. My feeling would be that bot (in the sense of asking) only arose in a roundabout way, i.e. because it also meant bum (as in buttocks), and bum already had another meaning (asking). But I could be wrong. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 06:15, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well people have been 'botting' from me since at least 1979-bumming is a more recent americanism-its not an 'australian' word. So I maintain that bot should have precedence.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_A._Warbuton_2073.html" title="User:Eric A. Warbuton">Eric A. Warbuton</a> 07:10, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Macquarie has "bum", to cadge, as only from 1978. And further, from the OED has "bot" from 1934 thus:</p>
<p><i>1934 Bulletin (Sydney) 7 Nov. 46/2 Settle up when I sell me next picture... Never did like botting on a bloke. 1941 BAKER N.Z.

<dl>
<dd>All I can tell you is that I have lived in WA for virtually all of my life and had never heard bot used in that way until a few years ago, whereas I had used bum used in the sense of cadge for as long as I can remember. If bot was ever the norm in WA, it hasn't been for at least 30 years. I remember some people also saying "tax", as in e.g. "can I tax a durry". <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 09:24, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>My experience (ACT/ NSW) is that we would use <i>cadge</i> or <i>bot</i> and understand what someone meant by <i>bum</i>. Our dog might attempt to bot some food during a barbecue or cadge, never bum. For begging cigarettes as above, cadge, bot or perhaps bum - though not a word I would use&#160;:-)--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 20:05, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The TV generation seems to be speaking most volubly through much of the Australian slang talk in Wikipedia, and it seems very confused about what is Australian and what is American, poor souls. I've lived in NSW virtually all of my 52 years and the only time I've heard 'bum a cigarette' is on some US song; I think it was 'Mr Bojangles'. It's always been 'bludge' a cigarette as long as I can recall. Rarely, perhaps I might have heard 'bot'. If someone wanted to bum a smoke from me I'd assume he was a Yank, or watched too much telly (by which, of course, I mean any telly at all).

<dd>A couple of points: (1) It's wrong to be assuming that the rest of Australia does what NSW does, when slang is often quite localised. I'm 40 and grew up in the WA <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheatbelt_%28Western_Australia%29_3306.html" title="Wheatbelt (Western Australia)">Wheatbelt</a>, and the word used over here for asking for a <i>durry</i> has been <i>bum</i> for as long as I can remember. I hadn't heard <i>bot</i> until a few years ago, so that seems to be an example of nationwide TV having an influence on this side of the country.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think TV has much to do with <i>bum</i>, because in the area in which I grew up we didn't even have a TV signal until I was six years old, by which time I would have seen and heard plenty of adults bumming (<i>not</i> botting) cigs off each other. My theory is that bum come not from TV but from US personnel based here during WW2. Their influence was proporionally a lot higher in places like Perth, Brisbane and Townsville because of the smaller populations and because there were more Americans concentrated in those cities. For example, the older generation here in Perth say <i>crosswalk</i> instead of pedestrian crossing, zebra crossing, etc. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 09:49, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No I dont think so. You might use it that way. But technically "literal" would mean that "alcheringa" has the exact meaning as "dreamtime" which it cant. It was the best, or most approximate translation of the word. Arrente and English have, apart from concrete nouns, very little correspondence. Only cultures that are very similar can have literal translations between each other. Anyway "alcheringa" is one word and dreamtime is composed of two. It is not a "literal" translation.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_A._Warbuton_2073.html" title="User:Eric A. Warbuton">Eric A. Warbuton</a> 06:36, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry Eric, but "literal translation" does mean "word for word". In any case, if you are saying that it is not a word for word translation of an Arrernte word then we shouldn't need mention Arrernte as the word/concept is clearly very widespread, if not universal, to Aboriginal cultures. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 09:24, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well if it was literal, do you mean dream to be:</p>

<p>b)A train of thoughts, images, or fancies passing through the mind during sleep?</p>
<p>c) To have visions and imaginary sense-impressions during the day?</p>
<p>'Dreamtime' was translated from the Arrente in 1899 by Spencer&amp;Gillen (see OED) Which sense did they mean it? And the Arrente?

<dl>
<dd><i>In 1984 the Sydney Morning Herald reported: ‘Jim Kable believes that "dinkum" may come from the Cantonese expression "din kum", meaning "real gold". It would have come, he says, from Chinese workers during the gold rush’. This furphy is still often repeated... It is true that one of the meanings of the Mandarin word ding is ‘very; most; extremely’, hence in Mandarin ‘extremely gold’ would be ding jin, but this collocation can’t possibly be the progenitor of our Aussie dinkum. Cantonese comes closer to putative parenthood with ding kam (‘top gold’). The trouble is that we haven’t a shred of evidence that this collocation was ever used by the Chinese, whether on the goldfields or out of them... However, all the evidence to hand leads to the conclusion that (apart from a single word pakapoo, which is the name of a Chinese gambling game) Australian English did not borrow any words from Chinese. Furthermore, where there is British dialect evidence for the provenance of an Australian word, this is usually to be preferred. A surprising amount of Australian slang derives from British dialects.</i></dd>

<dd><i>In the dialects of Lincolnshire and Derbyshire there is a word dinkum (dincum in Derby) which means ‘work; a fair share of work’. It is not widely recorded, but there is an 1891 record from a coal-miner who says ‘I can stand plenty o’ dincum’, that is, ‘I can put up with any amount of fair work’; and from north Lincolnshire there’s the record of a person who says ‘You have gotten to do your dinkum, soä you understand’. The first record of the word in Australia has this meaning. It occurs in Rolf Boldrewood’s Robbery Under Arms(1888): ‘It took us an hour’s hard dinkum to get near the peak’...</i></dd>

<p>If I may add to the confusion... The Next Whole Earth Catalog, 1980, quotes Robert Rodale's Organic Gardening Magazine thus:</p>
<p>Once I caught myself saying, "This is fair dinkum."</p>
<p>Queer phrase to be served up in my mind. I hadn't used it in years. Learned it from an Australian soldier on a bus ride when I was 15. He said, "In Australia, we say fair dinkum for okay. It means something's all right." Years later I spotted the phrase, "Vere dignum" in a Latin prayerbook. It means, "Fitting indeed." Fair dinkum is obviously an anglicized, latter-day version of vere dignum.</p>

My first point of note is that under "bludger", there is reference to a "scab" in trade union terms. I think this is flat out wrong as a bludger just doesn't do any work whereas a scab does, but is non-union (often brought in during a strike). Are there many people who have heard a scab deliberately called a bludger purely for their non-unions status? <a href="../../../c/i/t/User%7ECitizen_D_640b.html" title="User:Citizen D">Citizen D</a> 00:12, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>bogan: I've always taken it to mean a specific stereotype, not just any "lower class white Australian" -- it is someone that wears thight black jeans, moccasins, a megadeth T-shirt, has a mullet and most likely you see them hanging out at the train station drinking VB.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rhyming slang: a post-1970s phenomenon?</span></h2>
<p>I am quite dubious about assertions that rhyming slang was widespread in Australia until very recently; in fact, I assert the opposite. Neither my father nor I had heard of it until at least the 1970s (although I grant that there was probably some before then). He (aged 80) and I (52) are both lifelong Sydneysiders. We come from a working class background and both have knocked around in factories, building sites and a very wide variety of industries. He left school at the age 12 in 1937 and worked in many factories, shops and workshops and had ample opportunity to hear Aussie slang, and is a past master of it. We aren't entirely stupid. He is now a PhD with English as part of his studies, my bachelor's degree is in English including linguistics. Neither of us has lived long away from Sydney. I remember rhyming slang being popularised on TV (the UK's show 'Minder', and, if I recall correctly, the UK comedian Ugly Dave Grey). Since then, the received wisdom always seems to be on the side of a long, grand tradition of Australian rhyming slang, but I doubt it and hope someone gives evidence in the Wikipedia article. The article as it stands hints that rhyming slang is not as popular now as it was long ago (say, the 1890s); I believe it to be exactly the converse, and I have just spent a solid year in private study of Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson and the Bulletin school of writers c. 1880 - 1910, though I admit I might easily have missed something. Could my old man and I be bonkers on this? Of course. But please, someone, convince us.

<dd>When the question is asked, there always seems to be an Australian who <i>swears</i> that rhyming slang is very Australian, and that it is widespread. However few of the terms listed in this article seem to be used in real-life very frequently. I <i>have</i> heard many of them, but frequently this was in tv shows like <i>Paul Hogan Show</i> and <i>Kingswood Country</i>. I think I have heard <i>Reg Grundies</i> used once, but that was an announcer on <i>JJJ</i> radio. So it was not in naturaly, everyday speech.

<dd>The structure of the page is that general terms come first, and then someone has decided to group "Terms for people" somewhere else. I didn't organise it that way, but it just evolved into that format. To follow your logic where <i>everything</i> should be in the general list, then <i>all</i> terms listed in terms for people should be copied up into there as well (and with differing descriptions too). I don't see what the problem is, because the words you were adding and reinstating were in the article all along. The example from the Olympics/American comics (below), <i>did not</i> make it clear that it was intended as a send-up of a <i>mistaken</i> use of the terms, so could have easily misled casual international readers. (DELETED BLOKE TEXT: <b>bloke</b> - a slang word for <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy.html" title="Guy">guy</a>, usually means an <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult.html" title="Adult">adult</a> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man.html" title="Man">man</a>.

<dd>Well, I didn't realise that it was listed below as well, when I wrote it, because I had presumed that the general list included everything - therefore if there was no text there, then "mate" was not included. I don't care what the definition is, just so long as it is included. And I thought that including *famous* comedic quotes which explain the use of the word was very relevant. Its not my fault if you weren't alive in 1984 to hear it, or didn't ever see D Generation etc who copied it. It was obvious enough to me, but to you I guess it was not. A bit like how you think you have a right to randomly deleted entries that people put in and add rude comments about it, when in fact you have no such right. 59.167.139.163 15:07, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I thought it was a briliant piece of insight into Australian culture and I was so disappointed to find out they were supposed to be saying "Mine". 203.214.74.36 13:42, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Car make names</span></h2>
<p>Is it appropriate to have the make or trade names of commercial motor vehicles (Falcon, Commodore, Magna) listed here? If we start listing trade names for commercial items in Australia that are only trade names, then this page will get <i>very</i> long. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinorEdit_0301.html" title="User:MinorEdit">MinorEdit</a> 20:24, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know where you're coming from but as I see it the page is designed (e.g.) to assist people to understand every day Australian conversation and car names are in every day use. While "Ford" wouldn't need explaining to someone from Greenland, "Falcon" or "Holden" would. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 04:31, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gupta and Deepak</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to hear from anyone living in the Sydney metropolitan area in relation to whether they have heard the terms "Gupta" or "Deepak" being used playfully in reference to a person (generally male) of Indian, Pakistani or Nepalese persuations. The terms are actually common Indian names as far as I am aware. I have heard these terms used increasingly over the last few years, particularly in Western Sydney. I'm not sure if these are very new terms or slow developing terms. Any feedback would be good, particularly if you live in Western Sydney.</p>
<p>Examples of the terms used:</p>
<p>1. "Hey mate, have you seen the new Gupta who started here the other week, he works in accounts"</p>
<p>2. "Hey buddy, check this Deepak out!"</p>
<p>I have a feeling these are very new terms and confined to only a few pockets of NSW.</p>
<p>I'm dying to know if anyone else knows about them. The curiosity is killing me. Yes I know I have too much time on my hands&#160;:) - <a href="../../../n/j/v/User%7ENjvanhouten_8b6b.html" title="User:Njvanhouten">Nigel J Van Houten</a> 03:18, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
