<p><b><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a> rock</b> and pop musicians have produced a wide variety of music. While many musicians and bands have had considerable international success, there remains some debate over whether Australian popular music really has a distinctive sound. Perhaps the most striking common feature of Australian music, like many other Australian art forms, is the dry, often self-deprecating humor evident in the lyrics. Australian music also tends to distinguish itself from the rock styles of other nations by a heavy focus on melody and complex, reggae- and jazz-inspired rhythms. Even hard rock and heavy metal groups, from <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_Chisel_447c.html" title="Cold Chisel">Cold Chisel</a> through to <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_Animals_a5f8.html" title="Baby Animals">Baby Animals</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Tattoo_7d98.html" title="Rose Tattoo">Rose Tattoo</a> all had a strong sense of melody and are notable for joyous tunes.</p>
<p>Until the late 1960s, many have argued that Australian popular music was largely indistinguishable from imported music: British to begin with, then gradually more and more American in the post-war years. The sudden arrival of the 1960s underground movement into the mainstream in the early 1970s changed Australian music permanently: <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyhooks.html" title="Skyhooks">Skyhooks</a> were far from the first people to write songs in Australia, by Australians, about Australia, but they <i>were</i> the first ones ever to make money doing it. The two best-selling albums ever made (at that time) put Australian music on the map. Within a few years, the novelty had worn off and it became commonplace to hear distinctively Australian lyrics and sometimes sounds side-by-side with the imitators and the imports.</p>

<p>In the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> American <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockabilly.html" title="Rockabilly">rockabilly</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_roll.html" title="Rock and roll">rock and roll</a> music was taken up by local musicians and it soon caught on with fans. A small independent Sydney label, <a href="../../../f/e/s/Festival_Records_d194.html" title="Festival Records">Festival Records</a>, led the charge, releasing <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haley_a641.html" title="Bill Haley">Bill Haley</a>'s "Rock Around The Clock" in Australia in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> after it had been turned down by the local branch of <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decca_Records_8e99.html" title="Decca Records">Decca Records</a>. It became the biggest-selling hit ever released in Australia up to that time, and its success led to Festival becoming the dominant Australian pop music label for the next fifteen years. Their commercial success was surpassed only by the multi-national British recording giant <a href="../../../e/m/i/EMI_68e5.html" title="EMI">EMI</a>, who dominated the charts thanks to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">the Beatles</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hollies_a38f.html" title="The Hollies">the Hollies</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Byrds_72ba.html" title="The Byrds">the Byrds</a> and the other leading 'Beat' groups on their catalogue.</p>
<p>The most famous exponent of the so-called "First Wave" of Australian rock'n'roll was <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_O%27Keefe_614a.html" title="Johnny O'Keefe">Johnny O'Keefe</a>. Inspired by <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Richard_892a.html" title="Little Richard">Little Richard</a>, he carved out a unique career and became a legend of Australian rock music, and hosted one of Australia's first TV pop shows, "Six O'Clock Rock". No less a figure than <a href="../../../i/g/g/Iggy_Pop_f985.html" title="Iggy Pop">Iggy Pop</a> acknowledged O'Keefe's importance when he recorded a version of O'Keefe's hit "Real Wild Child" in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. For a few years, O'Keefe and other local rockers like Lonnie Lee &amp; The Leemen, Dig Richards &amp; The R'Jays, Col Joye &amp; The Joy Boys, Alan Dale &amp; The Houserockers, Ray Hoff &amp; The Offbeats, Digger Revell &amp; The Denvermen and New Zealand's Johnny Devlin &amp; The Devils whipped up excitement on a par with their American inspirations.</p>
<p>The success of these 'First Wave' artists was shortlived, and by the early '60s it began to fade. Between O'Keefe's last major hit in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Thorpe_cf4f.html" title="Billy Thorpe">Billy Thorpe</a>'s first hit in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, the local pop scene became noticeably blander and more conservative. The charts were dominated by clean-cut acts, like the members of the so-called "Bandstand family", most of whom were signed to Festival and were regular guests on Australia's leading TV pop show, 'Bandstand', which explicitly aimed to appeal to anyone "from eight to eighty".</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there were some exciting undercurrents. A notable alternative to the mainstream pop fare was the emergence of instrumental and 'surf' groups, notably <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Atlantics_a26a.html" title="The Atlantics">The Atlantics</a> and The Denvermen in Sydney, and Melbourne's, The Thunderbirds. Many of the players in these dance bands had come from the jazz scene, and were also strongly influenced by the R&amp;B and "jump" music of performers like Louis Jordan. Others were inspired by figures like American surf guitar maestros <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Dale_e816.html" title="Dick Dale">Dick Dale</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/a/Duane_Eddy_b18b.html" title="Duane Eddy">Duane Eddy</a>, and particularly by the all-pervasive popularity of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shadows_%28band%29_5b2c.html" title="The Shadows (band)">the Shadows</a> and American band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ventures_b837.html" title="The Ventures">the Ventures</a>. The Shadows' influence on Australasian pop and rock music of the Sixties and Seventies is still much underrated, and their lead guitarist <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Marvin_fe67.html" title="Hank Marvin">Hank Marvin</a> probably inspired more aspiring <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_guitar.html" title="Electric guitar">electric guitarists</a> than any other figure in popular music until the advent of <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Clapton_2d16.html" title="Eric Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>.</p>
<p>These instrumental outfits cut their teeth playing on the booming dance circuits in Australia's major cities and regional towns. Like <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_jazz.html" title="Australian jazz">Australian jazz</a> bands of the period, these rock'n'roll musicians became extremely accomplished players. Because dance patrons in those days actually danced as couples to traditional rhythms, dance bands in Australia and New Zealand tended to play a much wider variety of musical styles than their American or British jazz counterparts — it was not unusual for Australasian bands of this period to have literally hundreds of songs in their repertoire, ranging from current rock'n'roll and pop hit to the standards of the Twenties, Thirties and Forties.</p>
<p>Many of these instrumental groups survived into the Beatles era by adding a lead singer, and several evolved into some of the top bands of that next wave. Surf music and local dance crazes like "The Stomp" were hugely popular at the time, even though they rarely rate a mention these days.</p>

<p>Although most of the Australian and New Zealand pop/rock music of this era went unheard by international audiences, a few Antipodean acts did manage to make an impression overseas. Singer <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Ifield_ce3a.html" title="Frank Ifield">Frank Ifield</a> was one of the very first Australian postwar performers to gain widespread international recognition. He was hugely successful in the UK in the early Sixties, becoming the first performer to have three consecutive #1 hits there, and his biggest hit, "I Remember You" was#1 in the UK and was also a Top 5 hit in the U.S.A. Singer comedian and artist <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolf_Harris_544a.html" title="Rolf Harris">Rolf Harris</a> also had several novelty hits during this period and went on to become a fixture on British television with his own popular variety show.</p>

<p>Facilitated by the deep cultural, linguistic and economic links between Britain and its former colonies, the Beatles and other <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Invasion_612b.html" title="British Invasion">British Invasion</a> groups had a massive impact on the Australasian music scene. Many of these bands toured Australia and New Zealand to wild receptions in the mid-Sixties. When The Beatles' epoch-making 1964 Australian tour arrived in <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, an estimated 300,000 people — about <b>one-third</b> of the city's entire population at that time — turned out to see them as their motorcade made its way from the airport to the city.</p>
<p>The tours and recordings by these new 'Beat' groups revitalised the pop genre and inspired scores of new and established groups, who quickly developed a vibrant and distinctive local inflection of the 60s 'beat music' craze. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Easybeats_827d.html" title="The Easybeats">The Easybeats</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bee_Gees_e35d.html" title="The Bee Gees">The Bee Gees</a> are probably the best-known acts from this era to gain success outside Australia, but by the mid-Sixties there were literally hundreds of bands working almost every night of the week in Australia and New Zealand.</p>

Also of note were cult acts such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Missing_Links_f8fb.html" title="The Missing Links">the Missing Links</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple_Hearts_%28Australian_band%29_78c5.html" title="Purple Hearts (Australian band)">the Purple Hearts</a>, The Wild Cherries, The Creatures and the Throb, who had only limited success at the time but whose 'heavier' sound would exert a significant influence on later bands like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Saints_%28band%29_eec1.html" title="The Saints (band)">The Saints</a>.</p>
<p>It was during the '60s that New Zealand performers began to move to Australia in search of wider opportunities. Although their origins are often overlooked (in much the same way that Canadian performers like <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Young_9315.html" title="Neil Young">Neil Young</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/n/Joni_Mitchell_0ba3.html" title="Joni Mitchell">Joni Mitchell</a> are routinely classified as "American") these trans-Tasman performers — people like <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Merritt_d585.html" title="Max Merritt">Max Merritt</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Rudd_f8ca.html" title="Mike Rudd">Mike Rudd</a>, Dinah Lee, Ray Columbus, Dave Miller, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruno_Lawrence_56d6.html" title="Bruno Lawrence">Bruno Lawrence</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_%28band%29.html" title="Dragon (band)">Dragon</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/l/Split_Enz_7b15.html" title="Split Enz">Split Enz</a> — have exerted a tremendous influence on Australian popular music.</p>
<p>Another significant Australian from this period, and one whose importance is only now beginning to be widely recognised, was the critic and journalist <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lillian_Roxon_1628.html" title="Lillian Roxon">Lillian Roxon</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> – <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>), who grew up in Brisbane but who was based in New York from <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> until her premature death from <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a>. She was a close friend of feminist writer <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germaine_Greer_9ba6.html" title="Germaine Greer">Germaine Greer</a>, photographer <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_McCartney_2d21.html" title="Linda McCartney">Linda McCartney</a>, poet <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delmore_Schwartz_15cd.html" title="Delmore Schwartz">Delmore Schwartz</a>, artist <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Warhol_b973.html" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> and many musicians including <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Reed_999a.html" title="Lou Reed">Lou Reed</a>. Roxon wrote the world's first Rock Encyclopedia, published in 1969, and her writings about pop music and musicians were central to the development of serious rock criticism and rock journalism in the late 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>By far the most influential and popular music-related periodical of this period was the weekly magazine <i><a href="../../../g/o/-/Go-Set_bbb8.html" title="Go-Set">Go-Set</a></i>, which was published from 1966 to 1975. Founded in Melbourne in 1966 by a group of former [[Monash University student including Philip Frazer. Tony Schauble and Doug Panther, <i>Go-Set</i> chronicled all of the major events, trends, fads and performers in Australian popular music, as well as featuring regular columns by renowned Melbourne radio DJ <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Rofe_11f0.html" title="Stan Rofe">Stan Rofe</a> and Aussie fashion designer Prue Acton.</p>
<p><a href="http://au.geocities.com/gosetcharts/index.html" class="external text" title="http://au.geocities.com/gosetcharts/index.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Go-Set</i> also published the first national Australian pop charts</a> in October 1966 (all charts prior to this were state-based) and it gave extensive coverage to overseas musical developments -- it was one of the first international music papers to report on the emergence of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> and two staff members -- writer <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lily_Brett_5471.html" title="Lily Brett">Lily Brett</a> and photographer Colin Beard -- travelled to the USA and the UK in mid-1967, reporting on the famous <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monterey_International_Pop_Festival_1a1f.html" title="Monterey International Pop Festival">Monterey International Pop Festival</a> and the burgeoning music scene in London, as well as chronicling the exploits of Australian musicians overseas including <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normie_Rowe_4506.html" title="Normie Rowe">Normie Rowe</a> and Lynne Randell. Another aspect of <i>Go-Set's</i> activities was it's exclusive reporting &amp; promotion of Australia's prestigious annual rock band competition, <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoadley%27s_Battle_of_the_Sounds_88f5.html" title="Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds">Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds</a>, which ran from 1966 to 1972.</p>
<p>Although it was explicitly established as a 'teen' magazine, in its later years, inspired by newer publications like <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a> magazine, <i>Go-Set</i> took on a more mature presentation, with numerous rock performers including Jim Keays and Wendy Saddington writing for the magazine. In 1970 former columnist <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Meldrum_9298.html" title="Ian Meldrum">Ian Meldrum</a> scored a world exclusive for <i>Go-Set</i> when he interviewed <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> in London, during which Lennon made his first public announcement that The Beatles were breaking up.</p>

<p>After a period of flux in the late 60s, during which almost all of the dominant 60s acts dissolved or faded from view, Australian rock moved into the so-called "The Third Wave" (1970 – 1975), a fertile period in which newer performers and veterans of the 60s Beat Boom coalesced into new formations and developed a more mature, progressive and distinctively Australian rock style. Some of these acts were successful within Australia, but few managed to achieve any lasting local or overseas success, due to the combination of poor management, lack of record company support and lack of radio exposure.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rock.html" title="Edit section: Early &quot;Third Wave&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early "Third Wave"</span></h3>
<p>Until the late 1970s, many Australian performers found it hard to become established and to maintain their profile, because of the difficulty in getting airplay on radio. Until 1975, Australian pop radio was dominated by a clique of commercial broadcasters who virtually had the field to themselves and their influence over government was such that, incredibly, no new radio licences had been issued in any Australian capital city since the prevailing industry structure had been consolidated in the early 1930s. All commercial pop radio was broadcast on the AM band, in mono, and the commercial sector strenuously resisted calls to grant new licences, introduce community broadcasting and open up the FM band (then only used for TV broadcasts in Australia) even though FM rock radio was already well-established in the United States.</p>
<p>Many of the more progressively-oriented artists found themselves locked out of Australian commercial radio, which concentrated on high-rotation 3-minute pop single programming. This was a result of the widespread adoption of the American-inspired "More Music" format, which had been pioneered in Los Angeles with great success by the Drake-Chenault programming consultancy.</p>
<p>There was a great deal of innovative and exciting music produced; although few Australians got to hear more than a fraction of it at the time, this music is undergoing a major resurgence both locally and internationally, since Australia is one of the last untapped resources of 20th-century popular music.</p>
<p>Landmark acts of this period include <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spectrum_%28band%29.html" title="Spectrum (band)">Spectrum</a> and its successor <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariel_%28band%29.html" title="Ariel (band)">Ariel (band)</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/d/Daddy_Cool_%28band%29_4ced.html" title="Daddy Cool (band)">Daddy Cool</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackfeather.html" title="Blackfeather">Blackfeather</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flying_Circus_%28band%29_6f0d.html" title="The Flying Circus (band)">The Flying Circus</a>,Tully (band), <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamam_Shud_c528.html" title="Tamam Shud">Tamam Shud</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Morris_4d65.html" title="Russell Morris">Russell Morris</a>, Jeff St John &amp; Copperwine, Chain, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Thorpe_cf4f.html" title="Billy Thorpe">Billy Thorpe</a> &amp; The (new) Aztecs, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Company_Caine_b321.html" title="Company Caine">Company Caine</a>, Kahvas Jute, Country Radio, Max Merritt &amp; The Meteors, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_La_De_Das_6bac.html" title="The La De Das">The La De Das</a>, Madder Lake, former Easybeats lead singer <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Wright_b89c.html" title="Stevie Wright">Stevie Wright</a>, Wendy Saddington, The 69'ers, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Captain_Matchbox_Whoopee_Band_dd17.html" title="The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band">The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band</a> and country-rock pioneers <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dingoes_15dd.html" title="The Dingoes">The Dingoes</a>.</p>
<p>Rock musicals were another important development in Australia at this time. The local production of <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_%28musical%29.html" title="Hair (musical)">Hair (musical)</a> brought future "Queen of Pop" <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcia_Hines_f7bf.html" title="Marcia Hines">Marcia Hines</a> to Australia in 1970. In 1972 the hugely successful and much-praised Sydney production of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_9292.html" title="Jesus Christ Superstar">Jesus Christ Superstar</a> premiered, and this production alone included Marcia Hines, <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_English_577e.html" title="Jon English">Jon English</a>, theatre legend <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reg_Livermore_cb99.html" title="Reg Livermore">Reg Livermore</a>, the two main members of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Supply_f9b7.html" title="Air Supply">Air Supply</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Wright_b89c.html" title="Stevie Wright">Stevie Wright</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_Young_f570.html" title="John Paul Young">John Paul Young</a>. It was directed by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Sharman_a2f9.html" title="Jim Sharman">Jim Sharman</a>, who went on to lasting international success as the director of the both the original stage production and the film version of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rocky_Horror_Show_5b60.html" title="The Rocky Horror Show">The Rocky Horror Show</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside the more 'adult' acts was a raft of successful pop-oriented groups and solo artists, including <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherbet_%28band%29.html" title="Sherbet (band)">Sherbet</a>, Hush, Ray Burgess, the <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Mulry_Gang_5578.html" title="Ted Mulry Gang">Ted Mulry Gang</a> (TMG) and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_Young_f570.html" title="John Paul Young">John Paul Young</a>, who went on to become the first Australian performer to have a major hit in multiple international markets with his perennial "Love Is In The Air" (1978) — a song which was, not coincidentally, written and produced by former Easybeats Harry Vanda and George Young, the masterminds behind many of the biggest Australian hits of the mid-to-late Seventies. The tail-end of the Second Wave gave birth to the record-breaking Skyhooks, who bridged the transition from the Third Wave into the period of the so-called <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Wave_music_2b3e.html" title="New Wave music">New Wave music</a> acts of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Sherbet was undoubtedly the most successful of these.</p>
<p>The early 1970s also witnessed the first major <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_festival.html" title="Rock festival">rock festivals</a> in Australia, which were closely modelled on the fabled <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodstock_Festival_2b33.html" title="Woodstock Festival">Woodstock</a> festival of 1969. The festival era was exemplified by the annual <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunbury_music_festival.html" title="Sunbury music festival">Sunbury music festival</a>, held outside Melbourne, Victoria each January from 1972 to 1975. Although there were numerous other smaller festivals, most were not successful and failed to have the lasting impact of Sunbury. After the disastrous 1975 festival, which sent the promoters broke, large-scale festivals were considered too risky and were only rarely staged in Australia until the advent of the annual <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Day_Out_04f8.html" title="Big Day Out">Big Day Out</a> in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Two important changes which had a dramatic affect the rock scene were the long-overdue introduction of colour television and FM radio in 1975. This period also saw the decline of the booming local dance and discotheque circuit that had flourished in the 1960s and early Seventies. These rock dances were a continuation of the social dance circuit that had thrived in Australia's cities and suburbs since the <a href="../../../1/8/0/1800s.html" title="1800s">1800s</a>, and they were hugely popular from the late Fifties to the early Seventies, but they gradually faded in the early Seventies as the "Babby Boomer" generation grew into adulthood and changes to lecencing laws saw <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pubs.html" title="Pubs">pubs</a> take on an increasingly important role as venues for live music.</p>
<p>From the 1950s to the early 1970s, the main venues for live music were discotheques (usually located in inner city areas), church, municipal and community halls, Police Boys' Clubs and beachside surf clubs. Bigger concerts and internatioal tours were usually staged in the few large-size venues, such as the legendary <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Stadium_0e58.html" title="Sydney Stadium">Sydney Stadium</a> (originally built as a boxing arena), the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Trocadero_b4e6.html" title="Sydney Trocadero">Sydney Trocadero</a>, and Brisbane and Melbourne Festival Hall. Such venues regularly attracted large numbers of young people because they were supervised, all-ages events — Australia's restrictive liquor licensing laws of the period meant that these venues and dances were almost always alcohol-free.</p>
<p>According to rock historian <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_A_Baker_7644.html" title="Glenn A Baker">Glenn A Baker</a>, in 1965 there were up to 100 dances being held every weekend in and around Melbourne alone. The most popular groups frequently played almost every night of the week, commonly commuting around town, performing short sets at three or more different dances every night. It was a very lucrative circuit for musicians and even moderately popular acts could easily earn considerably more than the average weekly wage at that time.</p>
<p>The decline of the local dance circuit, combined with the fact that the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_boom.html" title="Baby boom">baby boom</a> teenagers of the Sixties were now ageing into adulthood, led to the rise of a thriving new city and suburban <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pub.html" title="Pub">pub</a> music circuit in the mid-70s, which in turn spawned a new generation of bands who cut their teeth in this often tough but formative training ground.</p>
<p><a name="1974:_Countdown"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rock.html" title="Edit section: 1974: Countdown">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1974: <i>Countdown</i></span></h3>

<p>Teen-oriented pop music still enjoyed strong popularity during the 1970s, although much of it was sourced from overseas, and the proportion of Australian acts in the charts had hit an all-time low by 1973. That trend began to change around 1975, thanks largely to the advent of a new weekly TV pop show, <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Countdown_%28TV_series%29_df80.html" title="Countdown (TV series)">Countdown</a></i>, in late 1974. It gained a huge audience and soon exerted a strong influence on radio programmers, because it was broadcast nationwide on Australia's government-owned broadcaster, the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation_9631.html" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (ABC). <i>Countdown</i> was the most popular music programs in Australian TV history, and it had a marked effect on radio because of its loyal national audience — and the amount of Australian content it featured.</p>
<p>The most important feature of Countdown was that it became a critical new interface between the record industry and radio. By the late 1970s, radio programmers ignored Countdown's hit picks at their peril. Host <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian__Molly__Meldrum_af08.html" title="Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum">Ian "Molly" Meldrum</a> also frequently used the show to castigate local radio for its lack of support for Australian music. Unlike commercial TV or radio, Countdown was not answerable to advertisers or sponsors, and (in theory) it was far less susceptible to influence from record companies. Like no other ABC program before or since, it openly and actively promoted the products of these private companies and even back in the Seventies, there's no doubt that there would have been a major controversy if the ABC had used its resources to promote the products of any other private industry so blatantly. Yet, it was able to do so because the public, the regulators and the policy-makers evidently regarded pop records and music videos as somehow standing outside the realm of everyday commerce.</p>
<p>Countdown was crucial to the success of acts like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_Young_f570.html" title="John Paul Young">John Paul Young</a>, Sherbet, Skyhooks, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_%28band%29.html" title="Dragon (band)">Dragon</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/l/Split_Enz_7b15.html" title="Split Enz">Split Enz</a>, and it dominated Australian popular music well into the 1980s, although some critics felt that in later years it tended to concentrate on pop-oriented major-label acts and that it failed to reflect much of the exciting independent scene of the time.</p>

Double Jay banner</div>

<p>In the long term, one of the most important changes to the Australian music industry in the 1970s (and beyond) turned out to be the founding of the ABC's first all-rock radio station, Double Jay (2JJ) in Sydney in January 1975. It is indicative of the conservative nature of the Australian media and its regulators that Double Jay was the first new radio licence issued in an Australian capital city in more than 40 years. It was also Australia's first non-commercial 24-hour rock station, and the first to employ women disc jockeys.</p>
<p>Double-Jay's wide-ranging programming policies were influenced by British '60s <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate_radio.html" title="Pirate radio">pirate radio</a>, the early programming of <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_One_22f7.html" title="BBC Radio One">BBC Radio One</a>, and the American album-oriented rock (<a href="../../../a/l/b/Album_Oriented_Rock_d154.html" title="Album Oriented Rock">AOR</a>) format. The new station opened up the airwaves to a vast amount of new local music, introduced listeners to important overseas innovations like <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggae.html" title="Reggae">reggae</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dub.html" title="Dub">dub</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_rock.html" title="Progressive rock">progressive rock</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Wave_music_2b3e.html" title="New Wave music">New Wave</a> -- music that had been largely ignored by commercial radio. Double Jay also featured an unprecedented level of Australian content, and presented regular live concert broadcasts, comedy, controversial documentaries and innovative radiophonic features.</p>
<p>Double-Jay quickly made a significant mark on the ratings in its target age group, much to the dismay of its major commercial competitor, Sydney's <a href="../../../2/s/m/2SM_0afc.html" title="2SM">2SM</a> (then Australia's top rating and most profitable pop station) and, in concert with <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Countdown_%28TV_series%29_df80.html" title="Countdown (TV series)">Countdown</a></i>, Triple J was a crucial Australian outlet for the emerging <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Wave_music_2b3e.html" title="New Wave music">New Wave</a> music styles of the late 1970s. Much of this music was considered too extreme for commercial radio and it is doubtful that much of it would have been heard otherwise, but after 1975 it soon became an established pattern for Double Jay to break new overseas acts like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Clash_8395.html" title="The Clash">The Clash</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Police_9a4c.html" title="The Police">The Police</a>, or local acts like Midnight Oil and The Birthday Party, after which they were (usually) considered "safe" for commercial radio.</p>
<p>Despite the constant downplaying of its significance by the commercial sector, the importance and influence on Double Jay/Triple-J on the Australian music industry and Australian commercial radio cannot be underestimated.</p>

<p>The advent Double Jay and <i>Countdown</i> fundamentally changed the political economy of Australian popular music, and the pub circuit gave rise to a newer generation of tough, uncompromising, adult-oriented rock bands.</p>
<p>One of the most popular Australian groups to emerge in this period was the classic <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_pub_rock.html" title="Australian pub rock">Australian pub rock</a> band <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_Chisel_447c.html" title="Cold Chisel">Cold Chisel</a>, which formed in <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> and enjoyed tremendous success in Australia in the late 1970s and early 1980s, although they never managed to break into other countries.</p>
<p>Other popular acts from this transitional period include <a href="../../../a/c/2F/AC_DC_2284.html" title="AC/DC">AC/DC</a>, Skyhooks, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Clapton_4992.html" title="Richard Clapton">Richard Clapton</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/27/Ol%27_55.html" title="Ol' 55">Ol' 55</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_English_577e.html" title="Jon English">Jon English</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/_/Jo_Jo_Zep_%26_the_Falcons_6df7.html" title="Jo Jo Zep &amp; the Falcons">Jo Jo Zep &amp; the Falcons</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Angels_%28Australian_band%29_ab4f.html" title="The Angels (Australian band)">The Angels</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sports_53cd.html" title="The Sports">The Sports</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Radiators_%28AU%29_8e42.html" title="The Radiators (AU)">The Radiators</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Crawl_8680.html" title="Australian Crawl">Australian Crawl</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_%28band%29.html" title="Dragon (band)">Dragon</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Tattoo_7d98.html" title="Rose Tattoo">Rose Tattoo</a>, Ross Wilson's <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mondo_Rock_5023.html" title="Mondo Rock">Mondo Rock</a>, acclaimed soul singers <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcia_Hines_f7bf.html" title="Marcia Hines">Marcia Hines</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%C3%A9e_Geyer_7f99.html" title="Renée Geyer">Renée Geyer</a> and pioneering Australian punk/new wave acts <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Saints_b7c4.html" title="The Saints">The Saints</a> (Mk I) and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Birdman_06aa.html" title="Radio Birdman">Radio Birdman</a>. The band Sebastian Hardie became known as the first Australian <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphonic_rock.html" title="Symphonic rock">symphonic rock</a> band in the mid-70s, with the release of their debut <i>Four Moments</i>.</p>
<p>Three "Australian" acts that appeared towards the end of the Second Wave — AC/DC, Little River Band and Split Enz — and lasted into the late 1970s and early 1980s achieved the long sought-after international success that finally took Australasian rock onto the world stage.</p>

<p>AC/DC are perhaps the most notorious group to spring out of Australia. They have sold millions of albums, toured the world several times over, broken countless attendance records, and influenced hard rock music the world over.</p>
<p>From their humble beginnings, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> brothers Angus and Malcolm Young forged a hard-hitting, ball-breaking pub guitar sound. When Bon Scott joined the band to lend his unique vocal talent, the band began their 'long way to the top', shooting to the top of the Australian rock scene in 1974 – 75 and their song "It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock and Roll)". This song is now widely regarded as <i>the</i> Australian rock anthem. The band found a degree of international success, especially with the release of their <i>Highway to Hell</i> album. This was to be Bon Scott's last album. During the subsequent tour, Scott was discovered in the backseat of his car, having choked on his own vomit during a drunken slumber.</p>
<p>The band found a new singer in English-born Brian Johnson, and released their next album, <i>Back In Black</i>, in the early 80s. The U.S. took notice of the band with some of their finest songs, such as the title track and <i>You Shook Me All Night Long</i>, and the band became a huge international act that still endures to this day.</p>
<p>AC/DC are credited as a seminal influence by scores of leading hard rock and heavy metal music acts, and they are now rated the fifth-biggest selling group in U.S. recording history, with total sales of over 100 million records.</p>

<p>By the late 1970s <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a>'s influence had been felt throughout the world, and bands like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Saints_%28band%29_eec1.html" title="The Saints (band)">The Saints</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Birdman_06aa.html" title="Radio Birdman">Radio Birdman</a> (sometimes considered punk rock acts themselves) gained a loyal following (largely thanks to <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_Jay_8c38.html" title="Double Jay">Double Jay</a> and to a lesser extent <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Countdown_%28TV_series%29_df80.html" title="Countdown (TV series)">Countdown</a></i>).

<p>Other developments of the late 1970s were the appearance of early <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_music.html" title="Electronic music">electronic musicians</a> most notable of which were <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>-based <a href="../../../s/e/v/Severed_Heads_8cf9.html" title="Severed Heads">Severed Heads</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>'s <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essendon_Airport_%28band%29_d734.html" title="Essendon Airport (band)">Essendon Airport</a> who began to experiment with tape-loops and synthesisers, but did not rise to prominence until the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>.

In 1980 producer Mark Moffatt pioneered dance technology by becoming the first in the world to use a Roland 808 rhythm composer and MC 4 digital sequencer on record with his studio project the Monitors. Prior to that he had produced (I'm) Stranded with the Saints.</p>

<p>While many Australasian bands from the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> remained cult acts outside of Australia, some, including <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_River_Band_d0a1.html" title="Little River Band">Little River Band</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_at_work.html" title="Men at work">Men at work</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/2F/AC_DC_2284.html" title="AC/DC">AC/DC</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/x/INXS_eedb.html" title="INXS">INXS</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midnight_Oil_304c.html" title="Midnight Oil">Midnight Oil</a> and, later, <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crowded_House_e6fa.html" title="Crowded House">Crowded House</a> and <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kylie_Minogue_fac0.html" title="Kylie Minogue">Kylie Minogue</a>, found wide success throughout the decade.</p>
<p>Critically-acclaimed acts like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_%28band%29_a726.html" title="The Church (band)">The Church</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunters_%26_Collectors_3a39.html" title="Hunters &amp; Collectors">Hunters &amp; Collectors</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hoodoo_Gurus_a75a.html" title="Hoodoo Gurus">Hoodoo Gurus</a>, the second incarnation of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Saints_b7c4.html" title="The Saints">The Saints</a> and a new band formed by Nick Cave and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Harvey_7bbe.html" title="Mick Harvey">Mick Harvey</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Cave_and_the_Bad_Seeds_c0b8.html" title="Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds">Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds</a>, developed strong followings in Europe and other regions. More commercial acts such as singer <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Farnham_c99f.html" title="John Farnham">John Farnham</a> were very successful for many years within Australia, but remain largely unknown outside the country.</p>
<p>Farnham's commercial comeback was one the biggest success stories in Australian music in that decade, the former "King of Pop" spent years out of favour with the public and the industry, often reduced to working in suburban clubs, but he bounded back onto the charts in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> with the album <i>Whispering Jack</i>, which became the biggest-selling album of that year and remains one of the biggest selling Australian records.

<p>The decade also saw perhaps the most concerted examination of the routine and everyday aspects of suburban and inner-city life since perhaps The Executives 1960's classic "Summer Hill Road." This approach was explored not only by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Kelly_%28musician%29_a404.html" title="Paul Kelly (musician)">Paul Kelly</a> and the aforementioned Coloured Girls (in songs like "From St. Kilda To Kings Cross" and "Leaps and Bounds" but also by bands such as The <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Heroes_2aea.html" title="Little Heroes">Little Heroes</a> (eg "Melbourne is Not New York"), <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kennedy%27s_Love_Gone_Wrong_fbc2.html" title="John Kennedy's Love Gone Wrong">John Kennedy's Love Gone Wrong</a> (eg "King Street") and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mexican_Spitfires_9482.html" title="The Mexican Spitfires">The Mexican Spitfires</a> (eg "Sydney Town" and "Town Hall Steps."</p>

These acts often topped the Australian charts but never quite gained the international success that many critics felt they deserved, although many continued with loyal followings well into the 1990s.</p>
<p>One especially noteworthy group in this period was the pioneering Aboriginal group <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warumpi_Band_353e.html" title="Warumpi Band">Warumpi Band</a> from the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Territory_b19a.html" title="Northern Territory">Northern Territory</a>, whose landmark single "Jailanguru Pakarnu (Out from Jail)" was the first rock single ever recorded in an Aboriginal language.

<p><a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_rock.html" title="Detroit rock">Detroit rock</a> bands such as the Celibate Rifles, The Lime Spiders and The Hitmen would serve as a link between the <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garage_rock.html" title="Garage rock">garage rock</a> revival of the 1980s and the <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grunge.html" title="Grunge">grunge</a> scene to follow.</p>

Notable Australian independent acts of the time included the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falling_Joys_0c25.html" title="Falling Joys">Falling Joys</a> from <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>; <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regurgitator.html" title="Regurgitator">Regurgitator</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Dirt_1b62.html" title="Magic Dirt">Magic Dirt</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powderfinger.html" title="Powderfinger">Powderfinger</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custard_%28band%29.html" title="Custard (band)">Custard</a> from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Living_End_a2dc.html" title="The Living End">The Living End</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Three_c26f.html" title="Dirty Three">Dirty Three</a> from Melbourne; <a href="../../../j/e/b/Jebediah.html" title="Jebediah">Jebediah</a> from Perth, <a href="../../../r/a/t/RatCat_c5cb.html" title="RatCat">RatCat</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Clouds_%28Australian_band%29_f7b8.html" title="The Clouds (Australian band)">The Clouds</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crystal_Set_13c7.html" title="The Crystal Set">The Crystal Set</a> from <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whitlams_339f.html" title="The Whitlams">The Whitlams</a>, and <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silverchair.html" title="Silverchair">Silverchair</a>, who began as a teenage combo in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle%2C_New_South_Wales_49e2.html" title="Newcastle, New South Wales">Newcastle</a>, were discovered by Triple-J and have since become one of the most successful Australian bands of all time. The changes brought about in this period and the aforementioned bands are discussed in the book The Sell-In by music journalist <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Mathieson_c2fa.html" title="Craig Mathieson">Craig Mathieson</a>.</p>
<p>Far and away the biggest commercial success of the 1990s was <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electropop.html" title="Electropop">electropop</a> duo <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Garden_2fc8.html" title="Savage Garden">Savage Garden</a>. They shot to fame in 1996, scoring huge hits in Australia, Asia, Europe and America. They became the first Australian act since Men At Work to score two #1 U.S. hits, and their 1999 album <i>Affirmation</i> sold over 5 million copies in the United States. alone. A 2004 report in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald_4298.html" title="The Sydney Morning Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a></i> rated their album <i>Savage Garden</i> at #4 and "Affirmation" at #15 in the list of the 25 biggest-selling albums (from any country) over the last ten years in Australia.</p>
<p>While overseas <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">hip-hop</a> became quite popular in Australia in the early 1990s, and a number of artists began performing it, virtually none of them were signed to record deals or saw mainstream airplay. The one exception was Sound Unlimited, who released one successful album in 199(4)?</p>
<p>The 1990s also saw a rise in popular Australian music and videos for young children, particularly <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wiggles_3936.html" title="The Wiggles">The Wiggles</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/-/Hi-5.html" title="Hi-5">Hi-5</a>.</p>

<p>Australia's predilection for pub rock never really went away, despite the enthusiasm for dance music in the late 1990s. Several Australian rock bands saw international success in Europe and the US. Notable examples include <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Vines_82db.html" title="The Vines">The Vines</a>, who rose to prominence in the UK before becoming known in Australia, and <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_%28band%29.html" title="Jet (band)">Jet</a>. Jet, were influenced by seminal 1960s acts such as the Beatles and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">the Rolling Stones</a>, had their single "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" used in an <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">Apple iPod</a> commercial, and consequently have sold 3 million copies in the US alone. Another band with great success is <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfmother.html" title="Wolfmother">Wolfmother</a>, a hard rock band, very influenced by 70's <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychedelic_rock.html" title="Psychedelic rock">psychedelic rock</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-metal.html" title="Proto-metal">proto-metal</a> bands, like <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sabbath_9b9c.html" title="Black Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Purple_eeae.html" title="Deep Purple">Deep Purple</a>. In 2007 Wolfmother were awarded a Grammy for best hard rock performance for their extremely successful single "Woman".</p>
<p>Apart from those bands which achieved international success, one of the well known Australian rock bands of the 2000s was <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grinspoon.html" title="Grinspoon">Grinspoon</a>. They first achieved success in the music industry in 1995 after being <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unearthed.html" title="Unearthed">Unearthed</a> by Triple J, and have been a mainstay of festivals such as the Big Day Out ever since.</p>
<p>Domestically, <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roots_music.html" title="Roots music">roots music</a>, seemingly a catch-all term for somewhat more laid-back acoustic music covering blues, country and folk influences, came to some prominence, including <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Butler_%28musician%29_02e3.html" title="John Butler (musician)">John Butler</a> leading <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_John_Butler_Trio_769d.html" title="The John Butler Trio">the John Butler Trio</a>, and the plaintive harmonies of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Waifs_211c.html" title="The Waifs">The Waifs</a>. A number of "blues and roots" festivals have sprung up and are attracting large audiences.</p>
<p>As well as these uniquely "Aussie Bands", 2005 in particular sparked many brand new Australian "indie rock" bands such as <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_Of_Fashion_052b.html" title="End Of Fashion">End Of Fashion</a> who won ARIA awards for their debut self-titled album and hit song "Oh Yeah" (as well as performing at the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homebake.html" title="Homebake">Homebake</a> festival and appearing on talk show <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rove_Live_dfd2.html" title="Rove Live">Rove Live</a> several times). There is also <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kisschasy.html" title="Kisschasy">Kisschasy</a> who appeared in concert on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">October 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> with Canadian rock superstars and teen favourite <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_Plan_5b15.html" title="Simple Plan">Simple Plan</a>.</p>
<p>Even at the commercial end of popular music, more attention was finally being paid towards "real" musicians, especially female <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singer-songwriter.html" title="Singer-songwriter">singers-songwriters</a>. A wave of female fronted, <a href="../../../p/j/_/PJ_Harvey_a9b1.html" title="PJ Harvey">PJ Harvey</a>-esque bands emerged in Australia during the early 00's, most notably <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Birdy_f33a.html" title="Little Birdy">Little Birdy</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_Outside_Andromeda_c32c.html" title="Love Outside Andromeda">Love Outside Andromeda</a>. And with the phenomenial success of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missy_Higgins_7fe2.html" title="Missy Higgins">Missy Higgins</a>, artists such as <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Blasko_e39f.html" title="Sarah Blasko">Sarah Blasko</a> and others have found themselves a strong following.</p>

<p>Australian hardcore punk is an active rock music subgenre with a dedicated following. Many bands never tour outside their home state but enjoy a relatively large local fanbase. Recorded material of their work may be hard to acquire as live shows are the mainstay of the scene.</p>
<p>The Do-It-Yourself (DIY) ethic is strong with local distributors and small record labels active in most capital cities. As in the United States some bands are relatively straight edge or are influenced by particular political views or religious convictions.</p>
<p>In recent years, Australian hardcore bands have been growing in fanbase and success, the most notable being Byron Bay's <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkway_Drive_0eba.html" title="Parkway Drive">Parkway Drive</a> signing to American punk/hardcore record label <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epitaph_Records_ed39.html" title="Epitaph Records">Epitaph Records</a>.</p>
