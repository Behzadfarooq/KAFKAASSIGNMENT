<p>The story with the flag color ıs a state myth or more an early political propaganda ( relating to Leopold V ) In reality ın the tıme same tıme a Austrıan nobility famely of Lower Austrıa died out and the posessıons where falling back to the Babenbergs as dukes of Austria by feudal law.This famely close to Zwettel had a red whıte and red shield. For a reason we dont know probably because ıt was simple the dukes overtook this shield. The castles witch name i have forgotten is still existing and you can see their the orignal red white and red shield painted as wall decoration.</p>
<p>May be that Leopold took this red whıte and red flag to invent this politıcal propaganda wich i have heard is older than this story.

<dd>The "official" story is: the Austrian Duke Leopold V. fought during the 3rd cusade in <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acre%2C_Israel_4216.html" title="Acre, Israel">Acre, Israel</a>. He wore a white shirt and a belt. After the battle all his shirt was red, except for the part where the belt was before, where it was still white: red-white-red.

<p>Hi Adrian, I find the image of the Austrian town Kaprun really nice, but why did you put it on the "Austria" page? I don't see any relation to the article. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantasy_73a8.html" title="User:Fantasy">Fantasy</a> 08:11 20 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi! from Adrian. I am extremely puzzled by your message. Kaprun is <b>in</b> Austria, and the article is called <b>Austria</b>!! I had imagined that a pic actually of an Austrian town would be nice to look at on the Austrian main page, as well as all the tables and facts. Evidently I was wrong and I'll remove it.

<dd>Sorry Adrian, you got my question wrong. I was not complaining, I find the image really nice and I am really happy to find more of them in the future. I just thought there could be somewhere in the article mentioned, why this image is there and what special meaning this image has for Austria. I also find it sometimes sad, that articles are so "trocken" (=dry?), some additional things to make it look more interresting are surely of help. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantasy_73a8.html" title="User:Fantasy">Fantasy</a> 09:16 20 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, Fantasy, I understand what you're saying, but I don't think a little piece about Kaprun or Austrian churches or what's in the image is the purpose of the Austria article. It's simply to give the facts about the country. Thanks for putting the picture back, it was only intended as eye relief from all the other dry facts and to show a fairly typical Austrian town. Maybe one day there will be a Kaprun page then I can move the pic over (perhaps I'll write it).<br />

<dd>Great, I am happy that we have the same point of view (specially on the "dry" topic&#160;;-) If you want to show with this picture a "typical Austrian town", so I suggest that we just say so.

<dd>Well, very few people born in Austria are mentioned in the article. Actually, only in the paragraph "Culture" some famous Austrians are mentioned and I don't think that the few pictures Hitler painted made him a famous painter.

<p>Is it really necessary to state in the table, that prior to 1999 the Schilling was Austria's currency? IMPOV the table ought to give nothing more than a concise overview.

<p>Somebody has repeatedly changed the description of the largest ethnic group in Austria to simply "Austrians". This use of the word is completely misleading and incorrect, a simple look at other references on Austria will confirm this. There is simply no such thing as an "Austrian" ethnicity alone. Before the end of the second world war most Austrians clearly identified as ethnic Germans. Although it is clearly insensitive to label modern Austrians as ethnic Germans, it still does not make any sense to create an Austrian ethnic label on Wikipedia when it exist virtually nowhere else.<br />
The original phrase that was used in this article was "German-Austrians". I personally find this term a bit too complicated and would recommend the use of a more sensitive label. My last suggestion and edit for this subject was the term "Germanic-Austrians". Another posibility would be "Austrians of Germanic descent".<br />
But the fact remains Austrian has not ever been commonly used as and still is not (even six decades after the Second World War) an ethnic label.</p>
<p>Here is how other references handle the issue...</p>
<p><b>CIA World Factbook</b>: Austria - Ethnic groups: German 88.5%, ....<br />
<b>Lonely Planet: People</b>: 97% Germanic origin, 2% Slovene &amp; .....<br />
<b>Encyclopedia Britannica</b>: population, ethnically Germanic......</p>
<p>I suggest the use of the term "Germanic-Austrians", which is in line with many other references and avoids the insesitive labeling of Austrians as "ethnic-Germans".<br />
I would also suggest that the person who keeps changing the term to simply "Austrians", join the discussion and give their reasons.</p>

<p>I added a new section, an introductory text, to the demographics sections, for the sake of clarity. I as someone who is half Austrian and has lived in English-speaking countries for much of my life, am aware of how confusing the issue of Austrian nationality is to many people outside of the country, i.e are they Germans or not?, How was Hitler German and Austrian?, etc. Therefore I think it is important to have the text I placed the demographics section that quickly explains the historical background briefly and the current situation. If anyopne has any objection please let me know. I do however feel that this will make the article clearer and is a neccesary piece of information in a reference text about Austria and I beleive it belongs at the beginning of the demographics section and NOT in history.</p>

<dd>The use of <i>Austrian</i> as the name of an ethnic group raised my brow as I read this article, too. To me, <i>Austrian</i> describes geography and nationality (in a political sense), not ethnicity. Regionally, German-speaking Austrians are at least as different from one another as Germans are from one another, and generally speaking, share more culturally with Bavarians than Bavarians do with the rest of Germany. Austrians, the vast majority of them anyway, are ethnic Germans. That said, I also see no reason to make it "politically correct" by saying "Germanic Austrians" or "German-Austrians". I think one ought to expect the reader to know in what sense the word <i>German</i> is being used. It has nothing to do with what government issued their passport. For the last sixty years, the idea of a German national/ethnic identity has become nearly taboo, with regional pride and regional rivalries filling the vacuum. That doesn't mean a German ethnicity doesn't exist. --<a href="../../../t/r/w/User%7ETrweiss_9649.html" title="User:Trweiss">Trweiss</a> 22:07, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Trweiss I agree with you on the subject of being "politically correct" to some extent but I do beleive it is totally neccesary for the simple reason that this is an open encyclopedia. The original word used in the article (and I was one of the first to expand the demographics section here) was "German-Austrian" and that was in my opinion a perfectly acceptable term but it ended up getting repeatedly deleted, my guess is mostly by Austrian visitors. The use of the term "German" alone is really not an option for the simple reason that this page will be visited by many people with little or no knowledge of Austrian and German history, so the term would lead to a considerable of confussion even if it is placed in quotation marks and accompanied by an explanation. The term "German" should also not be used to avoid offending a good amount of the Austrian visitors to this site. As someone with an Austrian passport, I know how sensitive the subject is to some Austrians.<br />
Personally I think the term "Germanic-Austrians" is an acceptable comprimise that is both in line with other English-language references and avoids the incorrect use of the word "Austrian" as an ethnic lable.</p>

<i>The issue of Austrian nationality and ethnicity was throughout recent centuries and remains to this day a sensitive issue and a topic of dispute. Before the end of the Second World War, most of Austria's population were clearly self-identified ethnic-Germans, who considered themselves part of a larger German Volk (ethnic nation), together with the other German-speaking-populations of Europe. A strong distinct Austrian national identity has emerged since the mid-twentieth century and most Austrians now no longer identify themselves as "Germans". In modern Austria only a small minority of the population, mostly but not entirely people with conservative or far right political views, advocate a pan-German ethnic identity for German-speaking Austrians.</i></p>

It makes no sence to discuss if Austrians are ethnic Germans or not... About 90% of all Austrians identify themselfs as ethnic Bavarians or Alemanics. I`m allowed to say that because I´m Austrian. Bavarians from Bavaria identify themselfs also as ethnic Bavarians and do not as Germans. It never existed an pan-german-nationality-feeling bevore Adolf Hitler.<br />
It is correct that Austrians of german mother tongue identify themselfs as "Germans" before the second world war. But you have to make a big difference: When a Austrian of german mother tonge say: "I'm German" he always means "I'm german speaking" - also before the second world war.<br />
You also have to make a difference between northern germans and southern germans - they are culturally totaly different!<br />
A "German" is: only an inhabitant of de Federal Republic of Germany, or: summary (not culturally, ant ethnical - but in the sence of the language) of volkgroups.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 138.245.10.1 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_138.245.10.1_1ca8.html" title="Special:Contributions/138.245.10.1">contribs</a>) 23:54, 20 August 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Turks are not an "national Austrian minority group"! Austrians of slovene- or croatian tongue also do not identify themselfs as "Slovenes" or "Croatians"! They are also "Austrians".<br />
People from different english-speaking-countries also do not identify themselfs as "English" people. - You have to accept that a majority of Austrians don´t want to be identify as "Germans", because we are what we are <i>AUSTROBAVARIANS</i>.<br />
If you would live in the German-speaking-countries, you would see and accept, that no lager-german-ethnic exist (in the head of the most) and never existed and in future not will exist.<br />
What you mean is: <i>a summary of Volkgroups who have quite the same language</i><br />
If you have any knowledge about the german language you would see, that only some dialects in the north of Germany - known as "Highgerman" - is the Language wich is standard. In Austria we speak "bavarian" very hard to understand for north-, west-, and east-germans, and write Standardgerman. For example Dutch is much more easyer understandable for northgermans (when they speak dialect) than bavarian! And bavarian is so called an "german dialect" - you have to immagin. When you call me a "German", you also have to call a Dutch as "ethnic german"!<br />
I have seen on your personal page that you are from the USA, would you identify yourself as "ethnic English"?<br />
At the end of the first world war, Austria planed to get a part of Germany, but the plan was to be a very autonom state in a greater Germany. The austrian goverment don't wanted to be under porussian regiment even not the volk. The most of the people in Bavaria and Austria always had an bavarian identity. Bavaria today also is so called a "Freestate" it is an autonom State in the federal republic of Germany, as three other States. You can see, even in Germany most of the Bavarians, and others don't feel "German". In Bavaria about 60% identify themselfs as Bavarians at first... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 138.245.10.1 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_138.245.10.1_1ca8.html" title="Special:Contributions/138.245.10.1">contribs</a>) 01:08, 22 August 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Dutch is a Low German language which is, so far as I am aware, not intelligible with Hochdeutsch. The language spoken by most Austrians and Bavarians is much more intelligible with Hochdeutsch, and as you note, Hochdeutsch is the written language. The fact that Low Saxon dialects are more closely intelligible with Dutch than they are with Bavarian is true - but those languages are also more intelligible with Dutch than they are with standard German. But the basic fact is that both Austrians and Bavarians have always been considered ethnic Germans, and are still so considered. At any rate, your own argument is incoherent. My argument is that it is completely incoherent to pretend that "Austrian" is an ethnicity. If we use the word as synonymous with "the German-speaking population of Austria," then we are saying that any non-German-speaking Austrian is not an Austrian. The term "ethnic Austrian" is ridiculous, because Austrian is not an ethnicity - it is a nationality. It would be like calling old stock White Americans "ethnic Americans." If you don't like the term "ethnic Germans," I am fine with using "German-Austrians." But any other term just confuses the issue. Especially since not all Austrians speak the Bavarian dialect - my understanding was that those in the Tyrol speak an Alemannic dialect. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 03:26, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, gotcha. As to the issue, I can understand the sensitivities of Austrian people, but there really is no good way to indicate what we are talking about without using the word "German." This may be unfortunate, but it's how it is. "Austrian" is not an ethnicity, and to say that they are of "Austro-Bavarian" ethnicity is completely opaque to most English-speakers. The point is that we are indicating what percentage of the population are first language German-speakers. Using "ethnic Germans" (which is <i>not</i> the same thing as "Germans") or "German-Austrians" is the only good way to indicate this. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 04:12, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

The fakt is: that no greater-german-ethnicity exist. It is a summary of ethnicities witch have quite the same language. An "lager bavarian ethnicity" exist!<br />
there are following "german-speaking" ethnicities:<br />
1. Bavarians - living in southern Bavaria and Austria<br />
2. Alemanics - living in Switzerland, Baden-Würtemberg and Elsass (France)<br />
3. Franconians - living in Bavaria, Baden-Würtemberg, Hessen<br />
4. Porussians - living in the rest of Germany<br />
5. lower Saxons - living in the north<br />
those are own ethnicities, in the sence of the language so called "Germans". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.245.211.185 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.245.211.185_c142.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.245.211.185">contribs</a>) 17:05, 22 August 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>To Anonymous:</dd>
<dd>Although Bavarians, Alemanics, Franconians, Thuringians were quite distinct groups in the early Middle-Ages, a common german identity soon emerged. This can be mainly traced in the writings of poets and other intellectuals, who freguently complained about the poor state of the HRE. By the 19th century there was a popular feeling of german national unity (ironically german nationalism before 1848 was liberal to left wing, because it was in favour of a united Germany (constitutional monarchy or even republican) and strongly opposed to the conservative princes of the separate German states). Austrian archduke Johann was elected Steward of the German Empire by the German parliament of 1848.</dd>
<dd>Although Austrians know that their dialects are Bavarian and that Austria was part of Bavaria for a long time, they certainly don't think of themselves as "Bavarians" anymore. This term is now restricted to Bavaria proper. (Unlike people from Vorarlberg who like to emphasize that they are Alemanic). And of course Slovenians consider themselves Slovenians AND Austrians but not Austrians who accidentaly speak Slovenian.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides: "Hochdeutsch" is not the written language but all the dialects south of the so called Benrath-line. It is based on old-high german, whereas "niederdeutsch" is based on old-saxon. The German standard-language evolved out of high-german dialects. Therefore, linguists like to say that for Northern Germans Standard-german is a foreign language (and therefore they keep Standard-german clean from local pronounciations unlike people from high-german areas).</dd>
<dd>The idea of an Austrian identity entirely distinct from German was introduced and embraced only after 1945. However, since most Austrians now identify as Austrians and there certainly is no danger of a second "Anschluss", during the 2005-anniversary celebrations there were frequent (cautious) allusions (by commentators which certainly cannot be labeled as nationalists), that this distinct Austrian identity originally was part of the "Opfermythos".</dd>
<dd>Changes in reference books: in 1980 the "Fischer Weltalmanah" still refered to "Austrians of German descent". In 2005 the CIA-Worldfactbook changed to "Austrians".</dd>
<dd>deutschsprachige Oesterreicher (Austrians of german mother-tongue) is the pc-term generally used in Austria since 1945.</dd>

I actually didn't plan to add to this discussion. However, I feel it's necessary as the artice in the current form is incorrect. I think the problem starts with the vague definition: <i>"An <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_group.html" title="Ethnic group">ethnic group</a> can be determined on the basis of a complex set of characteristics, including race, <b>nationality</b>, religion, ancestry, and language."</i><br />
The Austrian census does not collect data in the form it's argued about above.

The other websites already listed as external links are no more nor less relevant to Austria than Austrosearch. Other websites have been very kind to my work promoting Austria such as Dmoz was below.</p>

<p>I submit that I may have my own political views on Austria and those are kept in the features section.

<dd>Yes, I removed your link for the following reasons:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. Policy: See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Your link was placed in a position on the list suggestive of the behaviour of a spammer, i.e. at the top of the list, ahead even of those of the Bundeskanzleramt and the Austrian National Tourist Office.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. At the time, the link to your user page was showing red, and you had very few contributions (indeed, I think none other than to austrosearch.at), which again is suggestive of a newly-arrived spammer's behaviour -- it's a good idea to build up a profile as a contributor of useful edits to the body of articles, which will help to allay fears of you being a spammer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If I misjudged you, then you have my apologies. On the information available at the time, and given the need to make a swift decision while monitoring edits to over 2000 articles, I think I acted properly. If you wish to reinstate the link at a less-prominent position in the list, then I will not remove it again, though I see from <strong class="selflink">Talk:Austria</strong> that others on IRC have given you reasons why the link may have been removed, so someone else might still do so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, it was not necessary for you to seek out one of my actual email addresses to contact me -- most users like myself have an option set in their preferences to display an "email this user" option in the navigation bar to the left of their user page.

<dd>Being a new contributor to Wikipedia is definately a learning experience. Being a member of several open source communities I must say I am a bit embarrased how things started out. I think it really should be considered to warn folks such as myself wishing to contribute to wikipedia that starting off adding your own link is definately the wrong first move.<br />

<p>IMHO (as an Austrian very much interested in politics), it is a very minor fact that some ÖVP politicians have occasionally proposed joining NATO. If we mention this in the main article, we should also mention in the <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceland.html" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> article that some politicians have proposed to join the EU. The proposal to join NATO was of importance during the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, but after the fall of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, the idea of joining NATO is not even remotely considered by ÖVP politicians any more (openly, at least), because public opinion is somewhere above two thirds against that proposal. While browsing through pages on Austria, I just felt that this factoid was not really notable.&#160;::shrugs:: Would be interested as to why you think this is notable.

<p>Mh, well, sometimes you learn something new about your country... it seems that Schüssel did indeed say something along the lines of "should consider all options, including NATO membership" in November 2001. Still, I do not consider this possibility noteworthy enough to mention it in the main article, which should give a short overview of Austrian politics; NATO membership is definitely not an important topic in Austrian politics at the moment.&#160;;) <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion">ナイトスタリオン</a>…<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightstallion_e2b1.html" title="User talk:Nightstallion">ㇳ–ㇰ</a> 23:26, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right - doesn't fit into the article - not noteworthy enough. In reverting I just wanted to make the point that Schüssel etc. have several times advanced the idea to join NATO.

<p>It is not entirely clear what <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> means in the section on religion. For instance, <i>"the absolute monarchy of Habsburg imposed a strict regime to maintain Catholicism's power and influence among Austrians"</i>.

<dd>I think the following section is misleading: <i>Both these numbers have been on the decline for decades, especially Roman Catholicism, which has suffered an increasing number of seceders of the church. This is due partly to <b>child sexual abuse scandals by priests'</b> as well as the alleged unwillingness of the Roman Catholic Church to implement reforms.</i> (emphasize by me) The part mentioning child sexual abuse scandals at least needs to be reformulated. Either the statement refers to sexual abuse scandals outside Austria (e.g. USA) or it refers to abuse scandals inside of it. Concerning the latter I am not aware of any other case than that of Cardinal <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Hermann_Gro%C3%ABr_cee6.html" title="Hans Hermann Groër">Groër</a>, who was removed by JPII because of sexual misconduct with teenagers.

It is clearly not a calque of ostarrichi, and doesn't seem to be a direct borrowing of the High German word, could it have come from another Germanic dialect? For instance Old Norse "austr" (east) looks extremely similar. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 14:21, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Marc Bloch's Feudal Society has a more accurate account of how the Osterreich came to be the name of the german boundary in the alps and with eastern Europe. In the eleventh century (or tenth, can't really remember) Otto the Great sent two large garrisons to the southeastern borders of the empire to protect against Magyar assaults. There garrisons were called the "Eastern Command" or, for a simpler translation of the primitive german "ostaricki," the "East-Rule." The sense being conveyed would thus be "Eastern Regime," but only "command" really keeps the military reality of its origins in sight.</p>
<p>Given the modern term "Reich" and its uses, Austria is often mistaken by English scholars as being derived from "Eastern Empire;" though it goes much further than the primitive roots allow, it's still much more accurate than "Eastern Realm." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.85.63.18 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.85.63.18_5d26.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.85.63.18">contribs</a>) 18:20, 11 November 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Austria was ruled by the Ottoman Empire? Please have a second look into your favourite history book. Yes, the Ottomans tried to take over Vienna but failed twice (Vienna was quite fortunate that the reinforcements/relief came just in time - one day later would have been to late probably). They ruled over Austria? No, not to all I know and believe. Of course they got hold of some parts of eastern Austria in order to reach Vienna, but that does not mean they ruled Austria. Additionally, Vienna lies at the far east of Austria, so they only needed a narrow corridor to reach the capital. What you probably mean is that they got hold of some of the regions the Austrian Empire was ruling in the region of <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkan.html" title="Balkan">Balkan</a> (now <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia.html" title="Bosnia">Bosnia</a>, etc.) Those were taken over by the Ottomans on their way from Istanbul to Vienna, but that regions were not part of Austria then and are not now. --<a href="../../../w/i/r/User%7EWirthi_a96d.html" title="User:Wirthi">Wirthi</a> 09:51, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, Kusma, you had been suggesting way back that the (very thin) discussion on that page, out of the sight of the many contributors to the country pages involved, was sufficient to override the Wiki standard which should be changed by broad discussion.

<dd>You are wrong. It is used for Slovenians in Austria.

<dd>Isn't the argument that it <i>used to be</i> the term for Slovenes? My understanding is that, in old German, "Wends" were peoples living to the east of the Germanic peoples (usually Slavs), and "Welsh" were people to the west (Latins or Celts). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 16:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the Czech Republic (and Slovenia) was once part of Austria. So, sort of, was Hungary. But it seems unnecessary for the intro. But giving the name for Austria in all 11 languages of the old monarchy might be worthwhile somewhere. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 16:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, no, I think the reason is that there are ethnic minorities of Czech and Slovenians in Austria and therefore, their language have some official status.

<p>In the "Babenberg" article of Wikipedia, it says "Austria, the capital of which <b>had been transferred to Vienna in 1156</b>, was elevated into a duchy in the Privilegium Minus." Fruthermore, the original fief, as well as the first Margravate, did not extend to Vienna (rather 60 miles only from the Bavarian border). Was it that the Austrian Margravate simply did not have a Capital? or was it Passau, because Vienna had to wait until 1469 before becoming a separate diocese? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by SayKay (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SayKay_5cab.html" title="Special:Contributions/SayKay">contribs</a>) 17:08, 14 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
