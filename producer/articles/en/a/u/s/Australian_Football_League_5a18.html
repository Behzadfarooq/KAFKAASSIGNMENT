<p>The AFL has tight controls over the player lists of each club. Each club can have a senior list of 38 players plus up to six rookie or veteran players. From 2006, up to two international rookies<a href="http://www.realfooty.theage.com.au/articles/2006/08/24/1156012674646.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.realfooty.theage.com.au/articles/2006/08/24/1156012674646.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> are also permitted. Clubs can only trade players during a "trade week" at the end of each season and can only recruit new players through the <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL_Draft_3f3b.html" title="AFL Draft">AFL Draft</a>. The rules for the draft have changed every few years since it was introduced in 1986, but the basic philosophy remains in that players are selected by clubs in the reverse of the order of their positions on the ladder at the end of the preceding season. That is, the club that finished last has first draft selection, then the club that finished second last. However, this philosophy has been compromised by giving priority picks to clubs which win fewer than five matches during the season and by allowing clubs to select sons of former players under a "father - son rule" which itself has been varied over the years.</p>
<p>A salary cap (known as the <b>Total Player Payments</b> or TPP) is also in place as part of the league's equalisation policy. In 2006, this is <a href="../../../a/u/d/AUD_bfab.html" title="AUD">A</a>$6,472,812 per club. Salaries of draft selections are fixed for two years. Salaries for senior players are not normally released to the public, although the average is estimated at <a href="../../../a/u/d/AUD_bfab.html" title="AUD">A</a>$200,000<a href="http://www.realfooty.theage.com.au/realfooty/articles/2006/08/02/1154198206162.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.realfooty.theage.com.au/realfooty/articles/2006/08/02/1154198206162.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and the top few players can expect to earn up to <a href="../../../a/u/d/AUD_bfab.html" title="AUD">A</a>$1,000,000 a year<a href="http://www.realfooty.theage.com.au/realfooty/articles/2005/03/14/1110649126920.html?from=storyrhs" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.realfooty.theage.com.au/realfooty/articles/2005/03/14/1110649126920.html?from=storyrhs" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Infringements by clubs in relation to exceeding the TPP, not informing the AFL of payments or draft tampering are severe and can include large fines and exclusion from the AFL draft. The AFL has not penalised clubs premiership points for breach of the salary cap.</p>

<p>The <i>Toyota AFL Premiership Season</i>, contested between the 16 teams from around Australia, lasts for 22 rounds and begins in late March.</p>
<p>At the end of the 22 rounds, the top eight teams compete in the four-week <i><a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota_AFL_Finals_Series_99c1.html" title="Toyota AFL Finals Series">Toyota AFL Finals Series</a></i>. In the first week, depending on the their ladder position, teams play in two Qualifying Finals and two Elimination Finals. The two lowest placed losing teams are eliminated, the two highest placed winning teams progress into a Preliminary Final (in the third week), and the other four teams play in two Semi Finals (in the second week). The losers of the Semi Finals are eliminated and the remaining four teams play in two Preliminary Finals, with the winning teams play in the Grand Final.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/c/c/McClelland_Trophy_8a7d.html" title="McClelland Trophy">McClelland Trophy</a> is awarded to the team that finishes the league in first position (sometimes called the minor premiership) but this is not afforded anywhere near the prestige as the Premiership. The Premiership is awarded to the winning team in the Grand Final.</p>
<p>The Grand Final is traditionally played at the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground_93ce.html" title="Melbourne Cricket Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> in Melbourne, even if two non-<a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_%28Australia%29_71e6.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victorian</a> teams are playing, on the last Saturday in September.

<p>Themed rounds have become immensely popular. There are themes such as Rivalry Round (in which traditional rivals are matched up against each other), Women's Round and Heritage Round (where teams play in old style guernseys). Some matches are also themed for special events. For example, each year Collingwood play Essendon in the annual <a href="../../../a/n/z/ANZAC_Day_e650.html" title="ANZAC Day">ANZAC Day</a> match at the MCG and the game will typically sell-out regardless of the positions of the two teams on the ladder. Another annual match is the Queen's Birthday game between Melbourne and Collingwood. As of 2006, Richmond and Essendon play in the <i>Dreamtime at the 'G</i> match. There are separate trophies for the matches between several clubs and former rivalries, ie. the Lake Trophy between St Kilda and Sydney Swans.</p>

<p>In 1857, Tom Wills advocated playing football during winter as a way of keeping cricketers fit during off-season. The new sport was devised by Wills, his cousin H.C.A. Harrison, W.J. Hammersley and J.B. Thompson. The Melbourne Football Club was formed on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">August 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1858.html" title="1858">1858</a> - the year of the code’s first recorded match between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar School.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Edit section: VFL begins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">VFL begins</span></h4>
<p>The <a href="../../../v/f/l/VFL_AFL_0d5c.html" title="VFL/AFL">Victorian Football League</a> was established in 1896 when several clubs broke away from the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Football_League_a3a4.html" title="Victorian Football League">Victorian Football Association</a> which was the first Australian rules competition. The first games were played in 1897 between the foundation clubs – Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne, St Kilda and South Melbourne. Essendon won the first VFL premiership.</p>
<p>Although the <a href="../../../v/f/l/VFL_AFL_0d5c.html" title="VFL/AFL">Victorian Football League</a> and the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Football_League_a3a4.html" title="Victorian Football League">Victorian Football Association</a> continued to compete for spectator interest for many years, the VFL quickly established itself as the premier competition in Victoria.</p>
<p>In 1908, Richmond and University joined the VFL. University's term was short lived and it left the VFL after the 1914 season. In 1925, Footscray (now the Western Bulldogs), Hawthorn and North Melbourne (now trading as the Kangaroos) joined the VFL.</p>
<p>In 1924 the VFL inaugurated the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownlow_Medal_2578.html" title="Brownlow Medal">Brownlow Medal</a> for the player who received the most votes from the umpires for the <a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_and_Fairest_93f7.html" title="Best and Fairest">Best and Fairest</a> player.</p>
<p>Between the years of 1927 and 1930, Collingwood became the first and so far, the only, team to win four successive premierships. This team became known as "the machine" because of the organised and consistent way that they played. In 1932, the VFL became an incorporated company.</p>

<p>In 1959, the VFL planned the first purpose built mega-stadium, <a href="../../../w/a/v/Waverley_Park_0a1b.html" title="Waverley Park">Waverley Park</a>, to give it some independence from the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Cricket_Club_bf25.html" title="Melbourne Cricket Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a> which managed the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground_93ce.html" title="Melbourne Cricket Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>, Australian rules' spiritual home. <a href="../../../w/a/v/Waverley_Park_0a1b.html" title="Waverley Park">Waverley Park</a> was planned to hold 167,000 spectators (thus making it one of the largest stadiums in the world). Land for the stadium was purchased at Mulgrave, in those days just farmland, but one day predicted to be near demographic centre of Melbourne's population.</p>
<p>The VFL played some interstate and overseas <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football_exhibition_matches.html" title="Australian rules football exhibition matches">exhibition matches</a> in the 1950s to lift the profile of the league.</p>
<p>Geelong was the stand out team at the beginning of the 1950s, winning the premiership in 1951 then setting a record of 23 consecutive wins starting in Round 12, 1952 and ending in Round 13, 1953. This streak included the 1952 premiership.</p>
<p>After Footscray won its first (and so far, only) premiership in 1954 by defeating Melbourne, Melbourne became a powerhouse, winning five premierships between 1955 and 1960, including three in a row between 1955 and 1957. In 1958 Collingwood famously defeated Melbourne in the Grand Final, thereby preventing Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record of four successive premierships.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, television began to have a huge impact, which continues unabated to this day. Spectators hurried home from games to watch replays and many former players took up positions as commentators on pre-game preview programs and and post-game review programs. There were also several attempts at variety programs featuring VFL players, who generally succeeded in demonstrating that their skills were limited to the football ground!</p>
<p>Hawthorn won its first ever Grand Final in 1961, beating Footscray. Melbourne's period of success ended with its premiership win in 1964 over Collingwood, after which Carlton famously recruited Melbourne's champion player Ron Barassi as its captain-coach. St Kilda won its first, and so far only, Grand Final by one point over Collingwood in 1966 and after many years in the doldrums, Richmond won the Grand Final in 1967, starting a revival which lasted to 1980. Under Barassi's leadership, Carlton won the premiership in 1968, its first since 1947.</p>

<p>1970 saw the opening of Waverley Park, with the inaugural match being played between Geelong and Fitzroy, on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_18.html" title="April 18">18 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. Construction work was carried out at the stadium as the 1970s progressed, culminating in the building of the now heritage listed Sir Kenneth Luke stand.</p>
<p>The 1970 Grand Final between Carlton and Collingwood attracted a record crowd for a football game in Australia of 121,696. This game also saw the greatest comeback in Grand Final history when after trailing by 44 points at half time, Carlton managed to win by 10 points. <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jesaulenko_563c.html" title="Alex Jesaulenko">Alex Jesaulenko</a> took one of the most memorable marks in the sport's history during this game.</p>
<p>Hawthorn defeated St. Kilda in the Grand Final in 1971, beginning a long period of success that lasted into the early 1990s. The match was notable for Peter Hudson's famed attempt at breaking Bob Pratt's long held record of 150 goals in a season, in which he only managed two goals to level with Pratt.</p>
<p>North Melbourne won its first ever premiership in 1975, then won again in 1977 in the Grand Final replay, following the second ever drawn Grand Final, against Collingwood. 1977 also saw the commencement of <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Origin_73de.html" title="State of Origin">State of Origin</a> representative matches, where players were only able to represent the state of their birth, as opposed to representing the state in which they were currently playing.</p>
<p>The 1979 Grand final is remembered for a controversial goal that sparked another memorable Grand Final comeback by Carlton. Collingwood was leading by 28 points late in the second quarter when Carlton's <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Harmes_42db.html" title="Wayne Harmes">Wayne Harmes</a> miskicked, chased the ball towards the boundary line and knocked it to his team mate <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Sheldon_3fa3.html" title="Ken Sheldon">Ken Sheldon</a> who kicked a goal. Although Harmes won the inaugural <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norm_Smith_Medal_7f49.html" title="Norm Smith Medal">Norm Smith Medal</a> for the best player in the Grand Final, he is best-remembered for this incident as Collingwood supporters still claim that the ball had crossed the boundary line before Harmes knocked it to Sheldon.</p>
<p>Many rule changes were made during the decade in efforts to increase the attractiveness of the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>A "final five" system was introduced in 1972. The Grand Final was the highest scoring Grand Final in history, accumulating a total of 327 points with Carlton defeating Richmond by 27 points.</li>
<li>The centre diamond and a limit of four players per team at the centre bounce were introduced in 1973. The diamond was changed to the square in 1975.</li>
<li>The two-umpire system was introduced in 1976.</li>
<li>In 1978 the interchange law was introduced, to allow players to be able to be interchanged at any time (like basketball), rather than a one-off replacement (as in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a>).</li>

<p>As there was no national league for Australian rules, the VFL became the most popular and dominant league around the country in terms of overall attendance and interest. In 1980, the match of the day was broadcast on television. Interest around the country followed, and new sides from other capitals (many with their own local leagues) soon expressed interest in new licences.</p>

In 1988, a <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salary_cap.html" title="Salary cap">salary cap</a> was introduced, and the law changed to make players awarded free kicks be obliged to kick the ball, rather than handpass. This rule change was reversed in 1990.</p>
<p>In 1989, the league began encouraging other Victorian clubs to merge or relocate interstate. <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Bulldogs_899a.html" title="Western Bulldogs">Footscray</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/t/Fitzroy_Football_Club_aa48.html" title="Fitzroy Football Club">Fitzroy</a> nearly merged, but a fundraising event from Footscray supporters stops the proposed merger.</p>
<p>Collingwood played in its third successive Grand Final in 1981, yet didn't win any of them. This added to Collingwood's already infamous record in grand finals, signified by the term "the Colliwobbles" - coined to describe Collingwood's inability to win the big one and introduced after the 1970 grand final loss to Carlton.</p>
<p>A bitter rivalry between Essendon and Hawthorn emerged after competing in three consecutive Grand Finals between 1983 and 1985. Essendon's win in the 1984 marked the first time since 1966 that a team other than Richmond, Carlton, Hawthorn or North Melbourne had won the premiership. The dominance of these few clubs and mounting financial problems for several clubs resulted in the VFL adopting an equalisation policy, centred around the player draft and salary cap measures.</p>
<p>In 1988, Melbourne made its first appearance in a Grand Final since 1964, but it wasn't a memorable return to the big stage. Hawthorn crushed an underdog Melbourne side by 96 points, the biggest Grand Final win in history.</p>
<p>In what many believe to be the finest Grand Final of the modern era, Hawthorn overcame a strong challenge from Geelong in 1989. It was a physical game right from the start when Geelong's <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Yeates_f61c.html" title="Mark Yeates">Mark Yeates</a> ran through <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dermott_Brereton_08fd.html" title="Dermott Brereton">Dermott Brereton</a> at the opening bounce, bruising Brereton's kidney and causing internal bleeding. In a courageous display, Brereton refused to leave the ground and marked and goaled several minutes later to stem Geelong's attempt to establish superiority. Later heavy clashes would see <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Platten_df94.html" title="John Platten">John Platten</a> knocked out and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_DiPierdomenico_daec.html" title="Robert DiPierdomenico">Robert DiPierdomenico</a> suffer broken ribs and a punctured lung. Despite a Grand Final record nine goals from Geelong's <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Ablett_6cb5.html" title="Gary Ablett">Gary Ablett</a>, Hawthorn still went on to win by six points.</p>

Former AFL Logo (1990-99)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The VFL was renamed as the <i>Australian Football League</i> in 1990. The VFL name disappeared until it was adopted by the AFL's state feeder competition which was the most recent incarnation of the former VFA.</p>
<p>In 1990, the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Adelaide_Magpies_0f0f.html" title="Port Adelaide Magpies">Port Adelaide Magpies</a> made a bid for an AFL licence. In response, the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Crows_d561.html" title="Adelaide Crows">Adelaide Crows</a> were formed by the <a href="../../../s/a/n/SANFL_91a2.html" title="SANFL">SANFL</a> and joined the league in 1991, when the Grand Final was played at Waverley Park for first and only time as the MCG was being redeveloped. This game was also the first time that a non-Victorian team - <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Coast_Eagles_14b7.html" title="West Coast Eagles">West Coast Eagles</a> - made the Grand Final.</p>
<p>The final six was introduced in 1991, the same year in which Waverley Park hosted it's one and only Grand Final, whilst the Southern Stand at the MCG underwent reconstruction. In 1992, Waverley Park was renamed "AFL Park" and the West Coast Eagles became the first non-Victorian team to win a premiership, beating Geelong. 1992 was also the final year the Brisbane Bears called Carrara Stadium home, as they moved to Woolloongabba (better known as The 'Gabba) in time for the 1993 season.</p>
<p>In 1994, the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fremantle_Football_Club_702f.html" title="Fremantle Football Club">Fremantle Football Club</a> was formed to represent the strong history of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fremantle%2C_Western_Australia_228d.html" title="Fremantle, Western Australia">Fremantle</a> clubs from the WAFL, and played its first game in the AFL in 1995. That year, the first Western Derby was played between the two Perth-based teams. Carlton made the record books by winning its 16th premiership after 16 consecutive wins and only two losses for the entire season.</p>
<p>Some of the rule changes of the decade included:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1993, a third field umpire was introduced.</li>
<li>In 1994, the <a href="../../../m/c/i/McIntyre_Final_Eight_System_4895.html" title="McIntyre Final Eight System">McIntyre Final Eight System</a> system was introduced.</li>
<li>A fourth interchange player was added for the 1998 season, increasing match day squads to 22 players.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1996, the AFL celebrated its centenary. One round of games featured a repeat of the games in Round 1, 1897, with players wearing replicas of the guernseys worn 100 years earlier. Late in the season, after it looked like the <a href="../../../f/i/t/Fitzroy_Lions_e504.html" title="Fitzroy Lions">Fitzroy Lions</a> would succumb to financial problems and merge with North Melbourne, the AFL dramatically announced that Fitzroy would merge with the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Bears_6517.html" title="Brisbane Bears">Brisbane Bears</a> and play as the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Lions_4cd4.html" title="Brisbane Lions">Brisbane Lions</a> in 1997. North Melbourne recovered from being jilted, and became the only team to win a gold premiership cup by defeating Sydney, which had not played in a Grand Final since 1945.</p>
<p>Later in 1996, an attempt to merge Melbourne and Hawthorn to form the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Hawks_f5fb.html" title="Melbourne Hawks">Melbourne Hawks</a> made headlines, but failed to eventuate. Ross Oakley stepped down as the AFL's Chief Executive and was replaced by <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Jackson_2c58.html" title="Wayne Jackson">Wayne Jackson</a>. And the AFL rejected bids from Queensland club <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southport_Sharks_7319.html" title="Southport Sharks">Southport Sharks</a> and the <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmanian</a> government to enter teams.</p>
<p>In 1997, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Adelaide_Magpies_0f0f.html" title="Port Adelaide Magpies">Port Adelaide Magpies</a> was finally awarded a licence to join the AFL as the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Adelaide_Power_a719.html" title="Port Adelaide Power">Port Adelaide Power</a>. The inaugural <i><a href="../../../s/h/o/Showdown_%28AFL%29_b5bd.html" title="Showdown (AFL)">Showdown</a></i> occurred in that year, with Port Adelaide causing an upset victory over Adelaide. The Footscray Bulldogs were renamed the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Bulldogs_899a.html" title="Western Bulldogs">Western Bulldogs</a>. Adelaide won the first of two consecutive premierships and became the first side in history to win four finals in one series and win the premiership. St. Kilda, their opponent, were playing in their first Grand Final since 1971.</p>
<p>The International Rules series against the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_dab2.html" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a> was made a regular annual event from 1998. Adelaide repeated its feats of a year before to win the premiership (after losing their first finals match to Melbourne), beating favourites North Melbourne. North had major goal scoring problems in the match and had a dismal second half. <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_McLeod_4d7a.html" title="Andrew McLeod">Andrew McLeod</a> won his second <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norm_Smith_Medal_7f49.html" title="Norm Smith Medal">Norm Smith Medal</a> in two years.</p>
<p>In 1999, the league sold its <a href="../../../w/a/v/Waverley_Park_0a1b.html" title="Waverley Park">Waverley Park</a> stadium and used the funds in a joint venture to begin construction of the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Docklands_Stadium_b5bb.html" title="Docklands Stadium">Docklands Stadium</a>. The league announced the last AFL <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Origin_73de.html" title="State of Origin">State of Origin</a> match, and its intentions to instead to focus on the new national league. Carlton scored a huge one-point upset victory in the preliminary final to face North Melbourne. A competitive game up to half time, North ran away with the game and the premiership by 35 points.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Edit section: 2000s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2000s</span></h3>
<p>The logo was again changed in 2000. The first indoor AFL match was held at <a href="../../../d/o/c/Docklands_Stadium_b5bb.html" title="Docklands Stadium">Docklands Stadium</a> in the same year. In the first game at the venue, Essendon crushed Port Adelaide by 94 points. It was a sign of things to come as Essendon only lost one game for the entire season and had a percentage of 159.1%, one of the highest in history and drew equal with the fewest losses in an entire season, tieing with the Collingwood machine team of 1929. They faced Melbourne in the Grand Final and won by 60 points despite some poor goal scoring attempts.</p>
<p>In 2001, the Brisbane Lions won the first of a historic three successive premierships, becoming the first Queensland based and non-Victorian team to do so. In 2002, a thrilling game from start to finish saw Brisbane beat Collingwood by nine points on a wet and sloppy day. The final margin was the largest all day, making it one of the closest Grand Finals in history.</p>
<p>In 2003, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Demetriou_045d.html" title="Andrew Demetriou">Andrew Demetriou</a> was appointed as CEO. Brisbane won their third consecutive premiership by destroying Collingwood by 50 points highlighted by 39 disposals to <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Black_0b8f.html" title="Simon Black">Simon Black</a> and five incredible goals from <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Akermanis_b2df.html" title="Jason Akermanis">Jason Akermanis</a>. Brisbane became the first team since Melbourne in the 1950s to win three consecutive premierships.</p>
<p>In 2004, Port Adelaide won its first premiership and thwarting Brisbane's attempt at equalling the AFL record set by Collingwood from 1927-30. It was the first Grand final to be held between two non-Victorian sides.</p>
<p>2005 saw history made by the Sydney Swans, becoming the first New South Wales-based AFL team to win a premiership and breaking a 72 year premiership drought for the club (they had previously won the premiership as South Melbourne before they relocated to Sydney). A close game from start to finish, Sydney defeated the West Coast Eagles by four points in one of the lowest scoring Grand Finals in history and the closest final scores since 1966, made possible by a memorable mark from the Swan's <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Barry_68cf.html" title="Leo Barry">Leo Barry</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006 there was the so-called <i><a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL_siren_controversy%2C_2006_4731.html" title="AFL siren controversy, 2006">Sirengate</a></i> scandal, which saw St. Kilda force a draw against Fremantle after the final siren. In the days that followed, Fremantle appealed and got the full competition points. This was the difference between St. Kilda winning the double-chance.</p>
<p>A series of new rule changes were introduced for the 2006 season intended to speed up the game, including allowing the ball to be brought back into play immediately after a point is scored and limiting the time allowed for players to kick for goal to 30 seconds. The end of the 2006 season was a carbon copy of the 2005 Grand Final, with the Swans and Eagles facing off again in the decider. The West Coast Eagles instead triumphed by one point, exacting revenge on the Sydney Swans after the 2005 defeat.</p>

<p>Several areas have been discussed as expansion possibilities, most often <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, western <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, North <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a>, the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Coast%2C_Queensland_ffa7.html" title="Gold Coast, Queensland">Gold Coast</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin%2C_Northern_Territory_5a73.html" title="Darwin, Northern Territory">Darwin</a> and even <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, but the AFL have an aim to keep the competition to 16 teams. It is generally thought that if the AFL expands into a new area, one of the less financially well-off Victorian clubs will re-locate, rather than an entirely new club being formed. The Western Bulldogs and Kangaroos are most often considered candidates for re-location, and some theorise that their respective name changes in the 1990s were in anticipation of such a move.</p>
<p>Having experimented with home games in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, the Kangaroos played regular premiership season games at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manuka_Oval_3731.html" title="Manuka Oval">Manuka Oval</a> in Canberra until deciding on a secondary home at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrara_Stadium_b4c4.html" title="Carrara Stadium">Carrara Stadium</a> on the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Coast%2C_Queensland_ffa7.html" title="Gold Coast, Queensland">Gold Coast</a>, and the Bulldogs have played in <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairns%2C_Queensland_be34.html" title="Cairns, Queensland">Cairns</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin%2C_Northern_Territory_5a73.html" title="Darwin, Northern Territory">Darwin</a>. Melbourne have played home games in South East Queensland (both <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> and the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Coast%2C_Queensland_ffa7.html" title="Gold Coast, Queensland">Gold Coast</a>) while Hawthorn and St Kilda have played in <a href="../../../l/a/u/Launceston%2C_Tasmania_4d2f.html" title="Launceston, Tasmania">Launceston</a>, leading to more speculation that they are attempting to build a supporter base in those areas for future re-location.</p>
<p>Whilst St Kilda are pulling out of playing games in <a href="../../../l/a/u/Launceston%2C_Tasmania_4d2f.html" title="Launceston, Tasmania">Launceston</a>, Hawthorn recently signed a $5 million sponsorship deal with the Tasmanian government that will see them increase their commitment there to 4 games a year until 2011. However, both Hawthorn and the Tasmanian government have publicly stated that they have no intention of the club permanently relocating to Tasmania.</p>
<p>Mergers have also been an option for the AFL, as was seen with the Brisbane Bears and the defunct Fitzroy Lions in 1996. If two Victorian teams merge, then it makes room for a 16th team to come from an interstate city - potential candidates for this are the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southport_Sharks_7319.html" title="Southport Sharks">Southport Sharks</a> (on the Gold Coast) or a Tasmanian team (based in <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobart.html" title="Hobart">Hobart</a> or <a href="../../../l/a/u/Launceston%2C_Tasmania_4d2f.html" title="Launceston, Tasmania">Launceston</a>). However, since several failed club merger attempts, the AFL has been less willing to actively pursue the amalgamation of two Victorian-based clubs as an option.</p>

<p>The AFL Commission is responsible for the administration of the AFL. It was established in December 1985 after club parochialism and self interest threatened to undermine the competition.</p>
<p>The Commission's chairman is <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Evans_%28football%29_7f4e.html" title="Ron Evans (football)">Ron Evans</a>, a former Essendon player and president, and the Chief Executive is <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Demetriou_045d.html" title="Andrew Demetriou">Andrew Demetriou</a>. After playing for North Melbourne and Hawthorn, Demetriou had a successful business career before returning to the football world as chief executive of the AFL Players Association. He then crossed to the AFL as Manager of Football Operations before succeeding Wayne Jackson.</p>
<p>In addition to administering the national competition, the AFL is heavily involved in promoting and developing the sport in Australia. It provides funds for local leagues and in conjunction with local clubs, administers the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auskick.html" title="Auskick">Auskick</a> program for young boys and girls.</p>
<p>The AFL also plays a leading role in developing the game outside Australia, with projects to develop the game at junior level in other countries eg South Africa) and by supporting affiliated competitions around the world (See <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_football_around_the_world.html" title="Australian football around the world">Australian football around the world</a>).</p>

<p>The official free-to-air television partners of the AFL are the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Network_cc4b.html" title="Seven Network">Seven Network</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Ten_7cd2.html" title="Network Ten">Network Ten</a>. They own the rights to all eight matches per round, but have on-sold four of those to pay-TV providers <a href="../../../f/o/x/Foxtel.html" title="Foxtel">Foxtel</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austar.html" title="Austar">Austar</a>, meaning only two will actually be shown on each network. <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Sports_b431.html" title="Fox Sports">Fox Sports</a> will show the other four matches exclusively live across Australia.</p>
<p>In a complicated arrangement, Seven will hold exclusive rights to <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_Night_Football_%28Australia%29_b1bd.html" title="Friday Night Football (Australia)">Friday Night Football</a> in all the southern states where it will be shown at 8:30pm local time. In NSW and Queensland (except Gold Coast region where it will be shown live on Seven affiliate <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Television_37fd.html" title="Prime Television">Prime Television</a>), the game will be broadcast live on Fox (effectively a fifth match) through the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main_Event_b586.html" title="Main Event">Main Event</a> channel, and delayed on Seven at different times into different regions of the two states. Seven will also show the Sunday mid-afternoon game live or on delay depending on the market. Ten will show one Saturday afternoon and one Saturday night match live or on delay depending on the market, the same as under the previous deal. Fox will show the other Saturday afternoon and Saturday night matches, and have exclusive access to the early Sunday afternoon game and twilight Sunday game. In Victoria, if the early Sunday game is played at Canberra, Launceston or the Gold Coast, Seven will replay that match at about 10.30pm that night. South Australia and Western Australia also have the privilege of most of their local clubs' away matches being shown live or near live on FTA TV, even if Fox is scheduled to show it live.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Grand Final will be broadcast on Ten in 2007, and alternate between the two FTA networks until 2011, meaning Ten will screen three Grand Finals to Seven's two. As a consolation, Seven will show the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownlow_medal.html" title="Brownlow medal">Brownlow medal</a> count, the <a href="../../../n/a/b/NAB_Cup_86a5.html" title="NAB Cup">Pre-Season Grand Final</a> and have their choice of the best finals throughout the finals series in the years they don't broadcast the Grand Final. Ten will have the same privilege in 2008 and 2010.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ten have also announced that their Saturday Night matches will be shown in High Definition.</p>

<p>Before 2001, Seven had telecast the AFL for 45 years. The only year Seven didn't hold the rights was 1987, when the rights were bought by Sportsplay, which on-sold the rights to the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation_9631.html" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (ABC). Prior to this there were no exclusive television rights, and Seven shared the broadcast areas at venues with the ABC and also the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Network_03d3.html" title="Nine Network">Nine Network</a> for a short period in the early 1970's. The exclusive rights were won back by Seven in 1988 after Sportsplay went out of business.</p>
<p>In late 2000, the Seven Network's main rivals set up a consortium which won the rights. This resulted in matches being broadcast on Nine, Ten and <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Footy_Channel_b597.html" title="Fox Footy Channel">Fox Footy Channel</a> for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_AFL_season_655a.html" title="2002 AFL season">2002</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_AFL_season_7805.html" title="2006 AFL season">2006</a> seasons inclusive. Seven, however, purchased a guaranteed last rights bid which proved to be handy when the AFL invited bids for the rights to telecast the AFL after 2006. In January 2006, shortly after the death of media magnate <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerry_Packer_9dd2.html" title="Kerry Packer">Kerry Packer</a>, a Seven/Ten alliance used Seven's last rights bid to match Nine's offer of $AUD 780 million for broadcast rights in what was the biggest sport telecasting deal in Australian history.</p>
<p>The Nine/Ten/Fox Footy consortium saw the AFL telecast regularly on pay-TV, with three matches per round shown un-interrupted. These included one Saturday afternoon, one Saturday night, and one Sunday match. Nine screened <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_Night_Football_%28Australia%29_b1bd.html" title="Friday Night Football (Australia)">Friday Night Football</a> and two matches on Sunday - the 1pm match live, and a 4pm match on delay - while Ten showed a Saturady afternoon and a Saturday night match, with the live or delayed status depending on the viewers location in the country.</p>

<p>A modern museum called the Hall of Fame and Sensation opened in Melbourne in 2003 to celebrate the culture of the AFL and to provide a venue for the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_Hall_of_Fame_910a.html" title="Australian Football Hall of Fame">Australian Football Hall of Fame</a>. The museum, a licensed off-shoot of the AFL, was originally touted for the MCG, but the Hall of Fame failed to get support from the Melbourne Cricket Club. The new QV shopping centre on Swanston Street was then chosen as the location. However, controversy followed the appointment of an administrator as the museum began running at a loss. Many blamed high entry prices, which were subsequently reduced, and the museum remains open to the public. In early 2006 the name was changed to AFL World. It features various honour boards and memorabilia as well as a range of innovative interactive displays designed to immerse visitors in the experience of elite Aussie Rules.</p>
