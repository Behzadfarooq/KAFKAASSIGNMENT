<p>Further to the discussion on Parliamentary photos: is this a legitimate photo? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:BlairL.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:BlairL.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li>Australia doesn't have crown copyright. Australian copyright law has no special provisions regarding use of materials whose copyright is owned by an Australian government.

<li>Australia does have crown copyright, but it doesn't work the same way as that of the UK.

<p>Well, I want <i>someone</i> to come up with a formula that enables us to use these photos. It seems absurd that Wikipedians from every other country can use official photos of their elected officials and we cannot - not because the Parliament won't let us, but because of this silly Wikipedia rule. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 07:26, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The issue of links to commercial sites is a problem, say for example in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_accident.html" title="Car accident">Car accident</a> article where one firm of US lawyers seems to contantly spam the site. I don't understand the term "viral entries" in the context of plain text unless they are referring to some sort of subliminal content. I guess that is why so many of us have extensive watch lists and spend too much of our time reverting out inappropriate additions. I don't see it as a big problem at present in Australian content articles though. A bigger problem seems to be vandalism apparently from school students.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 22:30, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

You <i>are</i> a lovely piece of work: firstly, I am <i>well aware</i> that NSW is not the center of the universe. If the opposition leader in QLD resigned in similar circumstances, I would add this also. Secondly, noone was assasinated that I am aware. Thirdly, you are comparing notablility by population. Basically, by your reasoning, if Charles King had committed his massive electoral fraud today instead of in 1927 then you would not allow it on the template either.

<dd>OK, as far as being rude and personal, that was indeed uncalled for and I apologise. I do, however, stand by the substantive point. From a global perspective, or even an English-speaking world perspective, the resignation of any state/province Opposition Leader (or equivalent) is relatively small bikkies, whether they are from New South Wales, New Jersey, or Nova Scotia. And, yes, the size and economic influence of the particular jurisdiction is relevant.

<li>My comment was wrong and has been corrected. A dual naming policy has been adopted. The official name of Uluru/Ayers Rock is literally "Uluru/Ayers Rock". Similarly, the official name of Kata Tjuta appears to be "Kata Tjuta/Mount Olga". <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnottygobble_bf70.html" title="User:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> | <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Talk</a> 02:20, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I have just edited <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluru.html" title="Uluru">Uluru</a> to indicate that its official name is "Uluru / Ayers Rock", along with a little bit of background to its dual name. Since I have argued above that we should be avoiding the naming debate by adopting the official name, I'm going to stick to my guns and ask: how would people feel about renaming the article <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluru___Ayers_Rock_b7e0.html" title="Uluru / Ayers Rock">Uluru / Ayers Rock</a>? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnottygobble_bf70.html" title="User:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> | <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Talk</a> 02:43, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can find no evidence that "Uluru / Ayers Rock" is the official name (I consider official to mean government usage).

<dd>I don't mind much as long as consensus is reached. However, that being said I prefer Uluru and I don't think the article should be named Ayers Rock. The Geoscience Australia site is obviously not consistent: a place name search on that site for Uluru brings up the official name of "Uluru / Ayers Rock".<a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazm01?placename=uluru&amp;placetype=0&amp;state=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazm01?placename=uluru&amp;placetype=0&amp;state=0" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> If we go with the official name I suspect it would be the amalgam notwithstanding common government usage and consequent Google hits.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 10:17, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Its important that regardless of what you search for (Uluru or Ayres Rock) you get the same result as both names are widely accepted, whether or not they are the official names or not --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacco007_8efc.html" title="User:Bacco007">bacco007</a> 07:37, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The name of a place is what people call it. This seems to be a case where it is a matter of contention rather than convention, and two views apply. Ayers Rock is more widely known and longer established, and consequently you find that travel agents are tending to drop "Uluru" and use "Ayers Rock" instead. As an example, go to <a href="http://www.northernterritoryholidays.com.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.northernterritoryholidays.com.au/" rel="nofollow">this site</a> and click on the South Australia map.</p>
<p>I think it is important that people looking for the article, regardless of which term they enter, be able to get to the right place, and that we take an NPOV stance.</p>

<dd>I did not violate the 3RR, thank you very much. I reverted your changes as they were against naming conventions, three times if I recall correctly. There was discussion, and people come up with some good points. With that in mind, I can accept redirecting Jamison Centre until I can get together a decent article about it (which I'll begin preparing for tonight).

<p>Well, firstly let me say I don't know much about Canberra suburbs or Canberra's shopping centres. For the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sydney_suburbs_28df.html" title="List of Sydney suburbs">Sydney suburbs</a> though, we've been keeping shopping centres off the list thus far (e.g. someone added Warringah Mall, and it got removed after some discussion). Currently the shopping centre articles and the suburb articles are one and the same thing in most cases though (e.g. <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miranda%2C_New_South_Wales_67fd.html" title="Miranda, New South Wales">Miranda, New South Wales</a>), (or don't exist yet, in the case of which Warringah Mall), which makes it much easier. We also list localities in italics, to distinguish them from suburbs, because there are some places which are well known but which aren't officially suburbs. It's a bit of grey line as to whether a shopping centre is a locality, and therefore could be listed, but for the time being we've said they're not, because they're not defined as suburbs or localities by the Geographical Names Board of NSW, and because they don't seem to appear in our street directories in the index of suburbs and localities. However, Canberra and Sydney are very different cities, so you folks need to use whatever works best in your context. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 00:44, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've started a new city WikiProject, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Lake_Macquarie_21e8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Lake Macquarie">Wikipedia:WikiProject Lake Macquarie</a>. There is some confusion among Australians about the classification of places within the <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Macquarie_e49a.html" title="Lake Macquarie">Lake Macquarie</a> LGA, some people calling them independent towns, some calling them suburbs of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle%2C_Australia_6368.html" title="Newcastle, Australia">Newcastle</a>. However, residents of Lake Macquarie are in general deeply offended if they are told they are part of Newcastle, just like residents of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Stephens%2C_New_South_Wales_6c4f.html" title="Port Stephens, New South Wales">Port Stephens</a>. Luckily for them, the facts are on their side, Lake Macquarie is Newcastle's slightly larger neighbour, with its own independent local government. I'll provide whatever references are needed to convince everyone of this.</p>
<p>Because of this general confusion, Lake Macquarie articles have been inconsistently categorised and formatted in the past, and this is the perfect problem for a WikiProject to address. I hope some other interested people will join this WikiProject and help in creating lots of great articles about this area. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 09:00, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you need separate articles for the lake and the city, perhaps start Lake Macquarie (lake) ??. <a href="../../../c/f/i/User%7ECfitzart_a3fb.html" title="User:Cfitzart">Cfitzart</a> 09:25, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems a little strange to have Lake Macquarie (lake) - perhaps the local government article could be placed at its official title with a disambiguation pointer from <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Macquarie_e49a.html" title="Lake Macquarie">Lake Macquarie</a>? <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:54, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Crazy_idea:_Harnessing_child_labour" id="Crazy_idea:_Harnessing_child_labour"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Crazy idea: Harnessing child labour</span></h2>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I've got this crazy idea, and it might just work, but I want to know whether you think it'll work or not, so hear me out:</p>
<p>The basic premise is this: In our secondary schools, we have a vast untapped pool of child labour. Almost all of that labour is wasted writing essays or solving made-up problems that only the teacher will ever look at, and which will then be thrown away and promptly forgotten. If the aim of secondary education is to educate and learn, and you educate and learn by doing, then as a ongoing taxpayer who foots part of the bill for this whole exercise, surely it's not unreasonable to suggest homework and class activities which are just as educational <b>and</b> are also useful. In particular, I'm thinking that it'll take a long time to flesh out the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sydney_suburbs_28df.html" title="List of Sydney suburbs">list of Sydney suburbs</a> if we let them grow using the current organic process (there's around 400 of them). What we need is to speed the whole process up at little by generating some external involvement. Now, who can we ask? (See where I'm going with this yet?) Why, the schools of course! Lets look at their attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do they have the motive? (Check: Teachers need educational tasks to give the kids something to do, and the kids don't really get a say)</li>
<li>Do they have the opportunity? (Check: Classes run for much of the day on weekdays, that's a lot of hours to fill!)</li>
<li>Do they have the means? (Check: schools have computers, courtesy of the taxpayer, and furthermore many people have computers at home)</li>
<li>Locality and local knowledge (Check: schools generally draw students from the surrounding area, and the teachers and students know that area quite well because they work there and usually live there too).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, each school would be a natural "sponsor" of the suburb in which they are located. All we need to do is to suggest this as a class activity. It would involve clear and concise writing, copy editing, getting familiar with computers, logical organisation of though, making links to other topics to see where and how things are connected, and possibly some photography of local landmarks. In short, it's like what they do already, only instead of being a non-productive private exercise that's immediately forgotten as soon as it's done, it would a useful and enduring contribution towards the sum total of public information (whilst still being just as academically useful).</p>
<p>I'm thinking a letter or email along these lines:</p>
<hr />
<p>Subject: Fictional Public School:<br />
Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
<p>Are members of the general public able to suggest possible class activities? If so, I would like to first tell you about something, and then made a suggestion: On the Internet you will find the world's largest encyclopedia, called the Wikipedia (the web address is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a> ). This encyclopedia is very unusual in several regards, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the information is publicly available, without charge.</li>
<li>Anyone can expand it or improve it. You don't need a password or anyone's permission.</li>
<li>It's a not-for-profit organisation: it's maintained by volunteers, operational costs are paid for by donations, and there is no advertising.</li>
<li>It's international: Contributors come from all over the world, including Australia generally, and Sydney specifically.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of these attributes, the Wikipedia has been grown very quickly from it's start in 2001, and is now already larger than the Encyclopedia Britannica, and continues to grow rapidly.</p>
<p>The reason I am telling you this is that we have recently added article entries for every suburb in Sydney. At the moment most of these entries are extremely brief. I would like to suggest a class activity of expanding the entry for the school's suburb. This would involve a number of things, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some research on the suburb, it's origins and history.</li>
<li>logical organisation of though.</li>
<li>clear and concise writing.</li>
<li>copy editing.</li>
<li>making links to other topics (such as surrounding suburbs) to see where and how things are connected.</li>
<li>possibly some digital photography of local landmarks, if you wanted.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also an interesting and fun way to get familiar and involved with computers in general, and with the very unusual concept of the Wikipedia specifically. Also, many school activities are by their nature ephemeral: they're done, and either thrown away, lost, or forgotten. This on the other hand will endure, and will go on to be improved upon and expanded upon by future contributors.</p>
<p>It's a unique opportunity to get involved and learn about the local area in which the students live and go to school, and I encourage you to please consider getting involved.</p>
<p>To get to the entry for the school's suburb, just go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peakhurst%2C_New_South_Wales" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peakhurst%2C_New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peakhurst%2C_New_South_Wales</a> . Or alternatively go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a> and type "Peakhurst, New South Wales" (without the quotes) in the "search" box on the left margin of the page.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,<br />
Nick J.</p>

<dd>Nick, I had a similar thought about six months ago, regarding Melbourne suburbs, and sent off an email to all U3A's (University of the Third Age) in Victoria, as well as LGA's and local Historical Societies. I'm not sure if it helped to recruit any new people to Wikipedia but I certainly didn't get many replies. For you, and anyone else thinking of doing something similar, the following is the text of the email I sent out:</dd>

<p>It should have been a recipe for disaster, and it is still far from perfect, but in less than four years, an estimated 10,000 volunteers have written more than 1.2 million entries in 160 languages.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is continuously evolving. There are now around 3,000 new entries being added each day.</p>
<p>Each article in Wikipedia has an editing page, a discussion page and a history page. Articles are written and submitted by users, which means you, me, or anyone else in the world who wishes to contribute their wealth of knowledge to the project. Once an article is posted, other users can then edit or revise the content of the site.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Melbourne_547b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Melbourne">Wikipedia Melbourne Project</a> is an area that is in need of volunteers to write articles.</p>
<p>I am sure that many members of U3A would have knowledge and wisdom which they could contribute to the Wikipedia Melbourne Project.</p>
<p>I would be pleased if you could bring the Wikipedia Melbourne Project to the attention of all your members.</p>

<dd>One problem that I can see there is that the email isn't personalised - the beginning almost makes it sounds like spam. But it's a very good idea in principle. :) <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 06:18, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I know for one of my children, their major geography project last year was a study of the suburb they lived in. The data gathered was very useful for my contributions to Wikipedia. The issue with children is that for some of them there already would be major articles, others would be starting with blank or near blank slates. For many schools there would be more than one child living in the suburb. Each child needs the opportunity to work on the project themselves, cooperative work is limited to small teams. It is not the same as adding material to an article and subjecting oneself to merciless editing. In short I don't think Nick's project will work. I recall seeing somewhere some frustration with teriary students who had been set assignments to contribute to the wikipedia and were not adding a lot of value. I can't find the exact discussion of the incident (probably on votes for deletion some months ago) but a page that might give some ideas about the experience is at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchool_and_university_projects_a92e.html" title="Wikipedia:School and university projects">Wikipedia:School and university projects</a> and the related <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia_talk%7ESchool_and_university_projects_29c1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:School and university projects">talk page</a>.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">User:AYArktos</a> | <a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">Talk</a> 10:39, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Heads up, it's done! The messages went out a few minutes ago to secondary public schools in New South Wales.</p>
<ul>
<li>I've tried to make them feel less spammy.</li>
<li>If schools aren't interested, then they're not interested. Frankly, if I was running a school or an appropriate class (such as Geography or History), then I would be. In the end though, all you can do is tell them about it and help answer questions, and then let them decide whether to participate or not.</li>
<li>I included the links to the pages about using the Wikipedia for school projects.</li>
<li>I looked through the talk pages about past problems, and the real problems came from tertiary students who were either adding original and obscure research, or were adding made up concepts (like nonsense words) because their lecturers wanted them to challenge their concepts of reality! I honestly don't think these problems will be particularly applicable to this.</li>
<li>I added redirects and did moves to find as many of the appropriate towns and suburbs as I could, and for those that currently do not have an article I used a slightly different message explaining that there currently is no article for their suburb or town, and maybe they would like to add one.</li>
<li>I've created a page where people can ask questions about this at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Sydney_Suburbs_Schools_Project_713f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Sydney/Suburbs/Schools Project">Wikipedia:WikiProject Sydney/Suburbs/Schools Project</a>.</li>

<dd>A great idea. In fact it is already being done at US universities. One lecturer makes the production of a Wikipedia article a compulsory unit in the course he teaches. Some are a bit crap and end up in the AfD but others go on to be fully-fledged articles. I might try and arrange a similar think here in SA and the NT. Lisa 08:31, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
