<p>The broad aim of the Australian Air Force Cadets is to better equip young people for community life by fostering initiative, leadership, discipline and loyalty through a training program designed to stimulate an interest in the Royal Australian Air Force.</p>
<p>The training program is structured to reflect the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>to give Cadets a foundation of Air Force knowledge and discipline,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>to develop the qualities of leadership, initiative and self-reliance,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>to develop good character and good citizenship in the widest sense,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>to develop an interest in the Royal Australian Air Force and aviation generally,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>to instil a knowledge of the history of aviation, and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>to encourage Cadets to continue an active interest in aviation into their adult life.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Air_Force_Cadets_a265.html" title="Edit section: Cadet Training">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cadet Training</span></h2>
<p>Due to the relationship the AAFC has with the RAAF, the focus of much of the training is related to aviation and the RAAF which leads many cadets into a career in the RAAF or in the civilian aviation industry. However, aviation related subjects are not the only subjects taught within the organisation. There is also a great focus on Fieldcraft and Survival Training, Weapons Training, and Drill and Ceremonial as well.</p>
<p>As well as all the RAAF and aviation training involved, the AAFC is also an organisation which allows teenagers to socialise and meet new people not only local to them, but throughout the country.</p>
<p>AAFC training is broken down into a number of training stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruit Training - a new stage of training introduced in 2007 to replace the Induction stage. Includes Service Knowledge Recruit (SKR), Fieldcraft Recruit (FCR) and Drill and Ceremonial Recruit (DCR).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Induction - had six compulsory subjects covering: Aircraft Recognition (AR), Aviation (AV), Drill &amp; Ceremonial (DC), Service Knowledge (SK), Field Craft (FC) and Teambuilding Training (TT). Induction has been replaced by Recruit training as of 2007.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Basic - six compulsory subjects covering: AR, AV, DC, SK, FC and Personal Development (PD) (PDB removed from 2007 Basic syllabus, now an elective PDE).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Proficiency - three compulsory and three elective subjects, the compulsory are: AV, DC and FC</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Advanced - three compulsory and three elective subjects, the compulsory are: AV, DC and SK</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Qualified - consists of a mix of 'projects' and electives</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a wide range of elective subjects, such as Radio Communications, Firearms Training, Field Operations, Aircraft Engines, Meteorology, Aircraft Engines and Drill and Ceremonial (with rifles). Proficiency and Advanced Stages also have their own Aircraft Recognition (ARP/ARA) and Survival (SVP/SVA) subjects, which are electives in those stages.</p>
<p>In addition, cadets are able to attend a series of promotion courses in order to attain ranks past Leading Cadet. Each rank holds a higher level of responsibility and brings cadets more opportunities and experiences. These usually go for two to three weeks at a RAAF base, and have their own set of compulsory subjects. The promotion courses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Junior Non-Commissioned Officer (JNCO) Course, for promotion from Leading Cadet to Cadet Corporal (usually 10-14 days)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Senior Non-Commissioned Officer (SNCO) Course, for promotion from Cadet Corporal to Cadet Sergeant (usually 2-3 weeks)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cadet Warrant Officer's (CWOFF) Course, for promotion from Cadet Sergeant or Cadet Flight Sergeant to Cadet Warrant Officer (usually 2-3 weeks)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cadet Under Officer's (CUO) Course, for promotion from Cadet Sergeant, Cadet Flight Sergeant or Cadet Warrant Officer to Cadet Under Officer (usually 3-4 weeks)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cadets receive the opportunity to participate in a wide range of activities such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bivouacs</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>General Service Training Camps (GSTs) which involve spending a week on an Australian Defence Force (ADF) base (usually a RAAF base)</li>

<li>Powered Flying Courses</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Gliding Courses</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aeromodelling camps</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Parachuting (which has returned in 2007 after a few years absence)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Various competitions including the National Field Craft Competition, National Flying Competition, Various Regional Drill, Shooting, Chief of the Defence Forces Challenge and other competitions</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Promotion courses (to be promoted to higher ranks within the AAFC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>International Air Cadet Exchange program</li>
</ul>

<p>The AAFC uses an online cadet administration system known as Hector to manage many functions previously done on paper. This includes all personnel records, promotions, activity applications, appointments etc.</p>
<p>There are also several other systems both in development and the early stages of testing, which include the OA86 (activity planning form) submission database, 'Achilles'.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Air_Force_Cadets_a265.html" title="Edit section: Command and Structure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Command and Structure</span></h2>
<p>The AAFC organisation as a whole falls under the command of Headquarters AAFC (HQAAFC), based in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a>. At the organisation's head is the Commander - AAFC (CDR-AAFC), the only person to hold the rank of Group Captain (AAFC). The CDR-AAFC reports to the Director General Cadets - Air Force, a member of the RAAF who holds the rank of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Commodore_36d7.html" title="Air Commodore">Air Commodore</a>, and in turn reports to the Australian Defence Force Cadets Defence Steering Group, headed by the Head - Cadet Policy (of one-star officer rank).</p>
<p>Under HQAAFC are the operational and support wings, each headed by a Wing Commander (AAFC). Individual squadrons report to wing command and are headed by an officer holding the rank of PLTOFF (AAFC) to SQNLDR (AAFC), depending on the establishment of the squadron.</p>
<p>Airmen/women and junior officers are posted to an individual squadron (as per a squadron's size) as instructors of cadets (IOC) and officers of cadets (OOC).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Air_Force_Cadets_a265.html" title="Edit section: Drill and Ceremonial">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Drill and Ceremonial</span></h2>
<p>AAFC training constitutes much <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drill.html" title="Drill">Drill</a> and Ceremonial training, ranging from basic static drill in recruit phase to advanced banner and sword drill on officer courses. Each parade night a "squadron daily parade" is held (daily for <a href="../../../r/a/a/RAAF_f18f.html" title="RAAF">RAAF</a> SQNs, weekly for AAFC SQNs) in which all cadets participate, with <a href="../../../n/c/o/NCO_a82b.html" title="NCO">NCOs</a> and above assuming executive positions of Flight Sergeant (CCPL), Flight Commander (CSGT/CFSGT), Parade Warrant Officer (CWOFF), Parade Commander (CUO) and often Reviewing Officer (CUO). Lower ranks may hold these positions where there are insufficient senior cadets. Squadrons also hold CO's Parades (usually once a month but not always) where staff go on parade and the squadron is inspected by the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commanding_Officer_6386.html" title="Commanding Officer">Commanding Officer</a>.</p>
<p>AAFC squadrons often form <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guard.html" title="Guard">guards</a> and banner parties at <a href="../../../a/n/z/ANZAC_459e.html" title="ANZAC">ANZAC</a>/<a href="../../../r/e/m/Remembrance.html" title="Remembrance">Remembrance</a>/<a href="../../../v/p/_/VP_0642.html" title="VP">VP</a> services and other cadets will march on these parades. Promotion course graduation parades are very significant event, practise of which can take days. These parades will often be reviewed by a senior RAAF officer and consist of a number of squadrons/flights as well as colour parties. Graduation parades will generally be armed (SNCO candidates and above only in some cases) with F-88 Steyrs (often F-88i innoccuous) and swords for executives. Colour party members are often kitted out in full ceremonial gear including gloves, sash and special belt.</p>
<p><br />
There are a total of 9 Drill and Ceremonial subjects for cadets in the AAFC. Five of these are home training subjects, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drill and Ceremonial Recruit (DCR) - consists of basic static (on the spot) and marching drill, saluting and basic theory relating to aims of drill and safety considerations in drill.</li>
<li>Drill and Ceremonial Basic (DCB) - cadets consolidate their recruit drill and progress to more advanced marching including turns on the march.</li>
<li>Drill and Ceremonial Proficiency (DCP) - here LCDTs and CCPLs officially learn the slow march (although this is often taught before a CDTs first end-of-year ceremonial parade) as well as more advanced manuevres such as forms and form flights.</li>
<li>Drill and Ceremonial Advanced (DCA) - LCDTs and NCOs in advanced stage complete learning of all flight drill movements consisting of double time and forming hollow square. DCA also consists of Command and Control (CC) (calling commands/fault correcting a flight of cadets) and Mutual Instruction (MI) (basic drill instruction) components.</li>
<li>Drill and Ceremonial Elective (DCE) - consists of three parts which can be taught together or separately. DCE is often taught in proficiency and/or advanced stage. It is rifle drill with the L1A1 <a href="../../../s/l/r/SLR_7df1.html" title="SLR">SLR</a>, covering all movements including basic rifle movements (shoulder arms, order arms, present arms, saluting with a rifle), rifle drill on the march, ceremonial rifle drill (rest on arms) and other movements such as Port Arms, High Port Arms and Recover Arms. Cadet who have completed all of DCE are able to act as Banner Escorts or Guard Members on ceremonial occasions.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Each promotion course has a DC subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drill and Ceremonial JNCO (DCJ) - completes drill to basic level at a higher standard and introduces prospective CCPLs to Command and Control (CC), a key element of that rank. There are also some theory components and candidates are taught how to act as a FLTSGT on a SQN daily parade. Assessment for DCJ consists of 50% PDA (Personal Drill Assessment) and 50% CC.</li>
<li>Drill and Ceremonial SNCO (DCS) - perfects drill to an exceptional standard expected of a CSGT. This may include long times practising simple movements such as attention to stand at ease to ensure utter perfection. DCS consists of much theory and its main aim is to develop candidates as suitable instructors of elementary drill, through the instruction and practise of MI format. Rifle (F-88 Steyr) drill is learnt and candidates are also taught how to act as a FLTCDR on a SQN daily parade. DCS is the second-longest Drill subject, consisting of a total of 35 periods, in addition to daily parades and graduation parade practises on the SNCO promotion course. Assessment for DCS consists of 20% PDA, 10% CC, 60% MI and 10% TE (Theory Examination).</li>
<li>Drill and Ceremonial CWOFF (DCW) - candidates are expected to already have consistently high standards of drill. DCW aims to provide a broad theoretical knowledge, perfect skills of drill instruction and assessment and impart the knowledge of how to plan, organise, manage and execute all parades. CWOFFs are taught to act as a Parade WOFF, often as well as Parade Commander. They are also expected to be able to instruct DC on a JNCO promotion course. DCW consists of much theory and almost all Drill movements in existence are practised and perfected. Candidates learn Rifle, Sword and Banner drill. Assessment for DCW consists of 20% PDA, 10% CC, 35% MI and 35% TE.</li>
<li>Drill and Ceremonial CUO (DCO) - DCO ensures that candidates have a high standard of drill relevant to the officer, but skills in drill instruction/assessment are not normally taught as on CWOFF course (although an elective MI exercise can be undertaken at discretion of course and detachment staff). DCO focuses on personal drill and command and control as well as imparting broad knowledge of RAAF ceremonial procedures, as CUOs are often appointed as Parade Commanders, Host Officers, Reviewing Officers, Banner Bearers, Guard Commanders etc. The course includes Rifle, Sword and Banner Drill and is much shorter than DC on SNCO/CWOFF, coming in at 21 periods. Assessment for DCO consists of 40% PDA, 40% CC and 20% TE. MI is not assessable on CUO course whether undertaken as an elective or not.</li>
