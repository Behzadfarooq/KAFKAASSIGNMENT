<dd>The sport known as <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a> was called "Melbourne rules" and "Victorian rules" for decades by their governing body as well. Your point about the ASA previously calling it soccer contradicts your argument that it shouldn't be called football because the governing body changed its name. And <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">maybe I am stupid</a>, but I doubt that for starters, the majority of the 3.3% of Australians who speak Italian and Greek at home think straight to <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> or Aussie rules when "football" is mentioned.

<dd>You don't appear to be aware that rugby league supporters also refer to their game as football. But anyway, I like all these games. I often watch soccer on TV and as it happens, I wrote a large proportion of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer_in_Australia_0424.html" title="Soccer in Australia">Soccer in Australia</a>. But we have to face facts and IMO it's brainless and counter-productive for officials to give a sport a name which is not acceptable to, or used by, 90% of Australians. Why should we repeat their error, when they will quite possibly change it back to "soccer" in a few years time? It would be laughable to suggest to Americans that articles about U.S. soccer subjects should refer to "football", and that should be the case with Australian articles as well, especially when there are two other games which are already regarded as football in Australia. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 10:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it isn't. a) Canadians tend to be pretty cluey about this sort of thing, and b) in any case, gridiron isn't an international game in the same way that football, cricket, softball, rugby, etc. are, and it's unlikely that someone would search for it, even if they really were silly enough to call it "football". That said, "national football team" is fine as a disambig (provided someone, Grant65, I'm looking at you, hint hint, keeps it free of links intended for the real football team), and there's no reason why we can't add that. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 13:45, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

Of course not - people searching in Wikipedia for Kyiv would most likely be looking for the city, and the small proportion looking for the Australian version would be easily notified by the redirect template at the top of Kiev. And <i><b>honestly</b></i>, if you were searching for the All-Australian team (not really a national team since they never play a game) or the International Rules team (which is different enough that i've never heard it called "football") in an encyclopedia, would you seriously look for <i><b>Australian national football team</b></i>? 02:43, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Aussie rules football" is the usual long form, and "football" or "footy" is the conventional short form unless the person you're talking to isn't a fan, in which case it's "Aussie rules".

<p>Look socecr and football fans. Wheither you call it Aussie rules, Aussie rules in Sydney is irrelevant. The fact is it's called Football in Vic, WA, SA, TAS and NT. So don't ask me where it's called Football. If you say football here 90% of people will think it's Aussie rules. I don't care really, but changing a name is one thing, but trying to get other people to change theirs is something different. And a lot of Soccer fans have NOT adapted the name (like me and my vast majourity of friends). Not that we object it, it's just too confusing at the moment. If it comes more popular, than yes we will. But to suggest that a name that's only been named for one year has already changed and everyone has adapted it is ridiculous. These things take time. It's not going to happen overnight, regardless of how much you'd like that.</p>

<p>In the English language the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28word%29.html" title="Football (word)">word "football"</a> has always referred to a number of different codes. Soccer dates back only to 1863, which makes it a more recent development than either rugby or Australian rules. Even in the U.K., use of "football" to refer exclusively to soccer is a 20th century phenomenon and rugby union and league supporters there still refer to their games as "football". As does virtually every single supporter of American football or Canadian football. The "How-dare-you-call-it-soccer" fundamentalists, wherever they are found, are wilfully ignoring both history and use of the English language in other countries. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 12:42, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To summarise arguments from the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Talk%7EAustralia_national_soccer_team_Archive_1_492d.html" title="Talk:Australia national soccer team/Archive 1">talk page archive</a>, the present article title may be defended as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Articles on a topic specific to a particular English-speaking country are to be written in the form of English used in that country (see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English</a>). Obviously, for this article, that's <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>.</li>
<li>On Wikipedia, popular usage trumps official usage for defining "correctness". For example, the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> government spell the name of the nation's capital "Kyiv" in English, which better reflects the correct Ukrainian spelling of the word, but on Wikipedia its article is found at "<a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>", based on the more common English usage.</li>
<li>Clarity matters.</li>
<li>"Football" is an ambiguous term in Australian English; sometimes it refers to soccer (including in most of the soccer "establishent"'s use of the term) but more often to Aussie rules, rugby league or rugby union.</li>
<li>Therefore, the advantages of titling the article "Australian national soccer team" — clarity and following majority local usage — outweigh the disadvantages, which boil down to annoying some (but not all — I observe that <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancred_11fe.html" title="User:Tancred">Tancred</a>'s suburban club is, presumably, affiliated to <a href="http://www.soccernsw.com.au/home/" class="external text" title="http://www.soccernsw.com.au/home/" rel="nofollow"><i>Soccer</i> New South Wales</a>) of the players and followers of the game. Note that a redirect from <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_team.html" title="Australia national football team">Australia national football team</a> here is used to ensure links put in the usual Wikipedia format for international soccer teams work.</li>

<dd>Addition - another reason <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_team.html" title="Australia national football team">Australia national football team</a> should redirect here first is that it is actually the official name of the team.

<dd>That's how it is now, and if we swapped them around. calling this football, and having soccer redirect there wouldn't be too much of a difference. So there should be no real complaints from soccer aficionados on the current state of play. Most of this debate springs from the assertion that name of the game is football, when for the majority of us (Australians) it isn't.

<dd>Why do you think they care so much? We don't attack Aussie Rules pages for falsely claiming that their sport is called football. We don't care what they call it on wikipedia. There's a "Footy Show" here in Brisbane and it's about rugby league and you don't see us attacking the Aussie Rules pages for claiming the their game is called footy too. --<a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebunct_e157.html" title="User:Debunct">Debunct</a> 11:55, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hate to tell you, but Aussie rules was referred to as "footy" a long time before soccer was. It's an Australian term. So don't claim us of stealing the word football, if now you're going to start using "footy" to describe soccer.</p>

<p>In the section, "Player drain by other countries", the use of the term "granny rule" is inaccurate. Heritage alone does not qualify a player for a national team - to play for a national team, the player has to have the passport of that country, through naturalization or an existing dual citizenship. Also, the use of the phrase "lured away", combined with "granny rule", seems not NPOV.

<p>Just to clarify, my point was that there is no "granny rule" - either you are eligible for citizenship or not. So you have to have dual citizenship or go through the naturalization process. Having a European grandparent certainly helps, but it's neither a prerequisite nor a universal pass for a passport.</p>
<p><i>"European nations can claim native Australians for their squad using the "Granny Rule","</i> was at best misleading and <i>"players become eligible if they can prove that they have ancestors of that particular nations."</i> was simply wrong. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 05:50, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First paragraph refers to our 'upset win' over Japan. Australia were favourites for that match and although it wasn't until the end of the game that we scored I still wouldn't refer to it as an 'upset'. I haven't got a source to back me up at the moment but sports tab and canbet both had Australia as favourites at less than 2.5 to 1 with Japan at about 3.2 to 1. (3.00 for the draw). Also seeing as we'd just come off a draw with The Netherlands and A good win over Lichenstein I think that also would classify us as favourites. Just my opinion anyhow, would like to know what others think. JDCB4 07:10, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Japan is not only ranked much higher, but also has tied Germany 2-2 going into the tournament and has far more international experience as a national team. This is the first time Australia participated in the World Cup in 32 years and the team had never scored even a scored a goal before. This is Japan's third consecutive World Cup. Perhaps Hiddink's coaching made odds at betting sites tip to Australia's favor, but the indicators pointed to Japan winning. Personally, I knew Hiddink's Australia would win though. But that doesn't matter: Australia's victory over Japan was an upset.--<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Edgar_35f5.html" title="User:Sir Edgar">Sir Edgar</a> 07:21, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To add to what Sir Edgar wrote, it should be pointed out that betting odds <i>can</i> be an indicator of teams' relative strength, it's not a reliable one. Odds are set based on bookmakers' prediction of how bettors will place their money. This means that obvious favorites like Brazil are favored by bookmakers, but it will also reflect bettors' bias for team they root for or familiar with. So it wouldn't surprise me that Australian and European bookmakers set the odds for Australia higher, even if they weren't necessarily the favorites to a neutral, informed observer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the case of Australia vs Japan, I'm afraid you won't see many very informed, unbiased opinions on who were the favorites since the international sports press aren't familiar with either team. My personal, biased opinion is that the result was an upset based on Japan's overall quality, real tournament experience and the command of the majority of the match, but that's just an opinion. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 02:23, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The team's endurance faltered in the second half and Hiddink's strategy payed off well bringing in Cahill and Aloisi, but the perception that Australia was supposed to win is biased and frankly, in my opinion, seems racist. Japan had beat Russia and Tunisia (and tied Belgium) in the 2002 World Cup to make it to the final 16, before narrowly losing to eventual semi-finalists Turkey. Also, all the matches it played in during the 1998 World Cup were either a draw or lost on a margin of one goal and it only barely failed to qualify for 1994 in what is known as the <a href="../../../a/g/o/Agony_of_Doha_6c83.html" title="Agony of Doha">Agony of Doha</a>. Australia is an unknown entity in international football, but I can imagine Europeans rooting, and betting, for them. Most Japanese, however, expected their team to win and so did many other people who know Asian football teams.--<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Edgar_35f5.html" title="User:Sir Edgar">Sir Edgar</a> 05:45, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm curious, Panairjdde, where did you get that particular summary from? It was an opinion piece about how FIFA, its referees and its rules favour the soccer/football powerhouse nations or teams rather than encouraging development of the game in comparatively minor soccer/football nations, such as Australia and African countries. Personally, I agree with the author of the article, soccer claims to be the world game, but not much of the world is getting a chance to play at the highest level and that's not for the lack of trying. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourblind_e97e.html" title="User:Colourblind">Colourblind</a> 01:18, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As regards the rules, they are equal for all the teams.</dd>
<dd>As regards powerhouses, Australians complain for the penalty against Italy, but with do not say anything about the red card to Materazzi against (powerhouse?) Australia. At the previous WC, Italy had five goals disallowed against "powerhouses" Ecuador, Croatia, and Mexico, and (1) a red card instead of a penalty (2) a controversial penalty against (3) an unexistend one-against-one offside call against "powerhouse" South Korea, but everyone (even Australians) dismissed those claims — except Spaniards, when they got the same service in the following game against SK). The problem is that everyone remember what it was done against them, but no one remebers what was done against the others/in their favour.</dd>
<dd>The red card against Materazzi and the penalty against Australia can be discussed, but they are part of the game. And if a controversial decision against an underdog is a complot against other world countries, it is better to avoid watching any competition involving different countries.</dd>
<dd>A final tought (if it is personal and out of place, feel free to answer on my talkpage). This sport, football, is now shaped in the way we (Europeans and South Americans) like to play it. If it is really a game that can be a pleasure even in other countries of the world, this is a good thing, because we can enjoy it together. But if the price for a wide acceptance and diffusion of football is a deep change in its rules and its spirit, than it is better to keep it a South American/European thing: we shall enjoy other sports, eventually.--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanairjdde_99b7.html" title="User:Panairjdde">Panairjdde</a> 09:39, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly, soccer/football - who cares. Secondly, this article is long as australians love their sport. does it really matter if it is slightly bias? the simple fact is that with reporting anything, any historical account, there will be bias. With such an emotive issue such as sport, i think that wikipedia should have a slightly more leniant policy. I have been repetedly changing this article to say that australia were cruely eliminated, and the over-zealous dickheads on their powertrips keep reverting. WHY? anyone could agree that getting a penalty in the 95th minute (unfarely) awarded against you, when you had a reasonable chance of winning in extra time is cruel.</p>
<p>"NPOV!" they cry! but what really is the harm in this? It was cruel, it was devistating, and, unfortunate for australia and their supporters. the passion seen in world football is what makes the game so great, and why can't this be reflected in the article? Sure, i'm not advocating for the page to be titled "australia is the best and the ref's suck," but surely a little emotion in a sports page could be allowed?</p>

<dd>That's the beauty of Wikipedia - it presents all the facts that all sides agree to be true and inarguable, and readers can make their own judgements.

<dd>Honestly? I'm going to do absolutely nothing. Granted, the "dazzling" and "iconic" are problematic, mostly because they aren't supported.

<dd>A rather strange idea to base the quality of a team on one result; after all Australia beat Brazil in the 2002 Confederations Cup, therefore does that mean Brazil is lower in quality than a team that "could not beat the Solomon Islands"? Of course it isn't. Also, I'd like to point out that in the same qualification series, Australia thumped the Solomons 9-1 on aggregate in the final, as stated in the aticle. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_N_9a91.html" title="User:Emcee N">Emcee N</a> 09:28, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is not an unsourced claim, there was a clear commentary by many media reports at the time (hence this is not just my personal opinion). These media reports included questions to that effect of Socceroos players. I will admit that it is speculation, and no investigation was ever launched into the event in question (as was noted in my original posting). However, you will note that there have been several similar incidents in the past which are mentioned in wikipedia articles. These include <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_FIFA_World_Cup_1204.html" title="1978 FIFA World Cup">1978 FIFA World Cup</a> &amp; <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982_FIFA_World_Cup_ab66.html" title="1982 FIFA World Cup">1982 FIFA World Cup</a>. It should be noted that these World Cups involved similar incidents where certain quid pro quos existed that are believed to have occurred. However, no sanctions or investigation occurred into the incidents. In 1978, there appears to have been some type of informal agreement between the Argentinians and the Peruvians to have Argentina win by 4 goals. Similar in 1982 there appears to have been some agreement between Germany &amp; Austria to produce a 1-0 scoreline. These were never substantiated by investigation and are based solely on circumstantial evidence, however they are referenced in wikipedia articles. Note that these articles are accusing these teams of some form of collusion (my article simply noted a willingness by the Socceroos to underperform, a much less aggressive theory).</p>
<p>This is not a court of law, and so long as we state the facts, there should be no reason not to note what the possible theories are. It should then be up to the reader to make their decision. I see no reason why this very plausible theory should not be included.Please have a response within a week as to why it should not be included, or give me some guidelines on how I can amend the posting so that it may meet your approval (I am open to compromise). <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">User: Nlsanand</a></p>

<dd>You're right, it's not a court of law, but the same principles stand - just the facts, and only the facts in evidence. Your claim may have a source, but you didn't actually cite it.

Please refer to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. No matter how strongly you or anyone believe/suspect it to be true, it doesn't belong if it's not published in an independent.

<dd><i>There is some belief that Australia intentionally underperformed in the final match to ensure the Solomon Islands finished ahead of New Zealand, and thereby have an easier final playoff. However, no investigation has ever been performed and there is only circumstantial evidence indicating this.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides the absence of a verifiable source, I had the biggest issue with the opening phrase, <i>"There is some belief"</i>. They are what is known on Wikipedia as <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">weasel words</a> because it makes a point without providing real proof. There is some belief that the Earth is flat - this is a true statement but that doesn't mean it's a particularly useful statement. You have to explain who believes it, and why people who don't support the Socceroos should care what they believe. For example, if a prominent journalist or a New Zealand player said, "The Aussies drew the match on purpose", then write, "_____ said, '_____.'"</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I don't think there would be anything wrong with the paragraph if you state the theory as explicit quotes or exerpts from a notable person, or it's widely reported in a reputable, independent and reasonably unbiased source.

<dd>How do you balance that against the fact that noone in australia knows of the name of the sport as "Football". The naming of official organisations does not dictate colloquial usage.

<dd>I'm in Australia. I know it as football, and I can assure you I'm not the only one. When I open the "Football Fever" section of the Tuesday newspaper, everything in there is about the round ball - it wouldn't make sense for them to start a section called "Ice Skating Fever" and write about lawn bowls, because <i><b>"noone in australia knows of the name of the sport as "Ice Skating""</b></i>. This discussion has been done to death and a compromise was found between people who call it football (this includes Australians) and those who call it by its nickname.

This is silly. The socceroos are not the national football team, the Kangaroos are. The socceroos are the national SOCCER team. Just because the administration has changed its name, and a few of its friends in the media involved with contracts to the A-League and the socceroos have decided to call it football, DOES NOT MEAN WIKIPEDIA SHOULD REFER TO IT AS FOOTBALL. At least 9/10 Australians do not call soccer "football" and that will probably not change!!! Wikipedia should reflect Australian English, not some foreign English terms, and call it soccer.

<dd>It is the soccer world cup to Australians. Noone but a very angry and very small minority think that soccer is football in Australia. Never has been, and never will. The Australian National Football team has always been the Kangaroos as opposed to the Australian Rugby team, the Wallabies. DID I CALL YOU A WOG? NO, WHY REDIRECT THE POINT, that almost nobody that a tiny angry minority refer to the nationa football team when talking about soccer.

<p>That is in itself an inaccurate and stupid understanding of the meaning of the term football. It merely refers to ball games on foot, not to games neccessarily involving monotonous and repetitive kicking. You are so ignorant. I am sick of the soccer monoculture getting their way in these matters. Soccer is not football in Australian English and this term should be redirected to a disambiguation page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 60.225.217.55 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_60.225.217.55_046b.html" title="Special:Contributions/60.225.217.55">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Personally I support using the term 'football'. This page is not just for an Australian audience. Every other national team page in the world has a title of the form 'XXX national football team' (I should know, I just edited almost all of them). 'Football' is standard Wikipedia terminology for association football. I'd hazard a guess, also, that far fewer people using the <i>global</i> Wikipedia are searching for a 'national' Aussie rules team (!) than those looking for the Socceroos page. -- <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWantok_f5d1.html" title="User:Wantok">Wantok</a> 12:23, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hate to bring this up again as well - but questions need to be answered:
<ul>
<li>The "soccer monoculture" (whatever that means) is not "getting their way". You see how most articles about the round-ball football have the messy "football (soccer)" in their name? That's a compromise.</li>
<li>Articles such as <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_in_Australia_2105.html" title="Football in Australia">Football in Australia</a> ARE disambiguation pages. The article about national team is different, because Australia doesn't have a national Aussie rules team, and the rugby teams are named as such.</li>
<li>There are more english speakers in the world that just residents of countries which have English as a primary language - it is an extremely common second language.</li>
<li>Both the example links JK gave above redirect to the association football national team - so we are in alignment with other countries in that regard.</li>
<li>I'm writing up a proposal for a new naming convention at <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_Football_in_Australia_876c.html" title="User:Chuq/Football in Australia">User:Chuq/Football in Australia</a> if anyone would like to take a look at it. And yes, I am open to discussion from all points of view.</li>

<p>To anyone who doesn't think Aussie rules is called football, look at the name. the "Australian FOOTBALL League". Not the "Australian Australian-Football League", not the "Australian AFL Football League", not the "Australian Aussie Rules Football League". It is referred to as Foootball. If NSW or QLds want to go ahead anf falsely call it "AFL" (the competing body, not the sport), then go ahead. As for being arrogant, NSW and Vic never seemed to have a promblem with calling rugby league or aussie rules football. Then some sporting body who claims to own the sport says they can change the name and the australian dictionary and no else can refer to it as football. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 58.168.213.99 (<a href="../../../5/8/2E/User_talk%7E58.168.213.99.html" title="User talk:58.168.213.99">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.168.213.99_5358.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.168.213.99">contribs</a>) 21:32, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I think we need to clean up the squad list - maybe put it into two columns (or reduce the font and make three columns), and remove the */**/***'s after the names; maybe replace them with some sort of symbol to show if the player is European based or Australian based. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 07:41, 8 October 2006</dd>

<dd>thats exactly why i thought something like this table should be put on the front page.

<dd>I've mucked about with the list above. It still looks a little full - maybe the DOB and caps columns could go? How is the "current" team officially decided - is it anyone who has played a game and not retired? If so the members of the "A-League allstars" Socceroos squad may be on that list for quite a while, despite it being unlikely many of them (except a few - Milligan, North, Dodd etc.) will play for the national team again anytime soon. (Although that would be amusing - Australia could play two friendlies simultaneously - one in Europe with the European squad, and one in Australia with the A-League squad!) -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 01:18, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Users have been adding young players with no caps (or even senior call-ups) to the squad listing eg. a 16 year old GK called Bouzanis. It's highly speculative. Perhaps we need a clear criteria for inclusion? eg. currently active players with at least 1 national cap, and/or no senior cap but active +called up/sat on the bench for a senior game, and/or has played for Australia within the last 12 months?

His position in the game last night was certainly as captain, not as deputy or vice or acting captain, but it in a temporary capacity, and was solely because Viduka was not playing? -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 04:37, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would just call Viduka, Moore &amp; Neill captains all at once.<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENic_Car_Bel_03a6.html" title="User:Nic Car Bel">Nic Car Bel</a> 12:59, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The captaincy isn't settled so it does seem inaccurate to put Neill's name there. Moore and Viduka are the regular choices but Skoko (v Kuwait), and Grella (v Ghana), have also captained recently. Hmmmm&#160;?? 125.63.139.142 23:56, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
This is what I know about the captaincy after the world cup:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Muscat_7538.html" title="Kevin Muscat">Kevin Muscat</a> captained the team v Kuwait on August in a squad of A-League players</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/s/Josip_Skoko_b27c.html" title="Josip Skoko">Josip Skoko</a> captained the team v Kuwait on September in the absence of Neill, Viduka, Moore and even Muscat</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucas_Neill_daf9.html" title="Lucas Neill">Lucas Neill</a> captained the team v Paraguay and Bahrain on October in the absence of Moore and Viduka (it was first announced that Moore would be captain but he was expelled from the team)</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Grella_3019.html" title="Vince Grella">Vince Grella</a> will captain the team v Ghana on November in the absence of Neill, Skoko, Viduka (Moore was in but he was doubtful for the match)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is very complicated situations but I personally like to name Lucas Neill as captain because he captained Socceroos on 2 matches, not Viduka because never been called to the team since World Cup, and not Moore because this time he is on the squad but Grella was chosen over him. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_tamb_21d1.html" title="User:Martin tamb">Martin tamb</a> 00:46, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Moore wasn't picked because, right up until the last minute, he was 50/50 to be fit for the Ghana game. Neill was/is being primed for the captaincy and he's odds on favourite to be our regular one in the future. However, Arnold just said he's going to adopt a rotating captaincy policy, at least until the Asian Cup. <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/arnolds-roll-of-honour/2006/11/14/1163266549488.html" class="external free" title="http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/arnolds-roll-of-honour/2006/11/14/1163266549488.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/arnolds-roll-of-honour/2006/11/14/1163266549488.html</a></p>
<p>Can we put "rotating", perhaps with a short footnote attached that lists the various players when they captain? IMO that would be most accurate right now.</p>
<p>Also, considering Arnold has been given up until the end of the Asian Cup with the NT, I think "caretaker" deserves to be removed. Cheers. 220.101.78.99 00:57, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would personally call Viduka captain, the only reason he was not given captaincy in the post-WC games is because he didn't play. It's likely he will regain captaincy for the Asian Cup. Perhaps Neill and Viduka? <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENic_the_Man_6689.html" title="User:Nic the Man">Nic the Man</a> 05:16, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the text about Blatter's "apologies", since it looks like it was a misquotation.

[...] At no time did the FIFA President make any inappropriate comment whatsoever concerning the Australia vs. Italy match, and he most certainly did not comment negatively about Italy.

<dd>I agree that there is no harm leaving it there, but in the overall context of the article it is pretty irrelevant. That section itself is almost longer than the France 98 qualifying campaign (where Aust became the first team not to lose a match and fail to qualify) and the history intro. If the article was solely about that match, or even Australia's 2006 WC, of course it would be relevant, but when you are looking at the history of Australia's national football team, it pales into insignificance. I don't care if it's in now, but if this article was ever to be a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">FA</a>, it is more than likely that Blatter's comments won't be in it. – <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbinomonkey_5636.html" title="User:Albinomonkey">AlbinoMonkey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/l/b/User_talk%7EAlbinomonkey_dabe.html" title="User talk:Albinomonkey">Talk</a>)</sup> 03:15, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Martin, I think that the quote is irrelevant, and should go away. However, if you really want the reader to judge, you must include <i>both</i> quotes, not only the one Jeff likes. If one day Blatter says the penalty should not have been conceded, and the <i>following</i> day, he says he never talked about penalties, why are you including only the first quote?

<p>I apologize in advance if this is too trivial a matter to consider (which it is), but I have been in search of the truth in this field for a while.</p>
<p>It was widely reported during the World Cup 2006 that the head of the JFA accused Australian NT of playing "dirty". This is nothing but a bad translation, and even then you would need to make some effort to achieve such misinterpretation. The key officials in the JFA do not use such language for a start; this is obvious when you actually know them. This lead many of us to believe that this so-called "misinterpretation" was deliberate. The question is by whom.</p>
<p>There are many of us genuine football fans who looked into this in detail by tracing various media bodies as well as contacting the JFA. Possibly one of the most notable research into this subject was done by the editor, Matsu, of Rising Sun News. At any rate we are none the wiser. The end result is the same - the trail goes cold once you enter the west. It is plausible that a media in the west "planted an interesting story" by doing this. The tragedy is that in some ways this seems to have also resulted in some bad blood between the Australians and the Japanese. It seems there are enough Australian fans who genuinely believe in this story. From Japan point of view this is fabricated and bad taste, especially when a good friendship was desired from Japan end in general terms.</p>
<p>I am not trying to bring focus upon this subject, as far as this Wiki article goes. I have also added what has so far been found about this matter and edited the main article accordingly. However, I am wondering if any of you out there know any truth behind this - especially regarding who started it and to what end. While I do not expect any answers (as it is too trivial and obscured), I felt that it is worth pointing this out, in hope that maybe somewhere under somewhat bizarre set of circumstances someone may find the culprit.Jgrey 03:34, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>My opinion is that these shouldn't be here - they are not members of the national team, and to list them as such is speculation. There is a separate article for the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_under-23_football_team.html" title="Australia national under-23 football team">Australia national under-23 football team</a> (Olyroos) - details about their players can go there. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 03:50, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most if not all of these players are mentioned in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_under-23_football_team.html" title="Australia national under-23 football team">Olyroos</a> squad list. Delete them.

<li>There isn't a separate "reserves" squad as far as I know. Players are just selected as needed (based on availability, location, and importance of match). Harry Kewell and Archie Thompson are both just members of the team, there is no technical difference between the two so far as membership of the national team goes.</li>

<p>I think we should remove the */**/***/**** as well as it is getting too crowded. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 13:27, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
