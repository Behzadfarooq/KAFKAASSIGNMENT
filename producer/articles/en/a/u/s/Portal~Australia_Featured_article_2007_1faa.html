It is international cricket's oldest and most celebrated <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_rivalry.html" title="Sports rivalry">rivalry</a>, dating back to 1882. The series is named after a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satirical</a> <a href="../../../o/b/i/Obituary.html" title="Obituary">obituary</a> published in <i>The Sporting Times</i> in 1882 after the match at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Oval_7c8c.html" title="The Oval">The Oval</a>, in which Australia beat England in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> for the first time.

The English media dubbed the next English tour, to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> (1882-83) as <i>the quest to regain The Ashes</i>.

The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of an item of cricket equipment, possibly a <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bail_%28cricket%29.html" title="Bail (cricket)">bail</a>, ball or stump. The urn is not used as the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trophy.html" title="Trophy">trophy</a> for the Ashes series, and whichever side "holds" the Ashes, the urn normally remains in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_ecb9.html" title="Marylebone Cricket Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> Museum at <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_Cricket_Ground_3c18.html" title="Lord's Cricket Ground">Lord's</a>.
