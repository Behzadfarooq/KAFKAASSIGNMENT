<p>Re: Revision 8: I think you're wrong about the spelling of his name. A google search showed about 400 instances of Boehm-Bawerk but about 1200 Bohm-Bawerk. The actual spelling, I believe is Böhm, thats an 'O' with two little dots over it. Unfortunately Wiki won't let you use special characters in links. I think Boehm is an anglization of the name, trying to get across the proper pronunciation without using special characters.<br />
But a quick check shows that the Mises Institute spells it minus the 'e': |<a href="http://www.mises.org/bawerk.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.mises.org/bawerk.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.mises.org/bawerk.asp</a>] It also appears Mises and Rothbard spelled it without the 'e' too. Is 'oe' and excepted translation of 'ö'? --<a href="../../../m/e/m/User%7EMemoryHole.com_8b22.html" title="User:MemoryHole.com">MemoryHole.com</a> 7 Sep 2001</p>
<p>You are right that Böhm is correct, but unfortunately not possible as a page name. So I applied the normal German substitution used when no umlaut is available (old typewriters/printers) ö -&gt; oe. That is the nearest we can come here. The "correct" anglisation is probably just leaving the diaresis off (Bohm). Actually, it occured to me that we can use ö still in the text. See the change I'll commit next.</p>
<p>Finally, "von Böhm-Bawerk" seems to outmajor my "Böhm von Bawerk" so I'm changing that back. I guess both spellings were interchangable back when, but I'm no historian. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbe_6657.html" title="User:Robbe">Robbe</a> 25 Feb 2002</p>

<p>I found the last item in the "contributions" section to be extremely vague, to the point that it could be misleading or wrong. However, I don't know much about this so I'm not going to change it myself. Here's the quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The economic calculation debate between Austrian and Marxist economists, with the Austrians claiming that Marxism is flawed because prices could not be set to recognise opportunity costs of factors of production, and so socialism could not calculate best uses in the same way capitalism does.</dd>
</dl>
<p>My problem is that it seems to be using <i>socialism</i> as equivalent to <i>centrally planned economy</i> while equating <i>capitalism</i> to <i>free market economy</i>. Most socialists would object to these definitions, arguing that some models of socialism involve market exchanges, while capitalism generally involves extensive state intervention in the economy. So the idea of "central planning" vs. "free market" could be more precise, but it may be better to just describe the relationship between the decision maker and ther person whose interests are supposedly being served (an authority making decisions for others, vs everyone making decisions for themselves). <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRetchless_d1d6.html" title="User:AdamRetchless">AdamRetchless</a> 16:26, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough, but the first sentence specifically identifies <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> economists, and most Austrians feel that this debate is actually between themselves and everyone else (except maybe some members of the Chicago school). Austrians often accuse other economists of wanting to plan the economy, and that other economists (unlike themselves) are self-confident enough to think that they can solve the "calculation" problem more efficiently than the market.</dd>
<dd>This contribution should probably be broadened rather than made narrower. Socialists believe in some central planning role for the state, so do many others, and most of these would fall foul of the "calculation problem" in the Austrian view, wouldn't they?

<p>I think there is some confusion here in terms of Marx's positive analysis of market capiatlism and is nomative espousal of socialism. the sentance in question, in my reading, is in refference to the former</p>

<p>I believe the article should begin with the postive definition (role of the individual, Human action, expanding from there) rather than immediately defining Austrianism in opposition to other schools of thought.</p>
<p>&gt; I have to concur. The introductory paragraph uses too many Austrian-isms and isn't especially coherent to a trained neo-classical let alone a member of the general public. It should be rewritten. I'll fix it when I get time. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_morgawr_52ed.html" title="User:The morgawr">The morgawr</a> 01:17, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The introduction is also misleading. The opening statment, "The Austrian School is a school of economic thought that rejects economists' primary use of methods more common in natural science for the study of human action," is not a distinguishing aspect of the Austrian School. ALL major schools of economic though avoid the methods of natural science. The question is which method do you use. Most neo-classical economists hold to positivism/platonic idealism; most austrians hold to rationalism/Aristotlian realism; but that isn't hard and fast there are Austrians (Hayek) who follow positivism and there are neo-classicals who follow rationalism. The introductory paragraph should focus on distinguishing aspects (The actual way to distinguish the Austrian School is the strict adherence to methodological individualism). I'm working through how to clean the article up and render it much clearer to someone who is trying to learn about the Austrian School as opposed to refresh their memory. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_morgawr_52ed.html" title="User:The morgawr">The morgawr</a> 14:56, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree - this section is poor. For example: "While the praxeological method differs from the current method advocated by the majority of contemporary economists, the Austrian method is essentially identical to the traditional approach to economics used by the British classical economists, the early continental economists, and the Late Scholastics." is a very radical interpretation that should be referenced (to serious philosophers of economics) and then contrasted to alternative views. Most wouldn't consider Adam Smith to be a strict rationalist, and many 19th Century economists were more influenced methodologically by Kant than by Descartes.--<a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENmcmurdo_69fe.html" title="User:Nmcmurdo">Nmcmurdo</a> 00:40, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is said in the article, under the "Analytical Framework" part that</p>
<p>"It is an Austrian assertion that everyone is better off in a mutually voluntary exchange, or they would not have carried it out."</p>
<p>I think that this sentence might be misleading, in the sense that it is not an "Austrian assertion". This idea has been developed earlier by Adam Smith and other Classical Economists.</p>
<p><br />
Indeed, Austrian School inherits and advances the key classical idea of exchange as the subject of economics. Mises wished to popularize the term 'catallactics ==study of exchange' coined by Whately. Like classical economics Austrian economics is a science of exchange. The quoted assertion is definitely Austrian (Check Chapter 4 of Menger's Principles). If the quoted assertion does not sound original, one may be reminded of the fundamental difference between utility-based (subjective) explanation and cost-based (objective) explanation of gains from trade. The Ricardian idea that trade occurs because it gives benefits to everybody in terms of comparative cost is not exactly the same thing as Menger's assertion that trade occurs because all parties to it derive benefits in terms of utility. Adam Smith and other classical economists did not develop the subjectivist interpretation. Nor did they have the more complex idea that the demand for factors is derived from the demand for products, and hence the value of factors (to impute cost) gets its meaning from the prior assignment of value of products based on utility. In short, one can derive cost by imputation of value to factors from utility of products, but not vice-versa. This is one way to read the idea of round-about production.

<p>actually <a href="../../../p/r/a/Praxeology.html" title="Praxeology">praxeology</a> only got attention within the Austian School with the 1940 publication of Nationalökonomie by von Mises.

<p>Austrian economists do not reject observation at all. They reject a description of observations offered without causal explanation. Menger's long battle of methodenstreit is centered on the key idea that a historical narrative without the aid of theoretical explanation does not provide valid knowledge.

<p>Is it proper to use the word make, as in force, in this context? "<i>This means, in the Austrian context, the correct way to prevent imbalances in the economy is to make people want to buy the correct goods, rather than controlling when people buy goods.</i>" Either I've misunderstood or there is a better term.</p>

<p>"As a result Austrians hold that the only valid economic theory is one that is logically derived from basic principles of human action." Actually, this is just one branch of Austrian School economics that holds the a priorism of human action. Not all Austrian School economist hold this view...

<dd>I hope our anonymous commenter will come back some time and amplify on this remark a little bit.</dd>
<dd>I've read quite a bit of Austrian stuff by various authors (Menger, Böhm-Bawerk, Mises, Hayek, Rothbard, Kirzner, Ebeling, Hoppe, Raico, de Soto, Hazlitt ... maybe a few others) and I can't think of one who had a material disagreement with the positions L. von Mises stakes out in "Human Action". So I think it's categorically wrong to pretend that there's a real distinction between "Misesian" and "Austrian" economics. They are, for all intents and purposes, exactly the same thing. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCBryant_f1d6.html" title="User:DavidCBryant">DavidCBryant</a> 23:10, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I just made some stylistic revisions to the "History" section of this article. Most of these just involved proper English idiom, or breaking a horribly run-on sentence into two shorter sentences that convey the same meaning. I also straightened out a few flaws with the references to Karel Engliś an anonymous contributor recently added. Does anyone here have a problem with what I did?</p>
<p>I should also mention that I made one substantive change -- I changed "... without monetary prices or private property, meaningful economic calculation was impossible" to "... without monetary prices and private property, meaningful economic calculation is impossible", which, in my opinion, more accurately reflects the Austrians' view of the matter.</p>
<p>As long as I'm talking about this, I'd like to point out a major flaw in the next section, "Analytical framework". The last paragraph of that section reads as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This focus on opportunity cost alone means that their interpretation of the time value of a good has a strict relationship: since goods will be as restricted by scarcity at a later point in time as they are now, the strict relationship between investment and time must also hold. A factory making goods next year is worth as much less as the goods it is making next year are worth. This means that the business cycle is driven by miscoordination between sectors of the same economy, caused by money not carrying incentive information correct about present choices, rather than within a single economy where money causes people to make bad decisions about how to spend their time. This means, in the Austrian context, the correct way to prevent imbalances in the economy is to make people want to buy the correct goods, rather than controlling when people buy goods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paragraph is not only execrable prose – it is also a gross misrepresentation of the Austrian theory of the business cycle. The Austrians don't propose to "make" anybody buy the correct goods. In Austrian theory, the consumer always makes his own decisions.</p>
<p>Does anybody want to explain this paragraph, and why it's in here, before I rip its guts out? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCBryant_f1d6.html" title="User:DavidCBryant">DavidCBryant</a> 01:14, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The differences between Keynes' theories and Austrian Economics are so profound that one could write whole books about them. Some people have. Here's a quick overview.</dd>
<dd>In the first place, it's not so much that the Austrians are <i>opposed</i> to Keynes' theories; it's just that Austrian theory makes much different predictions than Keynes made. For instance, Austrian theory indicates that the Keynesian medicine of fiscal/monetary "stimulus" will do nothing to alleviate the ups and downs of the business cycle in the long run, but that inflation of the money supply and depreciation of the currency will inevitably result from such policies, eventually.</dd>
<dd>The basic question underlying different approaches to economic theory is "Who decides?" Who decides what is good for you? Who decides how much of each commodity should be produced? Who decides what somebody means when he says "outcome A is better than outcome B"? Ultimately, what is the meaning of the word <i>economics</i>? Is it a branch of the natural sciences that helps man understand the limits of his ability to act within the world? Or is it a form of technology that one class of people (the authorities, or rulers) can use to direct and control the activities of everyone else?</dd>
<dd>Broadly speaking, the Austrians come down on the side of individual liberty. Who decides? You decide. You decide what is best for you, and I decide what is best for me. The economic questions – how much of each commodity is produced, the level of prices, the balance between saving and investment – are all answered by individuals, each acting in his own best interest <i>as he perceives it</i>. So the market price of a particular good or service is determined by individual acts of exchange, which produce an "average" or "prevailing" price over short periods of time. There is no such thing as "economic equilibrium" – there is an "evenly rotating economy", instead, in which people are constantly looking for (ethical, honest) ways to improve their own situations. And so forth.</dd>
<dd>The Keynesian view is markedly different. It proceeds from the assumption that some patterns of economic activity are <i>objectively better</i> than other patterns, and that the high priests of economics understand that objective truth better than you do. In other words, Keynesian thought tends in the direction of central planning, and denigrates the value of individual liberty. Who decides? The authorities decide. They decide how much money to put into circulation, and what quantities of certain commodities should be produced / consumed. They decide what is best for everybody, and then they direct you to do your part. Ultimately, in Keynes' view, there are no individual wants and desires that each person strives to satisfy – there is only the economy, and you are just a disposable cog in the machine.</dd>
<dd>That's an oversimplification. But it's generally correct. And it's all I have time for right now. &#160;;^&gt; <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCBryant_f1d6.html" title="User:DavidCBryant">DavidCBryant</a> 12:15, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We must not think alike. As I explained above, the Austrians reject all the "results" of Keynes' theory, because Keynes' theory is based on premises that are demonstrably false.

<dd>Can you be more specific? I see quite a few flaws in the article ... as I've noted above, I think the major one is in the section entitled "Analytical framework". What in particular do you think needs to be fixed up? Oh -- since you seem to be keen on making a distinction between "theory" and "results", are we both talking about the same book? When I hear "Keynesian" I automatically think of "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money", by John Maynard Keynes (1936). That is in fact the Keynesian Theory you're talking about, right? I know that JMK wrote some other stuff, as well. For instance, he was pretty keen on Communism and the Bolsheviks until he actually visited Russia (<i>ca</i> 1925) – he was seriously disappointed by what he saw, and spoke out against the excesses of Lenin's government when he returned to England. That's one "result" Keynes obtained with which the Austrian economists would all agree. But I suppose you were really referring to his most famous book when you asked about Keynesian Theory in the first place. Or am I mistaken? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCBryant_f1d6.html" title="User:DavidCBryant">DavidCBryant</a> 23:37, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I was referring to "General Theory." My point is, the actual results of Keynesian theory aren't in line with Keynesian theory, and the article doesn't make that distinction.</dd>

I'm going to take his name out of the list altogether, but I figure I ought to drop a message in here first, just in case one of the Defenders of Catholicism is watching this page.</p>
<p>I read Bucketofg's edit note. Unlike him, I'm sure the link was to the right person. I do understand how the theological dispute in which Molina became embroiled can be interpreted as bearing upon the Austrian theory of subjective value. But theology is not a science. Economics is a science.</p>
<p>In my opinion, even calling people like <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Mun_2f33.html" title="Thomas Mun">Thomas Mun</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josiah_Child_43fe.html" title="Josiah Child">Sir Josiah Child</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boisguillebert.html" title="Boisguillebert">Boisguillebert</a> <i>economists</i> is something of a stretch, because the <i>science</i> of economics did not exist before <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quesnay.html" title="Quesnay">Quesnay</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Robert_Jacques_Turgot_f533.html" title="Anne Robert Jacques Turgot">Turgot</a>, and the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physiocrats.html" title="Physiocrats">Physiocrats</a> – maybe it didn't exist until <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Smith_aff1.html" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that it is <i>not</i> NPOV to label Molina an economist, because the science of economics didn't even exist in his time. In fact, since Carl Menger's book came out in 1871, it's probably incorrect to label anyone born before say 1800 an <i>Austrian economist</i>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCBryant_f1d6.html" title="User:DavidCBryant">DavidCBryant</a> 22:59, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Friedman was undoubtedly a monetarist. One of the most interesting things about his monetary views is that he never was able to give a definite answer to the question "how much inflation is enough inflation?" (where inflation is understood in the Austrian sense, as inflation of the money supply). Sometimes it was 6%, or so, and other times it was 3%, or so. (The Austrians generally support a free market in money (gold), with little governmental intervention; fiat currencies are anathema.) Interestingly, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Hayek_7651.html" title="Friedrich Hayek">Hayek</a> and Friedman were friends, and Friedman was one of the original members of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mont_Pelerin_Society_9211.html" title="Mont Pelerin Society">Mont Pelerin Society</a>.

<p>I found this quote under <b>Analytical framework</b>. I have only read Human Action and a couple other books, but I've never seen any recommendations to control what people want to buy (as if that could be done) or to controlling when they buy it. What I have seen is a statement that credit expansion will create the illusion that consumers want to buy more stuff, and will result in malinvestment, but the line above strikes me as nonsense.

<dd>I question the entire paragraph. The assertion that "goods will be as restricted by scarcity at a later point in time as they are now" isn't even true, so far as I can see. New sources of the good may be discovered, new manufacturing processes may be invented, etc. This whole paragraph was probably written by a neo-classicist or a monetarist who really doesn't understand the Austrian theory of the business cycle and the role of knowledge in the economy. I've been meaning to rewrite the whole paragraph for a while, but can't seem to find exactly the right words. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCBryant_f1d6.html" title="User:DavidCBryant">DavidCBryant</a> 23:24, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
