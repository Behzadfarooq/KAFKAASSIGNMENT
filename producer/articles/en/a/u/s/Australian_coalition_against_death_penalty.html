	    <p><b>Australian Coalition Against Death Penalty</b> or <b>ACADP</b> is a registered non-profit human rights organisation with no political or religious affiliation.</p>
<p>Australian Coalition Against Death Penalty (ACADP) is an Australian independent organisation dedicated to total abolition of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> worldwide, and is against the re-introduction of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a> in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in June 2000, the organisation acts in accordance with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights_2e89.html" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> in that ... 'Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.'</p>
<p>ACADP supports the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Commission_on_Human_Rights_f208.html" title="United Nations Commission on Human Rights">United Nations Commission on Human Rights</a> against the incarceration of offenders for purposes of punishment in that ... 'No one shall be subjected to torture, cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment (also known as <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_row_phenomenon.html" title="Death row phenomenon">Death row phenomenon</a>) - that incarceration of dangerous offenders to be subject solely for the purpose of security to others.'</p>
<p>ACADP opposes the use of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> in all cases, under any circumstances - unconditionally. ACADP cites several reasons for this view;</p>
<ul>
<li>because the death penalty is a violation of the most fundamental universal human right - the right to life.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>because the death penalty is a barbaric, brutal, cruel, degrading, inhumane and uncivilised form of punishment - which has no place in a modern-day criminal justice system - such punishment is prohibited under international human rights law.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>because the death penalty is fallible - the possibility of error of judgement can never be excluded - innocent people have been executed in the past.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>because the death penalty is extremely corruptible - some are "chosen" to be executed while others are not.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>because capital punishment actually reduces the value of human life - is overwhelmingly biased against political opponents, foreign nationals, racial and religious minorities, child offenders, the mentally ill, the mentally retarded, the disadvantaged and the poor.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>because the death penalty has a brutalising effect on the community, actually inspiring acts of violence or copycat crimes and thereby diminishing rather than increasing the deterrent effect.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>because the use of the death penalty creates more victims in society - the innocent family members and loved ones of the executed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The organisation is staffed by dedicated human rights activist volunteers, promoting the development of human rights values and campaigning for total abolition of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> worldwide. ACADP aims at educating society of the facts and fallacies associated with the use of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a>.</p>
<p>ACADP advertises and promotes educational information about <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a> around the world. The organisation conducts correspondence with both Australian and international government/political leaders, various international <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a> organisations and the worldwide media. ACADP is involved in research, gathers and divulges information, news and updates concerning the use of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a>, worldwide. ACADP campaigns by various methods for a moratorium on worldwide <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executions.html" title="Executions">executions</a> with a view to total abolition.</p>
<p>ACADP raises awareness by educating the public with a special focus on the youth of society (the next generation of political leaders), on every factual issue surrounding the use of state-sanctioned killing around the world.</p>
<p>In addition, the organisation guards against the re-introduction of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a> in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. Australia's last judicial killing was on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_3.html" title="February 3">February 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. The hanging of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Ryan_4076.html" title="Ronald Ryan">Ronald Ryan</a> at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentridge_Prison_de50.html" title="Pentridge Prison">Pentridge Prison</a> aroused a storm of public anger and protests, which would result in total abolition. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> officially abolished capital punishment nationwide under The Crimes (Death Penalty Abolition) Amendment Act 1985. Under Commonwealth law the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> was abolished in 1973 by Section 4 of The Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973.</p>
<p>Today, a minority of Australian right-wing individuals and religious extremists are calling for the re-introduction of capital punishment. Furthermore, over the last few years Australian politicians' comments and opinions on the death penalty have weakened and altered Australia's principled opposition to the use of capital punishment. Is it only a matter of time before capital punishment is re-introduced in Australia? <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/HRD/2003/6.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/HRD/2003/6.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>The <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> around the world has two faces - one is in the international spotlight and the other is hidden from view. The <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> in the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> is highly publicised. On the other hand, the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> is shrouded in secrecy - <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executions.html" title="Executions">executions</a> are intermittently reported by officials and generally ignored by the world media. In many countries state-sanctioned killings are a closely guarded secret. In some countries, speaking out for <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a> (which includes abolition of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a>) is considered <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminal.html" title="Criminal">criminal</a>. Sadly, no one appeals for clemency for the condemned. The few local <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a> defenders and family members struggling to save the lives of the condemned face harassment, intimidation and death threats.</p>
<p>The public is influenced to trust the criminal justice system - that capital punishment is only used for the 'worst-of-the-worst' offenders. But nothing can be further from the truth - the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> around the world is applied capriciously and at random.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> is a lethal lottery. Politics, corruption, quality of legal counsel, ominous jury members, who you are, your ethnicity, your financial status, the jurisdiction where the crime is committed, and the political climate at the time of the crime/death sentence are more often the determining factors - more than the actual facts of the crime itself.</p>
<p>Countries that carry out judicial/extra-judicial executions do not kill all those sentenced to death. They "select" offenders to kill - known as "legalised selective discrimination".</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> is applied for pre-meditated <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a>. In other retentionist countries the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> is applied for over 100 violent and non-violent crimes. Crimes punishable by death include <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adultery.html" title="Adultery">adultery</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html" title="Apostasy">apostasy</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blasphemy.html" title="Blasphemy">blasphemy</a>, drug-trafficking (soft or hard drugs), <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorcery.html" title="Sorcery">sorcery</a>, zina <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina_%28sex%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina_%28sex%29" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (sexual intercourse between partners not married to each other), individuals converting/preaching <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> or <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, corruption on <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>, conspiring against the government, stealing petrol, tax evasion, and plotting to overthrow the Islamic regime.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/x/e/Executions.html" title="Executions">Executions</a> in some countries remain a sordid public spectacle. The condemned are ritually humiliated by being paraded in public and insulted before being executed by <a href="../../../b/e/h/Beheading.html" title="Beheading">beheading</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanging.html" title="Hanging">hanging</a>, shot by <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firing_squad.html" title="Firing squad">firing squad</a>, strangled (hanged by crane), <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoning.html" title="Stoning">stoning</a> and even tortured to death. <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> reports that tens of thousands have died hideously, customarily executed in public stadiums or street corners to the sound of public cheers. The <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_Committee_1335.html" title="Human Rights Committee">Human Rights Committee</a> established under the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights_0230.html" title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, has stated that public executions are, 'incompatible with human dignity' which have a de-humanising effect on society.</p>
<p>In 2004, <a href="../../../a/t/e/Atefeh_Rajabi_3443.html" title="Atefeh Rajabi">Atefeh Rajabi</a>, a 16-year-old Iranian girl, was hanged by crane in Northern Iran after being sentenced to death for allegedly having committed an "act incompatible with chastity" (also known as pre-marital sex). Her much older male co-defendent was sentenced to 40 lashes, then released.<a href="http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=8000" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=8000" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>There are deep concerns at the continued imposition of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporal_punishment.html" title="Corporal punishment">corporal punishment</a> such as human limb-amputation or decapitation (a form of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torture</a>) and floggings. Other punishments include cutting off the right hand at the wrist for stealing and 40-80 lashes for drinking <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a> or having pre-marital <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a>. Some condemned offenders are flogged in public prior to being executed. <a href="http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5038" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5038" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">Capital punishment</a> can never be justified because it is pernicious to society through its example of barbarity towards humanity. Although this brutal act removes dangerous offenders from society permanently and protects citizens, life imprisonment achieves the same objective. Furthermore, <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a> is an ineffective deterrent and it does not provide for clemency and rehabilitation of offenders.</p>
<p>In our work for total abolition of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> around the world, ACADP does not condone the alleged crimes of convicted offenders. ACADP has the deepest sympathy for victims of crimes and their families, as it does for the family members and loved ones of condemned prisoners.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> today, there is still some doubt concerning the guilt of the last man hanged, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Ryan_4076.html" title="Ronald Ryan">Ronald Ryan</a>. In the case of Ryan v. Attorney General for Victoria, 1967, Ryan was convicted of the murder of prison warder George Hodson, while escaping from <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentridge_Prison_de50.html" title="Pentridge Prison">Pentridge Prison</a>. There were some ambiguities that surrounded the shooting. Hodson was a tall man and within a few metres of Ryan, a shorter man, when Hodson was shot. The downward path of the bullet suggested that Hodson was shot from a height or at a distance. All fourteen witnesses testified hearing only one shot, and prison warder Robert Paterson, admitted having fired a shot in the direction of Ryan and Hodson. This evidence brings into serious question whether Ryan had been the one who fired the fatal shot beyond reasonable doubt. Despite inconsistencies in evidence at the trial, the jury convicted Ryan of murder. Ryan was sentenced to death and hanged one year later. <a href="http://www.vicbar.com.au/webdata/VicBarNewsFiles/122%20Correspondance.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vicbar.com.au/webdata/VicBarNewsFiles/122%20Correspondance.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>On 1 March 2004, Dr Philip Opas, QC (Ronald Ryan's defence attorney) said to ACADP, ... "I want to put the record straight. I want the truth told about Ronald Ryan - that an innocent man went to the gallows. I want the truth to be made available to everyone, for anyone young and old, who may want to do research into Ryan's case or research on the issue of capital punishment. I will go to my grave firmly of the opinion that Ronald Ryan did not commit murder. I refuse to believe that at any time he told anyone that he did."</p>
<p>There is no way of knowing how many people have been executed in the past who may have been innocent or wrongly convicted. The courts and defence attorneys go on to other cases. Governments do not generally entertain claims of innocence after the defendant is dead. The State cannot pardon a corpse. It is too late to reverse the decision or compensate the offender for a miscarriage of justice after the death sentence has been carried out. In addition, the right to compensation for each family member of a wrongly executed person would total in the millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The following Australians were convicted of murder, and later found to have been innocent/wrongly convicted. If capital punishment had been a sentencing option, they could have been executed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Frederick McDermott</i> was convicted of murder in 1947. He served seven years in prison before a Royal Commission established his innocence. He was released from prison and granted a pardon for wrongful conviction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Edward Charles Splatt</i> was convicted of murder in 1978. He served six years before a Royal Commission established his innocence. He was released from prison and granted a pardon for wrongful conviction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Paul Alister, Timothy Anderson</i> and <i>Ross Dunn</i> were convicted of conspiracy to murder in 1979. They served seven years in prison before a Judicial Inquiry established their innocence. They were released from prison and granted pardons for wrongful conviction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Douglas Harry Rendall</i> was convicted of murder in 1980. He served nine years in prison before a Judicial Inquiry established he was innocent. He was released from prison and granted a pardon for wrongful conviction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Alice Lindy Chamberlain</i> was convicted of murder in 1982. She served four years in prison before a Royal Commission established she was innocent. She was released from prison, granted a pardon and compensated for wrongful conviction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Barry Mannix</i> was arrested for the murder of his father in 1983. He alleged the police had fabricated a confession to the murder. Later, three males were arrested and convicted of the crime. Mannix was released from prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Kelvin Condren</i> was convicted of murder in 1984. He served six years in prison before the High Court of Australia and Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal cast serious doubts on his alleged confession and conviction. Condren was released from prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Roger Graham Bawden</i> confessed to a murder in 1990, which he had committed seventeen years earlier. Another man, Johann Ernst Siegfried Pohl, had been convicted of the murder in 1973. Pohl had served ten years in prison. A Judicial Inquiry established Pohl was innocent. Pohl was released from prison and granted a pardon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who argue for the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> on the grounds that at least the killer is removed permanently from society must also keep in mind that there is always the possibility, however remote, that an innocent person may be executed.</p>
<p>Since 1973, more than 123 prisoners on death row in the USA have been released from prison after evidence emerged of their innocence/wrongful conviction. Many had spent more than a decade on death row and some had come within hours of being executed. <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=412&amp;scid=6" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=412&amp;scid=6" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<p><i>FOR:</i> --- The death penalty deters crime.</p>
<p><i>AGAINST:</i> --- Scientific studies have consistently failed to find convincing evidence that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than other punishments. Most murders are unplanned, spur-of-the-moment passion crimes. People who commit these murders are not thinking about the death penalty. Murderers seldom plan their crimes; the small number who do, believe they will avoid detection and therefore are not deterred by the thought of the death penalty. Mentally unbalanced people and those driven by political or religious fantasies are not deterred by the death penalty. With the exception of professional hit-men very few people are in a rational frame of mind when they comit murder. The most recent survey of research findings on the relation between the death penalty and homicide rates, conducted for the United Nations in 1988 and updated in 2002, concluded, " ... it is not prudent to accept the hypothesis that capital punishment deters murder to a marginally greater extent than does the threat and application of the supposedly lesser punishment of life imprisonment." <i>(Reference: Roger Hood, The Death Penalty: A World-wide Perspective, Oxford, Clarendon Press, third edition, 2002, p. 230)</i></p>
<p><i>FOR:</i> --- If you take the life of another you should lose your life. You lose the right to your life. The State should take your life in return - an eye-for-an-eye (also known as <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge.html" title="Revenge">Revenge</a>).</p>
<p><i>AGAINST:</i> --- This argument has been used to support the use of capital punishment without regard to the calculus or the true meaning. Governments would have to execute millions of killers - in time - to kill every killer that meets that "eye-for-an-eye" imperative. Without discrimination, Governments should also kill the killers, that kill the killers. What we would see is a bloodbath of human slaughter on the face of this planet. But Governments do discriminate when it suits them - you see, Governments do not kill all killers, they "select" the killers they want to kill. It is called "selective eligiblity" for state-sanctioned killing.</p>
<p><i>FOR:</i> --- Countries that use capital punishment have lower crime rates.</p>
<p><i>AGAINST:</i> --- Countries that execute their criminals are mostly repressive nations, which either limit or do not release accurate information on the true crime rates, death row numbers, or execution statistics. This gives the public the false assertion that the use of capital punishment is a deterrent to crime. In most retentionist countries, various crimes are committed with total impunity (eg. <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honour_Killings_037a.html" title="Honour Killings">Honour Killings</a>). The victims of crime/human rights abuses are systematically denied justice by the authorities - repeated and deliberate failure to bring offenders to justice. Also, crime rates and statistics from male-dominated oppressive regimes are unreliable, because victims of crime do not report certain crimes (eg. <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a>), or the authorities alter/ignore the actual crime. According to latest reports by Amnesty International, retentionist countries continue to have some of the highest crime rates per head of population in comparison to abolitionist countries. The USA is the only western nation that still practises the death penalty, yet continues to have a crime rate eight times higher per head of population by comparison to other western nations that abolished the death penalty decades ago.</p>
<p><i>FOR:</i> --- Keeping criminals in prison is wasting taxpayers money. Executing criminals saves taxpayers money.</p>
<p><i>AGAINST:</i> --- There is a mountain of evidence that just one capital case, after all appeals have been exhausted, ends up costing taxpayers much more money than life in prison without parole. Capital punishment is very expensive. <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/abolish/cost.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amnestyusa.org/abolish/cost.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> In all democratic nations, every human being is considered innocent of an alleged crime until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a court of law. For this reason, certain safeguards must be used for capital cases. These safeguards make capital trials more extensive, therefore they would last longer. The greatest cost of capital cases would incur prior to, and during the trial, not in post-conviction and appeals proceedings. The costs incurred for capital trials runs into the millions of dollars. In view of the 'life-and-death issue' at stake, Governments have an obligation to guarantee those prosecuted for capital cases receive the very best defence that taxpayers money can buy - a top-notch team of the best-of-the-best lawyers, with wide latitude in hiring top-notch best-of-the-best experts and consultants. After a person has been sentenced to death, various avenues for numerous appeals are available to the condemned, making the process to execution more lengthy, thereby much more expensive. The process could be streamlined of course, but at a very different cost - increasing the possibility of convicting and executing an innocent/wrongly convicted person. All these costs place a huge financial burden on the already over-stretched legal justice system. Unfortunately, politicians and the media keep this fact a closely guarded secret. Hence, the high cost of state-sanctioned killing is not reported. Those who passed Mathematics know the costly fact, but they do not want the public to know the truth - you see, it might change your mind on capital punishment.</p>
<p><i>FOR:</i> --- The appeals process of death penalty cases should be shortened or eliminated to save taxpayers money.</p>
<p><i>AGAINST:</i> --- And if history is any guide, innocent/wrongly convicted people would be executed along the way, as some have been in the past. The appeals process eliminates errors within the criminal justice system, but what is one or two mistakes when death penalty supporters talk about the expeditious eradication of criminals? Even if all appeals proceedings were abolished the capital system would still be more expensive than a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=6&amp;did=109" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=6&amp;did=109" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p><i>FOR:</i> --- Lethal injection is not cruel - it is like putting your dog to sleep, which makes it way too humane.</p>
<p><i>AGAINST:</i> --- State-sanctioned killing never seems to satisfy supporters of the death penalty - they also want the offender tortured. Fact is, there is no humane method for exterminating a human life. Many incidents of botched lethal injections have been reported. <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=8&amp;did=478" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=8&amp;did=478" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> Whatever method is used to achieve a state-sanctioned killing, it is brutal as it is cruel as it is inhuman. It is degrading to society because it further brutalises that society.</p>
<p><i>FOR:</i> --- If killers are not executed, there is a possibility they will escape from prison to kill again. Capital punishment ensures that the offender will never escape to re-offend.</p>
<p><i>AGAINST:</i> --- This is the ultimate of excuses for the death penalty. Isn't the government supposed to provide the best of safe-guards/security to guarantee the public that prisons are escape-proof? Must we start killing prisoners because governments are failing their responsibility to adequately protect society from dangerous offenders? To suggest we kill offenders on the "slight chance" that they may escape from prison is immoral as it is outrageous. Prison authorities/officials are supposed to ensure, absolutely, that correctional facilities are secure and escape-proof.</p>
<p><i>FOR:</i> --- For better or worse, the execution of a criminal absolutely guarantees that they will not commit a crime again.</p>
<p><i>AGAINST:</i> --- Of course! ... and a life sentence without parole approaches the same promise without the need for a Government to spend millions of extra dollars just to perform a "revenge" act on the offender. To execute criminals on the hypothesis that they "might" kill again is preposterous. It is like saying, don't drive your car ever again in the slight chance you "might" cause a fatality.</p>
<p><i>FOR:</i> --- The death penalty brings "closure" for the victims family.</p>
<p><i>AGAINST:</i> --- As if another killing closes doors! Supporters of the death penalty often say that state-sanctioned killing bring closure to the victims family. But how can two wrongs make a right? How can one killing then justify another? That is not true justice - it is quite simply an act of pure "revenge". Tragically, the loss of a loved one is permanent. Their sorrow and the pain will always be with them. Killing the offender does nothing to relieve their pain. What it does accomplish is grief to the innocent family members and loved ones of the executed - it creates yet another set of victims in society. Many family members of victims of crime say they can hardly wait to gain "closure" by the execution of the offender. But what the public never hears is any of these same people say years later, that they found this "promising closure". Supporters of the death penalty argue that a death sentence will bring the victims family with some sort of relief - focusing on anger, hatred and rage, rather than focusing on healing. Waiting, wishing, and seeing the offender executed by the State is not going to help the healing process. This only leads victims families to more despair over their loss.</p>
<p><i>FOR:</i> --- Many opponents of the death penalty have never been the victim of a violent act, or know of someone who has been killed by another person.</p>
<p><i>AGAINST:</i> --- There are many victims of crime and their families that seek true justice and not purely revenge via the death penalty. It is abhorrent to suggest that only the victims of crime or the families of victims of crime have the "exclusive right of say" in this matter, and that the rest of us are not qualified to render an opinion on the argument that we can neither claim a homicide in the family, nor appreciate horrific tragedies endured by others. When the State kills, it kills in all our names. When the State kills, it is everyone's business.</p>
<p><i>FOR:</i> --- Opponents of the death penalty should allow buildings of extra prisons to house all criminals next to their houses.</p>
<p><i>AGAINST:</i> --- There's no need. There are correct zoning laws for commercial, industrial and residential buildings. Besides, there is always land space to build new prisons, which creates employment. But that sould not be necessary if the majority of offenders who are in prisons for non-violent crimes (eg. petty offenders, drug addicts, the mentally ill and the mentally retarded) be given alternative punishment rather than locking them up in already overcrowded prisons. There are many alternatives to imprisonment for the majority of non-violent offenders, such as providing medical, psychological and rehabilitation treatment in secure state-funded facilities.</p>
<p><i>FOR:</i> --- Criminals should not be allowed to breathe - they waste free oxygen. They should be exterminated.</p>
<p><i>AGAINST:</i> --- Undiluted hatred! Yes, the death penalty really is a "legalised <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_crime.html" title="Hate crime">Hate crime</a>". It is homicidal <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retribution.html" title="Retribution">retribution</a> - homicidal <a href="../../../v/e/n/Vengeance.html" title="Vengeance">vengeance</a>, which breeds and feeds more hatred and more violence in society.</p>
<p>A civilised society should never tolerate such hatred for certain human beings that we lower ourselves to such an inhuman act. A civilised society simply cannot accept the proposition that a government, any government, has the "right" to take a human life in a well-organised pre-meditated cold-blooded ritual, and call ourselves civilised. State-sancitoned killing is the most pre-meditated of all murders.</p>
<p>Most morally decent people are cynical about politicians who, at times, will support capital punishment to their advantage. Most civilised politicians think capital punishment is ethically and morally abhorrent, and not useful at all in fighting crime. But these same politicians do not dare speak out against governments that use the death penalty, for fear of being labeled any number of awful or racist names. Sadly, every politician around the world knows the safest course for their political career is to keep silent ... silent about the tens of thousands of people that are put to death by Governments each year, worldwide.</p>
<p>Killing human beings as a deterrent to crime is not a measure of ethical and moral decency. Those who argue this point never seem to acknowledge the deterrent quality or punitive power of life sentences without parole. There is nothing positive or uplifting about state-sanctioned killing. It brutalises and degrades society. Furthermore, the use of capital punishment around the world has been proven to have no deterrent effect on crime.</p>
<p>We are human - not animals - we cannot pretend to be humane - yet, at the same time act out like animals.</p>
