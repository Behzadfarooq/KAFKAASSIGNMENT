<p>England batted first on what was described as a "beautiful wicket", but Fry was out in the third over, caught behind by the wicketkeeper standing back, and captain <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_MacLaren_af0b.html" title="Archie MacLaren">Archie MacLaren</a> was then run out for nine after a "misunderstanding". After 50 minutes at the crease, Ranjitsinhji, who was described as "upset" by getting the blame for MacLaren's run out, was bowled by second-change bowler <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warwick_Armstrong_5688.html" title="Warwick Armstrong">Warwick Armstrong</a> for 13, and England were 35 for three. Jackson then batted until lunch with Tyldesley, and had made 53 when he inside edged Ernie Jones shortly afterwards.

Tyldesley went on to make a "turning point" partnership with Hirst for 94 in 80 minutes, while Jessop was caught at deep cover having made six and played "very wild cricket". Tyldesley was last out on the day, having made 138, an innings described as "truly magnificent" despite the chances, including "masterly defence" and well timed cuts.</p>
<p>Lockwood and Rhodes added 55 before stumps on the first day, and when play resumed at three o'clock on the second day after rain had fallen during the night, they added a further 25 before MacLaren declared. What followed was described by Wisden as "one of the chief sensations of [the 1902 season]". It took 90 minutes to bowl out Australia for 36, with Trumper making half of the total, and though the light was bad the wicket was not "so difficult as to excuse such an ignominous breakdown". The Yorkshire bowlers Rhodes and Hirst bowled 22 of the 23 overs, in a manner described by the Wisden Almanack as "wonderful". Rhodes got seven wickets for 17, his first five-wicket-haul in Test cricket, and up until 2004 joint cheapest seven-for in Test history.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup> Hirst was helped by Braund to get one of his wickets, as the Somerset allrounder pulled off "a dazzling catch" to dismiss <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clem_Hill_f82c.html" title="Clem Hill">Clem Hill</a>.

<p>However, more rain followed. Twelve hours of unbroken rain during Friday night left the wicket unplayable, and though the afternoon was fine no play was possible until quarter past five.

England went in with the same eleven that had played in Birmingham, with <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Taylor_%28cricketer%29_e719.html" title="Tom Taylor (cricketer)">Tom Taylor</a> as twelfth man.</p>
<p>England lost two wickets in the first four overs, without any batsman having added to the total; rain then kept interrupting the partnership between Jackson and MacLaren, but the two added 102, giving a few chances that were not taken by Australian fieldsmen. The match was abandoned at quarter past eleven on the third morning, with the ground almost under water.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

He added a further five to that on the second day, bowling unchanged throughout the England XI's innings, and the eighth-wicket partnership between Jessop and Vivian Crawford was worth almost two-thirds of England XI's total. Trumble eventually had both men caught, and Gregory made 71 as the Australians set a target of 200, while the hosts <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Thompson_%28cricketer%29_c54b.html" title="George Thompson (cricketer)">George Thompson</a> took eight for 88 in the second innings.

<p>This was to be the only Test match played at <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bramall_Lane_69d0.html" title="Bramall Lane">Bramall Lane</a> in <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield.html" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, which became England's seventh Test ground. From Australia's squad for the second Test, one change was made, as a recovered Trumble replaced Ernie Jones in the eleven. Jack Saunders retained his place, having not featured in the first match. England made several changes; <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Abel_9f94.html" title="Bobby Abel">Bobby Abel</a> was originally selected to replace Fry in the top order, but Ranjitsinhji was ruled out due to a strained leg and Fry took his place back. <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schofield_Haigh_d0e1.html" title="Schofield Haigh">Schofield Haigh</a> had also been added to the twelve originally, but both he and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Lockwood_4b09.html" title="Bill Lockwood">Bill Lockwood</a> were left out in favour of <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Barnes_402f.html" title="Sydney Barnes">Sydney Barnes</a>, a last-minute replacement. <i>Wisden</i> claimed that "there [could] be no question that a grave mistake was committed in not playing Lockwood."</p>
<p>The English <i>Wisden</i> account acknowledged that Australia "played the finer all-round cricket" and "fully deserved their victory", but still claimed that "all the luck of the game went their way" as they won by 143 runs. The first lucky streak was to win the toss and bat; Braund opened the bowling with Hirst, and had Trumper out bowled for one early on. Barnes took the next four wickets, all caught, including Darling for a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_duck.html" title="Golden duck">golden duck</a>, before Noble and Hopkins added 54 for the sixth wicket, the largest partnership thus far in the game. Noble was out caught off Rhodes, and Barnes removed Hopkins and Kelly, but Armstrong and Trumble put on 57 for the ninth wicket and Australia totalled 194.</p>
<p>Again according to the Wisden account, England had "much of the best of the match" when MacLaren and Abel had taken the score to 60 for nought. But Noble bowled both, and as the light faded Noble and Saunders struck three more times before England successfully appealed against bad light a quarter before the scheduled close. By then England had lost three wickets for a single run, to close on 102 for five with Lilley and Braund set to resume.</p>
<p>Rain then fell overnight and the start of the second day's play was delayed, after which England lost their last five wickets for 43 runs, with Jessop the only England batsman to make it into double figures. Then, Trumper entered, to play what Wisden described as his most "marvellous" innings of the summer. In 50 minutes, he scored 62, the first half-century in the match, "doing whatsoever he liked with the English bowling", before he was caught behind off Jackson's bowling. Barnes had Darling caught with no further score added, but then Hill and Gregory got together. Hill then became the first and only man to score a Test century at Bramall Lane, leaving with the total on 225 after "a great innings", and though it was "not entirely free from fault" with a couple of dropped catches, it took a "wonderful catch" by MacLaren off Jackson to dismiss him.</p>
<p>Hopkins and Armstrong added 52 for the seventh wicket, taking the lead past 300, before Rhodes took the final four wickets in 19 balls. England now needed 339 to win the game, which would be a new Test record, the previous one of 315 being set by Australia in January. They sent Jessop out to open the innings, and he made an unbeaten 53 overnight, as England closed on 73 for one. However, on the third morning they lost three wickets in the first half hour, and despite MacLaren's "great effort" of 63, including an hour-long stand with Jackson, it was Noble (six for 52) and Trumble (four for 49) who came out on top. On Saturday morning, after coming on for Saunders, he took five for 22 in twelve overs, though the pitch "show[ed] unmistakable signs of wear". Noble ended with eleven for 103, his second and last ten-wicket-haul in Test match cricket.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p>Australia secured the series with one match to play, though only with a three-run margin, as England, who required 32 to win with seven wickets in hand, fell to Trumble and Saunders' bowling. A. A. Thomson claimed that this match, along with the fifth Test of this series, was "the most dramatic in Test history" when he wrote in 1967, excepting the <a href="../../../t/i/e/Tied_Test_f08a.html" title="Tied Test">Tied Test</a> in 1960–61.<sup id="_ref-Thomson_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Thomson" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="../../../n/e/v/Neville_Cardus_8595.html" title="Neville Cardus">Neville Cardus</a>, who later wrote an article on the game he had watched as a 13-year-old, said: "The match at the end seemed to get right out of the control of the men that were making it; it seemed to take on a being of its own, a volition of its own, and the mightiest cricketers in the land looked as though they were in the grip of a power of which they could feel the presence but whose ends they could not understand."<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Australia, who went in unchanged from the Third Test, won the toss and batted first against an England side where <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lionel_Palairet_5d1f.html" title="Lionel Palairet">Lionel Palairet</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranjitsinhji.html" title="Ranjitsinhji">Ranjitsinhji</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lockwood_7e93.html" title="William Lockwood">William Lockwood</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Tate_1429.html" title="Fred Tate">Fred Tate</a> had replaced Fry, Hirst, Jessop and Barnes. The Sussex bowler Tate was given his Test debut, but it was to be his only one; nevertheless, the match is known as <i>Tate's match</i>.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[37]</a></sup> He dropped a crucial catch, and was last man out when England heeded only four more runs to win. In the 1903 Wisden, it is claimed that leaving out Hirst for Tate was a "blunder", though the decision was inspired by a rain-affected wicket. Likewise, not selecting Jessop was called "a mistake".</p>
<p>According to Barker and Rosenwater<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[38]</a></sup> England did well to get so close to winning as they did, Australia gaining a large advantage from batting first. The ground was very wet when play began, and the pitch was initially slow and easy. Furthermore, the bowlers' run-ups were so slippery that Lockwood was unable to bowl for over an hour.</p>
<p>According to Wisden 1903, "the ball did nothing on the soft turf", but the England bowlers pitched it too short, allowing Trumper and Duff to add 135 in the first 80 minutes before Duff was caught at the wicket by third-change bowler Lockwood, who had been introduced with the score on 129. Australia were 173 for one at lunch, with Trumper having achieved the rare feat of reaching his hundred before lunch, before Rhodes struck three times to remove Trumper, Noble and Gregory, all caught with ten further runs added since lunch. Trumper's 104 was described as "one without mistake of any kind." Another <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partnership_%28cricket%29.html" title="Partnership (cricket)">stand</a> developed, however, between Darling and Hill; Darling hit two sixes on his way to 51 before he was caught by England captain MacLaren, and the two added 73 for the fifth wicket, a partnership described as <i>invaluable</i> by Wisden.</p>
<p>The wicket had dried out since lunch, and Saunders and Trumble took five wickets for 44, with only Tyldesley passing 20 for England on the first day. They closed on 70 for five, but the following day was "England's day". First, Jackson and Braund added 115 to the overnight score, a stand broken just before lunch when Braund was bowled by Noble, steering a ball outside off onto the stumps. Jackson then kept the scoring rate going, making 128, the highest score of the game, and England's total increased by 77 before he was finally out, 24 of them contributed by the lower-order batsmen, who were out to Noble and Trumble. England thus trailed by 37 on first innings, having been given some runs when Gregory missed "the simplest of chances" at cover point, but Australia were undone by Lockwood's bowling. He took the new ball, removed Trumper, Hill and Duff, and Australia were ten for three. Six more runs were added before Darling hit a catch to square leg, where Palairet would normally have fielded. But MacLaren had sent Tate, normally a close-in fielder, to that position.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[39]</a></sup> Tate dropped the catch, and Darling went on to make 37, the highest score of the innings, and share a stand of 48 with Gregory before Tate broke the stand, having Gregory lbw. Wisden speculated it was likely that the Australians would have been all out for 50–60 if the catch had been held. Despite Lockwood's five-wicket-haul, and match figures of eleven for 76, Australia lasted into the third morning, making 86, and setting a target of 124.</p>
<p>Rain had fallen for considerable time overnight, making the pitch difficult, though MacLaren and Palairet cut 36 off the target before lunch was taken. Palairet was then bowled by Saunders, and Tyldesley and MacLaren followed, the latter caught far out in the field by Duff for 35. Australia's Saunders then dropped Abel before rain stopped play again. After the break, England's batsmen were instructed to hit out. Abel added 20 with Ranjitsinhji, who looked uncertain against Trumble and was eventually given lbw, and Trumble and Saunders kept at the English batsmen. Abel was bowled trying to drive, Jackson caught at mid off, Braund stumped, and Lockwood bowled, England now requiring 11 to win with two wickets in hand. Rhodes came in and struck a boundary, and Lilley hit two scoring shots to take the tally to 116, before Hill took a brilliant running catch in the deep to dismiss Lilley when the ball had seemed sure to go for four.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Then rain struck once more, and the players left the field for 45 minutes. When they returned, seven runs were required, and the debutant Tate came to the crease to face Saunders. He edged down the leg side for four with the first ball, before the next two were no-scoring shots. The fourth ball of the over, a quicker one which kept low, struck the stumps, leaving Tate bowled and Australia winners by three runs.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>The inclusion of Tate in the England side appears to have been a result of friction between MacLaren and the selectors (and in particular their Chairman, <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Hawke_46de.html" title="Lord Hawke">Lord Hawke</a>) that had developed during the course of the series. According to Fry, the selectors included Tate in the twelve (he was a late addition to the eleven originally selected) because they thought that MacLaren could not possibly pick him and would therefore have to play their preferred eleven. However MacLaren was supposedly annoyed that Haigh was not included, and therefore on the morning of the match chose Tate for the final eleven in preference to Hirst. However Tate had been having a great season, eventually finishing second in the first-class wicket tallies behind Rhodes,<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[42]</a></sup> and an argument could be made for his inclusion.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
