<p>The <b>Australian Rail Tram &amp; Bus Industry Union</b> (RTBU), formerly known as the <b>Public Transport Union</b> or PTU, was formed on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, through the amalgamation of the <i>Australian Railways Union</i>, the <i>Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen</i>, the <i>Australian Tramway &amp; Motor Omnibus Employees' Association</i> and the <i>National Union of Rail Workers' of Australia</i>. This amalgamation effectively created one transport industry union for the first time in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>.

<p>The union became the <i>Australian Tramway and Motor Omnibus Employees’ Association</i> [AT&amp;MOEA] in 1934. When this union was deregistered in 1950 over the one man tram dispute in Melbourne, its members created, within the same year, a new union of the same name.</p>

<p>In Victoria, railway labourers formed the <i>Mutual Services Association</i> [MSA] in 1884 and looked to incorporate the various trades and crafts within the industry in a single powerful railway union, but remained largely unsuccessful in this attempt. The MSA retained a high rate of membership throughout the 1890s, and in 1900 changed its name to the <i>Amalgamated Society of Railway Employees</i> [ASRE]. In 1911 the ASRE and cognate organisations voted overwhelmingly to form a united <i>Victorian Railways Union</i>which, in 1921 became the Victorian Branch of the <i>Australian Railways Union</i> [ARU].</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>, seven years after the official opening of Victoria's first railway, the <i>Locomotive Engine Drivers' Association</i> was formed in an attempt to maintain some standards of employment for these skilled workers. Comprising roughly twenty members, the Association grew to include firemen in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>, prompting a change of name to the <i>Locomotive Engine Drivers &amp; Firemens' Association</i>. In October <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a> representatives of the Railway Locomotive Enginemen's Associations of New South Wales, South Australia Queensland and Victoria met in Melbourne and voted in favour of forming the <i>Federated Railway Locomotive Enginemens' Association of Australia</i>.</p>
<p>The Federated Railway Locomotive Enginemens' Association of Australia met yearly at Conference, but did not set up a Federal Division until 1920. In that year a decision of the High Court made it possible for unions covering employees in state instrumentalities to have access to the Federal Arbitration Court. In February 1921, the newly named <i>Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen</i> [AFULE] was the first such union to gain federal registration with the Court.</p>
<p>In 1922-1923, following Federal registration, successful steps were taken for the AFULE to gain coverage of Locomotive Enginemen working for Commonwealth railways, and the Union became truly Australia wide.</p>
<p>In 1924, the AFULE decided to file a separate log of claims on each of the state employers, but the decision of the Australian Railways Union to try to establish one federal award for all railwaymen precipitated the Locomotive Enginemen into a similar case before the Federal Arbitration Court. The AFULE presented a mass of detailed evidence resulting by April 1925 in its first Federal Award binding on State instrumentalities and bringing its four Union Divisions into line industrially.</p>
<p>By 1926 the union changed its name to the <i>Australian Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers</i>, only to change it back to the <i>Australian Federated Union of Enginemen</i> in 1927. After 1970, membership swelled as a result of the inclusion of members from the deregistered Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen, Commonwealth Division.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.afule.org.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.afule.org.au/" rel="nofollow">Queensland division</a> of AFULE voted to not affiliate to the RTBU and still operates as a separate union, registered in the Queensland industrial relations system only.</p>

<p>The <i>National Union of Railwaymen of Australia</i> was first registered under the Commonwealth's industrial relations legislation in March <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>. However, it was to last only until July 1933 before it was deregistered. Many members of this original union were eventually covered by a second union of the same name, which registered in 1938. The Union continued under this name until 1982 when it changed to the <i>National Union of Rail Workers of Australia</i>.</p>
