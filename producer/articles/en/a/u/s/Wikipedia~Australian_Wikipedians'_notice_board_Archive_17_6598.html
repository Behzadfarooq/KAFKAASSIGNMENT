<dd>It's not about being better. It's a matter of courtesy: if you move an article linked to by hundreds of other articles, it's polite to do at least some of the hard work of updating links yourself. As for the new title, I quite like it. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 23:31, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>mmmh. I don't see that such action is impolite. And I have to say I find it a little impolite to demand such stuff. I often move pages to bring consistency to WP. I fix double redirects and often look for templates that can be adjusted. You know what makes me additional kind of feel impolite treated in this case? The linking was not coherent before. Some of you now demand something that did not exist. Anyway thanks for saying that you like the naming. And special thanks to User:E Pluribus Anthony who just came around to say "thank you for the move" and not demanding additional work. We are all working together - so it doesn't matter who does what. In this case it might have even faster if not I would search for the templates but someone more involved with AU would have done it. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 05:20, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think anyone has been impolite towards you nor has anyone demanded anything of you. What was suggested, however, is that with prior discussion things such as links and categories could have been amended correspondingly and expeditiously. It's a long-standing editing practice to correct links when one <a href="../../../m/o/v/Wikipedia%7EMoving_a_page_d401.html" title="Wikipedia:Moving a page">moves</a> a page, but not strictly required - so long as redirects are point appropriately, then everything should be fine.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 07:44, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>quote <i>you may ask the movee, to fix all the pages that now need to be changed to avoid redirects</i> ... fix ALL, while there was no state of non-redirects before. I find this quite demanding and you blow the same horn with "it is long-standing editing practice". What logic is this? It has been long standing practice to read encyclopedias on paper. Maybe you stick to this and turn of your computer? And as far as "expeditiously" is concerned:</p>
<ul>
<li>i don't see the big damage if for some hours there exist new redirects. And if there is such a big damage, I wonder how you have slept with the redirects that existed before for much longer time. BTW how much did YOU fix during the last 24h? <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 08:28, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Category: Australian radio programs</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>User:Grutness has contacted me on my talk page to ask whether the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_radio_programs_213a.html" title="Category:Australian radio programs">Category:Australian radio programs</a> should be renamed as Category:Australian radio programmes. My advice for what it is worth is that programmes is the more traditional spelling but programs is the more common. However, I promised that I would post something here so that others can have their say. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 09:26, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was taught "programmes" as a young(er)ster, and a recent survey of that portion of my library by Australian authors (hey, I was bored) showed that in books even as old as ten years ago, "programme" is more common. However, "program" is catching on in a big way; two examples, <i>The Canberra Times</i> has standardised on "program" as its preferred spelling for both computer programs and any other sort of programmes, and the ACT Government has set up a "Helpshop Program" for shopping centres in Canberra. It won't be long before everyone — except for a few hangers-on who like to be perverse — says "program".

</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Winston Howard</a> prefers "programme", whereas the Australian Government 'Style Manual' suggested standardising on "program" (at least last time I looked).

<li>I tend to use programme, partly because that is what I was taught in school (and I'm not that old - I'm 27), and partly because I tend to be resistent towards adopting American spelling simply because News Corp and others think it might be easier. We haven't changed harbour to harbor and colour to colour. Adopting program instead of programme simply creates confusion in terms of what is and what isn't Australian spelling.

<li>From my experience, "program" has become dominant in the newsprint medium (thanks, as someone said, to News Corp) while the traditional "programme" is prevalent elsewhere. I was taught "programme" at school also, and I graduated from secondary school only a year or so ago, so I don't think "program" can be said to have displaced "programme".--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 07:23, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's different when the more appropriate spelling is obvious, though: on American articles, for instance, I always (if I remember) misspell "colour". And suchlike. For articles related to Australian topics, it's usually pretty obvious: -ise instead of -ize, colour instead of color, herbs instead of erbs (cough) ... it would be nice to be able to standardise on one spelling of "program(me)" across Australian articles in a similar manner. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 07:59, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Photo deletions</span></h2>
<p>Many of User Tannin's photos are up for deletion. He has been a wikipedian since 2002 and many of them were uploaded before the tagging became mandatory. He has not been active since last September, his only 2 wikipedia forays being to revert attempts by other users to retag images. I do not believe he has read <a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETannin_8d3a.html" title="User talk:Tannin">his talk page</a>. This is an example of right process wrong outcome, not helped by the prickliness of Tannin. Could some wikipedian who knows him perhaps intervene by emailing him and seeking direction on approproiate retagging? Or something! See <a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETannin_8d3a.html" title="User talk:Tannin">User talk:Tannin</a> for more info on this. There are many many articles, particularly Australian ones that will be worse off for these deletions. He has uploaded I believe over 100 images.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 01:16, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Tannin was not in favor of tagging all his images as GFDL since he did not want them re-used by commerical outlets, most of them are licenced under a non-commerical licences, which are as of May 2005, supposed to be phased out as possible. Its unfortunate that lots of images he uploaded will be deleted, but since they are not GFDL compatible and he isn't willing to change the licences (at least the last time I asked anyway) they will get deleted at some point. The commons has quite alot of images that could be used as replacements, we also have quite a lot of Australian photographers that could make replacements if we keep track of the articles that need replacement images.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 01:30, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes Ben. In the past when someone was up it was just mentioned in the discussion section. However I started its own section for it for my RfA in November last year. I feel it is important to let other Aussies know when one of us is up for adminship. Now that this board has been reformatted (which was long overdue), RfA announcements should go under "Other Candidates". We can never have enough Aussie admins.

<dd>I disagree. I think an RFA is meant to involve gathering wide community consensus, any publicising amongst "sympathy groups" is unfair in my opinion and likely to distort the discussion. It should be frowned upon just as RFA candidates writing to all their contacts asking for a "vote" is frowned up. (I'm not singling you guys out by the way, I came here as part of a survey to see if other noticeboards advertise RFAs as Singapore does. So, clearly some do - and some don't). --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 11:13, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Announcing Australian RFA candidates here is not about getting more support - it is about ensuring that the editors most likely to have encountered the candidate are aware that he/she is nominated.

<dd>I agree with Scott Davis. I hope we can keep them here, because they're useful. They don't mean that every editor here will go and vote for a candidate. I'd like to see any evidence at all that RfAs being posted here has led to a "pile-on" in any single RfA.

<dd>The Australian Govt is nowhere near as enlightened as the US govt as regards copyright, unfortunately. E.g. the idea that public paid for it, so the public should own it (which means public domain) seems to have not twigged. So, we're sometimes stuck with the perverse situation of having to sometimes get US govt data (e.g. NASA photos of Australia), and use those, instead of using similar material from Australian govt sources. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 21:58, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Section 2 seems to permit republication, although I'm concerned about 2 a). Although the GFDL allows the author to retain copyright on the work, this strictly speaking is not a "free" license.

<dl>
<dd>While we could, I'm inclined to think dumping legislation onto Wikisource is a Bad Idea. Legislation is constantly changing - unlike, say, treaties, or Jane Austen novels, anyone reading it really needs to know that what they're reading is very up to date. While I have no particular objection to caselaw ending up there, as the text does not change (even if a bit unnecessary with the definite accurateness of Austlii around), putting statutes on Wikisource opens up a needless minefield. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 08:41, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You do have a point there - it would be quite hard to keep up with the changes. However, the case law sounds like a good idea, to accompany our case articles. Actually, it might be useful to store on Wikisource old, repealled pieces of legislation that are important historically but are otherwise unavailable online (Austlii only goes so far back); that would involve scanning the typed up versions, which will take up truckloads of time that I don't think many of us have. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 12:31, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Putting legislation up would also be redundant, since it's all available through AustLII or ComLaw (or State equivalents) for free. I should check out what copyrights are on judgments, they may not be usable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 21:16, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With the fuss over US congressional staff inappropriately editing congresscritters' biographies, has anybody seen any evidence of Australian politicians' articles being edited by parliamentary staffers?

<p>I've seen a few examples of this happening. <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Simpson_567c.html" title="Tony Simpson">Tony Simpson</a> (WA state MP) appears to have been started by a staffer, and a new image was added to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mal_Washer_9c3c.html" title="Mal Washer">Mal Washer</a> the other day by someone who looks like a staffer. The article on <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Brideson_e51d.html" title="Andrew Brideson">Andrew Brideson</a> was briefly censored by someone who I have reason to believe may have been Brideson himself, and the IP traces back to the Victorian parliament. I have my suspicions, but no evidence, that some edits to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Collier_b279.html" title="Peter Collier">Peter Collier</a> were made similarly. There's also some that one does wonder about, such as the person who first wrote <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Perton_331b.html" title="Victor Perton">Victor Perton</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, while he may not be a staffer or an MP, several of us have strong suspicions that a Victorian political figure who shall remain nameless is the Australian politics libel vandal. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:09, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for this list. I had a quick look at <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicky_Winmar_4356.html" title="Nicky Winmar">Nicky Winmar</a> and I have now crossed him off the list. I would appreciate someone else having a look at it as well. It originally had a reference to his "exquisite skills" (not my wording) but now all reference to his skill level has been left out in the interests of getting the POV tag off...but...I can't help thinking that if we are talking about an exceptionally skilled player (confirmed by the Encyclopedia of AFL players), what is wrong with saying that the player was widely regarded as being extremely skilled? For someone who is rapidly getting up to 20,000 edits in a few wikipedias - I have to tell you - my observation is that often when someone whacks a POV charge on an article - it is often a case of the whacker being more POV than the whackee. In the AFL realm, non-AFL adherents are noticeably harsh and I am suspicious of their motivations. Sure, some of you will say: and deservedly so! However, a close inspection does not bear this out. For instance, in the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> talk page, a rugby diehard is trying to argue that Australian rules football should be called Victorian rules football - or that it shouldn't be described as an Australian game but as a Victorian game - it is the most inane, idiotic, POV argument I have ever heard.

<li>Sorry, if I raised eyebrows because I tagged a few of the AFL pages. I guess with cricket articles its easier because there are lots of individual stats, but in AFL this is obviously harder to quantify. However, it is probably improbable that players are extremely proficient at all areas, so it would probably be good to explain which areas were their relative strengths and weaknesses, lest it gives the reader the suspicion that the writer thinks that the player is immortal. If you think that perhaps I am being difficult, see <a href="../../../r/a/h/Talk%7ERahul_Dravid_c52f.html" title="Talk:Rahul Dravid">Talk:Rahul Dravid</a>, which was tagged in October. As for the quote, sports encyclopedias/history books aren't to the same standard as an encyclopedia. Some sports encyclopedias aren't really encyclopedias</li>
<li><i>As reward for his courageous effort</i>, from <i>100 Great Australian Olympians</i></li>
<li>Some quotes from Wisden Cricinfo profiles have been cut and pasted onto cricket profiles, and subsequently booted off for POV not for copyvio</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it is better to cite statistically and quote the pundit, rather than simply assert an 'encyclopedia' opinion as a 'fact'. Regards.

<dd>Yes but for many players who played before the advent of advanced statistics (ie, before the mid-1990s), it is very hard to quantify the skills of particular players. I suppose you could quantify a <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full-forward.html" title="Full-forward">full-forward</a>'s contribution to the team by the number of goals scored in a particular season, but apart from that it's hard to say without using anecdotal evidence. <b><a href="../../../a/f/l/WP%7EAFL_72f6.html" title="WP:AFL"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rogerthat_2a3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rogerthat"><font color="red">o</font></a><a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerthat_6fee.html" title="User:Rogerthat"><font color="darkblue">gerthat</font></a></b> <i><sup><a href="../../../r/o/g/User_talk%7ERogerthat_5be9.html" title="User talk:Rogerthat"><font color="black">Talk</font></a></sup></i> 12:17, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Categorisation of murderers</span></h2>
<p>There is some concern about the categorisation of people as murderers and criminals. The concern has been raised at <a href="../../../m/a/x/Talk%7EMaxwell_Stuart_77be.html" title="Talk:Maxwell Stuart">Talk:Maxwell Stuart</a>. I have suggested that given Stuart was convicted, had unsuccessfully appealed, the verdict had been reviewed by a Royal Commission and upheld, to fail to categorise him as a murderer seemed to be POV, rather than the other way around. It is not the Wikipedia's role to unconvict someone - the issue is to report the facts. To categorise someone as a murderer, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> is met by reference to court decisions and, in the Stuart case, the report of the Royal Commission.

<dd>I still have a problem over notability. He appears to be more notable than other insolvency practitioners only because a bunch of student politicians have gotten upset with him and launched a smear campaign, which they're trying to extend into Wikipedia. However, if we were to assume that he <i>is</i> notable, then the only solution would be to watch over the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_McVeigh_c39e.html" title="Dean McVeigh">Dean McVeigh</a> article carefully and remove any unsourced claims, and in particular defamatory statements. Protection would <i>not</i> be appropriate in this situation; it would stop good faith non-admin users from making any improvements, and if he truly <i>is</i> notable, then we've got to assume that there will be people along wanting to actually make the article better — it's not a good idea to deny them that opportunity just because we don't want to watch it constantly. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 03:16, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An editor over at <a href="../../../g/o/a/Talk%7EGoanna_4140.html" title="Talk:Goanna">Talk:Goanna</a> took exception to wording stating that 'goannas are found throughout Australia, except Tasmania' on the grounds that 'tasmania is not part of australia'.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Football childishness</span></h2>
<p>It looks like this football/soccer thing just <i>won't let up</i>. Frankly I no longer personally care what we end up naming things (though I once preferred "football"), but this idiocy — revert warring, "moving" by cutnpaste, etc. — has gotten way out of hand. Sooner or later the Australian Wikipedians are going to be the laughingstock of everyone here except the Romanians, and quite rightly so.</p>
<p>I've spent this morning cleaning up clumsy and stupid moves by <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebunct_e157.html" title="User:Debunct">User:Debunct</a> and others. The work is good for my edit count, but not for my state of mind. I was going to move on to Category space and try to work out what sort of silliness was occurring <i>there</i>, but the old heart quails just to look at it.</p>
<p>Speaking of the categories, it's obvious that certain individuals here — hem, hem — won't allow the category to be "Soccer in Australia". "Football in Australia" is obviously inappropriate, as one can see just from observing <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_football_competitions_885e.html" title="Category:Australian football competitions">Category:Australian football competitions</a>. So, what I propose is: a multi-tiered thingy. "Football in Australia" or "Football codes in Australia", with "Football (soccer) in Australia", "Australian rules football in Australia", "Rugby league in Australia", and "Rugby union in Australia" as subcats. How does <i>that</i> sound? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 00:54, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I ask again - why should <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_Football_e502.html" title="Association Football">Association Football</a> claim the title <b>Football</b> all to itself? How can I be accused of being POV when it is another group which is trying to appropriate a generic name all to themselves and make themselves out to be the one and only true football code worthy of the name <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a>, when in fact, anyone who knows the history of football generally, knows that this has no historical basis. Furthermore, we are the english wikipedia, and soccer is the name that is widely used throughout the english speaking world (especially in the USA). Remember also that soccer is the term coined originally by the British as a shortening of Association Football (the original and official name of soccer), there is no sound argument for not using simply <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> full stop. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 03:13, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is not that it is biased. It just gives far too much space to a notion that is basically silly. There is a snowball's chance in Hell of him becoming King of England. The right of the current Queen is grounded in Parliament (mostly the restoration after Cromwell and the cases of William and Mary and then George I), with only some inheritance as part of the picture. Most of this article should be deleted. He had his 15 min of fame when the TV had a program about him. BTW, I'm not biased against him or the current Queen. I've been a Republican for 50 years.

<dd>In the NSW Crimes Act, a crime is labelled as serious if the maximum prison sentence is 5 years or over.

<dd>As Enoch said, "serious" depends on where you are - a suitable definition might be anything that qualifies as an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indictable_offence.html" title="Indictable offence">indictable offence</a> (or whatever is the local equivalent). Then again, something based on the available sentence would probably mean more to the average reader. There's also the issue of crimes which are not "serious" per se in Australia, but are harshly punished overseas (drug offences in Indonesia, for example). A definition based on prison terms sounds like a good idea in that context. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 06:25, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
