<p>The <b>Australian Catholic University</b>, or <b>ACU National</b>, is <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia's</a> only public <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> university.

<p>The university's mission statement aims to add a "spiritual dimension" to higher education in Australia, similar to the aims of the great Catholic universities of Europe and North America. There is a strong social justice element in the university's mission and programsâ€”student teachers complete community service as part of their course.<sup id="_ref-mission_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mission" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Catholic schooling system in Australia developed in parallel with the state education systems in the 19th century. Australian Catholics, predominantly of <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish</a> descent, wanted to educate their children in their faith in a country where <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestants.html" title="Protestants">Protestants</a> were in the ascendancy. When state aid was stopped to Catholic schools in the late 19th century, the Catholic bishops sent for Irish brothers and nuns to staff their schools. Until the mid-20th century, the majority of teachers in Australian Catholic schools were members of religious orders, including the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregation_of_Christian_Brothers_037b.html" title="Congregation of Christian Brothers">Christian Brothers</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sisters_of_Mercy_c8d6.html" title="Sisters of Mercy">Sisters of Mercy</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominicans.html" title="Dominicans">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marist_Brothers_1417.html" title="Marist Brothers">Marist Brothers</a>.<sup id="_ref-history_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The predecessors of ACU were established as religious institutes to train Australian youth for religious life and to staff Catholic schools and hospitals. The first of these was established in 1850, a year before Australia's first university, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Sydney_fa65.html" title="University of Sydney">University of Sydney</a>.<sup id="_ref-est_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-est" title="">[3]</a></sup> In the mid-20th century, these colleges began to admit lay students, and the Catholic Teacher Training Colleges were established from the former religious institutes. By the 1980s these were known as <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_Advanced_Education_8aaa.html" title="College of Advanced Education">Colleges of Advanced Education (CAEs)</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawkins_Reforms_1c37.html" title="Dawkins Reforms">Dawkins Reforms</a> of the late 1980s and a desire of the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Australia_74b0.html" title="Government of Australia">Federal government</a> to deal with one Catholic institution led to the merger of these former CAEs to become the Australian Catholic University. More than 20 historical entities shaped the creation of the university. The four institutions that amalgamated to become ACU were the Catholic College of Education Sydney in New South Wales, the Institute of Catholic Education in Victoria, McAuley College of Queensland, and Signadou College of Education in the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>Australian Catholic University opened its doors on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>.

There were formerly three campuses in Sydney. The <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales_b537.html" title="Castle Hill, New South Wales">Castle Hill</a> campus was closed and staff and students moved to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strathfield.html" title="Strathfield">Strathfield</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sydney_84df.html" title="North Sydney">North Sydney</a>.

It is the only ACU campus to still offer on-campus accommodation. Programs offered include nursing, teaching and theology.</p>
<p>The campus dates its history back to the establishment of the Aquinas Training College in 1909 by the <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sisters_of_Mercy_c8d6.html" title="Sisters of Mercy">Ballarat East Sisters of Mercy</a>. Then known as Sacred Heart Training College, in the 1960s the college moved to another location in Ballarat. In 1974, the Catholic Teachers' College of the Diocese of Ballarat moved to the university's present site and was known as Aquinas College. The campus includes a two-story mansion built in 1881, <i>Carn Brea</i>, an example of the properties built in the town from profits of the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Gold_Rush_59a3.html" title="Victorian Gold Rush">Victorian Gold Rush</a> of the mid-1800s.</p>

A relatively new campus, having opened in 2000, it features a mix of modern and heritage buildings. The campus' main building is located at 115 Victoria Parade, and was formerly occupied by the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia_1418.html" title="Reserve Bank of Australia">Reserve Bank of Australia</a>.

<p>This campus offers courses in arts, business, education, exercise science, information systems, nursing, music, psychology, social sciences, theology and visual arts.</p>

<p>Students are represented at a national level by the Australian Catholic University National Students Association (ACUNSA), an informal gathering whose role is to present student issues to university management and to elect the student member of senate. ACUNSA is chaired by the student senator who also sits on the university senate.</p>
<p>Each campus has its own <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student_Association_f8a4.html" title="Student Association">Student Association</a>. The president of each campus Student Association doubles as a member of ACUNSA. Campus Student Associations are responsible for providing students with cultural, sporting and social opportunities and representing the needs of the student body to the university.</p>
<p>At the end of 2005, the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">Howard Government</a> passed its <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voluntary_student_unionism.html" title="Voluntary student unionism">voluntary student unionism</a> bill, which makes it illegal for student organisations to collect fees from students without their consent, as had previously been the case. As of July 2006, many believe that student organisations on smaller and regional campuses, such as ACU's, will be hardest hit without the commercial income and assets of the larger universities. The effect remains to be seen.</p>

<p>In 2004, the Sydney campuses hosted the first ever national gathering of students from every campus. This gathering was known as the Big Event and its aim was to engender a feeling of being one national university rather than a collection of small campuses. Students engaged in workshops on topics such as leadership, spirituality and social justice. Many of these workshops were led by alumni who were working for organisations that aim to make a difference in society.</p>
<p>The Big Event in 2006 was held at the Brisbane campus everyone lived in at Nudgee College and went to the Brisbane Campus to do workshops and listen to guest speakers. We also spent time in small groups sharing what we had learnt in the workshops we went to and responding to what the guest speaker said by creating a group banner on paper. At night at Nudgee College we had social events where we could let our hair down and get to know people from other campuses.</p>
