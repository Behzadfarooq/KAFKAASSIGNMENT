<p>Austinsurge, good job on the HoM article. You've made it look really nice. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElefuntboy_7b7e.html" title="User:Elefuntboy">Elefuntboy</a> 04:02, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a member of <a href="../../../c/m/c/WP%7ECMC_eb00.html" title="WP:CMC">WikiProject Comics</a>, I thought you might be interested in the <a href="../../../c/m/c/WP%7ECMCC_a961.html" title="WP:CMCC">Comics Collaboration of the Fortnight</a> we have set up. Please feel free to vote on the articles listed, although bear in mind that a vote for a particular article means you are pledging to help improve the article. The goal of the collaboration is to improve articles to <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Featured Article</a> status, as we feel Comics is under-represented in that area.
