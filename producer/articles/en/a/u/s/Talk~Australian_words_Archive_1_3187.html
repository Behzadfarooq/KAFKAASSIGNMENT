<dd>I've not heard of it either. In fact, I was the one who changed the original attribution ("Prisoner of Mother England") to "Origin Uncertain", which at present seems to be all that can be said about it. The P.O.M.E. explanation is definitely an <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_myth.html" title="Urban myth">urban myth</a>, which appears to have originated in the 1960s, at which time this kind of cod acronym etymologies were popular (cf. F.U.C.K. and others). It seems as if the origins of the term have been lost.

<p>According to the Macquarie Dictionary, "pom" is a contraction of "pomegranate" which was used as rhyming slang for "immigrant" ("imme-granate"). Seeing as this is Australia's official dictionary, they probably have a better idea than anyone else. I would either concur with them, or mark the origin as obscure. The derivation from the French "pomme de terre" is certainly wrong in any case. <a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 06:28, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Didjeridoo</span></h3>
<p>I've never heard the etymology listed on this article:</p>
<p>actually derived from the Irish term "Dudaire Dubh", which literally means "black trumpeter".</p>
<p>That looks like a <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a> to me, or perhaps what some users have begun called a <a href="../../../f/a/k/Fake_etymology.html" title="Fake etymology">fake etymology</a>. I've always heard, including from an aborigine and from a didj teacher, that the name is onomatopeoic from one of the sounds commonly produced by the instrument.</p>
<p>I'd like to see some citations to support the Irish etymology please or it should be removed. — <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippietrail_ecc5.html" title="User:Hippietrail">Hippietrail</a> 14:02, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This etymology was copied over from the <a href="../../../d/i/d/Didgeridoo.html" title="Didgeridoo">didgeridoo</a> article where there is a link to a page about this theory. It is quite creative, but probably false for a couple of reasons:
<ul>
<li>The English pronunciation would require a spelling like <i>duidirí dubha</i>, but in fact the word has a long <i>ú</i> in it's standard (<i>dúdaire</i>) and variant (<i>dúidire</i>) spellings. The long <i>-í</i> ending also implies plural, which doesn't make a lot of sense.</li>
<li>It's not impossible, but an English speaker would be unlikely to change <i>doodaradoo</i> (<i>dúdaire dubh</i>) or <i>doojeradoo</i> (<i>dúidire dubh</i>) into <i>didgeridoo</i>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, it's certainly not a proven etymology, so I'll amend the articles. — <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoillead%C3%B3ir_6009.html" title="User:Moilleadóir">Moilleadóir</a> 16:35, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not necessarily Irish, same in Scottish Gaelic. A lot of "aboriginal" words like kangaroo appear to have obscure origins. It's notable around North East Scotland though, they call a trumpet a tooteroo, which is similar.</dd>

<p><a href="../../../p/o/l/Polari.html" title="Polari">Polari</a> is described as "a form of cant slang used in the gay subculture in Britain in the 1950s and 1960s". Use of 'bloke' long predates that - for instance, C.J. Dennis' "The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke" was published in 1915.

<p>I don't know which part of Australia "bloke", "bloody" and "poofter" are falling into disuse, because I hear them used by lots of people all the time (In both Queensland and Victoria). I suggest the be moved from the "disused" list to the "common" list.

<dd>I have read, heard and used "Anglo-Celtic" in Australia, but as an adjective not a noun, describing/grouping people in Australia of U.K. and/or Irish descent, their POV, suburbs, food, etc. Yes, it's an inaccurate term in many senses.

<dd>Interesting, I've only heard Anglo, never the Anglo-Celtic bit. I still think its presence in the list gives an illusion of being in wide use, when it's not really. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">ShaneKing</a> 13:20, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've never heard Anglo-Celtic and have lived in Oz all my life. Also, I've rarely heard "Anglo". And things like "wog" are not as derogatory now - look at Nick Giannopolous and the like, who have helping turn "wog!" into a proud statement about one's orgins or a term of endearment to a mate. And there are accent differences between states, as well as between "classes". I, a Melburnian, can instantly pick if someone on telly is from New South Wales when they are acting as a Queenslander, for instance, and the accent of Adelaide is VERY distinct. The table showing pronunciations of different words accross the states is completely innaccurate, according to my personal experiences.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've also been baffled by the term "Anglo-Celtic" in this list. I can't recall hearing it and I'm 36, a 6th generation Aussie who's lived in 4 states. I've definitely heard "Anglo" though it's certainly not very common.</dd>
<dd>As for accents in Australia, it's widely known by linguists that many Aussies believe there are regional accents in Aus but it's been studied many times over the years and it just doesn't hold up. The chart in this article may not be completely up-to-date but it does give a good view of just how slight the regional variations are in Australia. Adelaide or South Australia is acknowledged as having more tendency to a British sound but it's only a tendency and different speakers have different numbers of the traits to differing degrees. Usually when an Aussie picks an "accent" it's actually use of regionalisms which give the hints - this doesn't make an accent in the linguistic sense, and this is a linguistic article. So we should state here that many Australians believe in regional accents but that linguists do not. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippietrail_ecc5.html" title="User:Hippietrail">Hippietrail</a> 08:15, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)

<dd>It is probably out of place on the list, since most of those words are colloquialisms. "Anglo-Celtic" is used more by academics and the government. But in those fields it is used very widely indeed (see <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22anglo-celtic%22&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryAU" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22anglo-celtic%22&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryAU" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), since the informal alternatives are all regarded as discriminatory in one way or the other. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 17:03, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Anglo-Celtic</i> seems to be used a lot in the media (particularly the ABC). It's strange to hear it described as a non-discriminatory alternative since I find it so very offensive. Given the history of the Irish in Australia, it seems incredible that anyone could ever use this term without blushing. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoillead%C3%B3ir_6009.html" title="User:Moilleadóir">Moilleadóir</a> 05:41, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anglo-Celtic is fairly common in discussing society and religion. I see how it could be considered offensive, but it's chiefly a way of broadly distinguishing different groups of European origin. Despite all the tricky history, Australians of Irish origin had been reasonably integrated (particularly in terms of language) by WWII as opposed to the large waves of Italian, Greek etc immigration in the post war years. It's particularly useful in discussing Catholicism in Australia, and the changes forced by incorporating these southern and eastern European immigrants into the Australian Church(where the Irish/British were very much the establishment). <a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMunster_9c29.html" title="User:Munster">Munster</a> 11:05, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Use of G'day</span></h3>
<p>I think the comment about Australians being embarrised by the use of 'Gday' is becoming out of date. I frequently use it in conversations with friends and in particular people I am meeting for the first time. Most people I know either use it or have no problem with other people using it. And I am only 17! My work also encourages people to use it to meet a customer.</p>
<p>I really do think that the whole use of 'Gday' is coming back in, and that a revision of this sentance may be necessary.</p>
<p>- I agree with this. I'm 29, and use g'day every day of my life, even if I speak to foreigners. I've never been embarassed or ashamed by it. Too bad for them they're not Australian, I say. David.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Words to Add to Australian vocabulary</span></h2>
<p>I am not entirelly sure if some of these words are in use in the USA of other english speaking countries but i think that the following should be added to the article:</p>
<p>Oi: usually used to gain someones attention, for example "Oi you you tosser!"</p>
<p>Thong: called flip-flops by Americans but is starting to decline by American influence in the younger generations (why is it not called G-string in USA anyway?)</p>
<p>bougan (sp?): Usually of Anglo appearance, similar to American white trailer trash, stereotype of blue flannel shirts, big beer drinker, dole bludger, and lower class.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is <i>bogan</i>. There is a separate article on that and the related <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westie.html" title="Westie">westie</a>. <a href="../../../l/-/b/User%7EL-Bit_18c9.html" title="User:L-Bit">L-Bit</a> 10:25, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the accent in Australia tends to be consistent throughout the country there are differences, for example when you go out bush or in central or regional Queensland it tends to be more nasal, or perhaps thats due to education levels in the areas? In addition there is Aboriginal accents which are different from "whites" particually in Missions or reserves. -June 4 2004 K. Levett</p>
<ul>
<li>Both "oi" and "tosser" are common English slang - specifically London slang I think. "Oi" does get some use in Australia (Aussie Aussie Aussie Oi Oi Oi comes to mind), but tosser is only known from British TV shows.</li>
<li>Thongs in Australia are cheap plastic or rubber summer footwear, which I think are called flip-flops in the US. The sense of thong underwear is not used, although the Lewinski scandal has made it better known.</li>
<li>Bogan is common urban youth slang meaning a young man of limited intelligence or education. An American equivalent would be hick or redneck, although it doesn't have the connotation of violence or bigotry that redneck has. It may come from the town of Bogan Gate in western NSW, but it may have some other source.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Differences in Australian accents are mostly class based rather than regional. As a rule country people have lower incomes and less education, and tend to speak more slowly and have broader Australian accents. Since Queensland and Tasmania are the least urbanised states, the "bush" accent is sometimes assumed to have a regional basis. Upper-class people, particularly South Australians, cultivate a Home Counties English accent, although this is declining under the pressure of Americanisation.</li>
<li>Aboriginal people certainly have a distinctive vocabulary, which when mixed with a broad rural Australian produces what might be called an Aboriginal accent.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">light globe – light bulb</span></h2>
<p>Don't know about anyone else but as an Australian I find this definition vaguely insulting&#160;: "light globe – although "light bulb" is sometimes also used, most Australians don't realise that "globe" is no longer commonly used in this sense outside Australia." Perhaps the rest of the world doesn't realise that it is used commonly this way in Australia?</p>
<p>Note to above. This has been improved, by why even mention that "globe" is not commonly used outside Australia? Surely this is common to all words listed in an "Australian language" page - ie not used outside Australia?</p>

<p>One possible theory on why Australians call "peppers" <i>capsicums</i> may be to avoid confusion with the other form of pepper, the ground or unground berries of the genus <i>Piper</i>. What term is generally used by American or British English speakers to refer to table pepper?

<dd>That's black pepper, or white pepper as opposed to a green pepper, or a red pepper. Both the colour and the need for an article (peppers are countable items, pepper isn't) remove ambiguity.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Entrée</span></h3>
<p>I have removed ref to use of entree when used to describe a course before the main one,</p>
<p><i>In American English, an entrée is a main course; in Australian English, it is a smaller course that precedes the main course. It is more substantial than appetisers, better thought of as a half-sized version of a main course. Restaurant menus will often offer the same dish in different-sized servings as both entrée and main course.</i></p>
<p>as in fact use of entree to describe the main course is a characteristic of American English, and in Britain the Aust usage is the norm...and in France (it is a French word after all) they also use it to mean the course before the main meat dish.</p>

<dd>Perhaps I've misunderstood the British usage.

As discussed above, in Australian English 'entree' does <i>not</i> mean the same thing as 'appetisers' or 'hors d'ouevres'; I've been to several places that offer both 'entrees' and 'appetisers', in separate parts of the menu.</dd>

<dd>If 'entree' in British English just means 'appetiser', then the Australian usage is different and ought to be mentioned here.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Lunch Meats</span></h3>
<p>I have spent time, and eaten processed meats, in both Victoria and New South Wales, and my experience is that Devon and Strasburg/Strasbourg are different, and found in both states. "Stras" is a reddish-pink, spicy meat that also usually contains white, hard pieces of what I assume are cartilage or "grissle" and at least sometimes has a rind. Devon is usually less spicy than Strasbourg, while Devon is of a similar light-pink colour to Anglo-saxon skin, is completely processed and smooth, and has no rind. Both usually come in a round sausage of similar diameter, although I have also seen Strasbourg in square slices that I assume come from a square block, and there's no reason Devon couldn't be the same.</p>
<p>I'd like to change the section that deals with this, but I don't know what these two meats are called in the other states. Someone care to fill this in? <a href="../../../b/k/h/User%7EBkhour_99b8.html" title="User:Bkhour">Ben Hourigan</a> 14:19 3 March 2005 (Eastern Standard Time)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've never thought of Stras as being spicy, and I would consider stras to be about the same color as my (white) skin. A spicy reddish-pink meat that often has a rind is how I'd describe, among other things, salami. I come from Melbourne.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>stras is spicy, dark red with white chunks. its not pink at all.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I grew up in SA (now live vic) and therefore not well versed re stras and devon: but can confirm that fritz in SA is the light-pink stuff that you get in a 'fritz and sauce sandwich'. I was told when growing up that this was called stras/devon in the Eastern states. Fritz was fat (say 8 cm diameter) with a tough skin of an unnatural colour. The red spicy stuff with white bits (fat) was (in SA) either salami or metwurtz (sp?). Metwurtz was likely to be less cooked and softer: salami was hard. Really need a European migrant to sort out the real names for these more recent foods. The fritz, strass etc line all date to before the rise in 'continental' foods in the 1970's.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Tomato Sauce and Ketchup</span></h3>
<p>Tomato sauce may be used interchangeably with ketchup by some, but there is a difference between the two. On supermarket shelves in Australia, one may find "Ketchup" as well as "Tomato Sauce", often sold by the same brand (eg. Heinz). Ketchup tends to be thicker and with more tomato flavour (possibly containing more tomato paste), and is generally more expensive than tomato sauce.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you sure that the use of <i>ketchup</i> is not some marketing ploy? The word certainly seems very unAustralian to me. You might find it on the labels of certain tomato sauce bottles but is any Aussie going to use that word to describe the sauce? Does a slight differenc in texture, flavour and price warrant a whole new name? Sure it does but only if you're trying to sell the sauce. Heinz isn't even an Australian company. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 13Apr05
<dl>
<dd>It's an interesting comment. I don't remember ever seeing anything labelled as ketchup in the local supermarket, but I'll have a closer look next time I'm there. They do try these things -- for a couple of years Coles, here in WA at least, has insisted on using the word "<a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantaloupe.html" title="Cantaloupe">cantaloupes</a>" here in WA for the things that 90% of the population (in WA) call "<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_melon.html" title="Rock melon">rock melons</a>" <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 11:00, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have seen tomato sauce labelled as <i>ketchup</i> once or twice in Sydney but that was a while back. Perhaps it's fallen out of fashion (one can only hope). However you've got to note some points about this alledged <i>ketchup</i> verses <i>tomato sauce</i> distinction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The distinction has no etymological basis.</li>
<li>It's not a distinction made in other parts of the English speaking world.</li>
<li>It's not a distinction normally made by Australians in speach or writing.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It seems only to be a distinction made by the tomato sauce companies. Hence the only difference between the two is an invention of Heinz: i.e. there is no <i>true</i> diffence between the two. <i>Tomato sauce</i> is the Australian term. <i>Ketchup</i> is a foreign term. No mention need be made of this "distinction" in the article, in my opinion. - <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 15Apr05</dd>

<p>I removed 'teetotaller' from the explanation of 'wowser' because it's misleading. IME, 'wowser' invariably means someone who inflicts puritanical beliefs *on others*.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Jerry-built</span></h3>
<p>I was under the impression 'jerry-built' was at least as common in British English as it is in Strine, and with the same meaning - should it really be included as specifically Australian vocabulary? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 23:24, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think (and might be able to prove, given time)that "jerry-built" is a phrase common to the British, the Americans and the Australians. There is a phrase, "<a href="../../../j/u/r/Jury-rig.html" title="Jury-rig">jury-rig</a>", that is an old sailing term derived from Latin and perhaps Old French which means - literally - to arrange mechanical help for something broken or unplanned. As in a jury-rigged mast or such. Since the term is older than near-universal literacy for common sailors, it's not hard to see the connection between the two phrases. This confusion may have been augmented by two wars between English-speakers and the Germans. A common euphemism for a German in both world wars was "Jerry". Toward the latter part of each of the wars, the German population was forced by the failure of their industrial and supply systems to do a great deal of improvising in order to provide themselves with housing, transportation and clothing. The term was in wide use in the subsequent popular literature written or dictated by veterans who pursued the German Army into Germany. captainjacklogan@netzero.net--24.91.129.109 09:22, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What *is* its etymology anyway? I mean, obviously, its immediate source is obvious to Australian speakers (non-Australians: it's an approximation of the word "Australian" as spoken in an Australian accent), but was it coined by "Afferbeck Lauder" in writing "Let Stalk Strine"?
