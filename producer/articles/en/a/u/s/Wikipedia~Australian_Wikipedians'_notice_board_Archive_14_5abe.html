<h2><span class="mw-headline">Category:Australian Aboriginal mythology</span></h2>
<p>Is it really appropriate to refer to 'Australian Aboriginal deities', 'gods' and 'goddesses'? I mean, we're talking about a religion that is essntially animistic, as I understand it, right? So 'gods' and 'goddesses' aren't really accurate terms in that context, are they? I'm going out on a limb here, I could be wrong. And I'm not sure what alternate terminology to use in the place of these. Anyone? -Dalziel 86 13:59, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The current heirarchy following reformatting by JPD is</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_Aboriginal_mythology_d3e0.html" title="Category:Australian Aboriginal mythology">Category:Australian Aboriginal mythology</a> (30 articles)

<li>Cat:Aboriginal gods (22)</li>
</ul>

</ul>

</ul>
<p>There are some deities who seem to be specifically goddesses according to the article such as <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kunapipi.html" title="Kunapipi">Kunapipi</a>. However, given the relatively small numbers why have a subsection below <i>Category:Australian Aboriginal deities</i>? I propose a merger of <i>Cat:Aboriginal godesses</i> and <i>Cat:Aboriginal gods</i> into <i>Category:Australian Aboriginal deities</i> which would have 38 articles, not too large and removes anachronism as per comments by Dalziel --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> <a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">(Talk)</a> 19:43, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I assume the original purpose of the gods and goddesses categories was to have them as subcategories of [[<a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Category</a>:<a href="../../../g/o/d/Category%7EGods_by_culture_c7d1.html" title="Category:Gods by culture">Gods by culture</a>]] and [[<a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Category</a>:<a href="../../../g/o/d/Category%7EGoddesses_by_culture_e91a.html" title="Category:Goddesses by culture">Goddesses by culture</a>]], which seems worthwhile to fit in with the general scheme. It is also true that some of the articles use the words "god" and "goddess", but on the whole the standard of these articles isn't that high, so someone with more knowledge might well be able to recommend renaming the categories to Australian Aboriginal male deities/spirits or something better. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> <a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">(talk)</a> 09:05, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For artistic works other than photographs and engravings (so including drawings, paintings, sculpture) it was "life plus 50" and is now "life plus 70". If the creator is unknown, it was "first published plus 50" and is now "first published plus 70". So if the creator died before 1 January 1955 or is unknown and the work was first published before 1 January 1955, then the work is out of copyright. This "in general" applies even if the creator was an employee of the newspaper which holds the actual copyright.

<dd>I heard back from a senior legal officer at Copyright Australia and they said that the National Library has probably not created a new work through the process of scanning the images and placing them online. So the images are still under public domain. If you where to approach the library for a high quality reproducation they may place you under contractual restrictions as to it's use. I will also post this on the above mentioned talk page. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<span style="font-size:90%"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></span> 01:44, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As my eyes glaze over at the first sight of anything even remotely legalistic, I'd like to recap the situation abd ask for clarification. I understand that I can use this 1950 <a href="http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an24649775" class="external autonumber" title="http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an24649775" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> image of Sir <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Playford_IV_5367.html" title="Thomas Playford IV">Thomas Playford</a> from the NLA site as it doesn't give details of who the photographer was and ergo his/her date of death. I can also use this NLA <a href="http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an23355926" class="external autonumber" title="http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an23355926" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> image of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Playford_II_8069.html" title="Thomas Playford II">Thomas Playford II</a> dating back to early 20th century. However, can I use this <a href="http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/pp/html/walsh.shtm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/pp/html/walsh.shtm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> image of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Walsh_775d.html" title="Frank Walsh">Frank Walsh</a> from the Parliament of South Australia website? The image was presumably taken later than 1955 but the site says "Apart from fair dealing permitted by the Copyright Act, the Parliament of South Australia grants visitors to this site a licence to download and display its copyright material for private and non-commercial purposes only", which to my non-legal mind indicates that we can display the Frank Walsh image on Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>According to Jimbo <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> non-commercial use images are no longer permitted. The pre-1955 photos are in the public domain -- it doesn't matter who took them (though it would be polite to give attribution where possible) or when it was published, if at all. Any photo taken after 1 January 1955 is not going to even begin to contemplate the merest thought of possibly being public domain until 2025 so you have to get the approval of the copyright holder to release it under a free licence. I don't know whether you can argue it is "fair dealing" to use a copyright photo of a person in an article about that person. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff/Gsl</a> 10:13, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As per Geoff, the Wikimedia foundation does not accept any restriction such as non-commercial use only. You would need to claim <i>fair use</i>. To understand more you really need to look at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a>. The way to navigate is really going to be <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">Fair use</a> - if you claim Fair use, you need to ask whether anyone will challenge it? As per the discussion about media releases, I would think not.</li>

<p>I don't know if the same has been happening to you guys or not, but a large number of Canadian government-related images (portraits of political figures, etc.) have been deleted under an apparent conflict between the provisions of <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_copyright.html" title="Crown copyright">Crown copyright</a> and the provisions of <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

<p>The cycle in the Indigenous Australian categories is now broken, and the graph is mainly in line with the proposal above. Th main differences are that I left A.A.music as a subcat of A.A.art, Native Title has not been renamed as yet, and I.A.leaders and I.A.politics are separate categories on the same level. It occurred to me that it might be worth making a new category:Indigenous Australian history. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> <a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">(talk)</a> 16:50, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

State Route Shield Template.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Just letting anyone know I have now added an attractive template of a general state route shield for use on roads. This design is based on many different ones used on Wikipedia, and I believe this is a good standard one to use for all states and territories using state route shields. Comments are appreciated on the design. I will soon complete a set of these of all the state route numbers used in Australia for use on all wikipedia articles on Australian roads. I am using a general Bold MS Sans Serif font which is generally used on Western Australian roads. The older style, thicker font is being is being phased out Australia wide for state route shields, so this was the most appropriate. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoochan_8bac.html" title="User:Boochan">Boochan</a> 08:25, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The OED defines "reform" as "the amendment of some faulty state of things... a change for the better... improvement or rectifying of something faulty or inexact." The word therefore cannot be used of Howard's legislation, since it is hotly disputed whether it is "a change for the better." It should be <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_industrial_relations_legislation%2C_2005.html" title="Australian industrial relations legislation, 2005">Australian industrial relations legislation, 2005</a>, and if someone doesn't move it there, I will. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:53, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the article should be called by either the name of the bill or the package. Is it called the <i>Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 2005</i>? The article's name should incorporate the word <i>Australian</i> as per the example of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Anti-Terrorism_Bill_2005_034c.html" title="Australian Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005">Australian Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005</a>.

<dd>I'm not sure what the bill is called, since it hasn't been introduced, tabled or even published. We might be able to find out another way, but I'm unsure how. It will probably be an amendment to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workplace_Relations_Act_1996_f2ac.html" title="Workplace Relations Act 1996">Workplace Relations Act 1996</a>. I think we can say pretty safely that the Liberals won't have the words "industrial relations" in its title: they'll use their PR term - "workplace relations". --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 01:37, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is also the problem of the Howard Government's increasing tendency to give legislation propagandistic titles.

Both treaties require parties to protect preexisting works from other member

<dd>Copyright is a <b>national</b> right, not an international one. The only reason why America recognises Australian copyright is because they have signed a treaty known as TRIPS, which is compulsory for countries who want to be members of the WTO. If you look at your local copyright act you will notice indicia of this. See for example s32(1) of the Australian copyright act which defines an author as an Australian - a qualified person is an Australian (see s32(4)). This only extends to foreign works due to application of TRIPS. Hence, copyright only exists internationally if it is recognised locally. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 05:48, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is not what we were told previously. We were told that images created in Australia before 1955 were absolutely free of copyright, regardless of the author/photographer's identity or date of death. Do you believe this not to be the case?

<p>Here is a replication of sections 33 and 34 of the Copyright Act</p>
<dl>
<dd>33 Duration of copyright in original works</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(1) This section has effect subject to subsection 32(2) and to section 34.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(2) Subject to this section, copyright that subsists in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work by virtue of this Part continues to subsist until the end of 70 years after the end of the calendar year in which the author of the work died.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(3) If, before the death of the author of a literary work (other than a computer program) or a dramatic or musical work:</dd>
</dl>
<p>(a) the work had not been published; (b) the work had not been performed in public; (c) the work had not been broadcast; and (d) records of the work had not been offered or exposed for sale to the public; the copyright in the work continues to subsist until the end of 70 years after the end of the calendar year in which the work is first published, performed in public, or broadcast, or records of the work are first offered or exposed for sale to the public, whichever is the earliest of those events to happen.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(4) A reference in the last preceding subsection to the doing of an act in relation to a work shall be read as including a reference to the doing of that act in relation to an adaptation of the work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(5) If, before the death of the author of an engraving, the engraving had not been published, the copyright in the engraving continues to subsist until the end of 70 years after the end of the calendar year in which the engraving is first published.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>34 Duration of copyright in anonymous and pseudonymous works</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(1) Subject to subsection (2), if the first publication of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is anonymous or pseudonymous, any copyright subsisting in the work by virtue of this Part continues to subsist until the end of the period of 70 years after the end of the calendar year in which the work was first published.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(2) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a work if, at any time before the end of the period referred to in that subsection, the identity of the author of the work is generally known or can be ascertained by reasonable inquiry.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A photograph is an artistic work (section 10(1))</p>

<p>(a) where the work is unpublished—continues to subsist so long as the work remains unpublished; and</p>

<dl>
<dd>OK. if you read my posts from a while ago I commented on the effects of the FTA. my point here is that it appears, on my reading of the act, that if the author of the photo is known it is 50/70 years after death, if not known 50/70 years after publication, if the government 50 years after publication. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 10:37, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For non-government photographs: photographs (if taken before 1 May 1969, 50 years from the end of the year they were taken; on or after 1 May 1969, 50 years from the end of the year of first publication); thus the interpretation that images made before 1955 are ok- however it would appear that this doesn't apply to government works. For works made by the goverment it's 1969 (or the year made) + 50 years, and after 1969 it's the year first published + 50 years.

<dd>According to the links posted by Martyman, before this year the law was that photos taken before 1969 were copyright for 50 years <i>from the year that they were taken</i>. This has now been changed, but copyright for photographs taken before 1955 had <i>already</i> expired when this change occurred, they are now public domain. The law does not recreate copyright that has already expired. For more references, you'd have to check the relevant part of the law before the 2004 amendments, which I suspect is the original 1968 version. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> <a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">(talk)</a> 10:40, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think the relavent act is the one before the 1968 one, which I can't seem to find. I don't know why you are arguing this. I have had confirmation from a chief legal officer at Copyright australia that all photos before 1955 in Australia are in the public domain. It get a lot more complicated after 1955 but we won't have to worry about that for a few more years. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<span style="font-size:90%"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></span> 10:46, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But that was superceeded by the 1968 act. once something loses copyright it is gone forever, but the change in 1968 would not have affected 1955 copyright. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 10:57, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sections 33 and 34 say things like "copyright that subsists ... continues to subsist".

<li>By cropping the images, you are removing the source of the image. It is important for reference purposes to source the images at the very least in the summary table. You should be honest about the source of the image and if your are frightened of copyright or reproduction rights (whatever that can mean without copyright), don't upload.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any fool can crop the image, if it is an attempt to disguise the source, you won't because the metadata will probably reveal the source unless you go through even further machinations.

<dd>It isn't an attempt to disguise the source, as that is stated clearly and obviously on under the "source" section, in the proper place. This is the way we source images on Wikipedia.

<li>Thank you Snottygobble for explaining why credits should not be placed on images and what the authority for your view is, ie not mere aesthetics. I am anything but lazy about uploading images.

<li>Wikipedia is quite clear on <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">citing sources</a>. Reasons given on the policy page include: "To enhance the overall credibility and authoritative character of Wikipedia." "To credit a source for providing useful information." Citing your sources does not only apply to words. The provenance of a photo is important, who took it, when they took it, in the case of historical photos, who now owns it, is it part of a collection, who has uploaded it and in what way they have manipulated the image all add information.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> <a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">(Talk)</a> 09:46, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would say that the NLA distorted the image by adding the border in the first place. Cropping the image back to the actual image is only returning to it's original state as the photographer intended. I would see the black border and text as a graphical frame rather than part of the image itself. I can also envision cases where cropping images helps highlight the information you wish to relay with it, I hardly think removing unwanted parts of a public domain image is in any way "wrong". --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<span style="font-size:90%"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></span> 08:48, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Umm, they haven't given permission. I got the go ahead from a layer at Copyright Australia who said that we are right to use images that are in the public domain off their website.

<li>Moral rights are most certainly not a silly european idea. The moral right of the author of a work to be recognised as such should be upheld even for public domain works. The fact that Shakespeare's plays are in the public domain does not give me the right to pass myself off as the author of Romeo and Juliet. But in the case of these photos, the NLA are not the author. All the NLA did is archive someone else's photo, scan it in, whack a border on it, and credit themselves. They have earned no moral rights in doing so. On the contrary, one could argue that the NLA's practice of tagging public domain images as though they are the NLA's property contravenes the moral rights of the author. It can certainly be seen as an attempt to defraud the public of their copy rights. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnottygobble_bf70.html" title="User:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> | <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Talk</a> 23:06, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Some recent developments which administrators may want to keep an eye on:</dd>
</dl>
<p>A recent edit lead me to investigate a little further with some interesting results. The new version of this article was created by <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Foley_8a4f.html" title="User:David Foley">User:David Foley</a>. An annon user with IP 203.51.162.131 removed the Not verified claiming that it was verified in a "list of 1800's western victorian towns". <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Foley_8a4f.html" title="User:David Foley">User:David Foley</a> claims to have read about it in "a book". IP 203.51.162.131 was also used to create some vandalism/creative editing on the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton%2C_Victoria_3fab.html" title="Hamilton, Victoria">Hamilton, Victoria</a> page on 26 Oct 2005. Earlier that day, two other edits were made by User:Millions and IP 143.238.48.232 Among the edits was a claim that a local boy named <b>David Foley</b> shared a name with a Canadian actor, and a photo, claiming to the that of David Foley was added. I wonder whether <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Foley_8a4f.html" title="User:David Foley">User:David Foley</a> and User:Millions aren't sockpupets, using PC from home and school. Although I'm fairly sure this is a hoax, if there really was a town called Davido and if the article was written by a kid with a creative imagination then it would be nice to tidy it up and keep the stub. <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 13:08, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>After a couple of reverts taking away the <i>not verified</i> template, I left a note within the artocle for the phontom editor asking him (or her) to use the talk page instead of leaving notes in the edit history. He or she then left a note saying citing the following text book: <i>Broome, Richard and Frost, Alan. The Colonial Experience: The Port Phillip District, 1834-1850</i>. The book exists in Google. Cnwb, if you have time, could you look into it while you're at the Library on the weekend. If it turns out to be true then I think we may have done a good thing by not scaring off a newbie and teaching him/her about citing sources and how to use the talk page. If it is a hoax then I'm sorry for wasting your time. <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 13:40, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The book cited by the editor, <i>The Colonial Experience: the Port Phillip District 1834-1850</i> seems to be a school textbook, consisting mainly of diary entries of Victorian pioneers, covering the timespan 1834-1850 (obviously). The Davido article states that the town's active period was between 1867-1871 (beyond the timeframe of the textbook). There is no index in the book, and so I scanned the pages for mention of Davido - but there seemed to be nothing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I checked the indexes of numerous books on nineteenth century Victoria, particularly those covering the Hamilton area, and found no mention of the town. I also checked the index volumes of the <i>Victorian Hisorical Journal</i>, which dates back to 1911, and this also revealed no mention of Davido.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, in the genealogy room, I found Angus B. Watson's excellent and addictive book <i>Lost &amp; Almost Forgotten Towns of Colonial Victoria: A Comprehensive Analysis of Census Results for Victoria 1841-1901</i>. This book includes all towns and villages as defined by the Government Statist for collection of Victorian censuses from 1841 to 1901. This includes settlements of as few as 13 people, yet there was no mention of Davido, which the article claims had a population of 1,500.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My conclusion is that the article is most definitely a hoax. If anyone wants to put this up for AfD, feel free to use the information I've just supplied. -- <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 06:26, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne-Sydney_rivalry_ab50.html" title="Melbourne-Sydney rivalry">Melbourne-Sydney rivalry</a></span></h2>
<p>Now I'm sure everyone has heard of the "legendary" rivalry between these two cities, and it has been suggested before that we create an article about it. I would love to create said article, but the problem is, while everyone seems to agree that there is, (or at least was), a rivalry between the two, (there's no denying it was the reason <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> was built—"I want to be capital!" "No, <b>I</b> want to be capital!"), it seems to be one of those things which is very hard to define. So far, all I've been able to think of is a vague introduction. What kind of encyclopedic content could go in an article about The Rivalry, without it degenerating into a "My city is better" contest? Besides Canberra, what actual events are there which can be attributed to it? What, in fact, caused it in the first place? (Besides the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Gold_Rush_59a3.html" title="Victorian Gold Rush">Gold Rush</a>.) Or is there no hope in making an article out of something like this? Comments are welcome...</p>

<p>My understanding of the background is as follows.</p>
<p>At foundation, a deal was done in which the site for Canberra would be slightly closer to Sydney than Melbourne, but while Canberra was being built, Melbourne would basically be the seat of Government. Which was good for Melbourne, while it lasted. Another deal done at federation was tarrifs and inter-state subsidies. Because Melbourne was the industrial heart, it did well out of tarrifs, while they lasted. The roll-back of tarrifs hit Melbourne disproportionately, but it, along with Sydney, has had to keep funding the smaller states. (NSW pays $13B in GST and gets back $10B. Don't know the figures for Vic.)</p>
<p>Having lived in Melbourne, my experience is that Melbourne Sydney rivalry is real. Living in Sydney as I now do, my experiences is that Sydney Melbourne rivaly almost doesn't exist. PK said that it's Sydney, or the bush, and most Sydney siders would agree with him. They only thing they disagree on is where Sydney stops and the bush starts.</p>

<p>I feel that Melbourne-Sydney rivalry is something the media likes to beat up on. But then again, I live in Sydney. I wasn't even 100% certain that Canberra was the result of Melbourne-Sydney rivalry or whether some of the less populous states may have had reservations about the capital being in one of the two largest cities. <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Canberra_b30d.html#Choice_for_capital_city_location" title="History of Canberra">History of Canberra#Choice for capital city location</a> puts forward yet another theory, that several states had different preferences for the capital, rather than only NSW and Victoria having opinions.</p>
<p>Some other potential examples of rivalry may be the hosting of "events" (eg sporting events), attracting certain businesses (eg film studios), or building (bio)technology hubs. But that involves several cities, not just Melbourne and Sydney. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 12:21, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As a Sydneysider, I can proudly say it is better than Melbourne. By far. And this is not very encyclopedic, but earlier this year a terrorist (with an apparently australian accent) made threats to melbourne specifically, to which some sydney news reporters seemed not to be happy about. Their reports were given with a hint of disdain or disappointment because the threats were not made towards the larger Sydney. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallchef_4000.html" title="User:Ballchef">Ballchef</a> 12:33, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Andjam, I think you're right about the smaller states not wanting to see either Melbourne or Sydney gain the capital. Remember too that the senate was originally intended to represent states rights, and is heavily weighted towards the smaller states. Yes, all the capitals compete for prestige events, but Sydney somehow feels less desperate (if I can use that word) to win. Winning or losing any individual event just doesn't make so much difference to us - after all, we're still Sydney. Who cares?</p>
<p>As <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Freedman_2d10.html" title="Tim Freedman">Tim Freedman</a> from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whitlams_339f.html" title="The Whitlams">The Whitlams</a> sang, "you've gotta love this city, for its body, not its brain". And it's true. This is an absolutely drop dead beautiful city, but it isn't always real deep, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>And Ballchef, don't get too upset about the terrorists. They almost certainly meant <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_%28Florida%29_f352.html" title="Melbourne (Florida)">Melbourne (Florida)</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Melbourne (disambiguation)">some other Melbourne</a>.

<dd>They're all fairly one-sided though. Can a rivalry be one-sided?

<dd>I agree. There's more parochialism in Australia than just the Melbourne-Sydney rivalry. As a frequent visitor to SA, I've noticed there's a certain attitude towards Victorians (at least in my experience), which came to a head when we stole the Grand Prix. But even still, there are TV ads in SA which play on this attitude. A beer ad comes to mind - something about Vics coming to SA and thinking there are no pubs (?). --<a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 00:11, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's definately rivalry mentality surviving in SA with regards to Vic ("kick a Vic"), but it died in Victoria some time ago. Vics are fixated on Sydney now. And you didn't <i>steal</i> the Grand Prix, we lent it to you so we could watch you fall on your faces :P!.

<li>Sydney-Melbourne rivalry definitely was an essential factor in the Constitution providing that the capital be in NSW but over 100 miles from Sydney. I refer to this paragraph on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Reid_c59d.html" title="George Reid">George Reid</a> in his article on the PMs website see <a href="http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/meetpm.asp?pmId=5&amp;pageName=before" class="external autonumber" title="http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/meetpm.asp?pmId=5&amp;pageName=before" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. "The Federation impasse was resolved at a ‘secret’ premiers’ conference at Melbourne’s Windsor Hotel, opposite the Spring Street Parliament House, held over six days from 29 January 1899. The compromise clause proposed by Tasmanian Premier Edward Braddon meant the Commonwealth must return to the States a proportion of all tariff and duties. To Reid’s satisfaction, the ongoing battle between Victoria and New South Wales over the siting of the national capital was also settled. Under the compromise, the site would be in New South Wales, but not less than 100 miles from Sydney." The constitution had previously failed to win a minimum level of approval at a referendum in 1898 with Reid earning the nickname of Yes/No Reid due to his equivocal position. The location of the capital led to the revised constitution passing in 1899. For that reason alone, Sydney-Melbourne rivalry is worth an article.</li>

<dd>It really does depend on where you live. When living in Victoria, we bemoan to the north, however when I was living in SA, we'd pick on the Victorians. I'm sure the Tasmanian's have their own issues with the Victorians as well. Having never been that far up north, I didn't even know a QLD v NSW rivalry existed.

<p>I thought that might be an objection to the design, but I disagree that it is harder edit. Hiving off sections to separate pages and transcluding them avoids users having to navigate through masses of code to just update a list. That's one of the reasons I'm thinking of creating a discussion section (or using a metatemplate for the top section). Also, three of the boxes are shared with The Australia Portal. I thought people might object to transclusion due to a preference for centralisation. Adding watch links to individual boxes may mitigate that concern. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 05:36, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not very fond of the new version, as it strikes me as being fairly unnecessary; a solution without a problem. For starters, <i>please</i> don't remove the discussion from this page and bury it on a rarely read talk page or subpage; it would get rid of the best venue we have for discussing Australian issues and projects, not to mention the to-do lists. I really fail to see the point of doing this; nothing is gained, and important things are lost.</p>
<p>Moreover, the present version already buries the notices in favour of things that were already easy to find in the earlier version, or belong somewhere else. Firstly, I don't think we need the two templates from the Australian Wikiportal page; if we want to read them, we can watchlist that page as well. Secondly, there's a lot of wasted space; the archives don't need to receive half the monitor space without scrolling, and the RfA box doesn't need to be anywhere that big. However, if you must go ahead with this, how about expunging the (useless) top two boxes, as well as the ITN, merging the archives and stub templates section in with the projects, and cutting the page back to four boxes (Projects, AfDs, RfAs, COTF). As it is, though, it's just overkill, and risks smothering some of the most useful aspects of this board. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 07:59, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>(<i>After edit conflict</i>)Perhaps you should take another look. Discussion is most certainly not <i>expunged</i> in the new design; part of the reason I bothered with this at all was because discussion on AWNB at present is buried beneath a ton of notices. I was merely floating the idea of creating a discussion page - the design doesn't do that yet. The whole point of it is to condense the notices in an attractive fashion so discussion can be more clearly found. All that is presently on AWNB (aside from the un-maintained to-do list) is in the new version, but formatted in a way that makes it IMO very much easier to read.</dd>
<dd>There are three boxes used from the Australia Portal: Projects, ACTOF and In the news. Of what was already on the page, In the news is the only new addition. As for the archives, I was just experimenting. That box is actually supposed to be used to provide a welcome message, but I wasn't feeling creative enough to write anything. I would note, also, that the archives are more compact than they are presently. But I doubt they'll stay there.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 08:13, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While this page has a lot of details up above the notices, it clearly hasn't smothered discussion; the new page, though, seems to change things like the AfD candidates from being a minor note to the focus of the page. This is reinforced by adding things like the news box: in effect, you're changing this from being the Australian answer to the Village Pump, Reference Desk, and Goings-on, to just being the latter. Furthermore, I'm not particularly amused that the first time anyone raised any issues with this page was to completely reorganise its focus, rather than sitting down and seeing what we can do about them (i.e. fixing the to-do list, rather than killing it). <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 08:27, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that the page will impact on servers. We could have an edit link in each box, but without transcluding, it would be to edit the AWNB as a whole.</dd>
<dd>Ambi, I really don't believe that the design is re-organising AWNB's purpose in any way (and I know that as the Wikipedian who established this board, you're more likely to see this than others). Nor do I see how Afd candidates will become the <i>focus of the page</i>. If anything, I am emphasising the aspect of the page you belive most important: discussion. Which, I might add, is in direct contrast to many other regional notice boards that have decentralised and shifted discussion elsewhere, and maintained the notice board for notices only.</dd>
<dd>And I'm not resigned to <i>killing</i> the to-do list (which remains linked in the design). I think there is a legitimate argument for a list (even if it does distract from the purpose of a "notice board"). But it had become bloated and out-of-date, and was not necessary for the proposed design.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 09:16, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that's infinitely better: it simply makes the existing content much more appealing to the eye rather than changing its focus. Once the massive to-do list was properly trimmed (back to, say, five articles in each category), it'd be a much more effective introduction and wouldn't take up *too* much screen space. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 12:32, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Condensing the top/notices part of this page seems like a good idea.</li>
<li>The to-do list should stay, as a separate conversation on improving it may start. In fact the articles-to-create part is reasonably active, the main problem with the rest is lack of guidance on when to add or remove items.</li>
<li>A concern I have with transclusion is that the subpages have to be on a watchlist, meaning watchers never see the whole page (eg a section <b>not</b> on their watchlist), and it becomes a set of unrelated pages.</li>
<li>To <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a>'s comment <i>I'm not particularly amused that the first time anyone raised any issues with this page was to completely reorganise its focus, rather than sitting down and seeing what we can do about them</i>, Cyberjunkie and Bainer have <b>not</b> completely reorganised this page, they've started a discussion and shown examples of what a redesigned page <b>could</b> look like to compare.</li>
<li>Should the stub links be to the categories as well/instead of to the templates? I might <i>copy</i> the template from here, but would never <i>link</i> to the template from here, but might browse what I can expand.</li>

<p>See here also. In this one the top boxes have been compacted into one, archives have been moved to discussion, and a shrunken to-do list is included.

<dd>"To improve or expand" is still at least twice the size it needs to be.

<dd>FTR, I've trimmed the main list down to twelve in each column; it was way too huge and maintainable before, and even now it still looks large. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 01:52, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If by <i>"we should have is candidates for featured article/image"</i> you mean we should have boxes for them, I have floated this thought above, along with peer review. Alternatively, given that Austalian candidates are only on RfA and FAC every now and then, the RfA section could be substituted for a FAC section when need.</dd>
<dd>Ambi, good work in trimming it down, and I agree that it's still too large. If one of the designs is implemented, the to-do list will be smaller with the removal of the ACOTF notice. But to shrink it further, I think we need to do the same thing to each section as has been done to "need images" - that is, encourage users to go to the complete list (which I think is under-utilised). --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 02:17, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it at all possible that we can do this thing where clicking on a link causes it to expand within the page (without reloading)? I don't know what it's called but I've seen it on some messageboards. It's a way of easily hiding/showing information without reloading or having separate pages. I haven't seen it on WP so maybe we don't have the capabilities for it... it'd be nice if we did, though. Something like <a href="http://www.onlinetools.org/tools/domcollapse/" class="external text" title="http://www.onlinetools.org/tools/domcollapse/" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Users without Javascript just get the whole lot expanded, otherwise you can collapse/expand sections as you please. <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 01:32, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AFAIK, Wikipedia does not have this capability. <i>However</i>, we have just swipped a feature from the German Wikipedia that allows us to <b>hide</b> templates in the same manner as users can <b>hide</b> the contents menu.

<dd>That one works much better than the other version. The only change I would make would be to take the general discussion out of the table, so that it's just on the normal background, just to distinguish the discussion from the header stuff.

<dd>I don't mind this design, but I prefer just having a bulleted list of "current event" articles rather than the prose "in the news" (ITN). Also, I would prefer to put all the largely static content at the end of the page, well at least the list of specialised stubs, and the archives links. And I don't go much on the colour scheme, but that's a minor quibble. :) <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 14:16, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As well as keeping tabs of Aussie articles on peer review and featured article candidates, I'd be in favour of having the option of peer review by Aussies prior to submitting it to the general wikipedia audience. Also an Australian equivalent of an Article Improvement Drive would be good (unless Australian Collaboration of the Fortnight is supposed to handle that). Another thing that might be good is a "statement of intent", where individual contributors can note their intent to make article X a featured article (something that could be culled if that individual fails to contribute to the article in the past month or so). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 10:55, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's not a bad idea - the "to review" section of the to-do list is meant to serve this purpose, but doesn't do a very good job of it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Possible vandal with no user page</span></h2>
<p>Hi, this is probably not the right place to ask this question... I have reverted a few edits by 58.104.82.22 and then by CandyNetwork2005 that looked like vandalism in <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Positioning_System_428c.html" title="Global Positioning System">Global Positioning System</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Brownless_e408.html" title="Billy Brownless">Billy Brownless</a>. They look like the same person (judging by the edits). I wanted to leave a friendy message on the users talk page, but they don't seem to have a user page at all. Does this mean the user has been deleted or something? Thanks <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanBailey_065a.html" title="User:IanBailey">IanBailey</a> 06:36, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hate to start another copyright discussion, but seeing the SLV's <a href="http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/about/using/copying/permission/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/about/using/copying/permission/index.html" rel="nofollow">reproduction permission legalese</a>, I have to ask - do they have any legal basis for that? If something is PD, then surely a photo or reproduction of it must be too, if it is not a new artistic creation but just a mere reproduction... <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 06:54, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The SLV claims to own its images, but that is not correct. It owns the physical version of the images it holds, and if you steal those physical objects that is theft. But ownership of the image <i>per se</i> is a different matter. Ownership of the right to reproduce an image is called copyright, and we have already established that there is no copyright on images created in Australia before 1955. By placing those images on its website, the SLV (and the NLA etc) place them at the disposal of the public and they cannot require anyone to ask their permission to reproduce them. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 07:08, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>They say: <i>It must be stressed that obtaining permission to reproduce an item is not the same as copyright. The State Library of Victoria often does not hold the copyright for items in its collections. In such cases it is the responsibility of the author or publisher to obtain the consent in writing of the copyright holder.</i> This is wrong?</dd>
<dd>It seems to me: Only the copyright holder can license a work. If a work is in the PD, there is no copyright holder (or, everyone holds copyright collectively) and therefore no one can license the work... which is what SLV is trying to do. Would that be an accurate assessment? <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 07:33, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

There is a long discussion on <a href="../../../p/d/-/Template_talk%7EPD-Australia_8da0.html" title="Template talk:PD-Australia">Template talk:PD-Australia</a>. As far as I am concerned places like the SLV and NLA can claim till they're blue in the face that they have sort of copyright hold over the work, but as stated before they do not have any hold over works created before 1955. end of story. I will reference them as the source when uploading (and yes uploaded to the commons .. thanks bainer) but that's all. <a href="../../../n/o/m/User%7ENomadtales_33b6.html" title="User:Nomadtales">Nomadtales</a> 08:27, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Live music photos</span></h2>
<p>I've been in email discussion with the photographer Sam Bala, who has a bunch of live music photos on <a href="http://www.nakeddwarf.com.au/" class="external free" title="http://www.nakeddwarf.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nakeddwarf.com.au/</a> and also his personal site <a href="http://www.cheesenugget.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.cheesenugget.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheesenugget.com/</a> (which only seems to work occasionally for me). He has very generously agreed to license any photos we want to use under GFDL. This is a good opportunity to replace some fair use images with some great free ones. I'm going to send him a list soon of ones we'd like, so he can send me the hi-res versions. If anyone wants to have a look at either of the sites (he has some non-music ones on his website, but I can't view them :( ), if you see some images you think would be suitable, drop me a line on <a href="../../../p/f/c/User_talk%7EPfctdayelise_a4c0.html" title="User talk:Pfctdayelise">my Talk page</a> and I will make sure I ask about them.</p>
<p>I haven't found a way to find all his photos on the nakeddwarf site, but his are marked with (C) Sam Bala so if you see some, you will know. (eg. he took all these at <a href="http://www.nakeddwarf.com.au/nd/photos/sydney/come_together__1" class="external text" title="http://www.nakeddwarf.com.au/nd/photos/sydney/come_together__1" rel="nofollow">Sydney Come Together festival</a>)</p>
