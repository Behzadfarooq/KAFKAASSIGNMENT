The first question asked whether <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> should become a <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a> with a <a href="../../../p/r/e/President.html" title="President">President</a> appointed by <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Australia_68dd.html" title="Parliament of Australia">Parliament</a>, a <a href="../../../b/i/-/Bi-partisan_appointment_republican_model.html" title="Bi-partisan appointment republican model">bi-partisan appointment model</a> which had previously been decided at a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_Convention_%28Australia%29_6853.html" title="Constitutional Convention (Australia)">Constitutional Convention</a> in February 1998.

<p>For some years, opinion polls had suggested that a majority of the electorate favoured republicanism,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>) but still the referendum was comfortably defeated. The majority of analysis has advanced two main reasons for the referendum defeat:</p>
<p>Firstly, Australians have traditionally been cautious about proposed constitutional change: only eight of 43 referenda since <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> have been approved by a majority of voters in a majority of states (as they must be to succeed). In <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Robert_Menzies_3207.html" title="Sir Robert Menzies">Sir Robert Menzies</a>' words, "to get an affirmative vote from the Australian people on a referendum proposal is one of the labours of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hercules.html" title="Hercules">Hercules</a>."<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Second, public opinion was not (and still is not) divided in a simple yes/no manner. The major opinion groups were:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Traditional monarchists</b> who held their beliefs largely on principled and/or sentimental attachment to the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a>, in part based on traditional associations with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> and a personal identification with <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a> and her family. Many were older or from rural rather than urban areas.</li>
<li><b>Pragmatic monarchists</b> who maintained that, whatever the argued weaknesses of the current system, it also had many strengths; following the motto of "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". The view of this group was that constitutional monarchy provides the basis for stable <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democratic</a> government, with the Governor-General (the monarch's nominal representative) acting as an impartial, non-political "umpire" of the political process. Many claimed that republican government would lead to instability or even <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship.html" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a> and result in an undesirable politicisation of the office of head of state.</li>
<li><b>Minimal change republicans</b> who aimed to replace the monarch with an appointed Australian head of state, but otherwise maintain the current system as unchanged as possible. Within this group, there were a small group of supporters of the ultra-minimalist <a href="../../../m/c/g/McGarvie_Model_33dc.html" title="McGarvie Model">McGarvie Model</a>, but generally the favoured model of these groups was appointment by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of Parliament.</li>
<li><b>Progressive republicans</b> who aimed to replace the monarch with a popularly elected head of state.</li>
<li><b>Radical republicans</b>, who saw the minimal change option as purely <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aesthetics.html" title="Aesthetics">cosmetic</a>, and desired comprehensive revision to the current Westminister-based system. This was easily the smallest major group, but prominent in the debate.</li>
<li><b>Tactical voters</b>, who took a long-term view and voted against their inclinations. Many traditional and pragmatic monarchists perceived a weight of inevitability and voted "yes" to the minimalist republic in order to avoid a more radical republic. Many sentimental republicans voted "no" in the hope of a more radical or populist proposal winning a future referendum.</li>
<li><b>The Uncommitted</b> — as in all electorates, a large proportion of the electorate remained unattached to either side. (Uncommitted '<a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing_vote.html" title="Swing vote">swinging voters</a>' are often the decisive force in shaping referenda results and election outcomes in democracies worldwide.)</li>

<p>The "yes" campaign was divided in detail but nevertheless managed to present a fairly united and coherent message, and was notable for unlikely alliances between traditional opponents - former <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor</a> Prime Minister <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gough_Whitlam_3876.html" title="Gough Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> and former <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal</a> Prime Minister <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Fraser_2bbe.html" title="Malcolm Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a> gave joint statements, for example. Many other prominent Australians also endorsed the yes vote - which, however, led to claims that the movement was "elitist" in sentiment and led by politicians rather than people. Viewing the case for a republic as fairly self-evident and broadly supported by the Australian populace, their advertising concentrated mainly on the positive symbolism of the republican case.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_republic_referendum%2C_1999.html" title="Edit section: The 'No' side">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The 'No' side</span></h3>
<p>The organised "no" campaign was a mixture of monarchist groups such as <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australians_for_Constitutional_Monarchy_eb91.html" title="Australians for Constitutional Monarchy">Australians for Constitutional Monarchy</a> (ACM) and the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Monarchist_League_8468.html" title="Australian Monarchist League">Australian Monarchist League</a>. Additionally it included some republican groups who did not feel that the proposed model was satisfactory, in particular they thought the people should elect the President. Headed by <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerry_Jones_caaa.html" title="Kerry Jones">Kerry Jones</a> of ACM, the "no" campaign concentrated on the alleged flaws of the model on offer, considering those who supported the "yes" push as "elites", and skilfully managing to appeal both to those apprehensive about the change on one hand, and those feeling the model didn't go far enough on the other. Their advertising emphasised voting no to "this republic", implying to direct-election supporters that a model more to their preferences was likely to be put in the future.</p>
<p>The common elements within the no campaign were the view that the model proposed was undemocratic and would lead to a "politician's republic". "No" campaigners called for further consultation, while remaining non-specific on what steps were needed to ensure this.</p>

<p>The questions of being a republic put to electors was whether they approved of:</p>
<p>A proposed law: <i>To alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by a President appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament.</i></p>

<p>Electors were also asked to vote on a second question at the 1999 referendum which asked whether they approved of:</p>
<p>A proposed law: <i>To alter the Constitution to insert a preamble.</i></p>
<p>The preamble would then have read</p>

<p>In order to pass, each question required a majority 'Yes' vote, as well as a majority of states (four or more) to have a majority 'Yes' vote. Voters in the territories only count towards the national vote. In practice, the requirement is to carry four states, as there has never been a referendum which carried four states and failed to pass, whereas there have been several that gained an overall majority but failed to carry four states. On this basis, the margin of failure can validly be regarded as the margin in the fourth state, and so the effective referendum yes vote was only 41.48%</p>

<p>Roughly 55% of the nation voted "no" and all states voted "no". This was broadly as expected: the real surprise was the distribution of the votes. As expected, traditionally conservative states and rural areas were strongholds for the constitutional monarchy; but wealthy city electorates mostly voted "yes", and blue-ribbon Labor seats in working-class suburbs voted "no". The failure of the opinion pollsters to pick up these trends has caused many people to question their methodology.</p>

<p>The outcome was met with angst by the republicans. Some, notably Australian Republican Movement president <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Turnbull_7c1f.html" title="Malcolm Turnbull">Malcolm Turnbull</a>, spoke bitterly in the aftermath, blaming Prime Minister Howard in particular for their defeat. Despite the hopes of radical republicans such as <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Cleary_00c4.html" title="Phil Cleary">Phil Cleary</a>, the referendum defeat was generally viewed as a setback for the republican cause and no further referenda on the subject were mooted by the Howard government.</p>
<p>ACM leader <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerry_Jones_caaa.html" title="Kerry Jones">Kerry Jones</a> called for citizens to accept the result and go forward "as a united nation". In recent years some republicans have called for a second referendum, proposing either a different style of presidency or a more generalised "republic or monarchy" question as a "first step" to establishing a new Head of State system.</p>

<p>On the face of things, with republican models of one form or another winning a majority in opinion polls, it might have been expected that the republican referendum would pass comfortably. However, few mainstream republicans were wholly agreed about the proposed mechanisms for replacing the monarch and Governor-General with either an appointed head of state (which was widely criticised as being undemocratic), or with an elected head of state (which was widely criticised as moving Australia away from the proven <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_System_853e.html" title="Westminster System">Westminster System</a> toward an American-style <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidential_system.html" title="Presidential system">presidential system</a>, even though many <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_republic.html" title="Parliamentary republic">Parliamentary republics</a> directly elect non-executive Presidents).</p>
<p>The former model (with an appointed head) was the one endorsed by the Constitutional Convention and put forward at the referendum. It was broadly supported by both minimalist and progressive republicans, including almost all <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor</a> and some conservative politicians. It was opposed by royalists of both kinds, although republicans claim that some voted for it as the Convention's recommended model because they saw it as the model least likely to succeed. ACM delegates at the Convention, following their policy of "No Republic" abstained from that vote, and in doing so allowed the model to pass. The radical republicans were ambivalent, reasoning that a simple cosmetic removal of the monarchy would make more far-reaching and substantial changes impossible.</p>
