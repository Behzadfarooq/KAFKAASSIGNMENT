<li>It seems to be very time-specific, median property values can change (and wildly!) in a particular suburb. Is someone going to go to all of the hundreds of Brisbane suburb articles to change all of these every time a new survey is released?</li>
<li>Are property values really encyclopædic anyway? Wikipedia is not a real estate guide.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I'm the only one that is thinking this way, I'll shut my mouth. I really don't think they have a place here though.</p>

<dd>Hi. I would like to invite you to post this at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Australian_Place_177f.html" title="Template talk:Infobox Australian Place">Template talk:Infobox Australian Place</a>. The transition to a new infobox for suburbs towns, and local government areas has been taken in an effort to standardize the look and data included in Australian infoboxes. A look at the template's talk page will show just how many variances there were. The fields to include in the new infobox were debated before the template's creation and implementation. The property value field was a feature of the South Australian (?) infobox and after debate a decision was made to include it in the new box. Whether you will find a great level of support for removing it, I am not sure, but the discussion will be more fruitful there then here IMO. BTW the template development was done as a part of this WP (through <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australian_places_223a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian places">WikiProject Australian places</a>), and you will find that it's development was quite open to opinion from all contributors. The implementation is being carried out mainly through a bot that was developed to specifically carry out the transition. That is why it appears that it is a 'few people' doing the changes. <a href="../../../s/a/u/User%7ESauliH_feee.html" title="User:SauliH">SauliH</a> 02:54, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's a bad thing that it's happening, quite the contrary, it's a good, very flexible infobox, and full props to whoever took the initiative to develop it. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 09:02, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's useful if they're all taken at about the same time, although the risk of redundancy and out-of-date info and so on causes problems as you have highlighted. However, it enables me to see right away, for instance, that Banyo and Ascot are quite different suburbs despite being close together (as a Perth person Brisbane is interesting for me as it's the Australian city I know least about) <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 03:03, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have an issue with the use of median property prices produced for/by real estate agencies. The methods they use are are based on sales only ie total sales/qty sold over a given period as such it becomes bias to type and quantity of housing sold. Take a Perth riverside burb like Bassendean that has a broad range of housing, from riverfront 1/2 acre mansions to 1950's-1960 1/4 acre asbestos houses or new 700sqm high desnity housing. All have the same land title, yet if any one type statistically dominates the sales during the period then the median price become bias.</dd>
<dd>Given this what encyclopedic value does the median price actually contribute to the article? <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 04:07, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I hadn't thought of this, but I guess it's true too. The suburb I used in my example is about 2/3rds middle-class detached housing, and 1/3 housing commission. However, because the housing commission is almost all rented by the government instead of bought and sold, the sample will be biased towards the nicer areas of the suburb. The median value would be dragged down a bit if the housing commission areas were included, but there's no way to objectively measure their value using real estate figures. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 12:12, 4 December 2006 (UTC).</dd>

I had put it up for discussion of removal, which is what the vote was for. At best it received weak oppose to the removal. I still am not sure whether it is a great field to have or not. Probably lean on the remove. Gnangarra has a point, which we could get around if we could use a more stable indicator of property value. <a href="../../../s/a/u/User%7ESauliH_feee.html" title="User:SauliH">SauliH</a> 05:43, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Austalian hospitals</span></h2>
<p>I recently upgraded the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Hospital_46e7.html" title="Template:Infobox Hospital">Template:Infobox Hospital</a> making it more generic and less US-centric (I'm British), and I need some advice please whether I've correctly coded and given guidance on the 'HealthCare' parameter as it applies for Australia. At its broadest this parameter is meant to distinguish "Private" from "Public" hospitals (in US also <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charity_Hospital_d157.html" title="Charity Hospital">Charity Hospital</a>), and for the major English Speaking countries also automatically insert wikilinks to the relevant public health system. In the UK this therefore takes the value of "NHS" and will display "Public <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Health_Service_ad67.html" title="National Health Service">NHS</a>". Likewise in Canada apparently virtually all hospitals are public and specifying "Medicare" will link to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicare_%28Canada%29_2c12.html" title="Medicare (Canada)">Medicare (Canada)</a> and so display "Public <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicare_%28Canada%29_2c12.html" title="Medicare (Canada)">Medicare (Canada)</a>", or the relevant Province's scheme if there is a separate wiki article (e.g. see <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_General_Hospital_0c65.html" title="Toronto General Hospital">Toronto General Hospital</a>).</p>
<p>My question therefore is does the same terminology and its usage apply for Australia, i.e. just as all public UK hospitals are under the NHS and for Canada under their Medicare, are all public Australian hospitals under Medicare - or is Medicare (Australia) only for those of lower financial means and everyone else needs cover their public hospital usage via separate private health insurance (i.e. more like the US system)&#160;? (if the latter is the case then public Australian hospitals would need to be described just as "Public")</p>

<dd>Yes, all Australian public hospitals are funded by Medicare. Well, sort of. They are funded by a bizarre combination of state government and federal government funding, which leads to all manner of wasteful cost-shifting and blame-reallocation. But it's still much more cost-efficient than what the Americans manage&#160;:) --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 00:19, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I could perhaps clarify some of the points Alec raised... I think the original question was whether ther should be separate articles for the council that governs a municipaliy, and the geographical area which falls within that municipality.</dd>
<dd>I think the question of "City of XYZ" vs "XYZ City Council" is largely solved by the official name of the LGA concerned, although this can add to confusion where "XYZ City Council" can also imply 'the council which governs XYZ". In either case, I think that all aspects of an LGA can be covered in one article unless there is sufficient information about the council, its history, politics, personalities etc to warrant a separate article. ... just my thoughts to get the ball rolling.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hobart/Tasmania WikiProject changes</span></h2>
<p>Hi everyone, SatuSuro suggested starting up a Tassie wikiproject - I responded by suggesting it be "merged" with the Hobart WikiProject. As a result, we now have <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Tasmania_9048.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Tasmania">Wikipedia:WikiProject Tasmania</a>, which covers all articles related to the state including all Hobart (and other city) articles. Some of the articles covered by WP:Hobart's were in other parts of the state anyway, so using the name 'Tasmania' is certainly more accurate. Longhair has assisted by fixing the {{<a href="../../../w/p/_/Template%7EWP_Australia_81e6.html" title="Template:WP Australia">WP Australia</a>}} talk page template to point to the new project; other links to the project will be fixed over the next day or so. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 02:42, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I'm listening to it now. Craig says whoever wrote the article about him is making him look way smarter than he is, and that no way did he get a UAI of 99.95. He said he changed it and someone put it back. Chris says that he corrected the year he was born and the degree he studied at uni, and that too was reverted. They say they are amazed that there are people who are watching articles like this seemingly 24 hours a day. They noted the <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag on the <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/Today_Today_56e4.html" title="Today Today">Today Today</a></i> article about them having the cricket on in the background of the <i>Bloody Sunday</i> radio show, and said they could confirm this was true... but then they are concerned that their word is not reliable enough and that a university professor will have to look into the matter and confirm it. -<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 11:50, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is knowing whether they're taking the piss or not. Saying that working on Channel 9 was "his life's dream" would send a red flag up for me, if I didn't know any better. Their comments about having to have a university professor verify their dates of birth before being inserted do have a point though. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 22:11, 8 January 2007 (UTC).

<dd>It's funny ... with that comment about the uni professor they are taking the piss .. but its not far from the truth .. when a known comedian/media satirist tells you information specifically so it can go in their Wikipedia article, you do need a 3rd party to verify it. I had a look at the history of Chris' article - the year of birth was added in August 2006 sometime and hasn't been changed since then - so I'm not sure when he was doing his "testing". -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 23:27, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is an absolute copyright violation. We can use the Dictionary of Australian Biography because it's from the first half of the 20th century and is thus out of copyright.

<p>If anyone has a bit of spare time on their hands this summer, it would be lovely if someone could take a look over our article on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Askin_3617.html" title="Robert Askin">Robert Askin</a>. For a fairly significant politician, this article is atrocious - it covers his rise reasonably, then goes into his pro-development policies, and then spends ten (!) paragraphs detailing rumors of his corruption. It doesn't even have a single word on how he actually left politics, and only a couple of paragraphs about what he actually did as Premier. I'd try and fix it myself, but I don't have access to the necessary resources at the moment, so it'd be lovely if someone else could have a go at fixing it up some. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 06:18, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I ask myself whether there's a legitimate use for this category, and the answer, unfortunately, is "yes". This category is a legitimate area of interest and research, and can legitimately hold articles such as <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_Opportunity_Commission_ce88.html" title="Equal Opportunity Commission">Equal Opportunity Commission</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_Discrimination_Act_1975_2f20.html" title="Racial Discrimination Act 1975">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/o/Koowarta_v_Bjelke-Petersen_e49b.html" title="Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen">Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fight_Dem_Back_7cce.html" title="Fight Dem Back">Fight Dem Back</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alas_Poor_Yagan_2a95.html" title="Alas Poor Yagan">Alas Poor Yagan</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_van_Tongeren_d445.html" title="Jack van Tongeren">Jack van Tongeren</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Cronulla_riots_6c1c.html" title="2005 Cronulla riots">2005 Cronulla riots</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambing_Flat_riots_9f2a.html" title="Lambing Flat riots">Lambing Flat riots</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/p/Explorers%27_Monument_34b5.html" title="Explorers' Monument">Explorers' Monument</a>, etc. In all these cases there is a broad consensus and understanding that the subject involves or is related to racism in Australia.</p>
<p>I think the problem here is the overzealous categorisation. I notice, for example, that <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bulletin_f57c.html" title="The Bulletin">The Bulletin</a></i> is categorised into it. Surely there's a potential legal issue for the Wikimedia Foundation right there. I say keep the category, but largely depopulate it, and put some effort into crafting strict but sensible admission criteria.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I'd concur that this is an unfortunately needed category. And as far as <i>The Bulletin</i> goes, if the Packers' want the kudos of publishing Australia's oldest magazine they have to live with the fact that it once was an obscenely racist publication with "Australia for the White Man" as a masthead! --<a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlf67_d959.html" title="User:Slf67">Steve <sub>(Slf67)</sub></a> <a href="../../../s/l/f/User_talk%7ESlf67_bed3.html" title="User talk:Slf67"><sup>talk</sup></a> 02:20, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do not think that such a category is useful in the first place, other than a label to slap on something. Secondly, racial matters and perceptions can be highly subjective, and as I said earlier, I do not want to see all the petty arguments for and against the category's inclusion in particular articles. To avoid potential headaches, and a neutrality mess, categories like these need to be given the flick. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_8597.html" title="User:Beneaththelandslide">michael</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBeneaththelandslide_de8f.html" title="User talk:Beneaththelandslide">talk</a></sup> 02:24, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the current category name can be seen to have pejorative undertones, but I believe a category of this nature is required. Perhaps we could refer to one of its parent categorys <a href="../../../p/o/l/Category%7EPolitics_and_race_d739.html" title="Category:Politics and race">Category:Politics and race</a> and extrapolate a new subcategory Category:Politics and race in Australia. However, the main issue, as Hesparian has pointed out, is to be very selective about the categorisation of articles. It is ludicrous, for instance, to place a geographic entity such as <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_Island%2C_Queensland_2087.html" title="Palm Island, Queensland">Palm Island, Queensland</a> in such a category, whereas an article titled 2004 Palm Island Riot would be suitable.--<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelburnian_8c45.html" title="User:Melburnian">Melburnian</a> 05:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Probably there were too many pages in the category. But that's a case for reviewing it, not for emptying it or removing it. Racism in Australia a completely suitable topic for a category.

<dd>Yeah simply cite the publication, date and page number as hard copy. Unfortunately some articles will be lost this way as not all of them actually go to print. We've had a number of problems with articles older than about 3 months which disappear never to be found again (not even in wayback) - I have generally endeavoured to use ABC and Fairfax links where possible for their durability. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 13:02, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, sorry to come late to the debate. I was the one who added the category Racism in Australia to the 2004 Palm Island death in custody entry, not having realised that it had been removed once previously. I'm looking forward to reading the link Golden Wattle put in above, but I would like to say first that the category wasn't added because it simply involved black people, and I definitely don't think the category is worthless. That to me would imply that either there is no racism in Australia worth mentioning, or that few people would be interested in reading entries falling under that category. As for whether the Palm Island riot was a racist event, I guess it depends who you ask. I have spent some time in Aboriginal communities over the past 12 months and there is not a doubt in their minds that the severe injuries sustained by Mulrunji were at the hands of the police; that the first pathology result attributing the injuries to a fall on the stairs was a cover-up; and that the use of SWAT teams against a community of unarmed men, women and children was an inappropriate use of force. Whether there were racist attitudes held by the police, police commissioner and pathologist involved depends on the likelihood that they would have taken similar action against a white man in custody. I think it unlikely, particularly given a lack of precedent with the SWAT involvement. Anyway, I will have a read of the previous discussion before saying any more. I'm all for coming up with an appropriate definition and strictly sticking to it. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto.mac_94e2.html" title="User:Sholto.mac">Sholto.mac</a> 04:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for commenting. My problem with adding this category to things like that particular article is that it's never clear whether the incident in question was motivated by racism. Unless Hurley can be proven to have yelled "Die Darkie!!!" as he repeatedly punched Domadgee in the spleen, I don't see how you can claim that it's 100% "racism in Australia". As it is, adding that category to things like that is merely speculation - something that has no real place on Wikipedia.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What to do with List of Australians?</span></h2>
<p>What to do with this article? It's been around a long time (created <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_23.html" title="September 23">September 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Australians&amp;oldid=305821" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Australians&amp;oldid=305821" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), and was probably once a useful index to Australian biographical articles. Today, I imagine the list is unmanagable and will never be anywhere near complete any time soon, if at all. The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_people_4823.html" title="Category:Australian people">Australian people</a> category and sub-category tree underneath manages the task much better IMHO.</p>
<p>What do others think about redirecting this list to Lists of Australian people, where a list of lists can be created and we do away with this list once and for all? -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a>\<sup><a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">talk</a></sup> 10:40, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Aboriginal Gods</span></h2>
<p>I see there is a category of <i>Aboriginal Gods</i> (and the term is also used in a number of articles). As far as I'm aware, no such thing exists. There are creator-spirits, or culture-heroes, or dreaming spirits, etc., but nothing that can really be called a <i>God</i> in the European sense. So I think this is rather misrepresenting Indigenous cultures, and is therefore disrespectful to those cultures. I'm happy to volunteer to do a big clean up to expunge the term, but before I start any flame-wars, does anybody disagree with this? <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayd8_849f.html" title="User:Rayd8">Rayd8</a> | <a href="../../../r/a/y/User_talk%7ERayd8_e4bf.html" title="User talk:Rayd8">User talk:Rayd8</a> 14:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the comments - you're right - it will be a lot of work. But we have to start somewhere. At present the representation of this whole area in Wikipedia is quite misleading, and will certainly be offensive to some Indigenous people. It's important to tread very carefully when you're dealing with a belief system with thousands of active adherents. And the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Aboriginal_mythology_a9ba.html" title="Australian Aboriginal mythology">Australian Aboriginal mythology</a> page also needs a lot of work! BTW can someone tell me if it would it be acceptable to Christians to have Jesus listed under "mythhology"? (This isn't rhetorical - I'm an atheist and I really don't know whether active Christians would consider that offensive). <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayd8_849f.html" title="User:Rayd8">Rayd8</a> | <a href="../../../r/a/y/User_talk%7ERayd8_e4bf.html" title="User talk:Rayd8">User talk:Rayd8</a> 03:05, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>many christians would view that as attempt to cast doubt on their beliefs. but i assume the main reason 'mythology' was used (apart from being fairly common usage, i think?) was, well, what else? until we can come up with something else i suppose we just have to pretend it's only meant to be descriptive?

<dd>Something like "Australian Aboriginal beliefs" would seem to cover the beliefs of all Aboriginal people, which includes more than indigenous beliefs. "<a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">Mythology</a>" as used in some areas of academia today seems to not comment on the historical truth of the stories, and in that sense wouldn't be offensive to anyone, but I suspect that most people would understand the more common meaning implying that the story has no basis in fact, making it hard to apply it to things with any sort of historical record. Having said that, I can't see anything better than "mythology" or perhaps "traditional beliefs". As for gods, I suspect the category was started out of ignorance and an attempt to fit in with the <a href="../../../g/o/d/Category%7EGods_by_culture_c7d1.html" title="Category:Gods by culture">Cat:Gods by culture</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/d/Category%7EGoddesses_by_culture_e91a.html" title="Category:Goddesses by culture">Cat:Goddesses by culture</a> categories. While "spirits" or "mythological beings" may be a better name, we will also need to address the question of how renamed category/ies should fit in this scheme. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 14:36, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for all the valuable comments. While <i>Mythology</i> has a technical non-pejorative meaning, I think some people will still interpret it as meaning <i>false beliefs</i>, which is obviously inappropriate for a belief system which has many adherents. The litmus test of whether Jesus could be regarded as <i>mythology</i> attracted a few interesting comments (some in private) which indicated that at least some Christians would be offended by the term. So "Australian Aboriginal beliefs" sounds pretty good to me right now. Any dissent from that? <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayd8_849f.html" title="User:Rayd8">Rayd8</a> | <a href="../../../r/a/y/User_talk%7ERayd8_e4bf.html" title="User talk:Rayd8">User talk:Rayd8</a> 10:05, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>yes, the suggested phrase is almost meaningless &amp; not in common usage. the term mythology is used in much of the relevant literature &amp; the sense in which it is being used can be explained on the relevent cat &amp; main article pages. that is if at all necessary, has anyone who might be offended acctually complained? expanding those rubbish stubs, although it does have to be done very carefully, would be far more useful.&#160;<span style="border: solid 1px black;"><a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font style="background:white;" color="black">&#160;<b>⇒ bsnowball</b>&#160;</font></a></span> 16:27, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The problem is that <i>much of the relevant literature</i> was written before the Anglo-Saxon authors had developed any respect for what is now acknowledged to be a living culture. Is anyone actually offended? Yes, very much so! This is why, for example, Mountford's classic work "Nomads of the Australian desert" had to be removed from bookshops after a legal injunction by Indigenous groups. What was acceptable in the sixties is not acceptable now. And Wikipedia should stand as an example of NPOV and equal respect for all cultures. I'd be happy to use the word <i>mythology</i> if Christians would be happy to have their religion listed as <i>mythology</i>, and I gather that does offend some (but not all) Christians. I don't think we should treat the beliefs of Indigenous Australians with any less respect than we accord to the Christian religion. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayd8_849f.html" title="User:Rayd8">Rayd8</a> | <a href="../../../r/a/y/User_talk%7ERayd8_e4bf.html" title="User talk:Rayd8">User talk:Rayd8</a> 21:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>probably not as not all of these people use the term 'dreaming'. i doubt moutford's book was removed just for using the word mythology? the term is used in contemporary literature (it means roughly 'non-historical', not 'bullshit'; amusingly enough the negative connotations do come from attempts to denigrate pre-christian european 'mythologies') and as i said, it's reference can be explained if there is a real problem. &amp; again there isn't a better term.&#160;<span style="border: solid 1px black;"><a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font style="background:white;" color="black">&#160;<b>⇒ bsnowball</b>&#160;</font></a></span> 09:53, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having considered the above discussion and done a bit of homework, I propose to replace the words "Aboriginal God" by "Aboriginal Ancestral Spirit", and words like "religion" by "Aboriginal traditional beliefs" (with appropriate redirects of course), and then cross the other bridges when we get to them.

<dd>Forgot to get my suggestion off Rayd8's talk page! <b>Aboriginal beliefs</b> for both myself - but then I have had an aversion to the use of ancestral and traditional for good reasons - it becomes ahistorical and non judgemental with the use of 'aboriginal beliefs'. Where I come (ie academic training) from - POV oozes out of the usage of 'ancestral' and' traditional' - in my opinion always better to go the way with the less of a moving target with fewer words. If there is evidence of belief of 'something that comes from before' from a particular spirit or being, it is not a god - it could be an ancestral spirit - but it is a part of a belief - better just an umbrella of 'aboriginal belief' - as to what it is it has regional variation and potentially multiple meanings - much better to qualify after from a simpler term- than get trapped by the potential arguments that arise from the position of whether something is traditional/ancestral or no... dangerous country for the wikipedia fellas <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">Satu</a><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">Suro</a> 09:30, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your excellent comment, but there are two different things here:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>What do we use to replace the word <b>god</b> in a sentence such as <b>Baiame was an aboriginal god</b>? Clearly <b>belief</b> is not appropriate here, so you have to use a word like <b>spirit</b>. <b>Aboriginal spirit</b> doesn't really work, as it's rather ambiguous. <b>Ancestral spirit</b> is what tends to be used both by the indigenous community and by academia. Things like <b>culture hero</b> would also be OK, but are less understandable by people outside the field. <b>Aboriginal Ancestral Spirit</b> isn't perfect either, but it's the best I can come up with.</li>
<li>What do we use to replace the word <b>religion</b>? I've proposed <b>Aboriginal traditional belief</b> and you've proposed <b>Aboriginal belief</b>. Both are OK, except that the latter has a slightly negative connotation, in that Aboriginal people may also <i>believe</i> in geology and physics as valid narratives as well as their traditional beliefs.<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayd8_849f.html" title="User:Rayd8">Rayd8</a> | <a href="../../../r/a/y/User_talk%7ERayd8_e4bf.html" title="User talk:Rayd8">User talk:Rayd8</a> 06:06, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Railway station article naming convention</span></h2>
<p>There seems to be an undocumented naming convention where railway stations in Australia are named either xxx, City or xxx, State. Is there a reason for this disambiguation? Further, the xxx, City names are slightly misleading as they are often in the metropolitan area and often on the far outskirts of the city. I would guess that 99% of the articles under <a href="../../../r/a/i/Category%7ERailway_stations_in_Australia_293a.html" title="Category:Railway stations in Australia">Category:Railway stations in Australia</a> do not need to be disambiguated. Any thoughts? —<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 12:45, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess the ", City" disambiguation appeared because it indicates that the station is in the metropolitan railway system of that city. As such, I don't think it is an unhelpful situation. I think a lot more than 1% of the articles need some sort of disambiguation. How many have a twin somewhere in the UK? <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 11:48, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It was done in response to the suburb naming conventions and has just been adopted that way. As far as I know there won't ever be any duplication issues under this system (except the to-be-opened <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esplanade_railway_station%2C_Perth_5945.html" title="Esplanade railway station, Perth">Esplanade railway station, Perth</a> has a closed duplicate in Perth on the Fremantle Line that was open for the America's Cup); about 99% of stations in Australia have been named this way (with the exceptions the iconic ones like <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flinders_Street_Station_a982.html" title="Flinders Street Station">Flinders Street Station</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Cross_Station_6913.html" title="Southern Cross Station">Southern Cross Station</a>), and as per JPD above, it avoids duplications with UK stations, of which there would be quite a few, since a lot of Australian suburbs are named after places in England. I think it's fine that we keep it this way, so long as we are consistent. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 01:10, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not so comfortable with the conclusions, particularly because their indicator of article quality is simply whether or not it has featured status. However valid an indicator that is, it is surely problematic when trying to demonstrate a correlation between quality and number of edits/editors. The article does acknowledge that the causality in both directions between quality and number of edits is relevant, I don't see how they have dealt with the fact that the articles they accept as high quality have necessarily received more edits simply through their exposure to the FA process. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 12:34, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

All too often Wikipedia is in haste to add content on events that fluctuate quickly, which can lead to pov-slants. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_8597.html" title="User:Beneaththelandslide">michael</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBeneaththelandslide_de8f.html" title="User talk:Beneaththelandslide">talk</a></sup> 06:50, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure it'll be over for quite a while with the way the hearings are proceeding in WA. There's some precedent for starting an article while scandals are ongoing (c.f. the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sponsorship_Scandal_c7c8.html" title="Sponsorship Scandal">Sponsorship Scandal</a> in Canada), and I think it's most relevant to create it now. In any case, I'm happy to write the article myself if someone can come up with a name, and I'm happy to have people checking it over for NPOV in case any sort of bias slips in. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 10:28, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the federal dimensions are anything close to notable, just this week's media hype, but the enormity of the scandal in Western Australia does. It's forced the resignation of three ministers ((<a href="../../../n/o/r/Norm_Marlborough_e806.html" title="Norm Marlborough">Norm Marlborough</a>, Tony McRae, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bowler_dee8.html" title="John Bowler">John Bowler</a>), two of whose careers - Marlborough and Bowler - appear to be over, one shadow minister (Anthony Fels), and there has been reported links to two more Labor backbenchers (<a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Wyatt_bc3b.html" title="Ben Wyatt">Ben Wyatt</a> and Shelley Archer) and the deputy leader of the state Liberal Party, Troy Buswell. It's become such a large scandal in its own right that it warrants an article to tie everything together.

<dd>It's a challenge - one would need to cover his years in power as a starting point, and his ridiculously high opinion ratings during most of his time in office. At federal level everyone will have forgotten this in a month - Burke really is a non entity outside WA, and is larger than life here. The scandal's really been gathering momentum since 2005. Boundary issues are also a problem - contrary to media reports it's actually three WA ministers - the first one (D'Orazio) was more generally related to CCC business and less to Burke. Had more connection with the Spagnolo affair in City of Stirling (Stirling, Wanneroo and Joondalup are all up to their eyeballs in this). I would say at this point until we can untangle what is where (it really is a web of intrigue) and write a decent article on Corruption in Western Australia or such like, we should probably defer. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 11:10, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see any great need to tie it into either broader corruption in Western Australia or to the previous Burke/WA Inc scandals, except in the context of a background section, since they're not directly relevant here. It's for that reason that I also ignored D'Orazio above - that's a separate scandal altogether, and one that belongs in his article alone. The Burke-Grill-Crichton-Browne scandal, on the other hand, is not that hard to untangle, but it is big enough and complex enough that I think it really does warrant an article of its own. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 11:26, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was Costello as "all tip, no iceberg" - just brilliant - one forgets how clever he was - it shows the others up dreadfully. This Burke scandal is however surely a storm in a teacup - notable only for newsprint column lengths / newstime devoted to it. Would it really pass the Wikipedia notability test, especially if you said current events belong in Wikinews - will this be notable a year from now? The challenge is surely to reference it in the Burke article, or the Corruption and Crime article as suggested by Moondyne, very briefly with links from the relevant bits of the articles on the various ministers sacked or resigned to that section only. Don't dignify the whole thing with an article. I am not trying to censor so much as try to have some perspective on notability.--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 20:33, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thinking about this, I wonder whether its one of those events that really should be allowed to run its course, let the dust settle then look at the fallout. My reasoning is two fold, the first being sources currently the article would be written purely from the News media and "whats going to sell today" POV. The second being that the underlying issues/results haven't really surfaced yet nor will they during the next six months. Most of the important encyclopedic/historical information wont come until after the commissions findings and after the political grandstanding for both the federal and state elections has been extinguished. Certainly the individuals who have been named should have their articles updated with the events as they occur, even some who may have not previously warranted an article will need one.

<p>Does the term "fast facts" sound a bit like "fast food"?</p>
<p>Wikipedia doesn't have a "mutual point of view" policy, it's a <b>neutral</b> point of view policy. It's an interesting substitution (the two words sound similar), but it suggests the journalist was just believing whatever was being said.

<dd>The lead under the image states <i>Much of Wikipedia's appeal lies in the way it creates a community.</i> It doesn't go onto expand on this point much in the article. While two of the four editors mentioned in the article met in real life ... I doubt whether they or anyone else would say that the appeal is about community - perhaps I am wrong. Although it avoided boilerplate content, I thought the article was pretty near useless and lacked interest. I also query its demographic assertions - what source is there that <i>Anecdotal evidence suggests that those who contribute to the site are generally in their late 20s or 30s, have degrees and are mostly male (about 80 per cent by one estimation).</i>? Perhaps it is the areas of the wikipedia that I contribute but from what I do know of my fellow wikipedians, I query the 80% and the narrow age limits. Perhaps the survey user: WikiInquirer is conducting at present on the motivation of editors ... <i>what motivates strangers from around the globe to collaborate and contribute to a public good like Wikipedia. Why would people come forward and donate their time, effort and knowledge?</i> will give us more insights. For more information on tthat survey and his methodology see <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiInquirer_40ec.html" title="User:WikiInquirer">User:WikiInquirer</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiInquirer_WikiStudy_0d37.html" title="User:WikiInquirer/WikiStudy">User:WikiInquirer/WikiStudy</a>.

<dd>I think that when someone writes an article on a subject which you are more familiar with than they are, it is always going to appear somewhat unsatisfactory. Having said that, I think that the article was quite a good overview of Wikipdedia in terms of introducing it to the public at large. A number of Australian Wikipedians were interviewed who made contact with the author through an email address placed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Australian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board/Archive_24#Wikipedians_wanted_for_interview" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Australian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board/Archive_24#Wikipedians_wanted_for_interview" rel="nofollow">this noticeboard</a>. I agree, however, that the "anecdotal evidence" about contributors is questionable, I too doubt its veracity. By the way, the line <i>Much of Wikipedia's appeal lies in the way it creates a community</i> is a quote from <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">User:Angela</a> rather than the author's assertion although its placement in the caption (of the online version) makes it appear so.--<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelburnian_8c45.html" title="User:Melburnian">Melburnian</a> 00:22, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Textor_588d.html" title="Mark Textor">Mark Textor</a> article is a disgrace.

It is self-serving and fails to mention any controversy of which there are plenty - that we allow such non-neutral articles is very embarrassing. I have put some links on the talk page.

<p>I'm sure the article could do with some improvement, but I'm actually glad that he hasn't touched on the controversies, as it may be better to have no content on the controversies than biased content.

<dd>I read it as an advert. I note also that a mention of Lynton Crosby was modified to reduce the controversial aspects by using weasel words, possibly justifiably but I really wonder. My concern is the breach of Wikipedia:Autobiography, the promotion in the John Howard article ... and the controversies if you read the links I have provided on the talk page are many. Biassed content would not be created if the first principles of wikipedia:autobiography had been observed - don't edit articles about yourself.--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 03:55, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
