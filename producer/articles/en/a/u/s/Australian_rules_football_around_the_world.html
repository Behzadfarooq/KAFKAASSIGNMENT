<p>A series of hybrid <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_rules.html" title="International rules">International rules</a> matches between the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Australian Football League</a>'s best professional players and a representative <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_football.html" title="Gaelic football">Gaelic football</a> team from Ireland's <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_dab2.html" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a> amateur players. The series is staged annually. The rules are a compromise between the two codes, using a round ball and a rectangular field. The fierce <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tackle_%28football_move%29.html" title="Tackle (football move)">tackling</a> of the Australian code is allowed, however more recently this has caused controversy with the Irish players who play a less violent contact game. The series have remained evenly matched with the Irish using speed and athleticism, and the Australians strength and power - both inherent skills in their respective codes. This contrast of skills has created exciting contests that are a hit with spectators.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Australian_football_Council_d55b.html" title="International Australian football Council">International Australian football Council</a> (IAFC) was formed in 1995 to promote and develop Australian football internationally.

<p>Australian football is not yet considered large enough internationally for a <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_a2be.html" title="FIFA">FIFA</a> styled governing body, so the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Australian Football League</a> is primarily responsible for funding and governance and provides $29 million for development of the game in Australia and around <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_dollar.html" title="Australian dollar">A$</a>500,000 annually for international development, with the following breakdown in 2005:</p>

<p>Australia has recruited several Irish Gaelic footballers to play Aussie Rules. As Gaelic football is primarily amateur competition and the AFL competition is professional, there is a strong financial lure. In the 1990s, the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Football_Club_b6bf.html" title="Melbourne Football Club">Melbourne Football Club</a> recruited <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Stynes_e684.html" title="Jim Stynes">Jim Stynes</a> who would turn out to be the most successful Irish player in the history of the VFL/AFL, taking out the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownlow_medal.html" title="Brownlow medal">Brownlow</a> medallist <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Stynes_e684.html" title="Jim Stynes">Jim Stynes</a>. At around the same time, the club recruited the Scot <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Wight_239e.html" title="Sean Wight">Sean Wight</a>. In more recent years, the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Swans_645f.html" title="Sydney Swans">Sydney Swans</a> recruited young Irish <a href="../../../t/a/d/Tadhg_Kennelly_8d87.html" title="Tadhg Kennelly">Tadhg Kennelly</a> who played in a premiership with the club and has also represented Ireland against Australia. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlton_Football_Club_f590.html" title="Carlton Football Club">Carlton Football Club</a> experimented with brothers <a href="../../../s/e/t/Setanta_%C3%93_hAilp%C3%ADn_777f.html" title="Setanta Ó hAilpín">Setanta Ó hAilpín</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisake_%C3%93_hAilp%C3%ADn_14d9.html" title="Aisake Ó hAilpín">Aisake Ó hAilpín</a>.

Due to increasing concern from the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_dab2.html" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a>, in 2006 the AFL made a deal with the GAA to limit the number of junior Gaelic drafts.</p>

<p>Australia has exported players to the <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a>. Since the 1980s, many AFL players have tried out as American Football <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punt_%28football%29.html" title="Punt (football)">punters</a>. The kicking position requires similar skills to those found in Australian football players. Salaries are up to 5 times higher and the position lends itself to longevity. Australian football players generally retire at around 30, whereas American football punters can play well into their forties.</p>
<p>The first convert was <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Ridgeway_9aeb.html" title="Colin Ridgeway">Colin Ridgeway</a>, but the most successful of these players was <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Bennett_%28football_player%29_6b70.html" title="Darren Bennett (football player)">Darren Bennett</a> - former <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Football_Club_b6bf.html" title="Melbourne Football Club">Melbourne Football Club</a> AFL player recruited by the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_Chargers_92bd.html" title="San Diego Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a>, now playing for the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Vikings_eec0.html" title="Minnesota Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a>.</p>
