<p>A while ago, some information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mamdouh_Habib&amp;oldid=24803530" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mamdouh_Habib&amp;oldid=24803530" rel="nofollow">I had</a> on Ahmed Habib (son of <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mamdouh_Habib_8f03.html" title="Mamdouh Habib">Mamdouh Habib</a>) was removed as I linked to a blog with a copy of an article rather than linking to the article itself. Would someone with access to archives be able to confirm that the content about Ahmed is backed up by the following article: "Prisoner's son charged with kidnap" The Sunday Telegraph, 23 NOV 2003, Page 017.

<dl>
<dd>That's essentially what is in the newspaper article. However Islam Hassam is the <i>victim's</i> twin brother, not Habib's brother. Your wording is also a little loose about who was involved - all that the newspaper alleges Habib to have done is to have been present, and intervening to have the woman put into the back seat rather than the boot.</dd>
<dd>I would refrain from putting this information in, however, since there is no subsequent reporting anywhere on the incident and the allegation doesn't seem to have gone anywhere. I imagine that it was only reported in the first place because of the connection to Mamdouh Habib. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 01:30, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While Australia has had some really terrible bushfires (like Ash Wednesday, Canberra 2003 etc); most bushfires are not suitable material for an encyclopedia.

<dd>But every year there are one or two, or a weeks worth, that truly make the news and should have their own article, such as <i>2006 Location bushfires</i> or the <i>November 2006 bushfires in Location</i>?

<dd>Why not create a list for each year, which contains the major bushfires of that year, e.g. Australian bushfires of 2006 (or whatever naming convention you want).

<dd>It's strange that for geography related topics there are those that would create an article for every rocky outcrop in Australia, but for other areas the move is to aggregate them up from the outset. I concur with the super-article and the sub-articles for notable ones --<a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlf67_d959.html" title="User:Slf67">Steve</a> 07:03, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>- Perhaps an article covering the whole of a Bushfire season. For example, Victoria has already had quite a few fires this season. A 2006 Victorian Bushfires or bushfire season might be good. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazycrazyduck_1987.html" title="User:Crazycrazyduck">Crazycrazyduck</a> 10:35, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Steve, Chuq, Crazyduck I agree with that approach. See how the hurricanes and cyclones are done already. It is a really effective pattern to follow I think. It helps that all cyclones are named which gives them an advantage (see <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Pacific_hurricane_season_d8de.html" title="2005 Pacific hurricane season">2005 Pacific hurricane season</a> for example), but a 2005 Australian bushfire season article would still have enough notable information to constitute a full article and summarise major distastrous fires. I think the level of disastrousness to warrant a sub article for a single cluster of fires would have to be like that of <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ash_Wednesday_fires_a758.html" title="Ash Wednesday fires">Ash Wednesday</a> so there would be fewer sub-articlse than for the parallel hurricane article. —&#160;<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 01:23, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(somewhat off topic) I'll second Steve's comment that we are inconsistent in our application of notability. An obscure species of fungus is unanimously considered notable, but an obscure historical figure may generate heated debate. A rocky outcrop is notable because it is a geographical feature, but last year's bushfire is not, even though it generated pages of broadsheet coverage, simply because it is an event that has passed.</dd>
<dd>(on topic) I think that any bushfire that received significant media coverage merits Wikipedia content. I have no objection to that content appearing in a stand-alone article.</dd>

<dd>But what is significant media coverage? Every big fire will get a mention in local or national media; I don't think that automatically qualifies a fire in Australia (given the number and frequency of fires each year) worthy of an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">Peta</a> 02:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have long ago accepted that I cannot convince you all to adopt my unusually low notability threshold. Instead, perhaps we could agree to write articles only about those bushfires (or other disasters) that are gazetted disasters, as determined by whether or not they appear in the <a href="http://www.ema.gov.au/agd/ema/emaDisasters.nsf" class="external text" title="http://www.ema.gov.au/agd/ema/emaDisasters.nsf" rel="nofollow">EMA Disasters Database</a> - "the primary Australian Government database containing records of all natural and non-natural disasters within Australia". <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 02:55, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Replying to Snottygobble's comment - I guess the reasoning may be that a small town and a bushfire cover similar areas, yet a town exists for decades/centuries, whereas a bushfire exists for a couple of days. The total media coverage that the town has received over its entire existence is probably greater that the coverage of a bushfire would get over a week. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 05:30, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The seasons for bushfires is probably the best approach then. For example, the fire at Yallorn currently has the potential to cut Victoria's energy supply by a third (well I don't know the latest, it had this morning)- while it isnt worthy of an article on its own it is quite a large fire. Perhaps even an article for the whole country (ie- <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_Australian_Bushfire_Season_3a67.html" title="2006-07 Australian Bushfire Season">2006-07 Australian Bushfire Season</a> or whatever the appropriate naming convention is). --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazycrazyduck_1987.html" title="User:Crazycrazyduck">Crazycrazyduck</a> 08:47, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If anyone is interested there is an open day for Kirribilli and Admiralty House on October 29th.

<dl>
<dd>"Why should anyone in Australia care? Wikipedia is a US-based site. It has no official status: no government funding, no university imprimatur, no editor-in-chief. But then, neither does Google, the search engine whose name recently made it into the Oxford English Dictionary as a verb."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think the author is aware that there are more than a number of Australian admins and contributors. <strike>He</strike> She (oops!) does have a point about the dire situation about articles about our authors though. Anyone game enough to give it a go at fixing this situation? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 10:39, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>P.S. in case anyone thinks I'm having a go, I think their suggestion is very good:
<dl>
<dd>"If it's not my job to clean it up -- and such a task is utterly beyond the resources of a single person anyway -- then whose is it? Editing Wikipedia is easy. You don't have to join, although it helps. A page can be updated in seconds by anyone, or created in minutes by a member. Any writer, publisher, agent, arts bureaucrat or editor could add a listing for themselves, their colleagues, their clients or their organisation in moments -- and add it to a watchlist to guard against misinformation."</dd>
<dd>"Perhaps the people who administer the Patrick White Award could take a moment to honour the past recipients with listings; perhaps a student writing her thesis on Australian short stories could spend half an hour adding a few words; maybe even the Australia Council could get their PR people to improve its listing beyond "stub" status. That's how those million-plus articles got there to start with: people cared enough to spend their time writing them. The state of Wikipedia makes me wonder if anyone in Australia cares about the international face of our literature, and about the next generation of readers. (They certainly care about football: "Australian Rules", a well-written entry, has 18 verifiable references: "Australian Literature" has none.) In other words, it's everyone's job."</dd>
<dd>"Meanwhile, I'm off to create that listing for Jessica Anderson. It's what Patrick White would have wanted." - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 10:46, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps I'm out of my head, but I certainly didn't see that article as a criticism of Wikipedia. It merely seemed to be a call-to-arms for people who care about Australian Literature to get stuck in and put some decent information about great Australia authors up on the world's most read encyclopaedia.

<dl>
<dd>Likewise, I didn't see it as an attack, but certainly pointing out one of Wikipedia's current weak spots, with a very nice suggestion on how the average Joe could help fix things.

<dd>I actually thought it was a decent article and let's face facts, it was basically true. Okay, she doesn't have a great understanding of some aspects of Wikipedia, but she's on the money when she writes about certain areas of Australian content lacking. We should be grateful to her for her call-to-arms. Maybe we'll see some new Aussie editors. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 13:43, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, to the people referring to the journalist as "he", her name is Jenny Sinclair and hence, I assume, female. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 13:51, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Coming in late, I hope it wasn't interpreted as an attack, any more than any pointing out of areas in need of improvement is an attack. Yes, I'm aware there are Australians working on Wikipedia, but few literature specialists; and the aim of the article was to draw in experts who may not be existing Wikipedia contributors.</p>
<p>I've also been made aware of the collaboration of the fortnight area, and I'll be going there to put this up for consideration too. Cheers, Jenny Sinclair 10:20, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the days after Jenny's article was published, I noticed two new people editing Australian literature articles. They had signed up the day and the day after the article was published. Sadly, though, one (who appeared to be from the Australian Society of Authors) was posting copyright violations.&#160;:( Sarah Ewart (Talk) 11:52, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While we're discussing this, is there any verifiable truth to what the editor is claiming happened? I'm no expert on Aboriginal history, but if this massacre is commonly held by those educated on the subject to have occured, writing a well-cited piece in the appropriate article (<a href="../../../c/o/o/Coolac%2C_New_South_Wales_357a.html" title="Coolac, New South Wales">Coolac, New South Wales</a>, I guess) could go a long way towards defusing the situation. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 03:21, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have read some of the early documents/drafts prepared by archaeologists relating to the RTA's application for consents for disturbance of indigenous heritage (note this is not an Environmental Impact Statement - that was finished years ago) for the Coolac Bypass before I prematurely resigned/retired in June. The simple answer is that there is <b>no written evidence</b>, which is not to say that no massacre occurred. Some are hoping that the current exercise will show that there was a massacre. However, this is unlikely because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is unlikely that a massacre would have occured on precisely the route being planned, and this is the only section that is being investigated</li>
<li>the only hope of finding evidence would be from datable burial sites, but if there were deaths, bodies would more than likely have been buried elsewhere (and not be found by the current investigation) or not have been buried at all (which would mean they would leave no trace).--<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahamec_491a.html" title="User:Grahamec">Grahamec</a> 04:42, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Is it enough of a mainstream view that it could reasonably be included though? Some quick Googling doesn't turn up anything for "Coolac Massacre" or "Gundagai Massacre", but I don't really have my finger on the pulse of indigenous politics in this country. If there's a significant minority that do believe it happened, then perhaps we should make a quick mention along the lines of "some believe a massacre occured here".</dd>
<dd>Basically, I'm just trying to extend the benefit of the doubt to this anon and assume good faith; while she has a lot to learn about civility, I think that Wikipedia as a whole would certainly benefit from more Aboriginal perspective. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 08:52, 26 October 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>There are apparently no reliable sources on this alleged massacre other than the one (unreliable source) above and references to alleged massacre claims on the ABC news from one resident and discussion about it do not seem to equal that there was a masssacre - very few refs.

<dd>I've spent the best part of thirty minutes looking for anything on this "massacre" that isn't obviously sourced from this one user (their writing style is rather... distinctive), and I've drawn a blank. I think we can definitely relegate her claims to the realm of crankery. Luckily, I haven't seen her about for a couple of days, maybe she's gotten bored. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 12:37, 26 October 2006 (UTC).

<dd>At the end of the day (I've looked too), it comes down to what Wikipedia is about - verifiability. If a massacre did occur, that is the realm of academics and anthropologists and historians to discuss, sort out, talk to sources, research the claims, publish, peer review, then we can put it up. There is info I'd dearly like to put into some articles as let's say in some cases there are Government facts and there are facts, and the latter don't get an airing. However, just because I may personally know it to be true doesn't mean I can verify it, and therefore it shouldn't be in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User%7EOrderinchaos78_0cc3.html" title="User:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orderinchaos78_01d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orderinchaos78">c</a>)</sup> 12:16, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Longhair's statement. People aren't perfect.

<dd>Blimey, mate. It was only listed an hour before you complained here. It was 2 below the bottom one on AfD the last time I looked and that was not too long ago.

<dd>I came accross this nomination by accident and it appeared to be a surreptitious process. I was under the impression that I was creating a stub, mainly containing the LGA infobox at this stage (which in my opinion is better not on the town article where it clashes with the town infobox). It would obviously need to be improved in future. Sorry if I over-reacted.--<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahamec_491a.html" title="User:Grahamec">Grahamec</a> 12:52, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">20 to 1</span></h2>
<p>I've come across a lot of articles recently (in the wikify and categorise lists) which are episodes of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Nine_8100.html" title="Channel Nine">Channel Nine</a> program <i><a href="../../../2/0/_/20_to_1.html" title="20 to 1">20 to 1</a></i> hosted by Bert Newton (and previously Charles "Bud" Tingwell). For those not familiar with the show, it lists in reverse order events under a certain topic such as "Celebrity Scandals" or "Great Aussie Ideas, Icons and Inventions". These articles are essentially the lists presented on the show (with wikilinks where available). I just wanted to get other Australian users' opinion on these (they are mostly under Category:20 to 1 if you want to take a look). I've taken note of some issues I'm concerned about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The formatting is wildly inconsistent, sometimes the numbering goes from 1 to 20 and sometimes 20 to 1 (as presented on the show).</li>
<li>I just noticed Channel Nine provide the lists on their website. I suspect some of the articles are directly cut-and-pasted from that site (the ones with no wiki formatting on the numbered lists). Also, if the lists are on the Channel Nine site, should they be here?</li>
<li>The lists are undoubtedly POV, is there a policy on regurgitation/copying of such lists on Wikipedia? Is there a copyright issue?</li>

<dd>According to some of the material I read about the show before it started, Jericho is intended to incorporate some content that is only on the internet and not on the television show itself. Now I don't know that this means some people connected with the show were using WP to host this material, but there were a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ravenwood_Solutions_b2f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ravenwood Solutions">couple of articles</a> that popped up around the same time as this ad, written from an in-universe view, about fictional companies in the show, and there were some edits like that to the Jericho page itself.</dd>

<p>Goldwyer was an explorer who was speared to death by Indigenous Australians in northern Western Australia. This was characterised as "treacherous murder" by the colonists, but Indigenous Australians repudiate this, invoking "the right of Aboriginal people to defend their land" and "the history of provocation which led to the explorers' deaths".

<dd>My thought is that with either poject "Islam in Australia" or "religion in Australia" the scope should be narrow and only directly cover the religion, preachers, buildings and notiable events.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Poverty</span></h2>
<p>I was having a look through the "economy of..." article, which have the number of people below poverty lines. <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Australia_4e00.html" title="Economy of Australia">Australia</a> has 14.3% of the population below the poverty line, while <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_the_United_States_3325.html" title="Economy of the United States">the US</a> has 12%, <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Canada_3d0f.html" title="Economy of Canada">Canada</a> 15.5% and France 7%! According to the source for Australia, we are ranked second to the United States (which has 17%). However, the US article obviously uses a different source, and has a lower poverty rate. Also, according to the source for the Australian article, the top five 1st world countries with high poverty rates do not include Canada, even though it is higher according to Wikipedia. I didn't really know where to bring this up, as there seems to be no economy wikiproject, but I thought it would be important to let people know. There really needs to be a single source for this type of statistic, or countries will use the best stat to make themselves sound good.</p>
<p>Also, just out of curiosity. How does Australia have a 14% poverty rate with &lt;5% unemployment, and France have &gt;9% unemployment and 7% poverty? --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 14:46, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting. Of course, the statistics are meaningless without defining "poverty line". Perhaps you should start a discussion at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Economy_9cfe.html" title="Template talk:Infobox Economy">Template talk:Infobox Economy</a> to come to a common source (though perhaps not many people will see that). Failing that, I feel that the statistic should be deleted from the table.</dd>
<dd>Some observations. The source for the Australian article is the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_Policy_Institute_456b.html" title="Economic Policy Institute">Economic Policy Institute</a>. From that article, it does not surprise me that they highlight the fact that the US has the highest poverty rate. I'd advocate using a clearly international organization. For instance, the United Nations Development Program published the <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/" class="external text" title="http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/" rel="nofollow">Human Development Report 2006</a>, which says for Australia that 14.3% are below half the median income <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/statistics/indicators/32.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/statistics/indicators/32.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and 17.6% are below $11 a day (1994 PPP US$) <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/statistics/indicators/33.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/statistics/indicators/33.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. The corresponding numbers for other countries are US: 17.0% / 13.6%; Canada 11.4% / 7.4%; France 8.0% / 9.9%. But you really need an economist to make sense of the numbers, in my opinion.</dd>
<dd>The reason that France has low poverty notwithstanding high unemployment is probably generous unemployment benefits and more generally that the French are more egalitarian than Australians, Americans, and Canadians. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 00:07, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For good ole Tasmanian controversies the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Dam_47ac.html" title="Franklin Dam">Franklin Dam</a> article is of reasonable quality so far - but it seems that <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Pedder_350c.html" title="Lake Pedder">Lake Pedder</a> article is sadly in need of a re-working.

<dd>If there ever was a reasonable response to this - it really should start with the Pedder saga ( much longer than anyone might understand) - and its legacy - then the possible ramifications on the Franklin issue.

<dd>Point of clarification. In my opinion they both need re-working, and if sufficient input is put into Lake Pedder - then in line with that we will then find that we will need to re-write the Franklin article - no offence to your hard work Rebecca.! I am hoping that somehow there can evolve from some of this a way of creating a structure for good articles on really heavily contentious issues (that split tasmania in two twice) so as tyo be good articles. If I have explained myself poorly what I am saying is that the Franklin Dam article as it stands alone (compared to a useless Pedder article IMHO) is a good article - and if its an example of how to go I think we have to do better with the Pedder article as it has a longer duration background- we will have to re-do the Franklin as a result. No offence intended - perhaps the Perth hot weather has induced my wooly thinking today! <a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> 12:08, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Perth Photo Wish List</span></h2>
<p>Over the next 6 weeks(school holiday day care program) I'll be running around Perth going daily to many varied locations. So I've created <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_Photo_wish_list_7eb5.html" title="User:Gnangarra/Photo wish list">User:Gnangarra/Photo wish list</a> if there is anything that you would like to obtain a photo from or of add it to the page. As the program covers an extremely wide range of places and activities anything is possible. I'm also not bound to the group as such I can wander to places nearby as well. Over the last week I've been rock climbing, pincic lunch by the river, Perth Mint gold pour, and the Perth zoo. Future activities include Museums, Ice/Rollerskating, a wildlife park, a farm, no matter how abstract the request anything could happen. Additionally you may already have a photo that fulfills someones else wish just upload and link to the page. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 13:40, 15 December 2006 (UTC) <span id="63291121944"></span></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why doesn't WIkipedia care about accuracy</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I am trying to correct the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Australia_by_population_ffe7.html" title="List of cities in Australia by population">List of cities in Australia by population</a>, because it incorrectly lists Thuringowa and Townsville as sepparate urban centres when according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics which is the only official source on the matter, they are one entity! However every time I try to fix the article to match the source document from the ABS a Wikipedian is undoing it and saying that some Queensland government figure for the Local Government Area is a better source. It is inconsistent to just use those figures for one entry, and wroung anyway because it is a list of Urban Centres, not Local Government Areas! Wikipedia should be about accurately reflecting the source, not picking and choosing statistics from all over the place. - Aucitypops <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Aucitypops (<a href="../../../a/u/c/User_talk%7EAucitypops_9915.html" title="User talk:Aucitypops">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aucitypops_4787.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aucitypops">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Not a simple answer to this one. The 'Greater' Townsville area consists of two seperate local government areas - the City of Thuringowa and the City of Townsville. As such each LGA has their own population. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Australia_by_population_ffe7.html" title="List of cities in Australia by population">List of cities in Australia by population</a> treats them in this manner. I think you will find that not everybody is in agreement with your assertion that the ABS is the only authority of what defines an urban centre. Your assertion is that 'Townsville' should be understood as the greater Townsville area, and you will have some convincing to do to treat it in this manner. You have a disconnect with the definition of 'city'. Cheers. <a href="../../../s/a/u/User%7ESauliH_feee.html" title="User:SauliH">SauliH</a> 05:27, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi SaulH, no my assertion is that Townsville-Thuringowa should be considered a single Urban Centre in the list of Urban Centres because that is how the ABS considers it on their list of Urban Centres, and the ABS is the organisation that defines Urban Centres and calculates their populations. Wikipedia should use the most authorative source, and it is indeed listed as the source on the page, but the figures here need to match the source! Not just have them added in from anywhere. Wikipedia is meant to be reliable. Of course the Local Governments are separate, if they are to be included they should be incluided in the list of LGAs, not the list of Urban Centres, which are different things. But the list of LGAs only goes up to number 25, Thuringowa would be a lot lower than that with only 59,000 or so people. Wikipedia will have to extend the list to include Thuringowa. - Aucitypops</p>

<dd>The most authoritative source of data on Australian city populations is the Australian Bureau of Statistics, therefore we use the data they provide. They show Burnie-Devonport in their list of urban areas, yes they are separate cities, but they are counted as one urban area due to their proximity. The page you refer to has separate lists for separate definitions of "city" so everyone should be happy. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 06:39, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The stats for each table are Statistical District Townsville - 148 767 (this includes Thuringowa as well as a bunch of other towns) Thuringowa is the city there are no other little towns as you say, plus both Townsville and Thuringowa have done surveys etc to find out the pop of the cities and this is how i know that the pops are not correct. but i guess i no nothing so i will leave it alone for now but trust me as soon as i can list the ref's for this information i will do so and make the changes thank you <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 06:46, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi mate sorry but yes you are mistaken the first lot are most not all suburbs of Townsville except for Magnetic Island this is part of Townsville but it is a island off the coast of Townsville, the next lot Thuringowa city part A, Kelso and Kirwan are suburbs of Thuringowa city again a lot are missing and Pt A Bal is the Northern Beachers area of Thuringowa city. there is only to cities here one is <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townsville.html" title="Townsville">Townsville</a> and the other is <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thuringowa.html" title="Thuringowa">Thuringowa</a> Townsville used to be a very small area but the government gave almost all of Thuringowa's land to Townsville (both Townsville and Thuringowa pages have this info on it) Thuringowa has it's own CBD (Thuringowa central) as does Townsville (the mall or Townsville CBD) I'm not sure who started this LGA stuff but it has a lot to do with Townsville (I can't say any more than that) Thuringowa built the first roads in what is now Townsville, Thuringowa was also the one to get the water on (via wells and pumps in Ross River) please if you need any more official info please let me know ..im more than willing to help get the facts correct thank you <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 07:32, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
