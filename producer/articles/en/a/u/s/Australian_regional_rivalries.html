<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_regional_rivalries.html" title="Edit section: Melbourne - Sydney Rivalry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Melbourne - Sydney Rivalry</span></h2>
<p>There has been a long standing rivalry, usually friendly yet sometimes heated, between the cities of <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, the two largest cities in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Capital_city" id="Capital_city"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_regional_rivalries.html" title="Edit section: Capital city">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Capital city</span></h3>
<p>The rivalry between the cities was the reason that neither Melbourne (the largest city at the time) nor Sydney (the oldest city) was chosen as the capital of Australia when the nation was <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation_of_Australia_75d3.html" title="Federation of Australia">federated</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a>. Because of this disagreement, section 125 of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Constitution_1fdd.html" title="Australian Constitution">Australian Constitution</a> specified that the capital of the new Commonwealth must be north of the <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_River_9586.html" title="Murray River">Murray River</a> (placing it in New South Wales rather than Victoria) but at least 100 miles from Sydney. This city became <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>. Melbourne operated as the capital city from 1901 until 1927, when Canberra's Parliament House was opened. Various Commonwealth governmental bodies continued to operate principally from Melbourne or Sydney after 1927. Most civil service departments were moved to Canberra in the 1950s, and the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Court_of_Australia_754b.html" title="High Court of Australia">High Court of Australia</a> was finally moved from Melbourne to Canberra in 1980.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_regional_rivalries.html" title="Edit section: Free Trade vs Protectionism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Free Trade vs Protectionism</span></h3>
<p>Rivalry and differences between the colonies was a feature of life in Pre-Federation <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. There was a real rivalry between the most powerful colonies, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_%28Australia%29_71e6.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a>, on trade matters. As the two largest colonies both the states believed that the new nation should follow their trade model. Victoria had a policy of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protectionism.html" title="Protectionism">protectionism</a> with <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tariff.html" title="Tariff">tariffs</a> imposed on goods coming into the state from other colonies. New South Wales had an opposite policy of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_trade.html" title="Free trade">free trade</a> where all goods coming that came into the state were not tariffed. This rivalry delayed the process of <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation_of_Australia_75d3.html" title="Federation of Australia">federation</a>; eventually the two colonies agreed that trade between the colonies would be tariff free, but tariffs would be placed on goods from overseas (excluding the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_regional_rivalries.html" title="Edit section: Football">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Football</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a> (AFL) in Australia is traditionally based in Melbourne, while <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> is played more in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>. While both sports have extended their popularity beyond their own state, the historic and spiritual centre of both sports has remained in Melbourne and Sydney respectively, and neither city has been quick to embrace the other city's dominant football code. This has created or fuelled the rivalry between the cities.</p>
<p><a name="Comparison" id="Comparison"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_regional_rivalries.html" title="Edit section: Comparison">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Comparison</span></h3>
<p>Sydney Harbour with the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Opera_House_ea14.html" title="Sydney Opera House">Sydney Opera House</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_c7db.html" title="Sydney Harbour Bridge">Sydney Harbour Bridge</a> has the most internationally recognisable <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmarks.html" title="Landmarks">landmarks</a> of any Australian city. The harbour is often described as one of the best in the world. Sydney, with a population of 4.2 million, is the largest city in Australia and is also its <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finance.html" title="Finance">financial</a> capital. Melbourne, on the other hand, is the second largest city with a population of 3.7 million, and is often regarded as the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts.html" title="Arts">arts</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural.html" title="Cultural">cultural</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sporting</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fashion.html" title="Fashion">fashion</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shopping.html" title="Shopping">shopping</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food.html" title="Food">food</a> capital of Australia.</p>
<p>Both cities have hosted an <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a> (Melbourne in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956_Summer_Olympics_824a.html" title="1956 Summer Olympics">1956</a> and Sydney in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_Summer_Olympics_2af9.html" title="2000 Summer Olympics">2000</a>), while Melbourne has the bigger sporting events with the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Cup_8497.html" title="Melbourne Cup">Melbourne Cup</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Open_bdfe.html" title="Australian Open">Australian Tennis Open</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Grand_Prix_e5ce.html" title="Australian Grand Prix">Grand Prix</a>. Melbourne has the tallest office building (<a href="../../../r/i/a/Rialto_Towers_ea15.html" title="Rialto Towers">Rialto Towers</a> at 251m tall), residential tower (<a href="../../../e/u/r/Eureka_Tower_cde7.html" title="Eureka Tower">Eureka Tower</a> at 297m) and hotel tower (Crown Towers at 152m), while Sydney arguably has the tallest tower overall (<a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Tower_6891.html" title="Sydney Tower">Sydney Tower</a>, with its roof at 275m and an antenna reaching 309m). Melbourne's <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Casino_72ea.html" title="Crown Casino">Crown Casino</a> is much bigger than Sydney's <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_City_Casino_f7f0.html" title="Star City Casino">Star City</a>, Melbourne's <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Gallery_of_Victoria_3b8e.html" title="National Gallery of Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a> larger than Sydney's <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Gallery_of_New_South_Wales_43c0.html" title="Art Gallery of New South Wales">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a> and the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground_93ce.html" title="Melbourne Cricket Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> larger than Sydney's <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telstra_Stadium_989f.html" title="Telstra Stadium">Telstra Stadium</a>. However, Sydney's skyline contains a higher number of skyscrapers overall than Melbourne, its property prices are significantly higher, and its beaches such as <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bondi_Beach%2C_New_South_Wales_d309.html" title="Bondi Beach, New South Wales">Bondi Beach</a> are more popular than Melbourne's, due to the warmer climate and waves.</p>
<p>People in Sydney have in the past made fun of the <a href="../../../y/a/r/Yarra_River_4865.html" title="Yarra River">Yarra River</a> which is seen as being dirty, and Melbourne's <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climate.html" title="Climate">climate</a> which is seen as being both perennially overcast (although Sydney actually receives about twice as much rain), and erratic.

<p>Mainland Australians often use the island state <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> (or Tasmanians) as the butt of jokes. Many joke that people from the small island of Tasmania are <a href="../../../i/n/b/Inbred.html" title="Inbred">inbred</a>, or have two heads. The origins of these jokes are most likely due to the fact that Tasmania is an island state, and its (presumed) low population, when in actual fact Tasmania is much less remote than <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin%2C_Northern_Territory_5a73.html" title="Darwin, Northern Territory">Darwin</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_Western_Australia_3c92.html" title="Perth, Western Australia">Perth</a>, and more populous than Darwin, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>, and up until the early 1900s, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_Western_Australia_3c92.html" title="Perth, Western Australia">Perth</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Australian_population_data_as_a_percentage_1881-2000.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Australian_population_data_as_a_percentage_1881-2000.png" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> More Tasmanian born people live in Melbourne than in Tasmania.</p>
<p>Mainland Australian maps used graphically and symbols frequently leave Tasmania off completely, including the original castings of <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_Summer_Olympics_2af9.html" title="2000 Summer Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a> medals.</p>
<p>Tasmania is often jokingly identified as "not part of Australia" by mainlanders. Some jokingly refer to Tasmania as "overseas" in a freight or travel context, despite it being overseas only in a literal context. In return, some Tasmanians refer to "mainlanders" or the "North Island". Internationally, some people think of Tasmania and Australia as different countries. International mail destined for Tasmania being redirected to <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanzania.html" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> has sometimes occurred.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_regional_rivalries.html" title="Edit section: Western Australia and eastern states">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Western Australia and eastern states</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Australia_84d0.html" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a> is the largest state of Australia, the least densely populated, and the furthest removed from the centres of population and of federal government in the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_states_of_Australia_f98f.html" title="Eastern states of Australia">Eastern States</a>. At the same time, it has abundant natural resources and primary industries that contribute a significant part of Australia's economy, particularly in the mining sector.</p>
<p>Many Western Australians consider their state to be a "forgotten" state. This grievance is based in the fact that its remoteness and relatively small population mean that many significant events are denied to Western Australians, such as concert tours and sporting events. The state also has a lower profile than the better-known parts of Australia; non-Australians are more likely to know about Sydney or Melbourne than Perth.</p>
<p>More seriously, Western Australians have long complained of being ignored politically and economically by other States and by the Commonwealth. On more than one occasion, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secessionism_in_Western_Australia_042e.html" title="Secessionism in Western Australia">secession</a> has been proposed and even formally pursued, but to no effect. Western Australia was the last colony to agree to join the others in <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation_of_Australia_75d3.html" title="Federation of Australia">federation</a>, and almost decided against joining, expecting to be overshadowed by the more populous states.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_regional_rivalries.html" title="Edit section: Queensland and southern states">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Queensland and southern states</span></h2>

At the same time it has long contributed a significant proportion of Australia's most lucrative export commodities, such as <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beef.html" title="Beef">beef</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar.html" title="Sugar">sugar</a>. The disparity between Queensland's economic contribution and political influence has long caused tension. The relationship is complicated by the migration since the 1970s of many people from the southern states, who are both welcomed for the economic benefits they bring, and occasionally disparaged as "Mexicans".</p>

<p>Historically, the rivalry between <a href="../../../l/a/u/Launceston%2C_Tasmania_4d2f.html" title="Launceston, Tasmania">Launceston</a> in the north and <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobart.html" title="Hobart">Hobart</a> in the south has been endless. Tasmania's population (just over 480,000) is distributed almost evenly between the north and the south of the state.

<p>During the reign of one <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premier_of_Tasmania_58c4.html" title="Premier of Tasmania">premier</a> in the late twentieth century folklore had it that the government was planning to move the administration of the state to Launceston.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In 1991, the Launceston-based Tasmanian State Institute of Technology became the Launceston campus of the previously Hobart-based <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Tasmania_5084.html" title="University of Tasmania">University of Tasmania</a>. The decision was made to locate some courses at one campus only; for example, the University's then new <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Tasmania_5084.html#Faculty_of_Health_Science" title="University of Tasmania">School of Nursing</a> was based in Launceston.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a> being hugely popular in the state, Tasmania's local competition has struggled. For much of the 20th century Tasmania had a statewide competition (the <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmanian_Football_League_acb7.html" title="Tasmanian Football League">Tasmanian Football League</a>, later known as <i>Statewide League</i>), but in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> a lack of cohesion resulted in the division of the statewide leagues into separate northern and southern leagues. The conflict also flowed on to Tasmania's bids for a team in the national competition - the inability for northern and southern representatives to compromise on a home location for such a team has been partly responsible. The <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmanian_Devils_Football_Club_56da.html" title="Tasmanian Devils Football Club">Tasmanian Devils</a>, who represent the state in the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Football_League_a3a4.html" title="Victorian Football League">Victorian Football League</a>, alternate their home games between Hobart and Launceston.</p>
