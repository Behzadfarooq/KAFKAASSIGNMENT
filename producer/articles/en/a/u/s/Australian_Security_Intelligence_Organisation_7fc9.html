<p>The <b>Australian Security Intelligence Organisation</b> (ASIO) is the domestic <a href="../../../s/e/c/Security_agency.html" title="Security agency">security agency</a> of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> which is responsible for the protection of the country and its citizens from <a href="../../../e/s/p/Espionage.html" title="Espionage">espionage</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabotage.html" title="Sabotage">sabotage</a> (especially sabotage of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_infrastructure.html" title="Critical infrastructure">critical infrastructure</a>), politically-motivated violence, attacks on the Australian defence system, and acts of foreign interference.</p>
<p>ASIO is comparable to <a href="../../../m/i/5/MI5_b0c3.html" title="MI5">MI5</a>, the domestic security agency of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. As with MI5 officers, ASIO officers have no police or <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrest.html" title="Arrest">arrest</a> powers and are not armed, except in situations which may require a means of self-defence. ASIO operations requiring police powers are co-ordinated with the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Federal_Police_32ae.html" title="Australian Federal Police">Australian Federal Police</a> or with <a href="../../../s/t/a/States_and_territories_of_Australia_07c2.html" title="States and territories of Australia">State and Territory</a> police forces.</p>
<p>ASIO's sister organisation is the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Secret_Intelligence_Service_7b11.html" title="Australian Secret Intelligence Service">Australian Secret Intelligence Service</a> (ASIS), which is the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligence_agency.html" title="Intelligence agency">intelligence agency</a> whose foreign counterparts are <a href="../../../m/i/6/MI6_da6b.html" title="MI6">MI6</a> in the United Kingdom and the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Security_Intelligence_Organisation_7fc9.html" title="Edit section: Establishment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Establishment</span></h2>
<p>Prior to the establishment of ASIO in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>, several forms of security and intelligence services existed in Australia, most of which were extensions and branches of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_military.html" title="British military">British military</a> establishment. The first was the Central Counter-Espionage Bureau, a counter-intelligence agency with responsibility over the whole of the then-<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, which included Australia.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_16.html" title="March 16">16 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>, Prime Minister <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Chifley_ccca.html" title="Ben Chifley">Ben Chifley</a> issued a <i>Directive for the Establishment and Maintenance of a Security Service</i>, appointing <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Australian_Supreme_Court_e516.html" title="South Australian Supreme Court">South Australian Supreme Court</a> Justice Geoffrey Reed as the first Director-General of Security. The need for a national security service (to be modelled on MI5 in the United Kingdom) became apparent following the raising of significant security concerns by Operation VENONA (see Operations). In August that year, Justice Reed advised the Prime Minister that he had decided to call the previously unnamed service the ‘<i>Australian Security Intelligence Organisation</i>’.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_6.html" title="July 6">6 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a> the Charter <i>of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation</i> was defined by the directive of Prime Minister <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Menzies_62a5.html" title="Robert Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> following the appointment of then-Colonel Charles Spry as the new Director-General. The following year, ASIO headquarters were relocated from <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> to <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> (the headquarters would be relocated again in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> to their current location in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>).</p>

<p>An extensive review of the management structure of ASIO, following the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">11 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist_attacks.html" title="Terrorist attacks">terrorist attacks</a> upon the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> (which triggered the invocation of the <a href="../../../a/n/z/ANZUS_Treaty_5c28.html" title="ANZUS Treaty">ANZUS Treaty</a> by Australia) and the Bali Bombings, led to a large restructure in March <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.</p>
<p>The head of ASIO is the Director-General of Security, who chairs the Corporate Executive, which includes the Deputy Director-General and First Assistant Directors-General. The Corporate Executive oversees the strategic management of ASIO.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the Australian government announced its intention to substantially increase ASIO's operational budget, with the aim of increasing the agency's staffing level to nearly 2,000 personnel - double its 2005 level and nearly triple the number of staff in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.</p>

<p>Because of the nature of its work, ASIO does not make details of its activities public and law prevents the identities of ASIO officers from being disclosed. ASIO and the Commonwealth Government say that operational measures ensuring the legality of ASIO operations have been established.</p>
<p>ASIO briefs the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney-General_0c69.html" title="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a> on all major issues affecting security and he/she is also informed of operations when considering granting warrants enabling the special investigative powers of ASIO.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Attorney-General issues guidelines with respect to the conduct of ASIO investigations relating to politically motivated violence and its functions of obtaining intelligence relevant to security.</p>
<p>ASIO reports to several governmental and parliamentary committees dealing with security, legislative and financial matters. This includes the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security_cc20.html" title="Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security">Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security</a>. A classified annual report is also provided to the government, an unclassified edited version of which is made publicly available.</p>
<p>The Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security was established in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> to provide additional oversight of Australia’s security and intelligence agencies. The Inspector-General has complete access to all ASIO records and has a range of inquisitorial powers.</p>

<p>The special investigative powers available to ASIO include: the intercepting of telecommunications, the use of listening devices and tracking devices, remote access of computers, entering and searching premises, examining postal articles and seeking warrants for the questioning of persons for purpose of investigating terrorism. These powers are used under the authority of a warrant signed by the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>ASIO has determined that Australia faces a lower threat level to its national security than many other nations, which is attributed to its ‘<i>political, social and economic systems</i>’, as well as its ‘<i>clearly defined borders</i>’. However, Australia is still a target for <a href="../../../e/s/p/Espionage.html" title="Espionage">espionage</a> and foreign interference because it is in possession of information and technology that other nations desire and could turn to their own advantage. Furthermore, Australia is at risk of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> and politically-motivated violence due to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_policy.html" title="Foreign policy">foreign policy</a> that seldom wavers from the lines taken by the United States.</p>
<p>According to ASIO, most threats to the national security of Australia have their origins overseas, and include ‘<i>efforts of foreign governments to use clandestine or deceptive means to further their goals in Australia</i>’.</p>

<p>ASIO is responsible for <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-espionage.html" title="Counter-espionage">counter-espionage</a> and actively monitors foreign agents in Australia, preventing and frustrating their efforts to gain scientific, technical, military and political information.</p>

The reputation of ASIO in the eyes of the CIA was enhanced greatly when ASIO was able to provide highly valuable information on the structure of the Soviet intelligence services in the mid-1950s.

<p>In fact, when Brigadier Spry retired, the Deputy Director of the CIA sent the following tribute:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“<i>The relationship between the CIA and ASIO started as a very personal one. The real substantive relationship started with Sir Charles’ visit in 1955… Since Sir Charles’ first visit, the relationships with ASIO have continued to become closer and closer until today we have no secrets, regardless of classification or sensitivity, that are not made available to ASIO if it is pertinent to Australia’s internal security… I feel, as does the Director, a type of mutual trust in dealing with ASIO that is exceeded by no other service in the world today.</i>”</dd>

<p>In the late 1940s, VENONA uncovered sensitive British and Australian government data being transmitted through Soviet diplomatic channels.

<p>ASIO was established in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> when the findings of Operation VENONA made it clear that Australia required a domestic security service similar to MI5 in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The operation to crack the Soviet spy ring in Canberra consumed much of the resources of ASIO during the 1950s. The operation became internally known as "The Case". MI5 assisted the then fledgling organisation with investigations concerning the spy ring.</p>
<p>Among the prime suspects of the investigations were Wally Clayton, a prominent member of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Communist_Party_170e.html" title="Australian Communist Party">Australian Communist Party</a>, and two diplomats with the Department of External Affairs, Jim Hill and Ian Milner.

Fearing for his safety, Petrov contacted Australian authorities.</p>
<p>ASIO was instrumental in arranging Petrov’s defection to Australia, which occurred on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_3.html" title="April 3">3 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>. Petrov was placed under protection, but his wife Evdokia was dramatically escorted to an awaiting aeroplane in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> by MVD agents. There was doubt as to whether she was leaving by choice or through coercion and so Australian authorities did not act to prevent her being bundled into the plane.

<p>The First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy, Ivan Skripov, was ejected from Australia and declared persona non grata in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>. Skripov had engaged in elaborate espionage preparations, which were detected and prevented by ASIO.</p>
<p>Since <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> Skripov had been refining an Australian woman as an agent for Soviet intelligence. However, the woman was actually an undercover operative of ASIO. Skripov asked the woman to courier a package to <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide%2C_South_Australia_aeaf.html" title="Adelaide, South Australia">Adelaide</a>, where he said it would be accepted by a contact. ASIO allowed the woman’s assignment to continue, hoping to uncover another arm of the Soviet intelligence apparatus in Australia.</p>
<p>The package contained a transmitter enabling coded messages to be sent by radio at several hundred words per minute. A similar device had been found in the United Kingdom after a British couple were arrested for spying for the Soviet Union. The package also contained a coded list of Russian transmission timetables.</p>
<p>However, the appointed contact did not show for the delivery and the ASIO operative was unable to deliver the package. Rather than take any more risks, ASIO recommended the ejection of Skripov and the government declared him <i><a href="../../../p/e/r/Persona_non_grata.html" title="Persona non grata">persona non grata</a></i> – not to be allowed re-entry into Australia.</p>

<p>During the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> period, a Soviet mole managed to penetrate ASIO. Due to the close defence and intelligence ties between Australia and the United States, ASIO became a backdoor to American intelligence. Upon realising ASIO was compromised, the United States pulled back on the information it shared with Australia.</p>
<p>Following a strenuous internal audit and a joint Federal Police investigation, George Sadil was accused of being the mole. Sadil had been a Russian interpreter with ASIO for some 25 years and highly classified documents were discovered in his place of residence. Federal Police arrested Sadil in June <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> and charged him under the Crimes Act 1914 with several espionage and official secrets related offences. However, parts of the case against him collapsed the following year.</p>
<p>Sadil was committed to trial in March <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, but the <a href="../../../d/i/r/Director_of_Public_Prosecutions_caf9.html" title="Director of Public Prosecutions">Director of Public Prosecutions</a> decided not to proceed with the more serious espionage-related charges after reviewing the evidence against him. Sadil's profile did not match that of the mole and investigators were unable to establish any kind of money trail between him and the <a href="../../../k/g/b/KGB_8668.html" title="KGB">KGB</a>.</p>
<p>Sadil pleaded guilty in December 1994 to thirteen charges of "<i>removing ASIO documents contrary to his duty</i>", and was sentenced to three months jail. He was subsequently released on a twelve-month good behaviour bond. It is believed that another ASIO operative, now retired, is suspected of being the mole but no prosecution attempts have been made.</p>
<p>There were suggestions that the KGB had not actually compromised ASIO, and that the United States used this as justification on limiting the intelligence information it shared (a trend noticed, in fact, by most Western governments and not just Australia). However, in November <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, former KGB Major-General <a href="../../../o/l/e/Oleg_Kalugin_4487.html" title="Oleg Kalugin">Oleg Kalugin</a> confirmed to the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation_9631.html" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>'s <i><a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Corners_%28TV_series%29_1a46.html" title="Four Corners (TV series)">Four Corners</a></i> programme that the KGB had in fact infiltrated ASIO in late the 1970s and early 1980s.</p>

<p>In April 1983 the First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy, Valeriy Ivanov, was declared persona non grata and ejected from Australia on the grounds that he had performed duties in violation of his diplomatic status (that is, espionage related activities).

<p>Further amendments to the <i>Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1960</i> became operable on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">22 June</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, expanding the telecommunications interception powers of ASIO to include modern technological communications advances.</p>
<p>The powers available to ASIO were expanded with the <i>Australian Security Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002</i>. The legislation, designed to enhance the capacity of ASIO to combat terrorism, defines terrorist acts as a threat to Australian security and authorises ASIO to question persons related to terrorism investigations, as well as providing the power to seize the belongings of suspected persons.</p>

<p>Furthermore, from the 5000 page document released by the Commission, it was found that:</p>

<li>the files that Petrov had removed from the Soviet Embassy were authentic and the Petrovs were truthful witnesses;</li>
<li>from its establishment in 1943 to its departure in 1954, the Soviet Embassy in Canberra had been used for espionage; and</li>
<li>the only Australians who willingly assisted Soviet intelligence were Communists.</li>

Justice Robert Hope of the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_New_South_Wales_2c70.html" title="Supreme Court of New South Wales">Supreme Court of New South Wales</a> was appointed as Royal Commissioner.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> the Commission confirmed the need for Australia’s own security and intelligence agency and made many recommendations on improving the analytical capability and financial accountability of ASIO. It also advocated increased ministerial control, designated the conducting of security assessments for access to classified information to ASIO, and urged greater cooperation with police and foreign intelligence services. Also as a result of the Commission the jurisdiction of ASIO investigation was expanded to include sabotage and terrorism, and ASIO was given lawful authority to open mail, enter premises, use listening devices and intercept telegrams and telex under warrant.</p>

In the report concluded in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, Justice Hope designated ASIO as the agency responsible for national threat assessments in terrorism and politically motivated violence. He also recommended that relations between ASIO and State and Territory police forces be regulated by arrangements between governments.</p>

<p>Following the publicity surrounding the expulsion of Valeriy Ivanov, First Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Canberra, the Government established a Royal Commission to review the activities of Australian Security and Intelligence Agencies. Justice Hope was again Royal Commissioner.</p>
<p>Justice Hope completed his report in December 1984. His recommendations included that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the security related activities which ASIO should investigate be redefined. References to subversion and terrorism be removed and replaced with politically motivated violence, attacks on Australia’s defence system and promoting communal violence;</li>
<li>ASIO be given additional functions of collecting foreign intelligence and providing protective security advice; and that</li>
<li>a separate office of <a href="../../../i/n/s/Inspector-General_of_Intelligence_and_Security_5cea.html" title="Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security">Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security</a> be established.</li>
</ul>
<p>Justice Hope also recommended that amendments to the ASIO Act provide that “<i>it is not the purpose of the Act that the right of lawful advocacy, protest or dissent should be affected or that exercising those rights should, by themselves, constitute activity prejudicial to security</i>”.</p>

<dl>
<dd>"<i>Consistent with the philosophy of a separation of the assessment, policy and foreign intelligence collection functions, the Government considers that the existing roles of the individual agencies remain valid in the 1990s. The rationale outlined by Mr Justice Hope for ASIO as a freestanding, non-executive, advisory intelligence security agency remains relevant in the 1990s and the Government has therefore decided that ASIO should continue to have the roles and responsibilities laid down in existing legislation."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Soviet threat certainly formed an important component of ASIO’s activities, but threats from other sources of foreign interference and politically motivated violence have been important to ASIO for some time, and will remain so. However, the implications for ASIO of the changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are more far-reaching than for the other agencies. The Government has therefore decided that while ASIO’s capacity to meet its responsibilities must be maintained, there is scope for resource reductions.<i>"</i></p>
<p>The resource reductions mentioned were a cut of 60 staff and a $3.81 million budget decrease.</p>

<p>Following the trial of George Sadil over the ASIO mole scandal and from concern about the implications of material having been removed from ASIO without authority, the Prime Minister announced the appointment of Mr. Michael Cook AO (former head of the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_of_National_Assessments_d647.html" title="Office of National Assessments">Office of National Assessments</a>) to inquire into various aspects of national security.

<p>The Parliamentary Joint Committee completed several reviews and inquiries into ASIO during the 1990s. The first concerned the security assessment process. Another was held in September into “<i>The nature, scope and appropriateness of the way in which ASIO reports to the Australian public on its activities</i>.” The Committee concluded that “<i>the total package of information available to the Australian community about ASIO's operations exceeds that available to citizens in other countries about their domestic intelligence agencies</i>.” Pursuant to this, recommendations were made regarding the ASIO website and other publicly accessible information.</p>

<p>ASIO has been accused of executing an agenda against the Left of politics since its inception. In particular, during the investigation of "The Case" in the 1950’s, circumstantial links were noted between the leader of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a> and the Communist Party of Australia (and hence to the Soviet spy ring). H.V. Evatt, the leader of the Labor Party at the time, accused Prime Minister <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Menzies_62a5.html" title="Robert Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> of arranging the Petrov defection to discredit him. The accusations lead to a disastrous split in the Labor party.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, ASIO was also accused of neglecting its proper duties because of this supposed preoccupation with targeting the Left. Like other Western domestic security agencies, ASIO actively monitored protesters against the Vietnam War, Labor politicians and various writers, artists and actors who tended towards the Left. Critics of ASIO go further, alleging that the organisation compiled a list of some 10,000 suspected Communist sympathisers who would be interned should the Cold War escalate.</p>

<p>Further accusations against ASIO were raised by the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney-General_0c69.html" title="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a> following a series of bombings from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> on the Yugoslav consulate in Australia by Croatian far-right militia. Attorney-General Lionel Murphy alleged that ASIO had withheld information on the group which could have led to preventative measure taken against further bomb attacks (it must be noted, however, that Murphy was a member of the recently sworn-in Labor government, which still held a deep-seated suspicion of ASIO).</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">15 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, Murphy and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Police_82b0.html" title="Commonwealth Police">Commonwealth Police</a> raided the ASIO offices in Melbourne.

<p>Due to their secretive nature, security and intelligence agencies such as ASIO are often the subject of conspiracy theories regarding their supposed actions. Accusations have been made that such agencies organise or allow terrorist acts to take place to justify their existence, or to increase their budget and powers.</p>
<p>One such occasion was the bombing of the Sydney Hilton Hotel on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_13.html" title="February 13">13 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, one of the few domestic terrorist incidents on Australian soil. The Hotel was the location for the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government_4280.html" title="Commonwealth Heads of Government">Commonwealth Heads of Government</a> Meeting (CHOGM). Three people in the street were killed – two council workers and a policeman – and several others injured. Former police officer Terry Griffiths, who was injured in the explosion, accused ASIO of either orchestrating the bombing or being aware of the possibility and allowing it to proceed. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, the Director-General of Security issued a specific denial of the allegation. Despite this official reassurance, Griffiths has repeatedly called for an inquiry into the bombing, particularly after the three men accused and charged of the bombing were cleared and freed.</p>
