<p>This page should be moved. <i>Aborigine</i> is a noun: the adjective is <i>Aboriginal</i>. Saying <i>Aborigine mythology</i> in talking about the dreamtime is like saying <i>Rome mythology</i> when talking about Romulus and Remus.</p>
<p>Trouble is, I'm not sure what to change it to!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/b/o/Aboriginal_mythology.html" title="Aboriginal mythology">Aboriginal mythology</a> is more grammatical</li>
<li>But perhaps it should be <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Aboriginal_mythology_a9ba.html" title="Australian Aboriginal mythology">Australian Aboriginal mythology</a> as there are Aboriginies in every continent but the entry is only about the Australian ones.</li>
<li>Koori mythology In general, the indigenous word "Koori" is prefered to the European term "Aborigine" which is, if not actually offensive, at least veers marginally in that direction. It's a bit like calling an Innuit an "Eskimo".</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Koori</i> is a word meaning "people" and comes from one of the many Aboriginal languages. Many of the communities in NSW and Victoria used either that word or else a rather similar one prior to the European arrival, and in recent years (satarting around about 1970) there has been a strong movement amongst the indigenous Australian community to use the term <i>Koori</i> instead of <i>Aborigine</i>. We should respect that.</p>
<p>However, <i>Koori</i> is a word from only some of the 250-odd Aboriginal languages: strictly it applies only to the people of NSW and perhaps Victoria. It <i>has</i> been adopted by other groups in other states, at least to a certain extent, but I'm not sure if it is considered appropriate to use it nationwide. Does anyone have up-to-date information on this? <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 08:41 Mar 19, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As an Australian, I have to say that Koori isn't a word that's mainstream in the Australian vocabulary. Part of the problem with a native word for the Aboriginals becoming mainstream is that there are competing words from different Aboriginal languages. In Queensland they prefer Murri in some places, Bama in others. There are around ten competing terms. Although Aboriginals understandably dislike having to use the English name, it's still more universal, even among Aboriginals themselves. The only real alternative may be "Native Australians", but I haven't heard anyone endorsing that one. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbon_Copy_Man_d6b5.html" title="User:Carbon Copy Man">Carbon Copy Man</a> 13:02, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the article seems to say that all the tribes have the SAME religion. anyone here know whether or not this is actually true or not? <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGringo300_19ab.html" title="User:Gringo300">Gringo300</a> 17:11, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think you can objectively draw lines where one religion ends and another begins, in Aboriginal Australia or anywhere. Traditions between tribes will be the same in some respects and different in others: just how different do they have to be before they stop being two sects of one religion and start being two religions? --<a href="../../../p/t/c/User%7EPtcamn_50b7.html" title="User:Ptcamn">Ptcamn</a> 09:46, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Describing Dreamtime spirits and stories as 'mythology' is entirely subjective and POV. Can I suggest this article be renamed to Australian Aboriginal beliefs (or characters)? <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllinoiserocks_6744.html" title="User:Illinoiserocks">Sambo</a> 16:23, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Depends on your definition of "myth". It doesn't have to mean "false". <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_mythology_d4b7.html" title="Native American mythology">Native American mythology</a> uses the same term in its title. I think it's just the best term for referring to a group of disorganised religious systems. Perhaps this article should model itself after the Native American article? If only I knew where to begin. I know very little about specific Aboriginal cultural groups. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbon_Copy_Man_d6b5.html" title="User:Carbon Copy Man">Carbon Copy Man</a> 13:02, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've seen it explicitly said that Australian Aboriginal beliefs do not include gods. Labelling certain personalities "gods" seems like eurocentrism. Perhaps "spirit" would be more appropriate.</li>
<li>I really don't like the way random personalities from all different cultures are lumped together. It would be much better if they were moved to subpages for each group. --<a href="../../../p/t/c/User%7EPtcamn_50b7.html" title="User:Ptcamn">Ptcamn</a> 19:09, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone with better knowledge than I should organize the terms according to group, but they should not be thrown out just because they need better organization. It's better to have some information on the various names in the Aboriginal cultures than none at all. <a href="../../../t/y/c/Image%7ETycon.jpg_e3bd.html" class="image" title="Image:Tycon.jpg"><img src="../../../upload/c/c1/Tycon.jpg" alt="Image:Tycon.jpg" width="25" height="21" longdesc="../../../t/y/c/Image%7ETycon.jpg_e3bd.html" /></a><b><a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoyoty_72ae.html" title="User:Coyoty">Coyoty</a></b> 18:12, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is true - there are no Gods as such in Aboriginal lore - there are Creation beings, Ancestor figures and so on. There is also a pantheon of creatures: Mimi; various types of Hairymen; beings malignant, friendly and indifferent, etc. Again, to say "an Aboriginal" anything is very misleading (see my remark in Koori). I've often seen "the Aboriginal word for..." but there's no such thing. Even to say the "NSW Aboriginal word for.." is wrong. An Aboriginal maybe but not the. It does need reorganising in Wikipedia, true, but it needs to be done by someone with authority - and most with authority or interest are strapped for time. I have a lot of knowledge but no formal qualifications and so no authority.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I have seen on Wikipdeia, <b>aboriginal word for</b> means nobody has bothered finding out what indigenous language group the word came from. It is still an aboriginal word, though. A bit like saying "cafe" is a european word (because french is a european language)<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 06:35, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b> I think if you move it all to Indigenous you imply that those practices also apply to Torres Strait Island peoples, who seem to generally get overlooked in the discussion of Indigenous Australians. While Aboriginal culture varies from langauge group to language group, it has some fairly basic consistencies, while Torres Strait Islander culture is substantially different, being a Melanesian culture more closely linked to PNG. 138.25.252.110 02:39, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> Aren't decendants of the colonial poulation indigenous as well? Her Majesty Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia uses the term "Australian aborignals" on the website of the Royal Family. Her Majesty's preference for this term means something - under International Law all Australian citizens are her legal property. Premier 07:34, 12 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are confusing two different senses in which words like <i>indigenous</i> are used. One is the common, everyday adjectival sense meaning simply "born in, local to" (your meaning), while the other is the more formal and particular sense whose practical interpretation is more specialised and restrictive, and associated with identity and collective rights as <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_peoples.html" title="Indigenous peoples">indigenous peoples</a> (see article). This latter sense is very widely recognised for eg. in national/international laws, regulations and treaties across the globe, and is only tangentially-related to the common adjectival definition. If in any further doubt that such distinctions in meaning are valid and are observed, peruse the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/" class="external text" title="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/" rel="nofollow">UN's PFII website</a> or any of hundreds of others which deal with the concept. I don't really see that there's any particular danger that an article entitled <i>Indigenous Australian X</i> could be confused with the former, or not readily understood to be concerned with the latter, of these two meanings.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 01:42, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> per scope problems. AFAICT all those articles refer only to the mainland Aborigins, as opposed to Torres Strait Islanders. Merging these topics (appropriate TSI articles don't exist yet?) would obviously be silly, as the two groups are fairly distinct in most aspects. The "Indigenous" should be preserved only where they're referred to commonly, such as in politic issues. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 15:52, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

A potentially better solution might be to split "Australian Aboriginal..." into multiple articles in some cases, if we can find appropriate reliable references to identify the boundaries. "Mythology" appears to already be a redirect, but does not even mention in passing Torres Strait Islanders.

<p>These can't be dealt with <i>en bloc</i>. The main page, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Indigenous Australians</a>, covers all the indigenous peoples of Australia, including Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders (and thus is properly located at that title).

<dd>Well I'm looking at this article, and it looks like it's about all Indigenous Australians, not just the Aborigines. As for the languages, it looks like they can be grouped together under "Australian languages" or "Indigenous Australian languages". But let's see how things work out. I'm open to removing the language move for now if it's going to be problematic. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZarbat_e4ce.html" title="User:Zarbat">Zarbat</a> 03:39, 12 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>All the pages mooted for moving deal specifically with Aborigines and don't mention Torres Strait Island culture as far as I can see. Perhaps separate Torres Strait Island culture pages could be created in the future to correspond with these? I don't think changing to Indigenous does Torres Strait Island people and culture justice. For example, I don't know about TSI kinship, but I don't think they have skin system in the way Aboriginal groups do. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDRyan_966e.html" title="User:DRyan">DRyan</a> 09:10, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A problem seems to be that the links <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html#Religion" title="Indigenous Australians">here</a> direct at "Indigenous Australian ..." but then redirect to "Australian Aboriginal ...". There seems to be some sort of a confusion as to whether the two groups (Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders) should be treated seperately or lumped together as "Indigenous Australians". The other move <a href="../../../a/u/s/Talk%7EAustralian_Aboriginal_culture_1597.html#Requested_move" title="Talk:Australian Aboriginal culture">here</a> seems to be passing pretty smoothly, so I don't really know what to think now. I guess it's better to do this on a case-by-case basis, but I don't really have the time, so I'm just going to accept the outcome of this survey. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZarbat_e4ce.html" title="User:Zarbat">Zarbat</a> 10:16, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It may be the case that we end up with some moving that are fairly uncontroversial or can be easily fixed to be entirely inclusive, while others will end up disambiguated so that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander customs/traditions/etc can be addressed in separate articles in cases where a notable article can be written about each fork in the divide. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User%7EOrderinchaos78_0cc3.html" title="User:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orderinchaos78_01d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orderinchaos78">c</a>)</sup> 18:17, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the proposer and I thought that there would be a consensus to move these pages based on that previous discussion. If you look carefully, most people who opposed that previous move are supporting this move. In any case what I meant to say was that this is just a <i>proposal</i> and no one assumed there would be a consensus (or we would have moved the pages without even discussing anything).

<dd>Well, any such descendant (or indeed, any individual born in AU) would be quite at liberty to describe themselves as "indigenous to Australia". However, this does not alter the fact that the nominal phrase "Indigenous Australians" has a particular and well-defined separate meaning as well, as a collective term for the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_peoples.html" title="Indigenous peoples">indigenous peoples</a> in Australia per the sense of this present article. The two levels of meanings here are not mutually exclusive, and there should be no grounds for confusion; it's irrelevant.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 23:59, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Because it's not confusing and it's not objectionable. The phrase "Indigenous Australians" has a definite and distinct meaning, namely the indigenous peoples of Australia. Any person born in Australia might like to call themselves indigenous, but they would be misusing the word. In this context, "indigenous" has the sense of something autochthonous or endemic (as opposed to something innate or intrinsic), and using it to describe any people other than the indigenous peoples of Australia, or as you like to call them, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indigenous_Australians&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88227943" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indigenous_Australians&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88227943" rel="nofollow">"people of colour"</a>, demonstrates an incomprehension of the English language. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 04:01, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to clarify, (and at the risk of repeating myself,) I have never heard anyone object to the term <i>aboriginal</i>, in fact it is a source of great pride to many to be aboriginal. It is <i>aborigine</i> that is offensive in some contexts. Frankly I do not understand why this is so, or exactly which contexts these are, but it's taken very seriously by some of those to whom the term is applied, and I'm guessing it is to do with past hurts, of which there are many. In response to this sensitivity, Australian government agencies, church groups and many others now use the term <i>aboriginal</i> rather than <i>aborigine</i>, and I <b>strongly</b> recommend it.
