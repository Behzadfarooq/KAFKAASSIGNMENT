<dd>The University of Sydney club would be a great idea, even though I'm not part of that august institution.

<dd>They'll survive (or at least the ones that don't need funding simply to survive will), although there probably won't be any funding, and definitely won't be any after the end of first semester.

<dd>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Sydney_Union_912c.html" title="University of Sydney Union">University of Sydney Union</a>, for the moment, has no intention of cutting funding to clubs once VSU kicks in - at the very least, it will provide funding for its members, as opposed to those students who are not.

<dd>The USYD club could be affiliated with a local chapter (a branch maybe?) but the chapter would be broader than the club. The idea would be for a group of people across Australia to work towards the goals of the chapter - <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECartman02au_fef5.html" title="User:Cartman02au">Cartman02au</a> 11:04, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What are the goals of the chapter? There are four general goals, of course, but what are some things we can do now to help the chapter? Probably an example of each goal. Probably get more of us, to fill in for example, the ABN form. That form asks for at least six director-type people. I know we're canvassing 'people interested' at the moment, and there are a few of us who might, while interested, might not be capable or willing to carry out that type of role. <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEuropracBHIT_594d.html" title="User:EuropracBHIT">User:EuropracBHIT</a>

<ul>
<li>A chapter would take the form of an non-profit organisation. Unfortunately from what I have done with non-profits before fundraising for a non-religious organisation is quite difficult (many government issues to be aware of). At the moment the chapter needs supporters. The six director-type people would probably be elected by chapter members. I am envisioning that either the chapter would be set up as an incorporated association (much like a small club) or a non-profit company. The first is registered in a single state, so I am not 100% on how this works nationally. The second is expensive so that in itself is an obstacle - <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECartman02au_fef5.html" title="User:Cartman02au">Cartman02au</a> 04:33, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It would be a good idea to have Wikimedia Australia incorporated (and have a presence in all the states and Canberra and Darwin). This site, OurCommunity, explains the procedure to have it done in Victoria. It needs five people only, for a start, and is under the 1981 Incorporation Act, and there's a Public Officer. Here it is: <a href="http://www.ourcommunity.com.au/management/view_help_sheet.do?articleid=15&amp;printable|Our" class="external text" title="http://www.ourcommunity.com.au/management/view_help_sheet.do?articleid=15&amp;printable|Our" rel="nofollow">Community: how to make an incorporated association in Victoria</a>.</li>

<li>Thankyou so much for that. Does incorporation in one state give the organisation legal status in other states?

<dd>Incorporating would give legal status throughout Australia.

<dd>I <i>think</i> it's a non-profit organisation (I am going off the US foundation), which is not quite the same as a charity, except for all practical purposes it is. I suppose in some ways it will have to run as a business. The main thing is: whether we are having to pay tax and whether anybody gets paid. --<a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEuropracBHIT_594d.html" title="User:EuropracBHIT">EuropracBHIT</a> 23:17, 9 January 2006 (UTC).

<li>You are correct. Unfortunately income tax exemption and deductible gift recipient status is difficult to gain in Australia unless you are a religious organisation. Gaining a fundraising licence in NSW is also difficult for the same reasons - <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECartman02au_fef5.html" title="User:Cartman02au">Cartman02au</a> 04:33, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't really think of myself as an anarchist, but I'd question whether the existance of any body corporate is needed (though a uni club seems the least beaurocratic option). I can't see it being worthwhile unless more than roughly $1000 is going to be spent by the organisation, or a legal entity needs to exist (for example, a bushwalking group may need public liability insurance). And if we spend more than $1000, we might be spending too much... <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 11:24, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But isn't the point of opening a local chapter so that donations for Aussies will be tax-deductable? So I think we need the bureaucracy unfortunately. <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 13:22, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're right, Andjam, that we who look after the Wikimedia Australia need to be as fiscally responsible/conservative as we can be. One expense for the chapter might be running Australian servers for the Wikipedia to go on, in case the Florida ones fizzle - just to make things run faster and more conveniently (that would be a lot more than $1000, I presume, <i>unless</i> we use Computerbank or something of that kind). I also agree that a university club (or a dozen) would be the one with the minimal bureaucracy. However, the 1981 Association Incorporation Act is meant to be easy and inexpensive with all the legal/moral/ethical protections required.</dd>
<dd>And Pfctdayelise (and everyone interested), there is more to Wikimedia Australia than tax-deductible donations. A lot, lot more. Like one umbrella to have Wiki activities, for social and educational purposes, as well as economic ones. Also so we can have a point of contact if there was ever an interview which required an Australian point of view. We are a vast continent full of enthusiastic Wiki users. We could be there to give guidance.</dd>
<dd>May I say that I usually feel uncomfortable with "devils' advocate" type arguments as I feel I am being baited and I would not make the decisions as clearly as I would otherwise. What do others think about the purposes of Wikimedia Australia? If we are going to be an incorporated association/company, we'd better have our purposes clear. If we're not prepared to take that step, then I completely respect that, but only if it's backed by consensus.</dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Local chapter: Tax Deductible donations</span></h4>
<p>The comment <i>"Unfortunately income tax exemption and deductible gift recipient status is difficult to gain in Australia unless you are a religious organisation. Gaining a fundraising licence in NSW is also difficult for the same reasons"</i> was made above. I disagree. There are numerous tests for religious organisations derived from numerous court cases. It probably is easier to get deductibility status for educational purposes. Obviously the purpose needs to be stated clearly. Most schools have a library fund associated with them, which has dectibility status. Some have a building fund. The entities running the funds need to be incorporated - the money needs to be associated with an entity other than individuals. Incorporation requires an AGM, lodging a return, audited accounts, office bearers. Incorporation is done at the state level. From my ACT P&amp;C experience, P&amp;Cs are not charge the exorbitant fees normal entities are charged for lodging their annual returns. The funds have separate bank accounts and their accounts are maintained, audited and lodged separately. I am not sure whether enough donations would be attracted to make the set up and maintenance effort worthwhile.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 18:59, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While it does seem it would be a lot of work, we only need to look at Wikimedia Deutschland as an example of what can be achieved by having a national chapter - they're received quite a lot of donations. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 20:56, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Unfortunately my experience (in NSW) has not been as pleasant. The Department of Gaming and Racing states religious entities can fundraise without a licence, others must gain one which is a pain. The tax office also haven't been that pleasant.</dd>
<dd>As much as I'd like to keep it simple, incorporation is better to be done at an early stage, rather than when the organisation outgrows the system - <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECartman02au_fef5.html" title="User:Cartman02au">Cartman02au</a> 02:44, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Queensland is a very large state with a disparate population (60% of which live outside of Brisbane), and the Queensland Government tends to divide things up into regions for administrative purposes. I’m not ‘’exactly’’ sure where FNQ starts but it is either just north or just south of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardwell%2C_Queensland_9ca0.html" title="Cardwell, Queensland">Cardwell</a>. It does include <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innisfail%2C_Queensland_e24b.html" title="Innisfail, Queensland">Innisfail</a>, but does not include <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingham%2C_Queensland_3dd8.html" title="Ingham, Queensland">Ingham</a>, which is closer to Cairns than Townsville.</dd>
<dd>There are nearly 100 articles in the Far North Queensland category, which indicates that there is a significant amount of information in wikipedia on the area. When I created the category some time ago I felt that it would be useful to readers and editors to have all the articles linked by way of a category. Other people have since also been placing articles in that category.</dd>
<dd>I don’t see why significant regions shouldn’t have sub-categories if there were enough articles to warrant them. <a href="../../../g/o/l/Category%7EGold_Coast_dce2.html" title="Category:Gold Coast">Category:Gold Coast</a> is another regional sub-categories that currently exists. The difference between Queensland and most other states is that the other states are more centralised and in some cases have smaller populations, so there is less to write about outside the capital cities. That said other regional sub categories might include the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunter_Valley_c5c5.html" title="Hunter Valley">Hunter Valley</a> region, <a href="../../../g/i/p/Gippsland.html" title="Gippsland">Gippsland</a> (lots of wikilinks there!), and the <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilbara_region_of_Western_Australia_7793.html" title="Pilbara region of Western Australia">Pilbara</a>/<a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimberley_region_of_Western_Australia_af8c.html" title="Kimberley region of Western Australia">Kimberley region of Western Australia</a> might be another. There are also city sub-categories in NSW such as <a href="../../../n/e/w/Category%7ENewcastle%2C_New_South_Wales_8843.html" title="Category:Newcastle, New South Wales">Category:Newcastle, New South Wales</a>. (none of which have as many articles as <a href="../../../f/a/r/Category%7EFar_North_Queensland_3e4e.html" title="Category:Far North Queensland">Category:Far North Queensland</a>. <a href="../../../s/u/b/Category%7ESuburbs_of_the_Blue_Mountains_1625.html" title="Category:Suburbs of the Blue Mountains">Category:Suburbs of the Blue Mountains</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/g/Category%7ERegions_of_Sydney_a802.html" title="Category:Regions of Sydney">Category:Regions of Sydney</a> already exist as regional subcategories. There is also a subcategory for Category:Newcastle, NSW sports teams for example – so I think where there are enough articles, there is no reason not to have regional sub categories, its just a matter of working out how to fit the articles into the bigger picture.</dd>
<dd>In the case of Tasmania you wouldn't have "Deep South Tasmania" unless it was a recognised region. You'd more likely have Huon Valley, North West etc. ... if there were enough articles to warrant it. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 03:23, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

I would appreciate some feedback if people wouldn't mind casting an eye over it.

Also, if anybody has some time on their hands and feels like creating some maps, I've left some links on the talk page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Universities</span></h2>
<p>Most Australian University pages don't have much detial on notable alumni and staff. Although they can be prone to non-notable additions, they do tend to make a mess on the University page. I have made a few lists from the exisitng pages, if anyone wants to make one for their uni I have named them (like the US articles) List of X university people, and put them in the cat Category:Lists of people by university affiliation - Australia. If anyone is super keen the best organised of these lists I've seen is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Columbia_University_people_722a.html" title="List of Columbia University people">List of Columbia University people</a>.</p>
<p>Should chancellor and VC lists also be merged into these lists, I don't really see much need to separate lists for these and very few Australian Unis have these lists so far?--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 23:08, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Sydney_fa65.html" title="University of Sydney">University of Sydney</a>, the chancellor and vc are currently in separate articles, but that's because we don't have a proper staff list.

<dd>I would be very surprised if <i>any</i> article on a VC was deleted. They're very often notable academics or otherwise important people anyway (ANU's is a former Cabinet minister at present), and even if they were just university administrators, I suspect a lot of people would vote keep based on the prominence of the position. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 11:22, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is true that "football" is starting to gain currency in Australia as the correct term for football. I couldn't care less what they want to call their code - I object to the fact that they try to make themselves out to be the original football code - and anyone who has even the slightest idea of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Rules_Football_546f.html" title="Australian Rules Football">Australian Rules Football</a> would know that it is a no contest - the history of our game can stand tall alongside any other modern code you wish to mention. So it is this idea of exclusion (we are the one and only code that can use the term football) that I object strongly to. The other thing is that "soccer" is known throughout the english speaking world, so this rush to use "football" exclusively smacks of POV. Lastly, an interesting side point, in one of the Wiggles tapes, I notice that Anthony is speaking to a Mexican boy who explains in Spanish that <i>soccer es uno di mis favoridos jogos</i> or something similiar - I think we get the picture of what he is saying! But the point is that people will try to say that word soccer is not known outside of the english speaking word, to which I say 1. irrelevant, this is the english wikipedia, and 2. in any event, you're wrong! <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Sicily.svg_42ed.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/7a/Flag_of_Sicily.svg/40px-Flag_of_Sicily.svg.png" alt="" width="40" height="27" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Sicily.svg_42ed.html" /></a> <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 01:22, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's more important to establish the correct term for the specific article, not changing our language for the sake of universalising it. My feeling is that if the article is about an Australian topic, then it should use Australian terminology (despite what SBS chooses to do). As far as I understand, this is standard Wikipedia practice. And if Australian's happen to call cars "horseless carts", then our article should reflect that too. Of course, back in my day, suitcases were known as "Swedish lunchboxes", but nobody knew that except me. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 13:35, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some Australian Coat of Arms are covered by odd copyrights for example the SA Coat of Arms is the <a href="http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/Catalog/legislation/Acts/u/1916.1242.htm|Unauthorised" class="external text" title="http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/Catalog/legislation/Acts/u/1916.1242.htm|Unauthorised" rel="nofollow">Documents Act 1916</a> which specifies that no person can print, publish or manufacture the symbol without permission. Queensland is copvered by the <a href="http://www.premiers.qld.gov.au/Government/emblems/coatofarms/" class="external text" title="http://www.premiers.qld.gov.au/Government/emblems/coatofarms/" rel="nofollow">Emblems of Queensland Act 2005</a>. They probably all need to be checked. I think that there may also be some info on flags and Coat of Arms in the Copyright Act 1968. Any of the newer flags will most probably be copyrighted (NT, ACT, Aboriginal, Torres Strait).--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 02:04, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've got to admit, I'm drawn to both sides of the debate here. Drew, I respect your view on the bias of biographical history, but I can see how others would view this as setting a precedence. You explain in the AfD discussion that about 100 of the 9000 transported to WA have been subject to biographical review. It seems that the only way this will pass through AfD will be if you can explain what makes John Warren notable - because at the moment it seems that being a convict and a teacher aren't cutting it. I had one of my own articles up there recently, so I know how it feels. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 06:33, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Cnwb and Ambi. Permit me to repeat that I'm not looking for support here; I'm looking for considered input of any kind, but from a wider range of contributors than the regular AFD voters. The decision here will affect my future contributions to Wikipedia. I have a 144 page book <i>Unbroken Spirit: The Life of William Boxhal: Convict 3744</i> sitting here on my desk in front of me.

<dd>Thanks for the heads up Slac. It might also be an idea to work on some of the articles for some of the likely contenders for the Premiership.

<dd>Done (does this count as quickly? I'm a day late). Of course, the articles need a great deal of expansion, particularly Mr McGinty's. By the way, I note our coverage of Western Australian Legislative Assembly electorates is rather poor; none of these four have articles on their electorates.

<p>I descided to keep the Bridges by City categories, and just add the Bridges by State cats intermediately (to preserve cross categorisation, eg to cats like <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETransport_in_Melbourne_648a.html" title="Category:Transport in Melbourne">Category:Transport in Melbourne</a>).--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 13:49, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Just to note that the only article in the Bridges category left is Murray River crossings, because of course many of those bridges go from NSW to Victoria, though I think they are in fact all NSW bridges as the border is to the south of the Murray - must check and update the article ... I think the sub-categorisation is perhaps a bit over the top given the number of articles we have on bridges. Are you planning to add a significant number of new articles?</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Bridges in Australia 1 article 6 sub categories

<dd>I don't think more information is presented to the reader. The location of the bridge is in the article text. Categories are useful for locating articles on similar topics, but is that what you are trying to do? Was a list of 32 too big? Editors interested in a particular topic can use the "Related Changes" function to find pages which are newly in a category and this can be useful to editors working on a particular theme. A category is not a list, and perhaps what you are trying to achive might be beter achieved by a list, I am not sure. Perhaps if you could articulate what is sought to be achieved by the creation of 11 sub categories for 32 articles.</dd>

<dd>sorry, didn't fully address the question above <i>"How much more expansion of the state bridges is required to warrant the new cat system?"</i> I can't find any guidance on wikipedia pages. However, up to 200 pages will be listed on a single caegory page. I would say that until we have exceeded double the number of existing Australian bridge articles (ie &gt; 64) sub categories may not be necessary. Just my opinion and could be altered by disproportionate number of articles for one river (the Murray for example) or one city, eg Brisbane is already at 12, straight State then city based might not be the most useful breakdown - eg the Murray might be a useful sub cat - at least 46 crossings.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 00:17, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Murray is of course why a state based system is less than useful. When the article is written on Bethanga Bridge near <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellbridge%2C_Victoria_70e7.html" title="Bellbridge, Victoria">Bellbridge, Victoria</a>, how would you categorise it? It will be pedantic, although accurate, to say it is NSW.

<li>But categories are not exclusive. Why can't we have the one bridge listed in both "Bridges in NSW" and "Bridges in VIC"? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 00:57, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal to re-organise categories relating to Australian Parliaments</span></h2>
<p>In December 2005 there was a brief discussion at WP:AWNB regarding sorting out categories relating to the various Parliaments in Australia.

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_politics_in_Australia_e402.html" title="Gun politics in Australia">Gun politics in Australia</a> NPOV dispute</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I'm hoping some experienced Australian Wikipedians can come and lend a hand at <a href="../../../g/u/n/Talk%7EGun_politics_in_Australia_71f5.html#.22Gun_control_over_gun_rights_in_the_gun_politics_debate.22" title="Talk:Gun politics in Australia">Talk:Gun politics in Australia</a>. I reverted a series of edits by <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">User:Yaf</a> which more or less replaced all instances of the phrase "gun control" with "gun control over gun rights in the gun politics debate". Apart from being ridiculously unwieldy, it is completely unnecessary. He claims that the very term "gun control" is biased towards the gun-control POV... as if the term "abortion debate" is also inherently pro-abortion, or "republic debate" is pro-republic. The three most active editors of the page (myself included) agreed it should be removed, so I did so. Now <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">User:Yaf</a> has slapped a NPOV tag on the page, claiming it is biased against gun owners. I am unsure how to proceed. I think this is unjustified, since the page has arrived at its present balance by careful editing including response to previous NPOV disputes where bias was claimed to exist in the other direction. Moreover although we strive to present a NPOV, I and at least one other editor are strongly opposed to present levels of gun control so it's fairly ludicrous to suggest we're supporting bias <i>in favour</i> of gun control. It's my view that an article is acceptably NPOV if a majority of active, well-informed level-headed editors reach consensus, and this doesn't change due to one dissenting view from someone who hasn't edited the article before and doesn't even live in Australia (and therefore doesn't know what is "neutral" in that context). However I've not been involved in a dispute were negotion/capitulation has failed before so that's why I'm asking for more experienced opinions as to how things should proceed and whether I'm right or wrong in objecting to the NPOV tag. This article seems to have it slapped on so regularly, from both sides of the debate, that I fear it will spend more time with the tag than without, despite being (IMO) quite a good article.

<p>I think we can probably resolve this problem if someone gave the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_food.html" title="Street food">street food</a> article a definition of <i>street food</i>.

<dd><i><b>Street food</b> is food obtainable from a street corner vendor.</i> There, fixed the page. So you have to be able to buy it without leaving the sidewalk. Sausage sizzles sounds like it; school-canteen food only counts if schools usually put their canteens on the street. I'd also only include things that are common; one Vietnamese street food stand in Porpoise Spit, Australia doesn't deserve a mention unless it's otherwise notable.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AWNB overhaul</span></h2>
<p>I've again had a fiddle and given this noticeboard an attempted overhaul. <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_AWNB_6093.html" title="User:Longhair/AWNB">See my recent effort here</a>. To summarise what I've done, I've used the Canadian notice board as a starting ground and localised their example for our needs and made a few further tweaks I felt improved the layout.</p>
<p>I think separating discussions that take place here onto their own page as per my example will help reduce much of the clutter and possibly not scare away a lot of new users not knowing how to navigate successfully.</p>
<p>The template on the right of my example wouldn't be too difficult to include into your user pages if that's what people wanted as well. Let me know what you think. After all the good work we do elsewhere at Wikipedia with articles and the like, I'd love to see this very page given an overhaul as well so we can get back to the real work at hand. If anything, a discussion on changes or improvements to this board would be become. I'm hoping for a design that allows at a glance anyone to navigate wherever they need. Currently, it's a nightmare for some. - <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 08:17, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good work! I think it is definitely an improvement on what we've got at the moment. Can I make a few suggestions?
<ul>
<li>Firstly, I'd suggest that we create a shortcut to the discussion page if we place it somewhere other than on the main noticeboard page (easilly done). - perhaps WP:AWNBD .</li>
<li>Secondly, It might just be my aversion to overt displays of nationalism on Wikipedia, and I realise that different people will have different views about this, but I think that the coat of arms is a bit 'in your face'. I don't mind there being a coat of arms and a flag, but don't see the need for it to be so big. If you want to use something large for formatting/layout, perhaps we could use a map. 'WikiNationalism'. Other national notice boards to compare with: <a href="../../../s/w/n/WP%7ESWNB_2064.html" title="WP:SWNB">WP:SWNB</a>, <a href="../../../u/k/w/WP%7EUKWNB_43b5.html" title="WP:UKWNB">WP:UKWNB</a>, <a href="../../../n/z/w/WP%7ENZWNB_d7fa.html" title="WP:NZWNB">WP:NZWNB</a>, <a href="../../../p/w/n/WP%7EPWNB_2e6e.html" title="WP:PWNB">WP:PWNB</a> and the one you used as a template, <a href="../../../c/w/n/WP%7ECWNB_3761.html" title="WP:CWNB">WP:CWNB</a>.</li>

<dd>Can I suggest that we instead run with Cyberjunkie's original idea? I agree that this does need to be overhauled, but I <i>really</i> don't like the idea of farming off the discussion to other places - since that was the reason this page was created in the first place. The best thing about this page is that it provides an easy and prompt way to contact most of the Australian Wikipedians, and putting the discussion on less-highly-read pages (especially to replace this with a near-static page) doesn't help things. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:20, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">People of/people from categories</span></h2>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Recently all the categories of the form [[Category:People <i>of</i> State]] were renamed to the form [[:Category:People <i>from</i> State]]. While the renaming was made for eminently sensible reasons, to my mind the change implies a profound change of category semantics. Whereas "People of" allowed the inclusion of any person important to the culture of a state or territory, "People from" implies birth in or at least substantial early development in a state or territory.</p>
<p>In the case of Western Australia, the effects are huge. W.A.'s three biggest historical figures? <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Stirling_%28Australian_governor%29_0bf1.html" title="James Stirling (Australian governor)">Stirling</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Forrest_2c7d.html" title="John Forrest">Forrest</a>, <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._Y._O%27Connor_7862.html" title="C. Y. O'Connor">O'Connor</a>; only one qualifies as "from" W.A. Our sportspeople? <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Gilchrist_ed25.html" title="Adam Gilchrist">Adam Gilchrist</a> is "from" New South Wales; <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damien_Martyn_5a9b.html" title="Damien Martyn">Damien Martyn</a>, Northern Territory; <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Judd_6cbc.html" title="Chris Judd">Chris Judd</a>, Victoria; <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_F._Bell_518f.html" title="Peter F. Bell">Peter F. Bell</a>, South Korea. Our premiers? <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Daglish_5bdf.html" title="Henry Daglish">Daglish</a> was from Ballarat. Our musicians? <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Butler_%28musician%29_02e3.html" title="John Butler (musician)">John Butler</a> was born in California. Even our <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Bond_%28businessman%29_1735.html" title="Alan Bond (businessman)">best known criminal</a> was born elsewhere.</p>
<p>Because of this, there is hardly a subcategory of Western Australian people that can now be listed as a sub-category of <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_from_Western_Australia_89e9.html" title="Category:People from Western Australia">Category:People from Western Australia</a>. <a href="../../../w/e/s/Category%7EWest_Coast_Eagles_players_796f.html" title="Category:West Coast Eagles players">Category:West Coast Eagles players</a>? No, plenty are "from" other states. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Category%7EConvicts_transported_to_Western_Australia_1101.html" title="Category:Convicts transported to Western Australia">Category:Convicts transported to Western Australia</a>? No, they came from England. <a href="../../../g/o/v/Category%7EGovernors_of_Western_Australia_27ca.html" title="Category:Governors of Western Australia">Category:Governors of Western Australia</a>, no; <a href="../../../p/r/e/Category%7EPremiers_of_Western_Australia_92ad.html" title="Category:Premiers of Western Australia">Category:Premiers of Western Australia</a>, no; <a href="../../../e/x/p/Category%7EExplorers_of_Western_Australia_4fa3.html" title="Category:Explorers of Western Australia">Category:Explorers of Western Australia</a>, no.</p>
<p>To my mind this change of a single word means that we no longer have a workable system for categorizing people of cultural importance to a state or territory. And I really don't think that's acceptable. While I do support the existence of "from" categories, I wonder what people think of the idea of establishing the two categorizations in parallel. There are precedents for this; for example <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_explorers_6773.html" title="Category:Australian explorers">Category:Australian explorers</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/p/Category%7EExplorers_of_Australia_c656.html" title="Category:Explorers of Australia">Category:Explorers of Australia</a>.</p>

<dd>The problem isn't unique to Australia, most places have a "people from" category, which generally includes people that are born in a place, or spend a large portion of their life there - you tend to get a lot of these cateogries applied to "international" people, which I don't really think is a problem. Looking at the way these catgories are used in Wikipedia not being born in a place doens't seem to exclude a person as being "person from place".</dd>

Unless the explorers of Western Australia are from WA, they shouldn't be a subcat of the People from WA category. I've discussed what I think should be done with convicts on Drew's talk page.</dd>

<p>There has been an addition of photo links to a few town articles from the IP , User:144.137.15.187, for example <a href="http://www.travelvictoria.com.au/euroa/photos" class="external text" title="http://www.travelvictoria.com.au/euroa/photos" rel="nofollow">Photos of Euroa</a> to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euroa%2C_Victoria_1205.html" title="Euroa, Victoria">Euroa, Victoria</a>.

I don't see similar categories for other countries</i>". I'm not really sure thats a decent reason, and I don't see what's POV about it. Do you think its a case for deletion review or should it be recreated as Category:Australian sporting events?

<dd>Would 'prominent' be a better word? The articles/items <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing_Day_Test_ce11.html" title="Boxing Day Test">Boxing Day Test</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_to_Hobart_Yacht_Race_0d0a.html" title="Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race">Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL_Grand_Final_9ad3.html" title="AFL Grand Final">AFL Grand Final</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Open_bdfe.html" title="Australian Open">Australian Open</a> are 'Major Australian sporting events' (and there would be a few media mentions to back that up). I'd expect a Category:Major US sporting events to include the superbowl, the world series, daytona, kentucky derby, verious hosted olympics etc, and theres nothing POV about that either. If it's a major event, it usually garners a large amount of media coverage (and is probbably covered live), and could do with its own category.

<dd>I think the category should be Category:Australian sporting events. If and when someone writes an article on the Whim Creek Egg and Spoon Race Olympics, we can start worrying about how to create a more exclusive yet NPOV category.

<dd>A general category is a good idea. By adding notable or major, you are making a judgment about the importance of an event, and categories shouldn't do that.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 00:03, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a post above, but I'll bump this up. We seem to have lost the ability to edit individual sections, which is <i>really</i> problematic. I've checked this page and the transcluded subpages, but I can't see a __NOEDITSECTION__ or similar, so I'm baffled as to what's going on. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 23:17, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
