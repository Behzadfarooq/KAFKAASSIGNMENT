<p>The article says that New Zealanders have never forgiven Australia for the underarm bowling incident. I think we have. It's a good natured joke these days, surely. It also says we define our national identity as distinct to Australia, in an Anti-Australian way. What???? I reckon we just are who we are, and Australia has nothing to do with our identity. <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 05:33, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree 100%. We are close enough to joke - and I think the bowling incident is a great example (fiery at the time, but a reason to poke good-natured fun now), yet we don't define ourselves by the other. Here, NZ is a place of sheep shaggers, who are fun to get along with even though they speak strangely and say 'sex' too much. I guess the NZers have their own jokes about us, but certainly don't need to define themselves by us - they have a distinct culture which, although not unlike our own, is still its own. katie 12:00, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some Australians have never forgiven other Australians for that incident (me included)!

<p>After living in nz for 3 months, I really enjoyed the people and the country but the media is what I found disturbing. I suppose when about 50% of their news seems to be Australian or Australian related the media does get quite anti Australian at times and not in a joking way. With a show called Ugly Aussies and with a recent sports presenter featuring an item about how funny it was that a NZ female sprinter caused a fight between two Aussie females sprinters so no wonder that the bad attiude gets around. Most people I have met have been great but there still comes across this better than Australia hippie attiude. It does seem similar to the US, Canada relationship. In Aus it seems like we really don't factor NZ into out thinking very much at all other than the odd joke but in NZ, Aus seems to feature so much people feel compeled to fall the tall poppy as they say. An ref the underarm incident, it certainly stings some people still in NZ, while I would never condone it its hardly something to kick up such a fuss so much thats its still apart of NZ culture today and not in Australia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Australian's are apart of the odd joke, but in my opinion that is about it. Australia is a great exporter to New Zealand and that is about it. Two seperate countries, two seperate people - nothing to do with either.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_von_Furrie_1354.html" title="User:Matt von Furrie">Matt von Furrie</a> 09:40, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Somebody should make a section mentioning some jokes that Aussies and Kiwis make about each other. For example, you might have to put it fairly "nicely" but the sheep shagger stereotype MUST be mentioned. 09:05, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Reading the article, I currently agree with the tag at the top of the article, refering to a lack or no references. However, some of the article, to me atleast, reads very POV, with weasel wording -</p>
<ul>
<li>"Consequently, âKiwisâ in Australia are accused of taking local jobs or living on Australian social welfare benefits". Who is accusing them?</li>
<li>"However, there are complaints in New Zealand that Australia is poaching the country's best and brightest, with police forces, schools and hospitals in Australia headhunting or recruiting aggressively across the Tasman" - Who is complaining?</li>
<li>"although some New Zealanders are almost horrified at the idea that they have anything in common with Australians" - More Weasles.</li>
<li>"A comparison could be drawn with American views of Canada." - With no reference, I would take that as somebodies point of view on the relations.</li>
</ul>

<p>I definately think this is biased; not to either side, but it seems to perceive that we don't like each other - I think both countries have a fairly good-natured approach to the other. We make jokes - here in Aus there's the sheep shagger jokes (I've never heard much reference to the mother land in poking fun), and they have their jokes about us. Everyone I've ever met who has made or been the subject of these jokes (NZ or Aussie) has found them humourous. In my time in NZ, I found everyone pretty much as friendly as Aus - not old fashioned, although a little more quaint in places like Christchurch merely because of the conditions of settlement.</p>
<p>The treaty compared with aborigine treatment isn't, I believe, a highly important point - I can see the paralell, but I think it needs to be detailed the separate circumstances - NZ and Aus aren't the same country (obviously) - it wasn't as if 'Australia' chose to treat their indigenous people badly and 'NZ' didn't - British rule was still about, different situations arose on each continent (convict or not), and from what I *believe*, maoris are more 'bound' than aborigines - they had a much smaller, much more inhabitable area to share, whereas aborigines formed many smaller tribes. (this is something I may recall correctly or not).</p>
<p>Generally, Iquite like NZers and their attitudes are fine - we have a competetive streak, and like to beat each other in sport, but unlike situations like the Cronulla Riots, I can't really recall any major tensions (if any at all).</p>

<p>I've added a bilateral graphic and info box to the page to help illustrate the countries involved, using the same template as the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada-United_States_relations_271e.html" title="Canada-United States relations">Canada-United States relations</a> page. In keeping with the title of the page and the alphabetical order I listed the countries as <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> not vica versa... the decision had nothing to do with my Australian birth&#160;;).</p>
<p>It's freaky how similar our flags look. We need new ones!</p>
<p>Let me know if you think it's a bad idea and I'll take it off.</p>
