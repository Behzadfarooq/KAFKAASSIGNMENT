<p>Not to rain on the parade, but is there really a large enough pool of voters for all this officialdom and redtape to be neccessary? I would have thought a more informal thing kept on the noticeboard page or a subpage would be enough. But seeing as this is here now, and I will reserve judgement, should non-Australians be allowed to vote?, are votes just votes or are they commitments to edit?, etc etc. <b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User_talk%7ETPK_8851.html" title="User talk:TPK">T.</a></b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK">P.K.</a> <small>06:39, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>I'd like to be able to format the history page in the same way that the main COTW does. Alas, I'm not sure of how to calculate the exact page size in the way that they do. Would anyone be able to do this?</p>

<dd>I <i>think</i> the way it's done is to copy the article text to a text editor that does word/character counting, and counting the characters. 1 char = 1 byte I believe. A quick check on <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclone_Tracy_1ccc.html" title="Cyclone Tracy">Cyclone Tracy</a> gives 15,895 at the end of Oct 2, up from 587 when the COTW template was added (though that's more than a week). That's counting spaces as characters, if you don't, it's 13,718 up from 521. That's also counting everything on the page, including categories, but I guess that's fine. <b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User_talk%7ETPK_8851.html" title="User talk:TPK">T.</a></b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK">P.K.</a> <small>08:34, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)</small>

<dd>I started it off - I included a wordcount as well as a bytecount (which was all characters, including spaces). The counts (and dates) were from the version immediately prior to the inclusion of the ACOTW banner and the version immediately after its removal. <b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User_talk%7ETPK_8851.html" title="User talk:TPK">T.</a></b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK">P.K.</a> <small>10:04, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)</small>

<p>I reverted TPK's change, because it adds unnecessary baggage to voting. Adding #~~~~ adds a number to the list, so it is quite easy to tally up votes. COTW doesn't do it, is there any particular reason why Australians can't count?

<p>Here I am, and my god, what controversy over an innocent little change! I made it to make it easier to tell which article was ahead, either from the TOC, or from quickly scanning the list, rather than scrutinizing each nomination. OK, it breaks the template links; for that reason, prehaps it should be changed, but I still would prefer a big total at the top of each nomination. For clarity's sake.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ACOTW History</span></h2>
<p>Just to make sure all the past ACOTWs are being examined in the same way, I suggest we come up with a specific, standard way of getting word/byte counts and diffs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should the word count include everything in the article source, or only what is visible on the page (i.e. excluding URLs or comments)? Should categories be included in the text?</li>
<li>Same with the bytecount, what part of the article should be counted?</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest that only the visible part of the article (<i>excluding</i> category links - but including everything else including equalsign titles and image captions) should be wordcounted, but that the entire source should be bytecounted; that the '- x times longer' should be calculated from the wordcount and not the bytecount, and that the diff should be from whatever edit the ACTOW banner was inserted in to whatever edit it was removed. Oh, and the bytecount is the number of characters, including spaces (which also count for a byte each).</p>

<li>They should simply be Australian articles that aren't massively long, are seriously in need of lots and lots of work, leave plenty of room for expansion, could be made into a good featured article, and are open to being worked on by many people. It's silly to rule out articles that need help because someone added an extra two paragraphs while the page was on ACOTW. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 13:30, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I assume that 'stubs only' includes pages that haven't been created yet? (Just to clarify). I personally think that 'only articles with scope for expansion' would be better - that would include nonexistant/stub articles, as well as longer articles which would not generally be called a stub, but still clearly could have much more work done. I voted 'oppose' for that reason - I don't think that articles with little room for expansion should be considered, even if they are on Australian topics. <a href="../../../t/p/k/User_talk%7ETPK_8851.html" title="User talk:TPK"><b>T</b>.</a><a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK"><b>PK</b></a> <small>17:07, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</small>

<li>See above. <b>Australian articles with scope for expansion</b> would be the perfect criteria. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphax_a96c.html" title="User:Alphax">Alphax</a> <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphax_ba31.html" title="User talk:Alphax">(talk)</a> 03:45, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)

<li>It is just too vague. I am up for an "exceptions may be accepted" clause, but not for wholesale acceptance of non-stubs. COTWs should be about creating something <b>great</b> out of practically nothing. COTW counts stubs as <i>"Two paragraphs or less of information or fewer than 1,000 characters"</i>.

Perhaps we need to change the nomination process or rid ourselves of a time period altogether and covert the collaboration into a focus on important articles or those that don't come under any WikiProjects. Is the ACOTF truly dead? There's little, if any active interest. Notwithstanding this, the premise of the ACOTF does remain attractive. --<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/15px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png" alt="" width="15" height="8" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie"><font color="green"><b>Cyberjunkie</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie"><sup><b style="font-size:74%;"><font color="gold">TALK</font></b></sup></a> 28 June 2005 05:02 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's safe to say that in this form, it is dead. I actually did do a lot of research for <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin%2C_Northern_Territory_5a73.html" title="Darwin, Northern Territory">Darwin</a>, and still intend to expand that when I get around to it, but it was a bit disconcerting that there was so little interest. <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowy_Mountains_Scheme_659a.html" title="Snowy Mountains Scheme">Snowy Mountains Scheme</a>, while a very worthy topic, really needed people who were prepared and ready to write on it - which it didn't have this time around. However, as we've seen with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> - when people do agree to collaborate on an article, they can turn out some pretty amazing results. The COTW effect was the same - just over a longer period. I think it would be better to make this an indefinite collaboration - working on something until its either featured or people agree to change it. I also think it would be good to keep this in mind when selecting topics - <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> was perfect, but also obvious - we'd need to find ones in the same vein. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 28 June 2005 10:34 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps some Australians don't enjoy being coralled into a particular activity. I have contributed to the Snowy Mountains Scheme article in the past (before the tag was added) and will probably do so again. My husband worked on the Snowy scheme (as did his father and brother). We have driven through the mountains a number of times and the pictures illustrating the article are mine. I just don't easily contribute to order - contributing to the Wiki for me is a break from work. I like the idea of extended collaborations. Thus if one doesn't have one's own ideas about missing information and what one could contribute then fine go for the suggestions and priorities of others. In which case perhaps we need to have several suggestions. This of course is the function of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Wikipedia%7EAustralian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_Complete_to-do_d580.html" title="Wikipedia:Australian Wikipedians' notice board/Complete to-do">To do page</a>.

<p>It isn't working totally properly. I think because of the bit of code that says &amp;action=edit&amp;section=12. Why section = 12? I suggest replacing with the following code:</p>
