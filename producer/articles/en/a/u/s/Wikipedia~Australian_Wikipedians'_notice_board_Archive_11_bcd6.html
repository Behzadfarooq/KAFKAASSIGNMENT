<dd>Looks fair to me. It's clearly labelled that it's the opinion of another party. What I wondered reading the list of links is where are the Liberal and Labor positions? --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 13:23, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's particularly extreme - we don't link to Resistance's opinions of the Liberal Party on their article either. We have a criticism page run by the Democrats; I'd not object to one by the Liberals or Labor either. What I do object to is this particularly extremist stuff, which verges well into the realm of POV pushing (as shown by the support of the article so strongly rebuked by the Press Council. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 13:27, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually the link to the website critical of the Greens is not run by the Democrats. The site creator states this quite explicity <a href="http://www.australiangreenswatch.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=27" class="external text" title="http://www.australiangreenswatch.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=27" rel="nofollow">on this page</a>. The website is not authorised or advocated (at least officially) by any political party. It is the work of a <i>one time</i> Democrats candidate. The claim that it is "run by the Democrats" should be removed.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 14:18, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

It's all "think of the children" type fundie stuff about how the greens are going to force your kids to have LSD for breakfast, as opposed to constructive criticism. It's an extreme view. I found another more moderate link, but he's insistent that this link in particular should be placed there. He's put this link there 5 times now. <a href="../../../j/g/r/User%7EJgritz_6f2d.html" title="User:Jgritz">Jgritz</a> 15:04, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>I do not believe a web page link to an individual's point of view about a political party should be linked. I am more than happy for that stance to apply to any political party. I would be happy for an official party view of another registered party to be linked, for example the Democrat's views of the Greens or the Family First's views of the Greens. Family First is a registered party. The link currently on the article <a href="http://www.australiangreenswatch.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.australiangreenswatch.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is to a web site of an individual not a party and would not meet my criteria..--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 21:48, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the interests of NPOV it's worth having other parties views about the Greens, as is done with the Libs, ALP etc. The link in question is not so much the views of FF as it is a collection of links to other sources, many of which have now been discredited. I think a better source would be a speech or statement by someone from FF actually talking about the Greens directly. This would be a better way to portray FF's views. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 02:18, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What are peoples opinions of the blocking of <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.166.96.237.html" title="User:203.166.96.237">203.166.96.237</a> for 1 week for vandalism? The user page clearly states the ip address belongs to an Australian school proxy. Not that I'm a supporter of vandalism as such, however the scope of the problem compared to the length of the block is somewhat severe. Not being an administrator myself I don't face the issue of whether or not to block users, so perhaps I'm mistaken and this is usual par for course. One can always expect some kind of immaturity from students, but it's not like this ip address has caused a constant flood of problems.

But I've been finding that there isn't much in the way of local examples to go on - most of the Australian sporting team articles aren't in great shape, and even those that are lack things like infoboxes.</p>
<p>It strikes me that it might be useful to try and tackle sports issues from a national level - all the team sports, be they AFL, rugby of either code, soccer, netball or basketball all share similar issues with infoboxes and templates.

<dd>You are quite right that <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technetium.html#Nuclear_medicine" title="Technetium">Technetium-99m</a> is produced at Lucas Heights, but wrong to conclude that it's produced using the accelerator.

Actually, it's not produced directly from the reactor, as it has such a short half-life (one reason it's so useful), but rather it's extracted (often closer to the site of use) chemically from material containing <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molybdenum.html#Isotopes" title="Molybdenum">Molybdenum-99</a>, see <a href="http://www.nrg-nl.com/public/medical/valley/node6.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nrg-nl.com/public/medical/valley/node6.html" rel="nofollow">this external link</a>.

I'm not sure about how one might name a campus article, though - any suggestions? <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 08:54, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The style Monash uses is Monash University Clayton campus (<a href="http://monash.edu.au/campuses/clayton/" class="external autonumber" title="http://monash.edu.au/campuses/clayton/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), Monash University Gippsland campus (<a href="http://www.gippsland.monash.edu.au/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gippsland.monash.edu.au/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>), Monash University London Centre (<a href="http://www.monash.ac.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.monash.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>) etc. For some reason the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Melbourne_c667.html" title="University of Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a> capitalises the word Campus in all except the Parkville campus (<a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/campuses/maps.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/campuses/maps.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>). The McMillan campus is in three different locations which will need disambigging. I would imagine that sort of style would be common for all the unis, it's probably good enough to use. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 12:48, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>I like the infobox, it keeps nasty things like longitude and latitude out of the lead and it provides a quick overview of the city. The one Cyberjunkie has made looks pretty good, I'd forgotten I've seen it on Darwin, I'd probably switch the crest for a dot map and tweak the colouring. The box on Geelong has a bit too much white space. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 12:14, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Postcode lists</span></h2>
<p>There seems to be no consistency for our state-based postcode lists:</p>

<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_postcodes_in_the_Australian_Capital_Territory_bd27.html" title="List of postcodes in the Australian Capital Territory">List of postcodes in the Australian Capital Territory</a> - divided into "main" (with links) and "other" (without).

<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_postcodes_in_South_Australia_6da9.html" title="List of postcodes in South Australia">List of postcodes in South Australia</a> - alphabetic, links to town/suburb names all with ", South Australia" as piped links, similar to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_and_towns_in_South_Australia_7619.html" title="List of cities and towns in South Australia">List of cities and towns in South Australia</a></li>

<p>As these are a series, they should have similar appearance and style. Is there a guideline I should follow to make them all fit some standard? A quick sample shows at least our lists look complete - some US states have incomplete lists. Most other lists like this are sorted numerically. Should we split into <i>list of postcodes</i> (sorted numerically and fully linked with piped links) and <i>list of cities and towns</i> (sorted alphabetically, also fully linked, same list of placenames) for each state? Ideally, <i>cities and towns</i> should filter out the suburbs if there's a clear definition of which is which. There are some places not listed in either <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_and_towns_in_South_Australia_7619.html" title="List of cities and towns in South Australia">List of cities and towns in South Australia</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Adelaide_suburbs_4f99.html" title="List of Adelaide suburbs">List of Adelaide suburbs</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of Parliamentary photos</span></h2>
<p>I have now obtained written permission from AUSPIC for the use at Wikipedia of photos of Members and Senators. Here is the correspondence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Mr West</dd>
<dd>I am writing to ask your permission to reproduce photographs of Members, Senators and Governors-General appearing in current and past editions of the Parliamentary Handbook. I would like to be able to reproduce these photos for use in Wikipedia, a non-profit online encyclopaedia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>) for which I write articles. Wikipedia require a written statement that the use of any photograph is not a violation of copyright. I would be happy to add a "used with kind permission of" tag to these photos if that is appropriate.</dd>

<p>I suggest that images of Members, Senators and Governors-General be captioned "(Copyright AUSPIC)" after the name of the person in the photo. The copyright information should read. "This photo has been reproduced with the permission of the copyright holder, AUSPIC. It may not be reproduced for any commercial purpose."</p>

<p>I hate to be the bearer of bad news but since Jimbo declared that images that have a non-commnercial licence are incompatibe with the GFDL and should be deleted (bad for wikipedia, but good for the Foundation I guess), these images are technically still a problem. I would suggest that the information Adam has provided above be listed on the image page, and the image listed as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFair_use_3b59.html" title="Template:Fair use">fair use</a>}}, the images should be pretty safe then.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 01:23, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To elaborate everything on wikipedia is supposed to be compatible the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. The GFDL is not a non-commercial use licence, people can use anyhing licenced under the GFDL for whatever purpose. So content that requires some sort of promise of non-commercial use is incompatible because the GFDL doesn't provide for those kind of exceptions. For instance those pics would appear on all the commercial wikipedia mirrors, which is clearly not the intention of AUSPIC who have specified that they are free for Wikipedia only.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 03:27, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I concur absolutely here. A unilateral declaration made by Jimbo with the practical effect of hampering the quality and quantity of images on Wikipedia, all without any sort of legal/copyright benefit, has got to rank as the most monstrously stupid aspect of Wikipedia's development. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 03:17, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The arguments raised by supporters of the policy change consistently fail to address the arguments raised by the objectors. In particular,
<ul>
<li>The <i>unilateral</i> aspect of the policy change: Jimbo doesn't like copyright pictures of <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blinds.html" title="Blinds">blinds</a> being uploaded, so now we can't use Australian parliamentary photographs;</li>
<li>The <i>lack of discussion</i> that preceded the minimal-notification deletion of at least hundereds, if not thousands, of images, some of which will <i>never</i> be obtained from any other source;</li>
<li>The <i>inconsistency</i> in that <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> can be indiscriminately asserted with any number of copyright images, to not the slightest admonition, and they can be declared "free" (this whole "free" vs. "non-free" binary categorisation screams out at me as being over-simplistic), in a US-centric approach;</li>
<li>And finally, the (to me) completely baffling idea that we should bend over backwards to allow others to make money out of our volunteer-produced content. I thought I understood this place.</li>

<dd>So, basically, I think this is one discussion where one side is very clearly in the right - more so especially since it was a discussion that never properly took place. In fact, I think I might right a rant to this effect. In the meantime, I stress that the distinction is arbitrary, whimsical, and related primarily to a bush-lawyer interpretation of US copyright law. I don't see why we should be bound by it. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 22:14, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>To address your first point: the matter of whether the images are copyright or not is not the problem; all contributors to Wikipedia retain their copyright to their contributions, this extends toimages, and you are never asked to release your copyright. What is the problem is the license the images or contributors are released under. A "noncommercial" license is incompatible (whether or not Jimbo says so) because the GFDL permits commercial use of GFDL content.</dd>
<dd>In response to your final point: the provision in the GFDL for commercial use of the text is so that the authors can publish and sell their own work, presumably. In any case, if you disagree with the license that all of Wikipedia is under, you really shouldn't be adding material under such a license; alternatively you could signify you contribute under some GFDL-compatible license perhaps. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 22:49, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I personally don't have any problem with any of my contributions being subject to commercial re-use. Other sources that we use (eg. photo libraries) <i>quite legitimately</i> do, and I believe that we should make some effort to accord legitimacy to their wishes, especially - and this point I stress - where this is the only way that important material will become available for us. To state that certain specific issues about commercial use effectively designates their material as wholly and solely "non-free" and anathematic, is to my mind oversimplistic and undesirable. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 02:06, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's see.. there was actually very much discussion about it, but you didn't see it. You've absurdly reduced Jimbo's reasons for the pronouncement to something ridiculous. You complain as if people don't see any nuance beyond a simple free/non-free distinction, which is just rubbish. There are good reasons for facilitating commercial re-use, but you haven't heard them. You could try starting with the good assumption that you don't know what you're talking about, then ask some questions on, say, wikien-l. Try to come across as capable of rationality though, so that people might take you seriously. -- <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeronim_db32.html" title="User:Jeronim">Jeronim</a> 23:35, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The whole deletion program was provoked by a single email by Jimbo to wikien-L, which I might point out, I read. This was the <i>announcement</i> of an enormous policy change, not a <i>discussion</i> of the pros and cons of the change <i>before it occured</i>. I believe that the questions already asked on wikien-l, substantially the ones I would echo, were indeed quite capable of rationality, regardless of whether I am or not, and still the response given was unsatisfactory.</dd>

<dd>The point was raised in the discussion above that a copier of Wikipedia content would in effect have to re-assert the "free use" licence when they took such material from it. I have no idea why when it comes to "used with permission" images, they can't re-seek permission for use of the images from the original source that Wikipedia got them from in an analogical fashion. That's for the copying source to worry about, since we have no control/responsibility for their content in the first place.</dd>

<p>Well, I can see the problem, given that there is no restriction on people copying Wikipedia's contents into commercial imitations, which is a problem Wikipedia has created for itself. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 04:58, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not going to go to the trouble of scanning and uploading pictures unless I am assured that they will not be deleted.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Summarising the position</span></h3>
<p>Merits of either camp aside, the fact remains that we will have trouble using the parliamentary images. Non-commercial images, or with-permission images are still not 'free', and will still be trouble. There is a discussion of fair use as applicable to WP at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, and it seems to me (although IANAL, just a student) that these images can't possibly be fair use (even if fair use applied outside the United States), since fair use doesn't apply when there are alternatives. Here there are clearly alternatives - pictures of pollys are hardly unique. Ideological arguments aside, it's really not a good idea to use those parliamentary images. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 08:18, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's true that they actually can't be claimed as fair use, I suggested if only because there is currently no decent mechanism for checking fair use claims, it's the deviant in me&#160;;). From my experience on <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> unless an image is listed as a copyvio or is in a FAC people don't tend to notice bogus fair use claims. I tend to think that pics don't add that much to a short to medium length biography, do most parlimentarians have websites- could an external link to an individual or parlimentary website serve the same purpose?</p>
<p>Another option would be to go back to AUSPIC and ask them to licence the low res images for use under one of the creative commons licences or the GFDL, but all these options allow commercial reuse.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 14:34, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Further to this, how can it be that the photo at <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morris_Iemma_5dac.html" title="Morris Iemma">Morris Iemma</a>, which has clearly been lifted from an ABC website, is kosher while the parliamentary photos are not?

<dd>This was adressed already at the talk page there. Check again for the changes that have been made since. I moved a lot of stuff from the <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power_phase-out.html" title="Nuclear power phase-out">nuclear power phase-out</a> article to <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_energy_policy.html" title="Nuclear energy policy">nuclear energy policy</a>. I am not completely sure whether the title for the new article is 100 % okay, but that's where the information about Australian energy policy is now. Contributions and corrections more than welcome. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMale1979_76fc.html" title="User:Male1979">Ben</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMale1979_96ca.html" title="User talk:Male1979">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Male1979_fd02.html" title="Special:Contributions/Male1979">C</a> 16:47, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</sub></dd>

<dd>Hey, and be careful what you say. The article cites more sources than any other wikipedia article I have ever seen. And it says no such thing as that Australia was phasing out. That's obviously a misunderstanding on your side. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMale1979_76fc.html" title="User:Male1979">Ben</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMale1979_96ca.html" title="User talk:Male1979">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Male1979_fd02.html" title="Special:Contributions/Male1979">C</a> 16:50, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</sub></dd>

<dd>Hmmm? I was specifically questioning your statement above: <i>Australia is noted in many articles as a country which renounced nuclear energy.</i> Did any of these <i>many</i> articles cite a source for this claim? Have you corrected them all? If not, could we perhaps have a list so we can? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 17:57, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How can I or you "correct" third party sources? Just think. I saw it several times. I normally don't cite sources on talk pages when I report a personal observation. If you need a list just search for yourself (<a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a>). You just misread the article. What you allege was never there.

<dd>As for my observation, <i>Australia is noted in many articles as a country which renounced nuclear energy,</i> I want to note that statements for and against phase-outs or nuclear energy use, often basically say something like "these countries have many power plants and are pro nuclear" and "these countries are against nuclear energy." I saw Australia on negative (against) lists and remember statements like "Countries that renounced nuclear energy [include ... some countries ...] Australia." It was some environmental organizations probably. I just reported it here to emphasize the importance of Australian <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_energy_policy.html" title="Nuclear energy policy">nuclear energy policy</a> for phase-out arguments. I will search later for it if you think it's important. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMale1979_76fc.html" title="User:Male1979">Ben</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMale1979_96ca.html" title="User talk:Male1979">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Male1979_fd02.html" title="Special:Contributions/Male1979">C</a> 03:17, August 16, 2005 (UTC)</sub></dd>

<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that there is a list of transcluded deletion debates on Australia-related articles. You can find it here: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletion_sorting_Australia_fc25.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Australia">Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Australia</a>.</p>
<p>I see that you have a list of deletion debates on this page, so presumably this new transcluded list will be of use. Please help to keep the list up to date by archiving old items and adding new ones. Thanks!</p>
<p>By the way, new members are needed at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletion_sorting_ca67.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting">Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting</a>. Hope to see you there!</p>

Instead of the "agreed" naming convention of "Town, State", they now reside at just "Town". I haven't yet raised this with Brisvegas, because I wanted to see if any reason could be offered to except these places from the rule. Thoughts? --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 09:32, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I Think Brisvegas has stated the main reasons to use the short forms in his/her edit summaries (the other is a little less typing). The counter arguments include:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28city_names%29_4643.html#Australia" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (city names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (city names)#Australia</a></li>
<li>Consistency - no harder for readers, easier for editors to not have to look up whether there is an alternative they've never heard of.</li>
<li>Sometimes, the popup over a link is enough to answer the vague "where's that?" when reading (eg biographies).</li>

<dd>I don't see the need to revisit this. We've been over this before, and both articles are still easily accessible via the redirect from the undisambiguated name. Consistency is a good thing.
