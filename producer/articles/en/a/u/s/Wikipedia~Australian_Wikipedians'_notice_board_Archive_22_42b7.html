<dd>We could probably blame the abundance of redlinks <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_shopping_centres_in_Australia_e677.html" title="List of shopping centres in Australia">here</a> for the regular appearance of non-notable shopping centre articles like this one. If the centres aren't notable, is this list? What makes a shopping centre notable anyway? Take <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chadstone_Shopping_Centre_332a.html" title="Chadstone Shopping Centre">Chadstone Shopping Centre</a> for example.

<li>For ACT schools, most redlinks were turned into blue links with a redirect to the locality, eg <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Deakin_High_School_370d.html" title="Alfred Deakin High School">Alfred Deakin High School</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stromlo_High_School_a1fb.html" title="Stromlo High School">Stromlo High School</a>. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_the_Australian_Capital_Territory_ce34.html" title="List of schools in the Australian Capital Territory">table listing the schools</a> has information on the Suburb or Town, Years catered for, when Founded, and a link to the school's Website. The expectation being that the content about the school could be developed as a separate section of the suburb/locality article. Many ACT shopping centres have their own article though - see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manuka%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory_42ef.html" title="Manuka, Australian Capital Territory">Manuka, Australian Capital Territory</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamison_Centre%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory_3380.html" title="Jamison Centre, Australian Capital Territory">Jamison Centre, Australian Capital Territory</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westfield_Woden_8797.html" title="Westfield Woden">Westfield Woden</a>, or <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dickson_Centre%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory_d11d.html" title="Dickson Centre, Australian Capital Territory">Dickson Centre, Australian Capital Territory</a> for some examples.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 00:40, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>However, the current policy with respect to schools is that they should be allowed to have an article, isn't it? If we're keeping all schools, I don't see why we shouldn't keep all shopping centres, as long as the article is reasonably written. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 01:12, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>they seem worth keeping when they have info on the history, but the ones which just list the stores dont look great. perhaps merge the stubs into the locality article, but keep the articles? <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altona_North%2C_Victoria_2221.html" title="Altona North, Victoria">Altona North, Victoria</a> is only a couple sentences, it could easily be merged there --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey</a><small><a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAstrokey44_2cf4.html" title="User talk:Astrokey44">44</a></small> 01:31, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rebecca has removed the prod saying "Nyet. Take it to AfD (and lose)" in the edit summary. Lets see how it goes.

<li>Hi, I originally prodded <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altona_Gate_Shopping_Centre_47e7.html" title="Altona Gate Shopping Centre">Altona Gate Shopping Centre</a> and gave the reasons as 'non-notable' and 'I don't think the stub can reasonably be expanded into an article'. I'm a relative newcomer and it seems that I've either:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) Unknowingly stepped into an ongoing debate about the general notability of certain general categories (schools and malls), or</dd>
<dd>2) Unwittingly stepped on the toes of the <b>Aussie Cabal</b>...um...you do have an Aussie Cabal don't you? If not, you should&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<p>While I'm a fanatic about preserving <i>useful</i> information I tend to think that stubs which can't be improved into decent articles should be deleted. Based on what I've read here, and after considering additional comments from <a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> I think I will nom it for deletion. However, I won't do so before 2006-07-01 because I'm interested in seeing if there's anymore discussion. I'm always in favor of working towards consensus and since many of you here are familiar with the subject, it seems like a good place to start. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> 03:34, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd also describe myself as an inclusionist. I'd never thrive at AfD. That being said, the idea of having an article for every shopping centre bothers me. Wikipedia isn't meant to function as the yellow pages. By all means, list the major shopping centres in an article about suburb or city X, but the shopping centres themselves are largely homogenous places that all look the same because they're driven almost exclusively by shopping and not by anything that is intrinsic to its location. Certainly, there's nothing to be said about most shopping centres that isn't already written in the article about their parent suburbs. I think we have to be really choosy as to what commercial entities deserve articles. There are already guidelines to determine if a company is notable. Shopping centres really just don't cut it. If there is a case where a particular shopping centre is especially unique in a cultural or historic context (not a commercial context) then an article could be justified. —&#160;<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 06:21, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Often suburbs are notable as much because of their shopping strip as anything else. It seems to me that the modern shopping centre took over from the old shopping strip idea decades ago. So, it could be argued that shopping centres have as much notability as some suburbs (the main difference being that one is privately owned and covered, and the other isn't). All of Canberra's suburbs have articles on them, and I am confident many of those are less notable than Altona Gate. Lastly, big shopping centres, like Highpoint West, often start defining the broader area around them, so that everyone within a couple of drop kicks starts calling their business Highpoint this or that. I am not sure if this has really been thought out enough. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 12:24, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's a good point about shopping centres being as notable as suburbs. Some shopping centres even have their own postcode these days. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 16:28, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps it might be simpler to merge this into, say, list of major shopping centres in Melbourne, or something. Perhaps a table with major stores, location, that sort of thing. Pippu and others make some excellent points (places like Chadstone have a massive impact), but at the moment I don't think we'd miss anything by not having a separate article. If it gets long enough then it can be spun out into its own article, of course. I'd be happy to get the list started if anyone thinks that would be a good idea. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 13:36, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've made some comments over at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_shopping_centres_in_Australia_ba6b.html" title="Talk:List of shopping centres in Australia">Talk:List of shopping centres in Australia</a> about this issue. One thing I'm uneasy about is that Australian shopping centre articles show up on AFD regularly, and whether they survive or not seems to be somewhat arbitary, with little reflection on the actual notability of the centre or even the detail within the article. I think it would be good if we came to some sort of consensus on what shopping centres should have articles (and what should be in those articles), and what ones should simply be covered within the surburb's article.--<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 00:35, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've gained an interest in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_1.0_24e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia 1.0">Wikipedia 1.0</a> and been fidding with article assessments of late. The table here over to the right provides participants of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australian_crime_c983.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian crime">Australian crime WikiProject</a> that I maintain with a daily progress report towards the 1.0 goal. The table is updated automatically by <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathbot_604f.html" title="User:Mathbot">Mathbot</a> and transcluded onto the project page. Assessing an article is as easy as tagging the talk page with a template containing a grade relevant to the quality of the article. A blank template classes the article as unassessed. A few <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Australian_crime-related_articles_by_quality_478c.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Australian crime-related articles by quality">other</a> <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Australian_crime-related_articles_by_quality_log_ecbf.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Australian crime-related articles by quality log">reports</a> are available as well. The system also supports article importance tagging, though I've not enabled that as yet. I'm pretty happy with how the system works.</p>
<p>What I imagine would be very useful to most Australian editors would be such a table covering the entire Australian article namepace. An Australia-wide table similar to the one at right would be handy positioned on the <a href="../../../a/w/n/WP%7EAWNB_94e7.html" title="WP:AWNB">Australian Wikipedian's Noticeboard</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Portal%7EAustralia_34a5.html" title="Portal:Australia">Portal</a>, and similar high profile places. It'd give us an instant update on the amount of Australian Featured Articles, Good Articles, and the progress of those on the way up the quality scale. It's a big job, but I'm up for it if others agree it's a worthwhile idea to pursue. Perhaps a bot could assist with tagging (at least into an unassessed status) if anybody operates one capable?</p>
<p>It's not something I'd rush into without first gaining some community approval, and there's probably a lot of questions and answers that need to be thrashed out before any work begins. It's early stages still. What do others think? I'm also willing to give other WikiProjects a hand to implement the system if they're interested. Drop me a note on my talk page if you need any assistance and wish to grade your own projects. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 23:26, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The Australia-wide table proposed by Longhair would only be useful if broken down into constituent parts.

<dd>Can the system support a hierarchy of wikiprojects, so that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australian_crime_c983.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian crime">Australian crime WikiProject</a> articles don't need to also be tagged as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_Australia_83a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject Australia">Wikiproject Australia</a> articles, and the various city projects can be aggregated into the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australian_places_223a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian places">Australian places WikiProject</a> and so on? I think it's a good idea anyway, but aggregation reduces the amount of tagging required, and ensures that if the status is changed for one project, they all get the same status change. I think that this noticeboard is a good place to put the summary, even if we also created a wikiproject. On This Day could move to the portal once the entire year is populated well enough. (Edit conflicted three times) - It looks like my hierarchy question might have been addressed by the Military history people.

<dd>(Few edit conflicts here). An Australia wide table would summarise the lot. It'd be big, but it'd be interesting also. I love your table idea AYArktos but thats a fair way off I'd assume, but a goal worth aiming for. If specced out thoroughly at the start it'd be a pushover in the right hands. Assigning all Australian articles under the one project to begin with would give us an easily managable base group of articles to start with, kind of like how categories evolved at Wikipedia. Initially, and I mean years ago, there would have been only <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralia_9699.html" title="Category:Australia">Category:Australia</a>, but now that's branched into many specialised subcatories. This project could work the same. (I spend a lot of time categorising and see this as an easy analogy, I'm sure there's anothers). Articles can still be broken down into smaller projects, as the Military history WikiProject has already done. One problem I saw with a nationwide project was the potential of talk page clutter, with many templates at work if the article is assigned to more than one project. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 00:49, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've had a bit more of a tinker with what I've described above, and managed to get a custom Australian version of the talk page template functioning ok with support for most descendant Australian WikiProjects. I should have them all supported by this afternoon. A lot of the backend pertaining to this system runs via a bot, so I'll find out true results shortly once the bots completes its run. All I've basically done is grabbed the code being used over at the military history project and customised accordingly. I've also ripped most of their project pages, leaving the obvious unrequired bits behind, as their ideas and layout seemed to fit us nicely. I'm technically inclined and a former programmer, but my time is limited to look into the sysyem AYArktos proposes above, but it's very possible with time and effort.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps a working group towards this goal would be an option? We need now to break down the Australian namespace into smaller sub-sections as hinted at above.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As you'll note, the system also supports tagging for other purposes, which I found interesting, and it works well for a large project, so I don't see why it couldn't work for us. This is all very early stages here, feel free to pick the system to bits and recommened changes. We don't need an exact carbon copy of the military history system, but now is the time to speak up and steer this in the direction you'd like to see it. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 01:32, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, it would be a great idea if you were to do this. The ABS' site is a mess and if would be nice if we could automatically dive in and extract the stats we want. If you're just talking about suburb statistics to start off with, I figure at the bare minimum you should retrieve the population, area, pop density, percentage of aboriginals/torres strait islanders and maybe the three most common nationalities/places of origin/whatever they call it. Perhaps average income as well. - <big>҉</big> <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandwicked_8ae2.html" title="User:Randwicked">Randwicked</a> <big>҉</big> 09:41, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay. I'm in the middle of downloading 2024 excel spreadsheets. For some reason there's no suburb data for Qld or ACT...? But what there is, I might as well do the whole lot in one go. Let's list the sheets and the data we want to extract:</p>
<ul>
<li>B01 - Population, area, pop density. So is ATSI percentage.</li>
<li>B03 - top (two?) age brackets</li>
<li>B05 - is this where you wanted me to extract most common nationalities from? ancestry based on parent? I'm a little confused about how to understand these tables: just use the last column? When I calculate percentages, does it include "not stated"? Does "most common" mean top 5, or all those above a certain percentage?</li>
<li>B06 - or did you want me to extract nationalities from here?</li>
<li>B07 - or is <i>this</i> where I should take nationality from??</li>
<li>B10 - get the top few religions- top by perccentage, or top 4? Count Christianity as one group or as individual sects, or both?</li>
<li>B18 - dwelling structure? percentage totals?</li>
<li>B22 - unemployment rate</li>
<li>B23 - non-school qualifications? percentages?</li>
<li>B33 - median weekly household income? median weekly individual income? mean household size?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you could let me know what you think of the need for each of these statistics, and in complex situations how they should be calculated, that would be fantastic. <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 00:29, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey everyone. I think it's unlikely in this list that any (forget about all) of the red links leading to articles on specific by-elections are ever going to be written. I'm wondering if someone could think of a quick way ("replace all" in Word wouldn't work) to change all the links to this standard: eg. [[Werriwa by-election, 2005|Werriwa]] → [[Division of Werriwa|Werriwa]]. This at least adds relevant and existing links from the article. Thanks in advance if anyone cracks this conundrum. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harr</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">o</font></a><b><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html" title="User talk:Harro5">5</a></b> 10:20, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please don't. The fact that we lack articles on by-elections is a problem, not a solution. Wikipedia has a series of excellent articles about by-elections in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, and I see absolutely no reason why we should not have the same. This will not happen if they're not actually linked from anywhere, and if nothing else, I'll get to writing them eventually. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 12:58, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Hopefully, it is something that we can get around to filling in. A number of by-elections have been signs of changes in political mood such as the Bass by-election in 1975 and the Canberra by-election in 1995. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 02:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If Australia are to host this, there is a <i>lot</i> more to it than just providing the venue. The locations of the previous two have been heavily based on the number of local volunteers willing to deal with the venue, accommodation aspects, programme, organising speakers and events, technical set-up, etc, etc. There are no "WMF people" to do this.

<dd>Conference organisation is a bit of a nightmare in my limited experience, we have no local chapter or local funds to use to do the organising and airfares to this side of the world would be prohibitive for many European and US attendees which would limit numbers. I'm assuming that registrations are used to finance the conference organisation - so unless you had enough people willing to pay to come to make sure that it paid for itself - there would be no way to do it.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">Peta</a> 04:44, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The idea of our own Australian Wikimania (Wikimania Down Under?) was raised as a secondary idea, in case travelling to the ends of the earth is not realistic for enough people to make having the real Wikimania here viable.

<p>What if we told Morris Iemma that Steve Bracks is secretly wanting to host it in Melbourne, and say similar things to Bracks and Beattie? Actually, given the competition between the states for biotech and IT conferences, this might be vaguely plausible... <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 11:15, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There hasn't been any precedent for a <i>country</i>, or <i>multiple cities</i> bidding for Wikimania, but I can see some merit in Sydney <i>and</i> Melbourne jointly hosting it. Firstly, we'd save all the squabbling that would ensue if we chose one over the other, and secondly, both are great cities with much to offer, and if people are flying in from some distant lands, why not make them visit both? But I think to warm up, and to see how well the WMA machinery works, I would think that a local conference would be highly recommended first. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 12:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Flying back and forth would be unviable, in terms of time and money. If it were to be done that way, I'd say that it would be important to find some kind of split in the program - for example, the pre-conference activities (hacking days, etc.), and the formal part of the proceedings (talks, workshops, etc.) could be done in separate cities. Furthermore, having the infrastructure already there in a city would allow us to conveniently arrange for broadcasts of the workshops and talks from the other city. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 13:26, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Realistically, I think splitting between cities (considering the distances involved) would be unviable, adding at least a couple of hundred dollars onto the already substantial travel expenses involved. I would imagine that Melbourne would be the most feasible location, on the basis that a significant portion of our active Wikipedians (plus Angela) live there, as compared to notably fewer in Sydney. Canberra could be a possibility (close to both) and has quite a few people, but probably none keen enough to do the necessary groundwork. I'm also not convinced that we need to host a more local conference first - firstly, we'd have the combined experience of the Germans and Americans from Wikimania 2005 and Wikimania 2006, and secondly, neither the Americans nor the Europeans held a local conference before holding Wikimania. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 13:42, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the purpose of argument, suppose we have the main stuff down in Melbourne. Most people are only going to attend the talks, workshops etc. But if we have some other activities in Sydney, the added expense to a few people is worth the engagement with a wider pool of people, who can't make it to Melbourne. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 16:43, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having been involved in many conferences and vowing after each one to never do it again, I urge some caution, but I'm probably a grumpy old man on this. Wikipedians are not rich and they are not employed by someone who will cover their costs. I suggest an Australasian one first (hoping we can attract some people from over the Tasman, and also from the Tok Pisin Wikipedia). I suggest Melbourne, not because I am there, but because Angela is. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 12:57, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I won't necessarily be in Melbourne by the time of Wikimania 2007 (<a href="http://wikiangela.com/blog/maybe-moving-to-sydney/" class="external text" title="http://wikiangela.com/blog/maybe-moving-to-sydney/" rel="nofollow">maybe moving to Sydney</a>). Anyway, there are plenty of people in Melbourne (and I possibly enough in Sydney too) to handle this if enough of them are interested. Remember that by 2007, Wikimedia will be that much larger, so even if you don't feel there are enough people now, there may well be by then. I'm still wondering if having a Wikimania Australia first would be a better option though, though Rebecca does give good reasons as to why we wouldn't need that. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 14:15, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would suggest speaking with the local tourist authorities who can help with suggested venues and things to do.

</dl>
<p>Agree with Capitalistroadster - I suggest contacting one of the many conference/convention organising companies - they do this sort of thing all the time. Other things we need to consider first of all:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we organise ourselves (officially) to present to outside organisations - is an Australian Wikimedia chapter required?</li>
<li>Would the WMF be happy in principle to a Wikimania held in Australia?</li>
<li>Which city? We all have to agree on one - infighting won't help the cause. My vote goes to Melbourne.</li>

<dd>The problem with using conference/convention organising companies is that they're very expensive. It's not the Foundation who decides, but I'm not aware of any of the Board having any objection in principle to Wikimania being held anywhere. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 14:15, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally, I think we should have some kind of organisation that people can relate to - it would present a much more unified face to the bidding, and I would imagine that some things would be neater (we can book venues in WMA's name instead of having it with half a dozen people etc). As for a city, I think a more in-depth analysis of venues, costs, events etc need to be considered, as well as people. This isn't something a straw poll could resolve. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 16:40, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the picture were taken in Australia, it wouldn't be a problem, because they have been camera-shy since 1936. But there's the possibility that it was taken outside Australia (one of the other pictures in the commons is of one in a US zoo), in which case the copyright may not have expired.</p>

As you can see it currently contains quite a lot of useful categories on Australian topics which are currently in need of articles to be assigned to them. On the other hands it also contains a lot of musical album related categories containing very few articles. I plan to propose deletion of many of these album categories with only 1 or 2 entires in a week or so and would appreciate if anybody working in the music area could help to populate those in need. Once a category contains 5 articles or so, feel free to remove the underpopulated notice. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 23:24, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thats a good question. Categories on band releases are easily verified, and if the band is a one or two hit wonder there's no good reason for its' own unique category. Ethnic categories are harder to verify and I'm overlooking them for now in the hope we can populate them with useful biographical articles in time, however if they remain mostly empty for a long time, as most of them have, I don't see any need for them to exist at all. I'm focusing on cleaning up the music side of things for now but as you've seen, there's a lot to sort through to see if their creation is justifed. I'm not suggesting the categories are pointless. I am saying there's little point categorising one article into a category of it's own.

<dd>There in no rule for applying these cats, and in various places over the wiki they are entirely overused and stuck on 2nd, 3rd, or 4th generation decendants (sort of like an ethnicity genealogy), who also don't appear to have identified with the ethnicity on any level.

<p>I've just recently got on the bandwagon of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Geographical_coordinates_a690.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Geographical coordinates">geographic coordinates</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Maps_6042.html" title="Google Maps">Google Maps</a> and thus I'd like to share the love. Here's how: I have a "test" wiki set up at <a href="http://www.brunsbug.dreamhosters.com/testing/" class="external free" title="http://www.brunsbug.dreamhosters.com/testing/" rel="nofollow">http://www.brunsbug.dreamhosters.com/testing/</a> . It has the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps_Extension" class="extiw" title="m:Google_Maps_Extension">m:Google Maps Extension</a> installed with maps set to "default" at the inner northern suburbs of Melbourne. Go in to edit a page, above the edit box is a link that says "show map". Navigate to find your location (Melbourne coverage seems excellent now), click on the map to create a marker. Click on the marker to make its hover box come up, and one of the links in it will say "add point here". Click on it and the longitude &amp; latitude of your point will appear in the edit box... wa-la.</p>
<p>Then on the corresponing Wikipedia article, under "External links", put <tt>{{Geolinks-AUS-suburbscale|long=[LONG]|lat=[LAT]}}</tt> (reverse them from their order in the edit box). All done! And plus you get a spiffy map (or I do, at least&#160;:)).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">Pfctdayelise</a> (<a href="../../../p/f/c/User_talk%7EPfctdayelise_a4c0.html" title="User talk:Pfctdayelise">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pfctdayelise_3459.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pfctdayelise">contribs</a>) 01:37, 28 July 2006.</small></p>

<dd>It's certainly a hell of a lot easier than deciphering the whole "coor" template thing. I'm using it for buildings and train stations, and the accuracy seems appropriate. In fact probably too accurate for an actual suburb. I don't know what you'd use for cities, but I hope someone else has already done them. So perhaps this should be renamed plain {{Geolinks-AUS}}?

<dd>Andjam - even if I think your analysis has merit, you know better than I that it can't drive the tone of the article. It seems to me that the reported facts of the case speak for themselves and need no further embellishment or colourful language. Looking at the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Dupas_87e1.html" title="Peter Dupas">Peter Dupas</a> opener again, it is written in a completely detatched manner and yet comes across as being completely revealing about what a gruesome case it was. I'm not saying that is an easy thing to achieve, if it were, I'd be there now and not here, and yes, I can certainly be accused of taking the easy way out in that respect. On the other hand, I think you did the right thing coming here because it needs plenty of input. For starters, we need a new title - surely we have it in us to come up with a unique title that doesn't make it sound like this was the first time a gang rape had ever taken place in Sydney. Then I remain extremely uncomfortable about the racial descriptors - and that is definitely a discussion worth having in this forum because it could help inform so many other articles. I have great respect for anyone working on this - it's a tough gig! <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 10:57, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tale revert like 25 edits that were by multiple users not just me, edits which even added new references from newspapers which took effort to find, and grammatical errors that were corrected. The article was not rewritten to be about "lebanese hate crimes" the intro was simply expanded to include the WHO WHAT WHERE WHEN and WHY, it did not previously include the WHY so i simply added that, the reason why these crimes occured can be understood when it is acknowledged that it was infact a hate crime. And Tale, regarding "The user is also having trouble with the citation formatting in a failed attempt to link a newspaper opinion piece as a source" if you are such a good wikipedian why didnt you simply fix the error in the code making up the reference system, i am new and i dont understand it, so either revert my efforts mercilessly like you did, or take 30 seconds to fix the reference code, which one would be more wikipedian of you? and by the way its not opinion piece sir, its a hard news story, know the difference.

<dd>Most of the reverted edits were by 203.208.102.224, apart from a few polite attempts to fix parts of the POV problems and typos, most of which 203.208.102.224 then reverted. There is an edit dated "07:01, 30 July 2006 203.208.102.224 (Talk) (Minor Edit see discussion)" which actually reverts to a disputed version that had been removed several times before by other Wikipedians for POV reasons.

<p>This is incorrect. I dispute this totally. You have reverted beyond the addition of new sources from newspapers. This is ridiculous. You cannot and will not revert beyond my input to this article it is simply not possible. This is attempt to discriminate against my input. All I have done is change the intro and stated why in detail. Is it not interesting that Tale has not written a single comment on the talk page explaining why he has a POV issue? he just reverts? i have stated the reasons for my changes to the intro... that it must a WHO WHAT WHEN WHERE AND WHY and that WHY is the hate crime acknowledglement. That is all.--203.208.102.224 16:23, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Plus Tale reverted beyond my adding a quote in the (→SMS used as tool) section which was deleted by a user a day ago or so, but in fact did need to be put pack, and i also added a reference for this quote.

<p>The disputed POV insertion of "hate crime" by 203.208.102.224 now extends to related articles, e.g. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilal_Skaf_2fd8.html" title="Bilal Skaf">Bilal Skaf</a>. His explanation for doing so can be found on the article's talk page. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETale_437b.html" title="User:Tale">Tale</a> 16:30, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And where is your explanation of your position on the insertion of hate crime Tale? I am a valid user just like you. I attempt to have a dialog with you on the talk pages and you ignore me, and instead, actually visit the talk page, edit it, but dont write anything except for signing my edits for me, thanks mate for signing a newbies edits ill be sure do it in future, to make an anonymous edit officially anonymous for you if its so important mate, but suffice to say I have on the Skaf brothers talk page and on the Rapes talk page stated my case for the inclusion of hate crime and you have never stated your reasons against it mate. So continue to act like a dobbing little girl and keep being a phantom lurking about signing my edits but never commenting on the talk page when we could have a useful dialog as fellow editors of the article. I wrote most of the article as it stands compare my rewriting (cur) (last) 03:11, 15 July 2006 203.208.88.138 (Talk) (cur) to when it was requested to be wikified (last) 07:16, 12 July 2006 Ansell (Talk | contribs) (article needs wikifying, tagging so) I rewrote the whole article and outlined the days and dates and clarified much of conjecture. So dont you hide in the shadows and denounce my input. I try and have dialog with you and you hide in the shadows and edit my edits and sign my IP to them when i forget, that means you were right there! cursor blinking...able to put down your reason Tale why you have a POV issue... you did nothing of the sort. This is shared IP address so youre not identifying anoyone. That guy who said he posted to my talk page is lying go and prove it yourself if youve got so much time to see what ive been doing and no time to write some input of your own regarding a real argument--203.208.102.224 16:45, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Naming convention for geographic places</span></h2>
<p>Folks, you might have noticed that we have no convention for naming articles on geographic places in Australia, with the exception of towns. If we take rivers as an example, some Wikipedians use Example River, others Example River, State and others Example River (State); some routinely pre-disambiguate article titles, while others disambiguate only when necessary.</p>
<p>There is currently a discussion about this issue under way at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Australian_places_6c79.html#Lakes.2C_rivers_and_mountains" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Australian places">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Australian places#Lakes, rivers and mountains</a>. If you have a stake in articles about Australian places, we would appreciate your input.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikimania get-togethers in Australia?</span></h2>
<p>Is anyone planning a local get-together to coincide with <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimania.html" title="Wikimania">Wikimania</a><a href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>? It's on August 4-6, i.e. this coming weekend, starting Friday night.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to get together to talk about it; and also get involved in <a href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimania_online" class="external text" title="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimania_online" rel="nofollow">Wikimania online</a>. (We can follow and get involved in Wikimania online on our own as well, but it will be more interesting with other actual humans to talk with and bounce ideas off).</p>
<p>One of my particular interests is this: <tt>There will be also sessions focused on non-Wikimedia projects, such as... related projects in the developing world</tt>.</p>
<p>I'm in Homebush, Sydney, and am willing to travel within the wider Sydney region. I'll also post something on <a href="../../../m/e/e/Wikipedia%7EMeetup_Sydney_4f58.html" title="Wikipedia:Meetup/Sydney">Wikipedia:Meetup/Sydney</a>.</p>
<p>Times: I believe Boston has daylight saving, making it 14 hours behind... so the 9a.m. opening of the conference, their time, is 11 pm Friday 4 August, for us. Of course discussions are likely to go on before during and after the conference. --<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingkong2005_96e7.html" title="User:Singkong2005">Singkong2005</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/i/n/User_talk%7ESingkong2005_cdc9.html" title="User talk:Singkong2005">talk</a></sup></small> 11:30, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
