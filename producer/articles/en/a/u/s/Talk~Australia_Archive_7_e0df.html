<p><a name="Separation_of_church_and_state" id="Separation_of_church_and_state"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Separation of church and state</span></h2>
<p>I changed an opening sentence in the Demographics section from: "The Australian Constitution guarantees the separation of church and state; there is no state religion" to "The Australian Constitution guarantees <b>a limited form of</b> the separation of church and state; there is no state religion." (Emphasis obviously not in original.)</p>
<p>This was challenged: "why do you say it is limited? the terms are absolute."</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/e/p/Separation_of_church_and_state.html" title="Separation of church and state">Separation of church and state</a> is only partly about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not having governments nominate a state church (as happens in much of Europe, for example); and</li>
<li>Governments not running churches' day-to-day business.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term can have a limited meaning, which is covered by the two items above. It can also have a broader meaning, such as is found in the US, where for example if legislatures have opening prayers they cannot be limited to a certain faith (as compared to Australia, where the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_Prayer_8f51.html" title="Lord's Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a> is the only one used to open the sessions of the federal houses of parliament). It can also have the broadest meaning, perhaps shown by countries like France where the separation extends to the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_law_on_secularity_and_conspicuous_religious_symbols_in_schools.html" title="French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools">French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Australia_has_many_examples_of_close_church-state_relations" id="Australia_has_many_examples_of_close_church-state_relations"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Australia has many examples of close church-state relations</span></h3>
<p>Here are just a few examples of how governments in Australia engage with churches in ways that contravene the strictest notions of the separation of church and state:</p>
<ul>
<li>About 1/3 of school children are educated in independent, mostly Catholic systemic, schools. When the federal government made its controversial decision to fund private schools by the income of students' parents, it explicitly excluded Catholic systemics, which were instead funded through multi-billion dollar grants to the centralised Catholic education offices.</li>
<li>Here in the ACT, there are two main hospitals: the Canberra Hospital (government-run), and Calvary Hospital, run by the Little Company of Mary. Calvary is publicly funded, but has a gigantic illuminated cross on its exterior and sells anti-abortion paraphernalia in its shop.</li>
<li>After the federal government, church agencies are the biggest providers of welfare in the country - much of it provided through government grants.</li>
<li>A large portion of government-funded aged care is done through the Anglican Church.</li>
<li>Most public schools have Scripture Week when the Easter and/or Christmas stories are taught from explicitly Christian perspectives.</li>
<li>Most schools engage in Aboriginal dreamtime mythology (which of course is as much a faith as the Christmas and Easter stories).</li>
</ul>
<p>Etc etc. etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the vast majority of jurists agrees that the separation clause in the Constitution is not interpreted as being a "high wall". It is a restriction only on compelling membership of a church. It was largely a result of Catholics (then a small minority compared to Anglicans) being concerned that they would be compelled to belong to the C of E. It is not about forcing the government to bow out of religious and spiritual matters, as the strict form of separation entails. A good example of that recognition was the High Court's DoGS case in the 1980s, which found with only one dissenting opinion that the clause is about preventing the creation of a state church, not about any other restriction.</p>
<p><b>Australia's is hence only a limited form of separation</b>, so my edit was wholly and totally correct - and indeed more correct than leaving the term unqualified. As such I'm reverting to my edit, since it is demonstrably beneficial to the accuracy of the article. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_T_b36c.html" title="User:El T">El T</a> 05:08, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
church / state relationships are irrelevant to freedom of religion. freedom of religion is freedom to exercise religious belief without interferance from the state.</p>
<p><i>116 Commonwealth not to legislate in respect of religion</i> The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. <i><a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 05:43, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>And about the lord's prayer - it is not compulsory, and it would be more discriminatory for the parliament to not allow its recitation, as that would inhibit the freedom of religion of the vast majority of parliamentarians.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">A better fix</span></h3>
<p>A more obvious question about this whole business is why on earth a discussion of rights in the Constitution is being discussed in the "Demographics" section. I'm moving that bit into "Politics" and adding some more material. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_T_b36c.html" title="User:El T">El T</a> 06:41, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That material should not confer the incorrect notion that freedom of religion in Australia is somehow limited. If something is a religious practice (as defined by the High Court) the government cannot prevent the free exercise of it. The only exception is where there are competing issues of public policy. E.g. a religion that allows murder. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 06:45, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That right to trial by jury is an interesting one. I learnt about it in constitutional law. I am not sure if there is an article on it, but one would be interesting as there has continually been a <b>majority</b> and <b>minority</b> view. The majority of the high court have said that an indictable offence is only what the Cth says is indictable, whereas the minority has said that takes the teeth out of the right and it is deeper than that. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 06:54, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm sorry, this is a summary article.

<dd>Good point, Cyberjunkie. However, rather than reverting to the previous version, we need to fix problems like the silliness of discussing rights &amp; freedoms and school attendance policy in the demographics section. Keep in mind that the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=demography" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=demography" rel="nofollow">definition of demography</a> is: "The study of the characteristics of human populations, such as size, growth, density, distribution, and vital statistics." In other words, the metadata of a nation's population. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_T_b36c.html" title="User:El T">El T</a> (<a href="../../../e/l/_/User_talk%7EEl_T_3d01.html" title="User talk:El T">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_El_T_f74f.html" title="Special:Contributions/El T">contribs</a>) 09:56, 30 October 2005 (ACST).</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>(Please don't forget to sign) As this is a feature article, I felt it necessary to revert to the last stable version. Some of what you now find in demographics are remnants of a previous much larger section which included sub-headings for "Education" and so on. That section was whittled down to its present form in the process of becoming a feature. Compare with other country articles and I'm sure you'll find similarities. And I think it's fine to mention in passing the constitutional provision for the separation of church and state when delineating religious adherence. Remember this is only a summary or overview article. We'd welcome more coverage on the separation of church and state in Australia. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 02:19, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You'll never find a reference work of any quality referring to political rights &amp; structures in a demographic summary. The only possible exception is if it explained something wholly abnormal, so for example in far-gone times you might have noted for England: "Church of England: 100% (NB - membership is compulsory)". <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_T_b36c.html" title="User:El T">El T</a> 10:58, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Australia in fact does have a reference to non-seperation of church and state..even though the constitution may have cleverly removed "Defender of the Faith" from the queen's title, is she still the "Supreme Governor of the Church of England" both in Britain and Australia? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 210.49.161.16 (<a href="../../../2/1/0/User_talk%7E210.49.161.16.html" title="User talk:210.49.161.16">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_210.49.161.16_45df.html" title="Special:Contributions/210.49.161.16">contribs</a>) 06:49 14 Dec 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Well, I guess she is Supreme Governor of the Church of England no matter where she is, but the Anglican Church in Australia is not the Church of England, and she isnt' Supreme Governor or anything like that of the Anglican Church of Australia.

<dd>Interesting. I'd always assumed English was our official language, but I'm now wondering what makes it so. Like, what regulation or bit of legislation or whatever deems this to be the case? Immigration can't just assert this as a fact unless there is some official document somewhere.

<dd>I wonder if the federal government has ever considered reinstating one of the more common Aboriginal languages in parliament, as well as English. If no action is made to support the use of Australia's Aboriginal languages they are likely to all die out with the passing of the next generation. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel563_0962.html" title="User:Daniel563">Daniel563</a> 06:57, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no way in the world the present government would ever consider it. In any case, it's a nice idea, but thoroughly impractical. For a start, most Aboriginal languages only have a few thousand speakers, and fewer still are actually highly fluent in the language, certainly to a point where a legally satisfactory translation could take place. And how would you pick out an Aboriginal language for the purpose given there's hundreds of them (or, at least, there *were* hundreds of them). Furthermore, I doubt the language would resemble much the language actually spoken once the hundreds of loanwords and figures of speech necessary to discuss parliamentary democracy were added. Finally, the plain fact is that very few white Australians would ever bother to learn an Aboriginal language; while it might be nice in theory, when it comes down to a choice of an economically useful language (French, Japanese, Indonesian, Spanish, Mandarin, maybe German) or warm fuzzies, most parents are going to put their foot down and insist on the economically useful language. Not that many Australians can actually speak *any* second language, unless their parents are migrants and they learned that language at home. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 11:56, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By your description, you probably mean a contemporary piece of Australian classical music. Unfortunately, AFAIK none of the Australian contributors to Wikipedia know much about the Australian classical repetoire; frankly, not much of it has reached the popular consciousness in a way that Germany's greatest composers have. Probably the most famous contemporary Australian classical composer is <a href="http://www.richardmills.com.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.richardmills.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Richard Mills</a>, and, historically, the most famous was <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percy_Grainger_8e04.html" title="Percy Grainger">Percy Grainger</a>, though he lived and worked mostly outside it, and is probably almost as famous for his personal proclivities than for any of his music.

<dd>Very strange! I've adjusted that redirect so it points to the country.

<dd>What is your objection? It uses the {{<a href="../../../i/p/a/Template%7EIPA_485e.html" title="Template:IPA">IPA</a>|...}} template as is standard for IPA transcriptions on this site to help people using certain webbrowsers to read it; and it is written using a fairly standard rendition of the IPA for <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_phonology_5bbd.html" title="Australian English phonology">General Australian English</a>. It's true that in broad transcriptions (i.e. ones which only use different characters for sounds that are distinguished such as this one, having nothing to do with "Broad Australian English") it's common to use ‹r› instead of ‹<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɹ</span>›, but that's only a matter of convenience. So I really have no idea what you want fixed up; I would suggest putting it straight back in the same as it came!</dd>

<dl>
<dd>(The fullstops are technically redundant, but might assist in getting the exact pronunciation of the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/l/</span> right (it's clear <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[l]</span> as in "light", not the dark/velarised <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɫ]</span> as in "pool") as well as emphasising that no-one has the same end to "Australia" as is found in the word "lear" (which'd be <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/lɪə/</span>.)

<dd>Fwiw, I don't think the final consonants are schwas. I use at least two different pronunciations, corresponding pretty much to the first and third (the second is more formal, isn't it?), and in both I would use a final "a" as in the end of "butter", rather than the schwa. It might also be worth ordering the transcriptions from most formal to least formal (to wit, moving the second one to the front). <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevage_a8b0.html" title="User talk:Stevage">Stevage</a> 09:46, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Last things first: To my mind, they <em>are</em> in order of formality. The first pronunciation is very formal and stilted and as I say below difficult for me to say. The second is my normal one, the one I'd probably use most often. The third is a relaxed pronunciation I tend to avoid because it is stigmatised.</dd>

<dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for the schwa-thing: The final consonants are either <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/j/</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/l/</span> depending on which you look at, neither of which is a schwa, so you're right&#160;:) Of course, you meant vowel… And although <em>phonetically</em> they're not schwas (in isolation), <em>phonemically</em> they are usually considered to be such. There's various reasons for this … word finally <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/a/</span> does not contrast with <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə/</span>; to keep it compatible with American and British English; because (given that in Australian English the last vowel of "twenty" is considered a member of the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/i:/</span> phoneme rather than the phonetically more similar <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪ/</span>) it'd be the only word-final short vowel. Also because it'd involve a phonemic change and you generally want some good evidence for that. Personally I'd think "because native speakers think it's an <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/a/</span>, not a <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə/</span>" is good evidence, but I don't know all that much about linguistics. So words like "Australia", "butter", "fitter", "Canberra", "thorough" are considered to end in <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə/</span>.</dd>

<p>Ooops - a little knowledge being a dangerous thing, I thought that these phonetics were an attempt to display the phonetic font that I'm used to seeing, such as <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/australia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/australia" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> [<i>I corrected the URI —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">FtC 14.11.05</a></i>] - as a lay reader, i erroneously thought that these phonetics were a kind of typo. - i do find them hard to understand, but they're obviously technically correct - sorry!, my fault.

<dd>Well of course the IPA is used in a great many contexts, is standardised (to an extent) and is the "official" pronunciation spelling of Wikipedia. In this context, it also has the advantage here that it directly encodes the difference between the Australian and non-Australian pronunciations of the stressed vowel (broadly <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[æɪ]</span> vs <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[eɪ, e]</span>). There are also various other advantages to the IPA including, no less, that most dictionaries except American ones and ones meant for students use the IPA to encode pronunciation. In any case, if you click the "pronounced" link, you'd be given a brief guide to the meanings of the spellings!—Which I think most people would need for the link you gave anyway (what's "ô" mean? should I assume (based on phonetic similarity) that "about" is \ô-baut\ (or whatever they'd do)? etc). Also, IME every dictionary that <i>doesn't</i> use the IPA uses their own home-grown concoction, so that knowledge isn't even generalisable anyway.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I'm inclined to leave it out for an entirely different reason. I think that just giving three different pronunciations without an explanation to the social, regional etc. variation that the words are obviously subject to limits how encyclopædic it really is.</dd>

<dd>I don't know what the "ô" is either, but I'd guess it's actually an American pronounciation. As for including the three pronounciations, I don't see a problem with having soemthing at that level of detail in a summary article.

<p>isn't it possible to record examples of the various pronunciations and have these available? - Felix, would you have any such resources? - maybe that would be a further improvement? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetesmiles_8c9b.html" title="User:Petesmiles">Petesmiles</a> 01:36, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have suitable low-quality recording equipment, and have now produced a recording for your listening pleasure! You can get it at <a href="../../../a/u/s/Image%7EAustralia_in_Australian.ogg_eae9.html" title="Image:Australia in Australian.ogg">Image:Australia in Australian.ogg</a>. Do note that for me, the sequence <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[æɪlj]</span> is decidedly unnatural, so this mightn't be exactly how it ought to sound. ([lj] as an onset is forbidden; if [lj] crops up, it's across two syllables. Yet <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[æɪl]</span> in a single syllable is also forbidden; if it crops up, it's across two syllables. So there's no possible way to pronounce that without making a change, hence naturally the third, but most commonly the second (as the l-less pronunciation is stigmatised). Also note that this is list-reading mode, so the final <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə/</span> are very open. Phrase-internally, they have a quality much more like the initial <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ə]</span>, but most Australians wouldn't use that sound phrase-finally or in list-reading mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I can't test the file, so it might not work. I can only record direct to MP3s, but Wikimedia stuff only wants Ogg Vorbis files. My converter converts happily, but then my multi-codec jukebox refuses to see the converted file, and I have no drivers for the soundcard in my computer. If it doesn't work, I can give you the MP3 if you email me, and maybe someone else can convert it to an Ogg and re-upload.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As far as I can tell 'ale' and 'mail' are both two syllable words. Although the sounds are merged together and basically pronounced as one, there is still clear distinctions between the two syllables. At least when I say them. And even if you do manage to say them together that is not how Australia is pronounced anyway, there's a break before the 'l'. There is a prounciation where this isn't so which is a very ocker pronounciation where the a is pronounced more like '<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[æ]</span>' without the following '<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɪ]</span>' giving the word pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɔː.ˈstɹæl.ja/</span>.</dd>

<p><i>In the 1980s, the Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating, started the process of modernising the Australian economy by floating the Australian dollar in 1983, and deregulating the financial system.[9] Since 1996, the Howard government has continued the process of micro-economic reform, including the partial deregulation of the labour market and the privatisation of state-owned businesses, most notably in the telecommunications industry.[10] Substantial reform of the indirect tax system was achieved in July 2000 with the introduction of a 10% Goods and Services Tax, which has slightly reduced the heavy reliance on personal and company income tax that still characterises Australia's tax system.</i></p>
<p>This paragraph needs to be pulled apart. I've never voted liberal in my life and even I can see the npov in this! It highlights the achievements of the labor party, omits the 'recession that australia had to have' the unemployment levels and interest rates born by Paul Keating's labor government and fails to acknowledge the achievements of the liberal government.</p>

<dd>People get Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island confused. Lord Howe is an integral part of NSW, and is every bit as much a part of Australia proper as Tasmania is. Norfolk Island is an External Territory of the Commonwealth. It is self-governing to an extent. It has a Legislative Assembly that is empowered to make laws about certain matters that the Commonwealth has decided are Norfolk's prerogative (such as the health system). Other matters (such as taxation and currency) are administered by the Commonwealth through the operation of Commonwealth acts that extend to Norfolk Island. As to whether Norfolk Island is "part of Australia", it depends what you mean by "Australia". In some contexts, the term "Australia" means just the 6 states and the 2 internal territories. In other contexts, it means those places plus the external territories. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 12:25, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NOT GENOCIDE IN LAW</span></h2>
<p>Aboriginal welfare is not genocide. Attempts to portray it as such are politically motivated. In international law the "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide" defines genocide as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group" - so the question of INTENT is critical. At part (e) the Convention says that "Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group" would be genocide where the INTENT to destroy a racial or ethnic group was operative. The transfer of children that took place in Australia was for purposes of benign child welfare - only about 10% of children where removed, many were voluntarily given up to care agencies, most were of mixed race, and in many cases, there were clear dangers to the health and welfare of the child. As mentioned above, one of the first "Stolen Generation" compensation cases to go to court found that the "stolen child" was in fact rescued after being stuffed down a hole and left to die. So genocide is rescuing children from death or neglect and giving them food, shelter, education, medicine and care? The intent was care, help and protection. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 165.228.127.160 (<a href="../../../1/6/5/User_talk%7E165.228.127.160.html" title="User talk:165.228.127.160">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_165.228.127.160_7345.html" title="Special:Contributions/165.228.127.160">contribs</a>) 13:13, 22 November 2005.</small></p>

<p>To address the issue: cj, the point is "intent to destroy" just as it says plainly in international law. I do not believe you will find any evidence of "intent to destroy" with respect to Australian practices of child removal. Hardly any full blood Aboriginal children were removed. It was mixed race children and even then they were only removed in the context of a threat to their welfare or survival.</p>
<p>It is wrong to revise history in this way and smear the names of many compassionate people of good will who tried their best to help children they perceived to be in danger. How can we, 50 or 100 years later, judge the delicate situations they faced?

<p>cj - The facts I allude to (and others of this nature) may be found in Wik's own sources and others. But I don't think it is up to me to "prove" that the genocide reference is inappropriate. If you want this highly politicised assertion to stand, you must demonstrate that it meets the requirements specified in international law and the "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide", which is the authority cited. That authority specifically says that genocide involves the "intent to destroy" - you need to show that that Australia as a nation and state was inspired by an intent to destroy the Aboriginal race. I do not think you will find any evidence of such malice, except perhaps for isolated incidents and acts of individuals. The fact that Aboriginal society declined as a result of disease and the ascendancy of European culture does not amount to genocide ... not in law and not in fact. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusvox_219f.html" title="User:Marcusvox">Marcusvox</a> 09:14, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The meaning used is the meaning in the Convention. It is broader than most people think it is. Wikipedia should not comment on whether this meaning is too broad or not. It has been widely claimed that the government(s) acted to ensure the ultimate demise of Aboriginal culture. You may not believe this is true, but it has been argued, so please do not remove the sentence saying so. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> 10:10, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>JPD - it has been "widely claimed" you say? I would dispute that. It has been "narrowly claimed", yes, by those with rather extreme credentials and political axes to grind. Here is a question: should Wik articles include every possible point of view, even extreme points of view? Should the article on the planet Earth, for example, include a section on Flat Earth theory, which is still espoused by various nuts? Should the article on the WTC terror attacks include the extreme theory (and widely claimed in many Arab nations) that it was a Jewish planned and financed plot? I think Wik articles need to distinguish between established facts and mere assertions. But let the sentence stand as it is. I have added a little extra to the para. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusvox_219f.html" title="User:Marcusvox">Marcusvox</a> 01:42, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In fact, even by the so-called "modern understanding" of genocide, it does not apply since it requires in its legal definition that <b>intent to destroy must inspire the act</b>.

<dd>Wik editors should strive in the first instance for the truth. The assertion that Aboriginal welfare practices were equal to genocide is not only a ridiculous lie, it is also demonstrably wrong in the law cited. You guys don't seem to get that. You all seem to be very eager to be preciously PC and like most PC fruitcakes you can't or won't face the simple truth. Study the cited "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide" and you will see what I am talking about. You will see that the INTENT to destroy a race must be established. The fact that the Aboriginal population went into decline was due to a lot of factors, but had nothing to do with any State-sanctioned policy of malice. But if you want to say that some people perceive it as genocide, that is fine, but in the interests of fairness and honesty, that statement must be balanced by an extra sentence indicating that such a viewpoint is disputed and controversial within Australia. For example, the current Government of Australia (love 'em or hate 'em) represents the majority of 20 million Australians and they reject the genocide theory. It would be my guess that fewer than 10% of Australians would consider this theory correct. That makes it pretty extreme and crackpotish! --165.228.127.160 02:28, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

At the start, you'll see that it says "Articles should be written without bias, representing all majority and significant minority views fairly." Now you assert that only about 10% of Australians would support the theory. Some would say that it is more than that amount. But regardless, 10% is still a significant minority opinion, and we are obliged to say that the opinion exists, and say who holds it. We are not obliged to agree with it, or say that it is true, merely report it.

The main cause for the decline in Aboriginal populations was disease, causing a 90% death rate - this was an unintended consequence of white settlement, and a phenomenon not understand by Western science until more than a century later. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusvox_219f.html" title="User:Marcusvox">marcusvox</a> 23:42, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>bainer - "Intent to destroy" does not imply any element of malice? Sorry bainer, but what kind of doubletalk is this? The words are very plain in the UN Convention. It takes a lot of creativity to twist them out of shape. Re alleged massacres on the alleged "frontier", see this link&#160;: <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/24/1037697982065.html" class="external free" title="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/24/1037697982065.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/24/1037697982065.html</a> There are many other sources like this. The genocide story is a contrived nonsense, created and perpetuated for political reasons. "<a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Windschuttle_618e.html" title="Keith Windschuttle">Keith Windschuttle</a> found the basis for the genocide argument to be speculation, guesswork, outright distortion and blatant ideology, an ideology which reached its crescendo in the Bringing Them Home report in 1997.

<dd>Acts of genocide!!!??? bainer, the <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myall_Creek_massacre_0468.html" title="Myall Creek massacre">Myall Creek massacre</a> does not even come close to what might be fairly considered an act of genocide. In 1838, twenty-eight Aboriginal people were murdered by a dozen white vigilantes in revenge for allegedly killing several hut keepers and two shepherds. Seven of the white vigilantes were convicted of murder, sentenced to death and hung. The murder of the Aborigines was no doubt a vile crime and the vigilantes got what they deserved. Quite possibly the vigilantes, as individuals, were also racists and motivated by racism. But whatever, this does not amount to genocide. Question bainer: do the acts of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Bryant_da7e.html" title="Martin Bryant">Martin Bryant</a> the world's worst mass murderer, constitute genocide? Of course not! The mere act of mass murder - in Bryant's case there were more victims than at Myall Creek - does not in itself equal genocide. Nor does Myall Creek, an appalling but isolated incident, with no organized backing and no official sanction (in fact, just the contrary) equal genocide. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusvox_219f.html" title="User:Marcusvox">marcusvox</a> 02:27, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Acts of genocide don't have to be state sanctioned. In the case of Myall Creek, the vigilantes, as you put it, were supposedly acting in retaliation for cattle rustling, as were the conclusions of the court. According to the evidence of the white shepherd at the station, most of the victims were old men, women and children. Could they have honestly suspected them of being cattle rustlers? Even if they did, why did they not take them into custody, or at least question them? Why did they rape the women? These questions were not answered in the court. But on the balance of probabilities the only conclusion that can be drawn from the court's findings of fact is that the twelve men set out to kill those Aboriginal people, and they were specifically targeted because they were Aboriginal. If they were simply mass-murderers, like Bryant, then they would surely have killed the shepherd and the other white employees at the station.</dd>

<dd>Let's stick with Myall Creek for the moment. I have no doubt that some (or all) of the Myall Creek vigilantes were racists. Quite possibly they acted merely to kill blacks, and used the rustling story to conceal their real purpose or for an ex post facto justification. Even so, does this amount to genocide? If it does, then we would be forced to conclude that any racially-motivated murder is an act of genocide. Therefore it follows that the hundreds of whites killed by Aborigines since settlement are also acts of genocide. In Tasmania alone it has been reported that from 1803 to 1847 there were 118 Aborigines' killed by whites and 187 whites killed by Aborigines! Thus, you see, we come to utter nonsense and the meaning of the word "genocide" becomes anything the user contrives it to mean. By the way, did you see this article by Paul Sheehan? <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/24/1037697982065.html" class="external free" title="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/24/1037697982065.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/24/1037697982065.html</a> --[[User:marcusvox|marcusvox] 04:25, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Blindly accepting the claims of <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Windschuttle_618e.html" title="Keith Windschuttle">Windschuttle</a> et al is as bad as blindly accepting the claims of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Reynolds_%28historian%29_4039.html" title="Henry Reynolds (historian)">Reynolds</a> et al. Windschuttle's methods, after all, were not as rigorous as he claimed. He arrived at the figure of 118 Aboriginal deaths in Tasmania by taking a list of incidents where Aboriginal people were killed, as recorded by Brian Plomley, and then gave an estimated number of Aboriginal casualties for each incident, for most of them estimating just one casualty, and allowing no more than ten casualties for any individual incident. This was all the more spurious because Plomley did not count deaths, only incidents, and moreover Plomley specifically chose not to attempt to count deaths, because he was only reporting incidents which the white settlers themselves had recorded. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 22:49, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I think that was helpful. The wording of the convention does not at all imply any malice towards individuals, only an intent to destroy a group. The sentence saying that some people consider the claims a fabrication is fair enough, but it does seem to be spending too much time on the issue in the context of the article. Most claims about genocide are controversial - does it need to be spelt out that this one is? The "decline of the indigenous population" statement is interesting, as it is true if "indigenous population" is meant to mean a community, but not so true in the modern sense that anyone with any indigenous ancestry is indigenous, and encouraged to identify as such. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> 11:49, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
05:47, 20 March 2006 (UTC)~I've made some changes. Personally I can't see why the forced removal of children is even being discussed as one of the main causes of indigenous population decline. IMO it is disingenuous bordering on the dishonest. Very few children who were removed died as a result of the move. Only a few thousand children were ever forcibly removed, something like 90% of those after the Aboriginal population had started to rebound. It was simply never a significant contributor to population decline and can not be justifiably included in a list of the main causes of population decline. I haven't actually deleted the entry, but I have edited it so that it no longer appears that any serious anthropolgist or historian considers this a major cause of population decline.</p>
<p>Personally I think that the reference should be deleted altogther, not because it is controverserial but because it is so trivial to the subject being discussed. It simply was never a major cause of population decline. By all means start another "historical controversies" section or something, but it really doesn't warrnt listing as a major cause of population decline. If someone can find a refernce to a respected anthropologist or historian who lists the removal of chilren as one of the main causes of population decline then all well and good. Until then we shouldn't make such a claim.</p>
<p><br />
Other changes:</p>

<p>2) Cultural breakdown was important. Unfamiliar diet, discarding social traditions and taboos that allowed for survival</p>
<p>3) Resettlement not directly linked to death (usually), rather it was the result of unfamiliar and hence unhygienic living conditions combining with infectious diseases like cholera.</p>

<dd>It is not its own infobox: it is Infobox Country transcluded from Infobox Australia; a metatemplate. This is done to avoid a large slab of code at the beggining of the article which may confuse contributors, attracts highly visible vandalism, and significantly increases the article size. It, along with similar templates, was nominated for deletion back in October (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/Not_deleted/October_2005#Country_Specific_Infoxboxes_that_only_redirect_to_Template:Infobox_Country" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/Not_deleted/October_2005#Country_Specific_Infoxboxes_that_only_redirect_to_Template:Infobox_Country" rel="nofollow">see here</a>) and was kept.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 10:17, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The WikiProject has no authority over individual articles, unless it can set up policy, which it hasn't nor will. As for Infobox Country, it should be standardised, but this article is not of concern in that regard. As for metatemplates, some of the developers are non-plussed about their use, but there seems (as is apparent in the abovelinked deletion debate) to be community support.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 13:54, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

It seems that since WikiProject Countries couldn't get them deleted, they decided to change the use on a one by one basis.

<p>There was a dynamic shift from the UK to the US, but Australia's own identity is swiftly being established. I can saftly say that the majority of australians want to shead the inaccurate image of us all being bush-bashers that speak like drongo's and drink beer all day with koala's and kangaroo's in our back yard...and this image isnt being help along with the god-awful 'Steve Irwin'... Overall, i guess the way australian culture is now, there isnt really a great need to bear the union jack on our flag...</p>

<dd>This particular area is of particular interest to me and it seems we have a informal choice of either following the "drongo" culture or following a heavily foreign influence. As a proud 5-generation Australian I feel for neither the amateurish drongo culture or the excessive foreign influences. Any possible changes in our flag, government type etc. should have in mind especially those who have been here several generations, the closest thing to "ethnic Australians". Multicultralism is merely an addition to the Australian culture. Australia is a nation like any other with its own identity, culture, beliefs, customs even if they are hard to realise, or we dont want to realise it (god help us if thats the case). Human nature alone gives us that, but our geographic isolation would also contribute.</dd>

<dd>The drongoising has to stop and so to do the excessive foreign influences and declaring a republic as quickly as possible, scrapping the "all of us are immigrants" lie (how many residents were born here and have both parents born here? More than 0 I imagine. Does anyone with foreign-born distant ancestors become a immigrant?) is a good start. We are not part of any foreign race, (NOT british and NOT american!!) and this sovereign country deserves respect and honour (not just pitty respect/honour) as much as any other.</dd>

<p>I removed the reference to indigienous first peoples arriving "by land bridges and short sea passages" from India - there were never land bridges between Australia and India, and the sea passages are far from short. This relates to geography, not ethnology - if someone wants to put back the reference to Aboriginal Australians having the latter kind of connection with India, they're welcome, but it should be drafted in a way that makes the difference clear.</p>
<p>Also noticed this: "The Torres Strait Islanders, ethnically Melanesian, inhabited the Torres Strait Islands and parts of far-north Queensland..." So far as I'm aware the TI people never inhabited any of the mainland.

<dd>To my knowledge, during the Ice Age, waters between the lands that are today Australia and Indonesia receded as massive ammounts of water was frozen and the polar caps grew. As a result, this meant that a small section of land was uncovered by the receding waters that connected Australia, the Torres Straight Islands and Papua New Guinea (and possibly some Indonesian Islands too but I'm not 100%sure). People migrated across these "land bridges" and into parts of northern Australia. I do not know how long humans have inhabited the Torres Straight Islands, and I do not know whether humans inhabited modern day Australia prior to the Ice Age. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_carson_2b91.html" title="User:Nick carson">Nick carson</a> 03:39, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Torres Strait Islanders occupied the islands, the adjacent coastlines on the Australian and New Guinea mainlands and much of Cape York at the time of European settlement. They were slowly expanding their range southward. This was the traditional method of invasion, beginning with the people who made it all the way to what is now Tasmania and became separated from later waves.</p>
<p>During Ice Ages, Bass Strait became passable, as did much of the narrow passages separating islands all the way to the mainland, with the exception of one deep ocean trench which required a not-insignificant sea crossing.</p>
<p>Given that mankind evolved in Africa and the first Australians essentially walked here (in a trek which must have taken thousands of years) it is hard to see how they could have avoided passing through what is now India. --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESurgeonsmate_83c2.html" title="User:Surgeonsmate">Surgeonsmate</a> 09:56, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

This seems a fairly basic fact for a previously featured article to get wrong, so I thought I'd check here before changing it.

<dd>Without defending the earlier figure (I dunno where it came from, possibly the CIA world factbook) coastline length is a matter of definition, see <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Fry_Richardson_0831.html#Research_on_the_length_of_coastlines_and_borders" title="Lewis Fry Richardson">Lewis Fry Richardson#Research on the length of coastlines and borders</a>.

<dd>Coastline length depends on how you measure it. If you go on the distance between major capes, then it is at a minimum. If you go from headland to headland it becomes more of a zig-zag and hence longer. If you go up every little indentation, every creek mouth, every river estuary, it becomes longer still. If you begin to include the length of small protrusions such as boulders, it gets longer yet. Where do you stop? Every grain of sand? There is a minimum length, but the upper limit is effectively infinite. --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESurgeonsmate_83c2.html" title="User:Surgeonsmate">Surgeonsmate</a> 11:57, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree - in which case I imagine it would make sense to choose some official figure published by the Australian Government as being the 'official' coastline length, as they are more likely to have determined a figure using some standard process. Geoscience Australia seems to look like the people to ask on this, though if there is a more relevant government department then we should contact them. In any case we should probably make it clear in the article what islands (Tasmania, smaller islands etc) we are including in the coastline length, if any. --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlinken_6e9a.html" title="User:Blinken">Blinken</a> 03:43, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Neighbouring countries</span></h2>
<p>The article says our neighbours are Indonesia, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and New Zealand. What determines which countries are considered neighbours and which not? Is it distance alone? A lot of Western Australians would consider Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma (Myanmar) just as much neighbours as New Zealand. Is it about being able to get there in a straight line without going through any other countries? If so, then places like India, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, Madagascar, many east African countries, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Tuvalu, Kiribati, USA (Hawaii) and many western South American nations would all qualify. In the Australian experience, neighbours are often 200 km away or more, not just 'over the back fence'. Why don't we extend this principle to our overseas neighbours? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 20:29, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, that's fine. Sorry for labouring this, but I just want to get it clear in my head exactly what we're talking about. The unspoken definition of "neighbouring country" seems to be something like: A country that has an obvious border with, and is less than X kilometres from, (country). What is the value of X in Australia's case? Would it be different in other cases? Am I correct in assuming we can even apply this principle to other countries? Do the "neighbouring countries" mentioned in WP articles on other countries conform to this paradigm? Does anyone care? Or should this sort of thing just be left to what is intuitively obvious rather than trying to be too prescriptive about it?. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 01:29, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I get the feeling that "neighbouring countires" is kind of an undefined concept. I think that it should obviously include coutries with land or maritime borders. I'm assuming the the information on neighbouring contries that appears in most country articles was originally derived from the CIA world fact book, which may or may not use some criteria to choose neighbouring countries.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 01:47, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It does seem to be a nebulous concept, doesn’t it? It’s not just about distance, because NZ is neighbour, but China, Phillipines and Brunei aren’t. It’s not just about having no intervening land, because NZ is a neighbour, but Madagascar, India, Hawaii and Antarctica aren’t. If NZ were not a traditionally friendly nation, there could even be an argument for excluding it on the grounds of distance, so "social neighbourliness" seems to be a bit of a factor too. After all that, I can’t see anything wrong with the list we have now. But it was good to have a think about things we normally take for granted.

That we include a country so far away as NZ as a neighbour has, I think, something to do the fact 1) that, east of Australia in the south Pacific, NZ is the only nation bigger than Tassie (before Sth America); and 2) that NZ wins bonus points for having a similar Anglo-Sax base population as Australia. — <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Донама</a> 02:45, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're sort of half-right. "Meridies" is the Latin <i>noun</i> for the south, but the adjective form for south is "australis". The complete phrase is "Terra Australis", which translates as "south land". "Australis" is also the word for "southern", so an alternative translation is "southern land".

<p>I've specified that it is only the woody vegetation that tends to be evergreen. Australian herbaceous vegetation tends to be primarily annual/ephemeral in common with arid zone flora elsehwre in the world.</p>
<p>I've also modified a comment which implied that all acacias and eucalypts are adpated to fire and drought. There are species in both groups that are adapted to neither, notably the rainforest and vine scrub acacia species.</p>
<p>I've also modified an ambiguous comment that might suggest that more species have become extinct following European arrival than vanished in the preceeding 40, 000 years. If we are going to allude to the so-called 'overkill' hypothesis at all then we should take care not to imply that the total extinction level was lower under Aborignal managemnet than European.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is Australia really a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a>?</span></h2>
<p>From the third paragraph of this article:</p>
<p><i>Since federation, Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system and remains a Commonwealth Realm.</i></p>
<p>From the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a> article:</p>
<p><i>Liberal democracy is a form of representative democracy where the ability of elected representatives to exercise decision-making power is subject to the rule of law and moderated by a constitution which emphasizes the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals and minorities (also called constitutional democracy and constitutional liberalism), and which places constraints on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised.</i></p>
<p>I'm not too sure about whether that description fits Australia. Australia currently has no equivalent to a <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_of_rights.html" title="Bill of rights">bill of rights</a>, and while there is a little bit of talk about possibly creating one, rights and freedoms of Australians are currently being sacrificed in various pieces of new legislation. We don't actually have anything that protects free speech, although we do have sedition laws. I'm not really sure what Australia should be called (just a democracy, perhaps?) but I think it's an accepted fact that the Australian constitution doesn't really place much emphasis on the protection of rights and freedoms.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Those seem to be attributes of a democracy, so while they are <i>necessary</i> for a liberal democracy, they are likely not <i>sufficient</i> for a liberal democracy. A stable democratic system can't exist without a rule of law, so the second attribute you listed is just an extension of the first. I'd also argue that a constitution which sets limits on the exercise of government power is also an extension of the first, as this is also necessary for democracy - if the government has limitless power, democracy doesn't exist.</dd>
<dd>The important difference that separates a democracy from a liberal democracy seems to lie in exactly what the limits of government power are. The reason for my suggestion that Australia may not be a liberal democracy stems from the fact that there are no laws that provide citizens' with a right to free speech, and there are in fact sedition laws that actively prevent free speech in some circumstances. Recent changes to the law have been widely criticised, in many cases by people (Malcolm Fraser and Marcus Einfeld come to mind) who have played an important role in Australia's history, as being damaging to civil liberties in Australia.</dd>
<dd>I realised this wouldn't be a popular change, which is why I introduced it to the talk section rather than the main article, but I would like to hear a compelling argument as to why Australia should be described as a "liberal democracy", because it certainly doesn't seem to fit the description provided in the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a> article. - James Foster 16:47, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thrashing out these definitional issues, I don't believe it's valid to define "liberal democracy" as "democracy with a constitutionally protected right to free speech".

While I do understand where you're coming from in disputing my definitional points above, I would suggest that forms of democracy, especially historically, are more diverse than the current sample of democratic states suggest.</dd>

But I digress. The "paradigm" liberal democracy states, if you like, exhibit strong similarities across a broad range of areas to Australia. What about this proposed new category for Australia, a non-liberal democracy?

<dd>THE AFL is doing very nicely, thank you. It is not just the 91,234 crowd that turned up for Tuesday's Anzac Day match that is the undeniable indicator. The AFL commission has recently viewed a 67-page document that says the competition is in health so rude it is borderline boorish.</dd>
<dd>Look every which way, for it doesn't matter. The AFL is the dominant national sport. Here's a snap shot:</dd>

<li>
<ul>
<li>The league draws the largest weekly TV audience;</li>
<li>It generates more than double the income of any competing code;</li>
<li>It is the most affordable sport;</li>
<li>It has the highest total audience;</li>
<li>It has the richest broadcast deal;</li>
<li>It has the biggest following;</li>
<li>It leads sport in total TV audience;</li>
<li>It dominates participation (a player must be registered and played minimum six games) and talent nationally;</li>
<li>It leads sporting industry in brand recognition;</li>
<li>Print coverage nationally doubles exposure of other sports;</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Armed with these facts, it is clear that this article does not really reflect where aussie rules sits in the sporting landscape.

<li>As was discussed on the noticeboard this in an internal AFL report.

<dd>"Being the richest and watched is not more important than being the most played..." - it's a question of degree, when the indicators of the AFL are absolutely trouncing those of the other codes put together, well....

<dd>I really don't understand the problem here, Pippu. As Peta says, the version of the article before Sliat started playing with it did not say or imply anything about whether any of the mentioned sports were more or less popular than others. If we do start trying to say which are the more popular, then we have to go into details about what sort of popularity we are talking about. This is meant to be a summary article, and is not meant to go into that amount of detail. If there is any place for a discussion of the comparative popularity of different sports, it would be at <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport_in_Australia_1f24.html" title="Sport in Australia">Sport in Australia</a>. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 09:20, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What JPD and Peta says is reasonable, but I have a nagging doubt. We are talking about Australian culture. We are talking about the importance of sport to Australians. We mention a half a dozen sports that do well internationally, and then subsidiary to that point, we mention some "other" popular sports, with aussie rules mentioned in the same breath as soccer. Now you may not be meaning to do so, but it is definitely implying that both are equally important to Australian culture, and that the "international" sports are even more important to Australian culture - when the truth is, it is hard to imagine any sport that is more important to Australian culture than aussie rules. I refer to an article that backs up what many of us already know, that AFL memberships, crowds, TV earnings and merchandising are absolutely streaks ahead of every other sport in Australia (that is before we even consider its long history and its influence in other cultural persuits). If I'm not told it's not true, I am told it is of no importance. I'm told that participation for aerobics and yoga is greater. Fine - let's weave that into the discussion on Australian culture. I can't understand how a discussion on the importance of sport to Australian culture can merely mention aussie rules as an <i>obiter dictum</i>. It in no way reflects the position of aussie rules within Australia's cultural milieu. That is my basic argument. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 12:12, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to disagree that the current wording implies that the international sports are more important. I think that implication is only felt if the reader comes to the article already thinking in terms of an argument about importance. Having said that, I agree with the point that the article does not reflect the importance of Aussie rules as an individual sport to Australian culture. The question is whether it needs to, and I tend to think it doesn't. At the moment no one sport is emphasised, but if one was, then the relative importance of others would need to be spelt out, and so on. We can't do that in a summary article. I think the suggestion of mentioning the game's popularity in the image caption it probably a good way to mention it without disrupting the paragraph. If anything needs to be done to the paragraph itself, I think it would be making more clear the importance of the spectator sport culture in general. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 13:37, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is true that I come from a perspective and background receptive to the viewpoint that aussie rules is extremely important in cultural terms to Australians. Equally, a large minority of the Australian population is not receptive to such a viewpoint (in fact, is down right hostile to such a viewpoint). And this is where we currently find ourselves in a number of talk pages around Wikipedia. We need an independent foreign scholar who has lived in all the capital cities of Australia to adjudicate! <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 03:02, 6 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are right that this argument is going on on Wikipedia, but I don't think that's the issue here. I don't think you could say anyone in this discussion is hostile to that viewpoint! I think any Australian who is thinking objectively would agree with the statement that Aussie rules is extremely important to the culture of a large group of Australians and fairly unimportant to the culture of a different, slightly smaller, group. The only question is how much of this needs to spelt out in an already long paragraph in a summary article? All I'll say now is that at the moment, the paragraph doesn't read like a "discussion on the importance of sport to Australian culture" - it simply states that it is important, referring to participation stats, then lists popular sports and important international events, with a small reference to the economic and tv-viewing effect of sport at the end. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 14:53, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I now support the caption idea.

<dd>I know many struggle to understand the prime position aussie rules has in Australian history and her culture, perhaps this quote from today's Age, by John Harms, will assist in a small way: <i>As I clicked through the turnstile at the MCG...I was reminded that the battles on Corio Oval during the 1880s, when Geelong won half a dozen premierships, weren't just footy matches, they were about Geelong people righting injustice</i> (that Melbourne had connived to become the capital city of Victoria over Geelong). Similar tales can be told about most senior clubs in Australia, they all have a similar tale to tell, and invariably they take us back to pre-Federation days - even in Sydney, which has a few clubs dating back to the 1890s. More often than not, the tales, the folklore, the mystique, of certain clubs take us back to the 1860s and 1870s (1859 in the case of Melbourne). Now, apart from the Melbourne Cup and cricket, both extremely important in terms of Austrlian culture, what other sport in has left as large a footprint on Australian history, folklore and culture as Austrlian football? Certainly not aerobics and yoga! It is this sense that I fear has been lost completely from the section that supposedly covers the importance of sport in Australian culture. (I know I sort of promised to leave this bugbear alone, but, well, I couldn't help myself...) <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 02:55, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
