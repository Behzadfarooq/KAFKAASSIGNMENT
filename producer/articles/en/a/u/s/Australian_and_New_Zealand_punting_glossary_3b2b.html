<p>The <b>Australian and New Zealand punting glossary</b> explains some of the terms, jargon and slang which are commonly used and heard on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> racecourses, in <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalizator_Agency_Board_14b2.html" title="Totalizator Agency Board">TABs</a>, on radio, and in the horse racing media. Some terms are peculiar to Australia, such as references to bookmakers, but most are used in both countries.</p>
<p>The emphasis in this list is on <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a> terms, rather than the <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_breeding.html" title="Horse breeding">breeding</a> or <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veterinarian.html" title="Veterinarian">veterinary</a> side of horse racing.</p>
