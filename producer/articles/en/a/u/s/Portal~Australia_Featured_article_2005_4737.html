<p><b>Cyclone Tracy</b> was a <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_cyclone.html" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> that devastated <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin%2C_Australia_35aa.html" title="Darwin, Australia">Darwin</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, from <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_24.html" title="December 24">December 24</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>. It was recorded by <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a></i> as being a "disaster of the first magnitude...without parallel in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Australia_5246.html" title="History of Australia">Australia's history</a>." It killed 65 people and destroyed over 70 percent of Darwin's buildings, leaving over 20,000 people homeless. Most of Darwin's population was evacuated to <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/y/Whyalla%2C_South_Australia_c008.html" title="Whyalla, South Australia">Whyalla</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Springs_00f0.html" title="Alice Springs">Alice Springs</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, and many never returned to Darwin. The town was subsequently rebuilt with newer materials and techniques. Cyclone Tracy was at least a <a href="../../../s/a/f/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale_3656.html" title="Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale">Category 4 storm</a>, although there is evidence to suggest that it had reached Category 5 when it reached Darwin. Cyclone Tracy, due to its severity, has entered into Australian <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_culture.html" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a> in a way that no other meteorological event had before, or has since. Probably the most famous work that it has inspired is the song by Bill Cate, "Santa Never Made it into Darwin" <a href="http://members.westnet.com.au/anugraha/music/files/santa.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.westnet.com.au/anugraha/music/files/santa.txt" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Composed in 1974 to raise money for the relief and reconstruction effort, the song became so wide-known that in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> the <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hoodoo_Gurus_a75a.html" title="Hoodoo Gurus">Hoodoo Gurus</a> released a song entitled "<a href="../../../h/i/d/Hideki_Tojo_0712.html" title="Hideki Tojo">Tojo</a> Never Made it to Darwin", inspired by Bill Cate's song and about the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> bombing of Darwin in <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_War_bded.html" title="Pacific War">World War II</a>.</p>

The lake is located in the approximate geographic centre of the city, according to Griffin's original designs. Numerous important institutions, such as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Library_of_Australia_5972.html" title="National Library of Australia">National Library of Australia</a> lie on its shores, and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_House%2C_Canberra_329d.html" title="Parliament House, Canberra">Parliament House</a> is a short distance away. Its surrounds are also quite popular with recreational users, particularly in the warmer months. Though swimming in the lake is uncommon, it is used for a wide variety of other activities, such as <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watercraft_rowing.html" title="Watercraft rowing">rowing</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing.html" title="Fishing">fishing</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailing.html" title="Sailing">sailing</a>. The lake's flow is regulated by the 33 metre tall Scrivener Dam, which is designed to handle a once in 5000 year flood event. In times of <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drought.html" title="Drought">drought</a>, water levels can fall below desired limits; so to compensate, water is released from the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googong_Dam_6a61.html" title="Googong Dam">Googong Dam</a>, located on a tributary of the Molonglo River.</p>

<p>The <b>Australian constitutional crisis of 1975</b> is generally regarded as the most significant domestic political and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_crisis.html" title="Constitutional crisis">constitutional crisis</a> in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>'s history.

The Coalition used its numbers to defer voting on bills that appropriated funds for government expenditure, in an attempt to force the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Australia_3aa3.html" title="Prime Minister of Australia">Prime Minister</a> to dissolve the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_House_of_Representatives_e683.html" title="Australian House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a> and call an election. This action was unprecedented in Australian history, and has not been attempted since. The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor</a> Government, led by Prime Minister <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gough_Whitlam_3876.html" title="Gough Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a>, refused a general election, and attempted to pressure Liberal Senators to support the bills. The impasse continued for some weeks, during which the threat of the government being unable to meet its financial obligations hung over the country. The crisis ended in a dramatic fashion on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_11.html" title="November 11">11 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> when the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor-General_of_Australia_3807.html" title="Governor-General of Australia">Governor-General</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_John_Kerr_047d.html" title="Sir John Kerr">Sir John Kerr</a>, controversially sacked Whitlam as Prime Minister and appointed his Liberal opponent <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Fraser_2bbe.html" title="Malcolm Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a> as caretaker Prime Minister.
