<p>In the late 1950s(b) investigations were made into the feasibility of creating a tri-service cadet training institution. However, each service continued with separate cadet training institution until 1970(e), when the concept was followed up by a committee chaired by Sir Leslie Martin. In 1977(r) the Australian Federal Government agreed to close down single service academies and set up the Australian Defence Force Academy on a site adjacent to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Military_College%2C_Duntroon_0a67.html" title="Royal Military College, Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a> (RMC-D).</p>
<p>In May 1981(g), the Commonwealth and the University of New South Wales signed an agreement that UNSW would establish a college within ADFA. This college is known as 'University College'.</p>
<p>In February 1984(e) the University of New South Wales announced the appointment of Professor G.V.H. Wilson as Rector of the University College. In April of that year the then Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Sir Neville McNamara, formally established the Australian Defence Force Academy as a Joint Service Unit under Section 32c of the Defence Act 1903. He simultaneously announced the appointment of Rear Admiral P.R. Sinclair, Royal Australian Navy as the Commandant. In September 1985 the Interim Academy Council ceased its functions and the Australian Defence Force Academy Council held its inaugural meeting under the Chairmanship of Sir Edward Woodward.</p>
<p>In 1986(n), ADFA opened and began providing military and tertiary academic education for Officer Cadets and Midshipmen. In late 2003, the Australian Department of Defence entered into another agreement with the University of New South Wales for the operation of University College at ADFA.</p>

<p>Over its history ADFA has been criticised for various reasons, such as the reason for the Grey Review - <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazing.html" title="Hazing">bastardisation</a>. In 1998, the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defence_7adc.html" title="Department of Defence">Department of Defence</a> released the <i>Grey review</i>, a report about bastardisation and sexual harassment at ADFA during the 80s and early 90s. In doing so, it also examined relevant cultural, structural and management issues at ADFA. Having found evidence of bastardisation, and of a failure to recognise and prevent such bastardisation by staff, the review received considerable attention from the national media, and thereby caused considerable damage to the Academy's reputation.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Defence_Force_Academy_1a2b.html" title="Edit section: Reform">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reform</span></h3>
<p>Following the 1998 <i>Grey Review</i> ADFA made various immediate and significant changes in reaction to evidence of widespread bastardation. Now all recommendations of the Grey Review relating solely to ADFA have been implemented. Such actions include the abolishment of the internal Cadet rank system, which ranked Officer Cadets and Midshipmen on their years. Now all Officer Cadets and Midshipmen are considered as equal in rank. Additionally, whilst cadets of differing years once lived together, they now live only with those in the same year. Staff were educated on how to identify and deal with bastardisation.</p>
<p>In order to fix its tarnished public image, ADFA went to the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation_9631.html" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">ABC</a> to offer it the opportunity of making a documentary about Academy life. The result was a five episode-long documentary called <i>The Academy</i>, which featured in 2001.</p>

<p>Under its agreement with the Department of Defence, the University of New South Wales (UNSW) provides Midshipmen (<a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Australian_Navy_272e.html" title="Royal Australian Navy">RAN</a>) and Officer Cadets (<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Army_5208.html" title="Australian Army">ARA</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Australian_Air_Force_8a68.html" title="Royal Australian Air Force">RAAF</a>) with a tertiary education at its 'University College' campus (UNSW@ADFA) which is located on the Academy grounds.</p>
<p>Midshipmen and Officer Cadets undertake three and four year undergraduate degrees at ADFA. Currently, available undergraduate degrees include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bachelor of Arts - BA</li>
<li>Bachelor of Science - BSc</li>
<li>Bachelor of Business - BBus</li>
<li>Bachelor of Engineering (Aeronautical, Civil, Electrical and Mechanical) – BE</li>
<li>Bachelor of Technology (Aeronautical and Aviation) - BTech</li>
</ul>
<p>However, those that do well academically and militarily have the possibility of a return to ADFA for one year in order to do honours, as long as their respective services authorise further training. Currently, UNSW@ADFA offers honours in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bachelor of Arts - BA(Hons)</li>
<li>Bachelor of Business - BBus(Hons)</li>
<li>Bachelor of Science - BSc(Hons)</li>
</ul>
<p>Post-graduate studies are provided to civilians, senior members of the ADF and senior public servants. Increasingly, distance-education units are being offered for service members not based in Canberra.</p>

<p>The UNSW and ADF have invested considerable effort in maintaining a high standard of academic performance. "83 per cent of the more than 600 students enrolled in the three-year course had tertiary entrance scores higher than 80 per cent, placing them among the nation's best academic performers" (Donnelly, 2005).</p>

<p>After coming to ADFA, newly appointed Officer Cadets and Midshipmen begin a six week-long phase of training known as Year One Familiarisation Training (YOFT). This training is designed to familiarise first years with the military. It includes training in discipline, military customs and traditions, adventure training (for instance, abseiling and high-speed water insertions), generally how to ‘live’ at ADFA, and particularly, drill and ceremonial activities, as after YOFT first years will be formally welcomed into the Academy during the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) Parade, for which the reviewing officer is the CDF. This is the first year cadets' first opportunity to be seen publicly on parade. The current CDF is <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Chief_Marshal_1cb0.html" title="Air Chief Marshal">Air Chief Marshal</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_Houston_5246.html" title="Angus Houston">Angus Houston</a>.</p>

<p>During academic sessions ADFA provides basic military training to Midshipmen and Officer Cadets through the Academy Military Education Training (AMET) program. The AMET program encompasses physical training (PT), leadership and management studies, equity and diversity (E&amp;D), military history, defence studies, drill and ceremonial, the military communication program (MCP), first aid, military law, field craft and weapons training.</p>

<p>After the end of academic sessions however, Midshipmen and Officer Cadets move to their respective single service colleges for Single Service Training (known as SST). Such training prepares them to be officers in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Defence_Force_def3.html" title="Australian Defence Force">ADF</a>. However, given the complex nature of leading in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Army_5208.html" title="Australian Army">ARA</a>, Army Officer Cadets continue this training for another 12 months after leaving ADFA at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Military_College%2C_Duntroon_0a67.html" title="Royal Military College, Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a> (RMC-D) to later be commissioned as Lieutenants. Most Officer Cadets and Midshipmen undertake six SST periods over a three year period. Bachelor of Technology (Aviation) Pilots have a n accelerated academic and military training program to fit with their movement from ADFA to Basic Flight Training School (BFTS) after approximately two years at ADFA.</p>

<p>The ADFA year is split by the two academic sessions, during which academic education is carried out. However, a variety of other activities take place in and around these sessions. Before Session 1, 'first years' undertake YOFT whilst second and third years are trained on their respective SST blocks. After Session 1, a two week holiday period begins, though first years go on their first SST block. Academics recommence after this period with the start of Session 2. At the end of Session 2, all years commence their final SST block for the year, and shortly after this, third years graduate, and this is formally recognised during the 'Grad' parade.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Defence_Force_Academy_1a2b.html" title="Edit section: Organisation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Organisation</span></h4>
<p>ADFA is based on an amalgamation of all three services, and the organisation of the cadet side of the academy reflects this. Divisions are accommodated in accommodation blocks (commonly known as 'lines' or 'divs') consisting of five sections (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo) with a sixth section (Foxtrot) normally reserved for divisional staff and storage. Each section has 2 corridors (Half-sections) with four rooms and shared toilet, bathroom and laundry facilities.</p>
<p>There are six squadrons each consisting of a few divisions: 1A Squadron is first years, Divisions 1-3; 1B Squadron is a second first year squadron, Divisions 4-6 or 7; Navy Squadron, Divisions 8-11; Army Alpha, Divisions 12-14; Army Bravo, Divisions 15-17 (AA and AB rotate second and third year Army Officer Cadets each year); Air Force Squadron, Divisions 18-22. There is also an Advanced students Navy Division which is part of the Officers' Mess annex.</p>
<p>The Squadron chain of command is as follows. Each division has an Divisional SNCO (Army SGT or equivalent) and Divisional Officer (Army Captain or equivalent). Each Squadron has a Squadron Sergeant Major (SSM) (Army WO2 or equivalent) and an Officer Commanding (OC) (Army Major or equivalent).</p>
<p>Within each division a Midshipman/Officer Cadet is appointed as the Divisional Duty Officer (DDO) on a weekly or fortnightly basis. The DDO is responsible for the general administration of the division, its cleanliness, and conducting the division's movements to and from military commitments. In addition, each section has a section leader appointed who is responsible for the section duties and assists the DDO.</p>
