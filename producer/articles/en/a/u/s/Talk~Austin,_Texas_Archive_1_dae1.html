<p>Regarding 1900-1969...Ramiro Martinez should be listed ahead of Houston McCoy as the person that "gunned down" Charles Whitman. According to a recent article published by Texas Monthly, ("96 Minutes", Pamela Colloff, Texas Monthly, August 8, 2006, Volume 34, Issue 8), Martinez, McCoy and a civilian named Allen Crum stormed the observation deck. Martinez fired the first shots at Whitman with his service revolver and finally brought him down with McCoy's shotgun. McCoy was overheard consoling Ramirez following the shooting.</p>

<p>Although "gerrymandering" may seem like a politically loaded term that violates the NPOV principle, going by the current entry on <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerrymandering.html" title="Gerrymandering">Gerrymandering</a>, it's appropriate and does not violate NPOV: in the case brought by Dems against the GOP to fight redistricting, the Dems argued the new district lines were drawn for racially motivated reasons. The GOP argued back that it was done strictly for political gain. This is the very essence of gerrymandering, and I suggest the word can be restored, and should be, because it is more descriptive. NPOV writing doesn't need to be weak.</p>
<p>After looking into this a bit, I agree that this should be called gerrymandering, so I reverted to the previous revision. My assumption that the Republicans would have at least denied gerrymandering proved incorrect.</p>

<p>The gerrymandering is stated as fact in the article. However, it is only an allegation. The only thing I found about it were various blog entries. Allegations by blogs should not be included in an encyclopedia. The Republicans wrote that they redistricted to rectify the 1990 gerrymandering by the Democrats <a href="http://www.texasgop.org/newsroom/newsDisplay.php?id=2619" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.texasgop.org/newsroom/newsDisplay.php?id=2619" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --<a href="../../../n/y/r/User%7ENyr14_4000.html" title="User:Nyr14">Nyr14</a> July 8, 2005 22:18 (UTC)</p>
<p>If the only thing you found regarding that was blog entries, you didn't look very hard. See the above discussion. This is not blog speculation--this is the substance of the arguments made in court. The Republicans themselves explicitly argued that the lines were drawn for politically motivated reasons. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamrice_31ce.html" title="User:Adamrice">adamrice</a> 8 July 2005 23:20 (UTC)</p>
<p>The arguments made in court by the Democrats were that the Republicans gerrymandered. However, the courts have ruled that the Republicans didn't gerrymander.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported, "The three-judge panel reconfirmed its original decision that the map does not unconstitutionally gerrymander Texas voting districts for partisan purposes<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA061005.1B.redistricting.2fb55d9c7.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA061005.1B.redistricting.2fb55d9c7.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>."</p>
<p>The Dallas Morning News: "A panel of three federal judges unanimously upheld Texas' 2003 congressional redistricting plan on Thursday, once again rejecting claims by Democrats and civil-rights groups that the map is so zealously partisan that it's illegal."</p>

<p>The Dem's argument in that suit was that the GOP's redistricting was done for <i>racist</i> purposes. The GOP countered that it was done for <i>political</i> purposes. That's gerrymandering. The court found basically that as long as it wasn't done for racist purposes, it was OK. Furthermore, the previous districts were not drawn by the Dems, they were drawn by a judge. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamrice_31ce.html" title="User:Adamrice">adamrice</a> 9 July 2005 15:13 (UTC)</p>

<p>Gerrymandering is defined as "To divide (a geographic area) into voting districts so as to give unfair advantage to one party in elections.<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=gerrymander" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=gerrymander" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>" To win 66% of the seats in a state that is about 60% Republican is not an unfair advantage (especially when you account for the fact that FPTP systems tend to exaggerate the majority party's winnings, e.g. in the 2005 British Parliament elections the Labour party received only 35.2% of the vote but received 55.2% of the seats <a href="../../../r/e/s/Results_of_the_United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2005_e3ce.html#Overall_results" title="Results of the United Kingdom general election, 2005">Results_of_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005#Overall_results</a>. The redistricting wasn't a gerrymander. Before the redistricting was done, in 2002 the Republicans received 56% of the vote statewide but only received 47% of the seats; that was a gerrymander. --<a href="../../../n/y/r/User%7ENyr14_4000.html" title="User:Nyr14">Nyr14</a> 16:32, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

When three districts have been meticulously drawn to pinwheel out from the intersection of Guadalupe &amp; 38th and run all the way to the border? When Austin is the largest city in the USA to (now) lack its own representative in Congress? You've decided to draw on a definition defining it as <i>unfair</i> advantage.

<dd>Here's a slightly different definition from Webster's College Dictionary (version published in 1991): "the dividing of a state, county, etc. into election districts so as to give one political party a majority in many districts while concentrating the voting strength of the other party into as few districts as possible"</dd>
<dd>That's pretty close to the definition that I would give based on my personal knowledge and past studies. However, I think Nyr14 has put forth a number of references to definitions that lead me to believe that the modern conception of this term generally includes an explicit or implied "unfair" aspect. My new opinion is that we should change the wording so that, rather than stating the central city "has been gerrymandered". We should say something along the lines of "has been split amongst multiple sprawling districts that do not conform to any unifying economic, geographic, or cultural theme. Many political observers have characterized the resulting districting layout to be a typical case of gerrymandering. It should be noted that modern usage of this term imply a degree of unfairness of illegality that has not been indicated by judicial review"--67.100.137.40 20:58, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think there's a misunderstanding here. The courts found that the plan was not "so zealously partisan as to be unconstitutional". But this doesn't mean the plan was not a gerrymander. Something like the following might work best:</p>
<dl>
<dd>However, two of its three congressional districts are presently held by Republicans; this is largely due to the 2003 redistricting, which left Austin with no congressional seat of its own. Democrats contend that this is flagrant <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerrymandering.html" title="Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a> designed to limit their influence; Republicans argue that their redistricting plan only worked to undo the gerrymandering done by previous redistricting schemas.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If we present both sides claims without taking sides in the factual dispute, it'll be closer to NPOV. Thoughts? <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> July 9, 2005 16:49 (UTC)</p>
<p>Two of the three seats being held by Republicans is more likely due to the fact that Texas is an extremely Republican state; 61% of Texans voted for Bush in 2004 <a href="http://www.uselectionatlas.org/USPRESIDENT/state.php?year=2004&amp;fips=48&amp;f=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uselectionatlas.org/USPRESIDENT/state.php?year=2004&amp;fips=48&amp;f=0" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. --<a href="../../../n/y/r/User%7ENyr14_4000.html" title="User:Nyr14">Nyr14</a> July 9, 2005 17:00 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't think even the Republicans have tried to claim the district lines they've drawn qualify as gerrymandering. Just look at the multiple (Dem) districts that snake north-south from central Texas to the Valley, or the (Rep) district that snakes east-west from central Austin to NW Houston.</p>
<p>So I don't think the text should be ambiguous as to whether there's gerrymandering. Now, the questions as to whether the gerrymandering was unconstitutional, that's where I think the NPOV is to state that the Republicans and the courts have said the answer is no, but the Dems have a case that the answer ought to have been yes.--67.101.66.213 9 July 2005 19:12 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is incorrect to say the Republican re-redistricting was to "correct" previous Democratic gerrymandering, since the previous map was drawn by a judge. It is also facile to argue that because 61% of Texans voted for Bush that they would vote the same at the state and local election. Nyr14 is apparently too young to remember the phrase "Reagan Democrat." <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamrice_31ce.html" title="User:Adamrice">adamrice</a> 16:17, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The previous map was drawn by judges that basically kept the 1990 map that had been gerrymandered by Democrats. As I have said before Texas is a heavily Republican state (the exact percentage isn't important just the fact that they have a good majority) and FPTP systems exaggerate the majority party's winnings so 66% of the seats isn't odd. --<a href="../../../n/y/r/User%7ENyr14_4000.html" title="User:Nyr14">Nyr14</a> 22:10, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is WAY too much liberal/Democrat Party POV/'spin' in the politics section. Offending parties need to clean this up or have this done for them. Example problems:</p>
<p>Effects of Stunted Growth: Austin's roadways are completely overloaded these days because anti-growth Democrats didn't make appropriate, responsible upgrades to the existing infrastructure. There is no mention of this in this section.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think Austin's transportation problems are complicated and not easily blamed entirely on 'anti-growth' Democrats. That's a part of it, but so is the nature of TxDOT funding past and present, growth patterns being different from "expected" patterns, conflicting jurisdictions, etc. That said, you're right that this isn't covered enough. I welcome attempts to start something on this.--67.101.66.193 19:19, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. I'll be happy to point this out, but it somewhat flies in the face of rationality to assert that counter-growth choices were not the major reason for the lack of infrastructure development. I'll take a stab at it -- again -- and let the fur fly for those so inclined. --<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.69.219.9.html" title="User:66.69.219.9">66.69.219.9</a> 23:12, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Liberal Holier-than-Thouness: Pervasive undercurrent throughout this article with respect to language. It's obvious to a conservative, but transparent 'NPOV' to a liberal. Examples:</p>
<p>(1) Vandalism of the recent re-write for this section -- which merely reversed labels and adjectives for liberal and conservative areas -- was somehow intolerable to the recent changer. Note that the Democrats have a 'stronghold' while Republicans 'tend to...' blah-blah-blah.</p>
<p>"As a result of the major party realignment that began in the 1970's, central Austin became a stronghold of the Democratic Party while the suburbs tend to vote Republican. To a limited degree the division between Democratic and Republican precincts coincides with the aforementioned divisions between supporters of environmental regulations and supporters of unfettered urban growth. One consequence of this is that in the most recent redistricting plan, formulated by the Republican-majority legislature, the central city has been split among multiple sprawling districts that do not conform to any unifying economic, geographic or cultural theme.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think "stronghold" is a fair word for central Austin. By that I mean Austin proper, not the metro area.--67.101.66.193 19:19, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>(2) Exaggeration and convoluted language: "Many (????) political observers have characterized the resulting districting layout as gerrymandering. The plan was contested in Federal court, but a judicial review of the redistricting plan determined the plan was not illegal." (NOT illegal...? How about "legal and not requiring any changes"...which is the truth, and which is how this sentence was rewritten?)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This language was hashed over for a while. I don't think it's perfect, but I was able to live with it. I recommend you read the talk re. this section if you haven't and see the views that we are trying to accomodate.--67.101.66.193 19:19, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It's moronic, double-redundant and counterintuitive language, but the "not illegal" phrase is actually kinda growing on me: it is at once both too-clever-by-half and self-convicting.

<p>(3) Pure political Nonsense: In the following, if John Kerry "defeated" 'Bush' (and note the disrespect of not using the President's full name or title) and "won" something...what was it, exactly? The fact is that 'Kerry' lost the state and its electoral votes (which a rewrite made clear), and happened to have a majority in Austin.: "Overall, the city leans Democratic; in the 2004 presidential election, John Kerry defeated Bush by a wide margin in Austin."</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am with you that "defeated" is not accurate vs. "more votes." I don't like the "won the popular vote" concept either. I can't get myself worked up over "President Bush" vs. "Bush"--67.101.66.193 19:19, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No problem...clean up complete. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
<p>P.S. Sixth Street, the old Pecan Street, was historically a "red light district". Those not knowing that should do their own homework.</p>

<dd>Can you cite a source or at least a date range for this? My understanding is that East 6th/Pecan has always been respectable. And there are several other areas that come to mind first as long time or current red light districts. So if nothing else a date range would be good.--67.101.66.193 19:19, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I found your edits to be far more biased than the original article. Austin IS liberal, especially when compared to the rest of the state. The politics mentioned in the article are meant to highlight this. Stating that Kerry won a strong majority in Travis county is an acceptable observation, as it provides contrast to outside readers to Texas, known throughout the rest of the country as a Republican stronghold. Bush was referred to as 'Bush' in line with current Wikipedia trends, as he had been obviously mentioned multiple times (twice, to be exact), with full title, earlier in the article. The gerrymandering plan was challenged as illegal - stating that it was deemed 'not illegal' is an acceptable term, and is most certainly not POV. In addition, your tone in this post is ridiculously argumentative and in no way in line with the community WP wishes to foster. I was in no way involved, I didn't revert your edits, but I strongly agree with the reverts. Your edits were biased. The article clearly presents an accurate view of Austin politics. Whether they are in line with yours or not is a moot point. <a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell">Bbatsell</a> 18:06, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you, liberal Bbatsell. Your argument only demonstrates for the umpteenth time that liberals are incapable of seeing their own bias. The fact that Austin "IS" liberal does not justify the liberal spin, word choices and POV as contained in the article's Politics section. This is Wikipedia, which aspires to a NPOV, not the Austin American-Statesman/local fishwrapper. Don't like my attitude on the Talk page...? That's your prerogative. But the fact of the matter is that it does not carry over into the article itself. My comments in the article are FACTUAL, and in fact do not engage in the sort of spin-ology that the liberals have. Take a Midol and re-read the article's edits from a factual standpoint. <a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.69.219.9.html" title="User:66.69.219.9">66.69.219.9</a> 18:16, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to add my $0.02 that I think the wording in the politics section is fairly good NPOV. And I say this as someone who's been described as slight to the right of Attila the Hun. Keep in mind that this article is referring to Austin proper, not the Austin metro area. That neccessitates highlighting that much of the politics in the city proper is pretty leftist, especially because of high turnout in central neighborhoods. Perhaps it can be made more clear that words like "stronghold" are referring to the center of Austin proper, not the larger center of all Central Texas.--67.101.66.193 19:19, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks so much for your condescension, telling me how "we" do things on Wikipedia. I was also under the impression that "we" set up accounts and usernames, rather than hide behind anonymous IP numbers. My point, since it apparently didn't penetrate on the first try, is that you have apparently set yourself up as the sole arbiter of NPOVness, but your ability to discern bias is not better, and is probably worse, than all the other contributors collectively.

<dd>Aha, yes you're probably right about the 5/4 inclusive of the current area. I don't really see the point of including it, personally -- it may be true, but is it really necessary? Some liberals might call Rush Limbaugh's fanbase the People's Republic of Fathead, but does it deserve a mention in his article?

<p>Yes. The highest elevation of Austin is: 8,749 feet (Guadalupe Peak), Which ranks 14th in the State The Lowest elevation is: sea level (Gulf of Mexico),Ranking 3 rd in the State and, a mean elevation of: 1,700 feet.

<li>I assume you mean highest and lowest points in <i>Texas</i> not <i>Austin, Texas</i>. Neither Guadalupe Peak or any portion of the Gulf Coast are in Austin.

<p>The following text isn't <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral</a> in my opinion: "In fact, Austin's well-established excessive traffic problems -- today's most glaring problem with Austin in general -- are largely rooted in <i>historical choices to not support growth by denying highway/infrastructure development</i>." Especially the last bit, which I've added emphasis to. Traffic can be alleviated by highway development for a time, but as more people move to the city or realize how travel has improved, traffic again worsens. Can't recall the name of this theory right now...</p>
<p>With regards to Austin traffic in particular, other initiatives — like the barely defeated 2000 light rail plan — would have probably done more for the city than yet-another-highway.</p>
<p>Which brings me to another point: Austin has denied highway development? I disagree.

<dd>I think the idea is that for years, Mopac and I-35 were the only freeways in the area. 183 and 290 have only been renovated into freeways in the last 10 to 12 years, and the others you mention are even more recent. (360 and the eastern section of 183 aren't freeways, due to their at-grade intersections.) Compare this with, say, Fort Worth, where most of the current freeway infrastructure has been in place for 40 years. (Not necessarily advocating more freeways here... but I am suggesting that other cities got to eat more from the trough.) -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 22:41, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Talk%7EAustin%2C_Texas_Archive_1_dae1.html" title="Edit section: LCRA">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">LCRA</span></h2>
<p>Changed the 1900 to 1969 section to more accurately reflect how the dams were built. To say it was the Federal Government who built the dams is incorrect. The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) was created in 1934 to complete the dam that the Insull Company started and to also build a series of dams to protect against flooding in Austin and down river. The LCRA was actually created by the Texas State Legislature as a conservation and reclamation district.</p>
<p>From the LCRA website at www.lcra.org:</p>
<p>The birth of LCRA In 1931, a Texas subsidiary of the Chicago-based Insull utility company began construction of Hamilton Dam on the Colorado River in Burnet County, on the site originally proposed by Adam Johnson. The project brought jobs for as many as 1,500 people in the deepening stages of the Great Depression. But a year and a half later, the utility went bankrupt, leaving the dam less than half-built.</p>
<p>Alvin Wirtz, a lawyer and politician skilled in water issues, was appointed receiver for the bankrupt company's assets and began looking for funding to finish the dam. The only option turned out to be a package of loan and grants from the federal government, on one condition: that the money go to a public agency created and owned by the State of Texas.</p>
<p>In 1933 Wirtz drafted legislation creating a Colorado River Authority, modeled after the federal Tennessee Valley Authority. Three times the Texas Legislature considered the bill, and each time — pressured by private utilities and West Texas water interests — the Legislature voted it down.</p>
<p>Finally, Gov. Miriam A. "Ma" Ferguson arranged a compromise, and the Legislature passed the bill. As a compromise to the West Texas interests, the new entity would have jurisdiction only over the lower portion of the river, with authority to store and sell water, generate electricity, prevent flood damages, and implement reforestation and soil-conservation programs.</p>
<p>On Nov. 13, 1934, Gov. Ferguson signed the bill creating the Lower Colorado River Authority. More than three months later, on Feb. 19, 1935, LCRA opened for business. In 1937 LCRA completed Hamilton Dam, renaming it for U.S. Rep. J. P. Buchanan, a key Congressional supporter. That same year it broke ground on Mansfield Dam, which would serve as the valley's flood-control structure. In 1938 it completed construction of Inks Dam, immediately downstream of Buchanan Dam.</p>
<p>Rep. Buchanan died in 1937 and was succeeded by Lyndon Johnson, a protege of Wirtz. Johnson realized the potential LCRA and its dams offered the region. He persuaded LCRA to use the electric power from its dams to benefit Central Texas communities and rural areas. LCRA manpower strung the lines that brought electricity to customers of the region's first two electric cooperatives, Pedernales and what is today Bluebonnet.</p>
<p>In 1938 LCRA faced its first critical test, when heavy flooding swept the basin. Critics charged LCRA had worsened the flood by its operation of Buchanan Dam, prompting an investigation by the Texas Senate. The investigation not only exonerated LCRA but also determined that LCRA needed to extend the height of Mansfield Dam by an additional 80 feet to its current height of 278 feet to provide more protection to Austin and downstream communities.</p>
<p>By 1939 LCRA had acquired a service area surrounding Austin from private utilities and began a campaign to convince communities to purchase their local distribution systems and buy power from LCRA. Almost all communities did — and saw retail electric bills drop almost by half from what private utilities had charged. LCRA also sponsored "electric fairs" with local merchants to introduce residents to the benefits of electric appliances.</p>
<p>In 1940 LCRA completed reconstruction of Tom Miller Dam, owned by the City of Austin. The dam had twice been destroyed by floods. The following year, months before the United States entered World War II, LCRA completed Mansfield Dam.</p>

<p>Anyone else think this is unnecessary, as well as incomlete and misleading?</p>
<p>Unnecessary: These people's biographies should tell the story sufficiently. Perhaps it could exist in a separate entry, it is does for the Houston entry.</p>
<p>Misleading and incomplete: Some of the people on the list only temporarily resided in Austin to attend UT (eg, Wes Anderson) or hold political office (George W. Bush). By that logic, there are many, many more people who qualify. Following this line to its end (the complete list) is absurd: it would make the list too long to be of any use.</p>
<p>Only one further example of how absurd this list might be: George Armstrong Custer--American soldier, quartered at Texas School For the Blind during Reconstruction of the Union Verylongnile 20:43, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that following anything to its end is absurd. For that reason, I think that suitable controls should exist on the list. The list of notables should reflect the best of Austin, and contain names people who made a significant contribution to the city. By this standard, Gen. Custer should not be on the list. However, Michael Dell, Lance Armstrong, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, each clearly deserve a mention. And yes, George W. Bush would clearly qualify. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveHopson_68d6.html" title="User:SteveHopson">SteveHopson</a> 20:59, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Do you mean completing the list is absurd? To be clear, following this logic to its end would mean including every notable person who attended UT or held a state political office in Austin, regardless of whether they "lived" in Austin. George W. Bush may have "lived" in the governor's mansion, but his home is in Crawford, Texas, just as his parents' home was in Houston while they occupied in the White House.</p>
<p>None of this is addressing the fact that the list seems unnecessary and vainglorious. A quick sample of five other cities revealed only one that had a list of notable persons (Des Mones, IA: a very short list indeed). Can you imagine the list of notables from New York or Los Angeles?</p>
<p>My opinion is that this list be deleted (or made very, very short) and a link to (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Austinites" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Austinites" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Austinites</a>) be put in its place. Verylongnile 19:02, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My point is that its very easy to play the 'take a concept to its extreme end' game. The list we have here is not out of control and represents who Austinites are. If the list got out of control in the future, we could always create a separate page devoted to the topic, as is done on the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose%2C_California_e18c.html" title="San Jose, California">San Jose, California</a> article. No, every student at UT and every resident of the Governor's Mansion do not make significant contributions to Austin as a community and should not be included. As far as George H.W. Bush and Houston, he represented Houston as a Congressman and returned to the City in retirement -- I certainly would think that would qualify as a notable resident.</dd>

A similar search for the term, "Notable residents" returned 13,600 articles, including <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turin.html" title="Turin">Turin</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice_beach.html" title="Venice beach">Venice beach</a>, and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plano%2C_Texas_041b.html" title="Plano, Texas">Plano, Texas</a>. Even your reference to "Des Mones, IA: a very short list indeed," seems shallow. Assuming you meant <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Moines%2C_Iowa_3123.html" title="Des Moines, Iowa">Des Moines, Iowa</a>, the "short" list includes 18 names.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Would help if you (Steve Hopson) read what I have written. Either address the concerns or remain uninvolved. And please try to be less abrasive.</p>
<p>1) "The list of notables should reflect the best of Austin, and contain names people who made a significant contribution to the city." These are not definable parameters. What does "the best of Austin" mean? What can be considered significant or insignificant? Why should denizens have to make a significant contribution to their cities in order to be considered notable?</p>
<p>2)"No, every student at UT and every resident of the Governor's Mansion do not make significant contributions to Austin as a community and should not be included." I did not suggest any such thing. I am suggesting that we close the door on out-of-town students and out-of-town politicians altogether, as they are not neccessarily considered residents of Austin.</p>
<p>2)"The list we have here is not out of control and represents who Austinites are. If the list got out of control in the future, we could always create a separate page devoted to the topic, as is done on the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose%2C_California_e18c.html" title="San Jose, California">San Jose, California</a> article." It is not a question of whether or not the list is "out of control"; I am mostly concerned about the accuracy of the list. Further, I have already suggested (twice) that the list be removed from the main article and a link be put in its place to the list that exists at Category:Austinites. The list is far from being comlete and is already unwieldly.</p>
<p>3)"As far as George H.W. Bush and Houston, he represented Houston as a Congressman and returned to the City in retirement -- I certainly would think that would qualify as a notable resident." My point exactly. He may have lived in Washington, DC for all those years, but he was never a resident. He voted in Houston, payed taxes in Houston, etc. Similarly, George W. Bush was never a resident of Austin.</p>
<p>4)"Concerning your "survey" of other cities, your work here seems very shallow." I made a "quick sample", not a scientific survey. To wit: Phoenix, AZ; Portland, OR; Houston, TX; Atlanta, GA; Des Moines, IA--only Des Moines had a list in the main article, and it was rather short when compared to Austin's. The same is true for the cities on your list: Fargo, Helsinki, et al. I take exception to you twice calling my work "shallow", assuming you meant "shoddy". Considering that your response to such "shallow" work consisted of a Google search, I should think this is a bit like the pot calling the kettle black.</p>

I was just looking at the "London" article, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London#Society_and_culture" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London#Society_and_culture" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, which is deemed a "good article" under "good article criteria" and saw that there were quite a few noted Londeners in the article. Would it be appropriate to, say, include the fact that Michael Dell makes Austin his home under the section on technology? And that Lance Armstrong makes Austin his home under the section on sports and leisure? I agree that George W. Bush lived here (as a function of his role as governor), but he's not an Austinite.

<p>Hello folks. Austin native here. The entire sports section should be rewritten. This is pathetic. The Austin sports scene is dominated by the stellar University of Texas sports program, which is mentioned almost as an afterthought. This should be the absolute first item mentioned, and additional accolades should be mentioned as well, such as all years UT football won national championships, as well as the fact that the UT sports program as a whole dominates college sports. Actually I could find a citation for this if need be - I'm not just ranting. UT and UCLA regularly are ranked #1 and #2 for overall sports programs. The mention of the large number of Longhorn olympians should be included, (including but not limited to Kat Osterman). The mention of the professional teams in Austin should follow an extended discussion of the UT sports program, possibly including seating capacity and picture of memorial stadium. Mention of Darrel Royal would be a welcome addition, as he is an Austin icon. The swim center is the best in the state of Texas. The facilities are second to none. This entire section should be completely redone to accurately reflect the true nature of Austin sports. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArteworks_84c7.html" title="User:Arteworks">ArteWorks Business Class</a> 22:56, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay I used to own and operate a now defunct longhorn sports site at mightyhorns.com - it was one of the first longhorn fan sites, even before hornfans. It was in operation from 1997 to 2000. Anyway, I have maintained a friendship with one of my writers from that site. His name is Bert Hancock and currently he writes for Roger Clemens Inside Texas. He knows all about the horn sports program and history more than I do. I have contacted him and asked if he is willing to write a couple of paragraphs for review. When he gets back to me I will post them here for discussion and then after a few days if no objection I will make them live. If he isn't interested then I'll try to come up with something, but will likely need some assistance after I submit the first draft because although a huge fan I am certainly no expert in the history and such. I'll keep everyone posted. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArteworks_84c7.html" title="User:Arteworks">ArteWorks Business Class</a> 15:16, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Today I posted a note on hornfans asking if anyone wanted to help rewrite this section and got a bunch of sarcastic smack talk about it.

<li>I'm skeptical of recruiting authors from outside Wikipedia. New editors are always welcome of course, but they have a downside in that they don't know the ropes here. I'm particularly concerned about recruiting them from a partisan location because of the risk of their introducing undue bias to the article. Again, any of them are welcome if they play by the rules, but I actually hope your message does not result in a flood of new poeple who are mainly interested in talking about how great UT sports are. We have quite a lot of editors watching this page already. If needed, we can always recruit more eyeballs from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_Texas_85c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians/Texas">Wikipedia:Wikipedians/Texas</a>, or we can nominate it at <a href="../../../t/e/x/Wikipedia%7ETexan_Collaboration_of_the_Month_290c.html" title="Wikipedia:Texan Collaboration of the Month">Wikipedia:Texan_Collaboration_of_the_Month</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 16:32, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was surprised that we didn't have a climate section already, so I decided to make one. It's still a little short at the moment, but it has great room for expansion.

Anyone is welcome to help me expand this- I was thinking of including things such as relation to tornado alley, flash flooding, etc..</p>
<p>On a side note, I've tried to make this section pretty well sourced, using &lt;ref&gt; tags.

<p>For what it's worth the photo of the "Hill Country" is nice but not exceedingly impressive. Among other things the "hilliness" does not stand out (if you only glance at it you might not even notice that it was taken from the top of a hill since the vegetation is really what stands out). Does somebody out there have a free picture that maybe gives a better visual? --Mcorazao 17:32, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. I think showing the vegetation is important (amazingly people still think we live in the desert) but that is not what the caption is explicitly referring to.</p>

<p>I went ahead and removed this section, because there must be over 100 churches in Austin. We could never hope to list them all, and we certainly have no reason to list them all. It has a real chance to turn in to a "list my church here" section, followed by a "after listing my church I should make a wiki article on it" section.</p>
<p>If there are <i>notable</i> churches that deserve mention, maybe they could be listed, but there should be a reason why they are notable listed.</p>
<p>Yes, I realize this might be taking <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">Be Bold</a> a bit too boldly. If someone really feels the section has merit, re-add it.

<li>I think a short list of the largest congregations (not just churches) does merit mention. The article has a lot of information that is not notable by encyclopedic standards - especially to a non-local audience. This information is included because it does affect many Austinites, as does the membership of major congregations. For example, the article goes into great detail about our transportation network and includes a mention of every school district and institution of higher learning (several of which I have never seen mentioned elsewhere). I think we should allow mention of the City's religious groups in a spirit of inclusiveness and with the goal of creating a well-rounded article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMindsEye_e83c.html" title="User:TheMindsEye">TheMindsEye</a> 13:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
