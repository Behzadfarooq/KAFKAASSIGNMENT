<p>For crying out loud, instead of continual reverts, could we discuss these blasted templates? There does seem to be a real issue with "template creep", and given that editors of other articles such as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> have given them a speedy farewell, we might want to talk about them. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 23:48, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I support <b>keep</b>ing the templates referring to Commonwealth realms and nations.

They're more relevant to the main Australia article than half the external links.

<dd>I think its pretty good, it shouldn't really cover anything beyond the basic structure of the government, the recently featured <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> article had the same breakdown.

<dd>The Government section is good; I just don't like the dot point method. And I'm a bit confused with the Politics section. In most country articles, Politics is used to talk about government in general, whereas we have a separate government section. So if our Politics section is used to talk exclusively about Parliament, why then must Government only be an outline? Shouldn't it be more detailed?</dd>
<dd>In the Australian topics table, at the bottom of the page, foreign relations is included under history, but I don't think that's the right place to put it. Do you mean to write about it, or simply include a link to it as a Main article? Either way, there isn't really a corresponding section - the closest are Government and Politics.</dd>
<dd>If discussion of military is required for featured articles, a military section could be created, like in the South Africa article.</dd>
<dd>I don't know how deep we will be able to delve into transport for Australia, given it's more state-based (and in fact, state concern). I suppose we could have minor discussion on major infrastructure, like inter-state/trans-continental railways, national highways and capital city airports. Perhaps even some unique features like road-trains? Still, I doubt its necessity.</dd>
<dd>As for communication, I've never seen it written about before in a country article - not even in South Africa. That's something that could go into Economy possibly, but I don't think it needs a separate section. Actually, transport could also be included in economy.</dd>
<dd>It seems that people expect country articles to have to same layout as the CIA World Factbook, and I decidedly disagree - the factbook is hardly something to aspire to.</dd>
<dd>Anyways, thank you for the great work you've been doing. I'm sure the article will become a feature with your efforts. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 07:04, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Also, I have added information on Australia's maritime territory to <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exclusive_Economic_Zone_df64.html" title="Exclusive Economic Zone">Exclusive Economic Zone</a> that could be included under geography, as in the France article.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 11:13, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could whoever said that the Queen is generally considered to be the head of state please find a source for this statement?

<dd>You're right, although referencing the (written) constitution won't do you any good - it actually doesn't mention a "head of state" explicitly. But let’s not get into this again. As a <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENewbie_34d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Newbie">newbie</a>, you’ll no doubt be surprised to learn that this was one of the most heated/lively issues on Wikipedia.

<p>They're US dollars (GDP) and per capita income. Much obliged if Cyberjunkie could insert 'US'.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Australia or its commonwealth</span></h2>
<p>Wouldn't it be usefull to keep the continent/island and the political structure separate? The first is far more "eternal" than the last. Only plate tectonics can "destroy" the first and it has existed for how many millions of years? On the other hand the commonwealth exists apparently since 1 January 1901.

<dd>I disagree entirely. Australia the country and Australia the continent are one in the same. The natural features of the continent are discussed within the diverging articles of ecology and geography. Most of the continent articles focus upon the polities situated within their bounds, and for Australia, the polity encompasses it in its entirety.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Most of the estimated 20.3 million Australians descend from 18th and 19th century immigrants....</span></h2>
<p>... most from Britain] and Ireland to begin with, but from other sources in later years" in the Demographics section seems both inaccurate and blantantly contradictory. The 19th century was over in 1899 (and 1788 was only 12 years before the end of the 18th!) At the end of the 19th century, the "later years" of non-Anglo-Irish immigration had not yet begun, and the population was still well over 90% Anglo-Irish. Moreover, is it really true to say that "most" Australians are descended from immigrants who came to Australia before 1899?? My understanding is that even many of the Anglo-surnamed Australians can trace their heritage to British immigrants who came in waves after 1900 (not to mention the non-Anglos). I'm not Australian so I'm reluctant to change in case I'm missing something, but please respond or correct.

<dl>
<dd>The Etymology section was recently, and significantly expanded by <a href="../../../a/l/-/User%7EAl-Andalus_6db0.html" title="User:Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a>. In the revised section, it is claimed that <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Quir%C3%B3s_3ac0.html" title="Pedro Fernández de Quirós">Pedro Fernández de Quirós</a> first discovered and named Australia. However, this claim is contradicted in the explorers own article. That article states that Quirós discovered the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hebrides_a395.html" title="New Hebrides">New Hebrides</a> (<a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanuatu.html" title="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a>), not Australia, but named an island he thought might be <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terra_Australis_2d21.html" title="Terra Australis">Terra Australis</a> "La Austrialia del Espiritu Santo" (not La Australia as was written). The article also states that the claim that Quirós named and discovered Australia is essentially <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Catholic</a> propaganda, pushed by some Australian Catholics in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have asked <a href="../../../a/l/-/User%7EAl-Andalus_6db0.html" title="User:Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> to provide his sources so that his changes may be substantiated. Even so, I do not expect that they are factual. It may well be that Flinders was influenced by Quirós's "La Austrialia", but so far, all sources state he named Australia - and let's not forget the influence of "Terra Australis" itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The following is the etymology before Al-Andalus changes:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The name <b>Australia</b> derives from <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a></i> australis <i>meaning</i> southern<i>, and dates back to <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_century.html" title="2nd century">2nd century</a> legends of an "unknown southern land" (that is</i> terra australis incognita<i>). The explorer <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Flinders_d24d.html" title="Matthew Flinders">Matthew Flinders</a> named the land</i> <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terra_Australis_2d21.html" title="Terra Australis">Terra Australis</a><i>, which was later abbreviated to the current form. Previously, when the Dutch explored the area they named it</i> Nova Hollandicus <i>or <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Holland_95b1.html" title="New Holland">New Holland</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Flinders later renamed the land Australia in a chart compiled in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1804.html" title="1804">1804</a> whilst he was held prisoner by the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauritius.html" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>. When he returned to England and published his works in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1814.html" title="1814">1814</a> he was forced to change the name to</i> Terra Australis <i>by the British Admiralty. <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lachlan_Macquarie_2e2b.html" title="Lachlan Macquarie">Governor Macquarie</a> of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> became aware of Flinders' preference for the name Australia and used it in his dispatches to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. In <a href="../../../1/8/2/1824.html" title="1824">1824</a> the British Admiralty finally accepted that the continent should be known officially as <b>Australia</b>.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps some of Al-Andalus's changes might be incorporated within the orginal etymology. I will not seek to change the section before Al-Andulus himself or others respond.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 07:26, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Flinders gave the name to Australia, whether or not he was influenced by Quirós is hard to say and probably doesn't need to be debated in this artilce, I think the text should be switched back.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 08:03, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>The Port Arthur image is more visually appealing, but conveys much less information of a useful sort than the population graph it seems to have replaced. I'd rather see the graph go back in instead.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, if the PA image stays, is the caption correct? <i>Most</i> settlers were convicts? I don't know the actual numbers, but I suspect that even in the early years convicts were less than half of the total. Consider guards, administrators, early free settlers, traders, whalemen and sealers ... add them all up and the "most" might not be true. It shouldn't be too hard to look this one up and check.</dd>
<dd>Thirdly, shouldn't we have some representative landscape here on the main Australia page? That's what Australia is all about, after all. The Ularu image doesn't really count, as it just shows the Rock, and doesn't convey any real sense of the Australian landscape. I sugggest a scene from outback NSW, or something of that sort.

It is <b>not</b> convention that the Governor-General only acts on Ministerial advice, for example. It is the nature of the reserve powers that they are exercised without advice. The case of Prime Minister George Reid in the second Parliament is before us - nobody, least of all Reid, disputed the power of the Governor-General to refuse Reid's advice to call an election or to appoint a new Prime Minister (Deakin), both actions taken against or without advice.</p>
<p>Bryan Palmer's Australian Politics <a href="http://www.ozpolitics.info/rules/rp.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ozpolitics.info/rules/rp.htm" rel="nofollow">site</a> provides another view of the reserve powers and lists examples of their use - eight times in all since Federation. Constitutional conventions cover more than just the limited circumstance of the Governor-General acting on advice. For example, it is a convention that Australia has a Prime Minister, even though that office is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution. Australia has been without a Prime Minister for a short time on a number of occasions following the death of an incumbent, and this could be construed as a breach of the conventions. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Pete</a> 21:03, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

Archaeology, perhaps, if anybody ever finds the ship. Worth a mention somewhere, because it's eminently plausible (and there's that tantalising mystery of the "Mahogany Ship"), but not in this article. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Pete</a> 05:12, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Aboriginal population</span></h2>
<p>The article shows an increase of about 300% in 24 years. Obviously this can't have come from immigration, and I haven't done the maths, but I think that the birthrate needed to sustain this sort of increase is pretty much beyond any human population. The large and anomalous increase is mostly because Aboriginal Australians now feel far more comfortable about declaring their Aboriginality on census forms - a very positive sign IMHO, which says a lot about changing community perceptions. Reductions in infant mortality and increases in longevity also account for a portion of the increase. I think that the article should mention this because otherwise someone's going to say "hey, they must breed like rabbits!" and that's not the case. I've added a hypenated word to help explain this, but it's really a subject that deserves more detail, which may be inappropriate in this "overview" article. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Pete</a> 07:25, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Sure, but trade routes and fish traps don't make for agriculture. The only indigenous Australians to be farmers were the TSI folk, who had plots of land marked out by stones and passed down through family lines, which was the incontrovertible evidence of ownership needed for Mabo. Perhas we can say "Most indigenous Australians were hunter-gatherers..." Actually, I'd really like some specific mention of the way that TSI folk cultivated their land and grew crops, because it's important to understanding Mabo, and why it was such an injustice to say that these people didn't own the land they'd farmed for centuries. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Pete</a> 07:52, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we are talking about more than a simple fish trap here. We are talking extensive construction - i.e., fish farming. Certainly that was the case in South-west Victoria, and I believe that there was similar activity up along the Murray. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 08:01, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting article, and thanks for the link. However it's still fish traps rather than fish farming. Eels are oceanic creatures for most of their existence. You can't farm eels, you can only catch them as they migrate up or down the rivers. Digging out channels between ponds would make it easier to catch them as they moved along the channels.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The existence of circular foundations for huts is actually more interesting. You don't build substantial housing unless you plan to stay there for more than a few nights. I think that saying there was enough of an industry in catching and smoking eels to sustain a village of hundreds of houses, making for a permanent community of up to a thousand individuals, is a bit of a stretch, however. Presumably they also caught other wildlife from the wetlands and perhaps traded with more distant tribes. A thousand people eat a lot of tucker.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But even if you have an aquaculture industry, exporting smoked eels across Australia, which sounds reasonably plausible, just what percentage of the Aboriginal population would have been engaged in such pursuits? And if it was a viable lifestyle, why didn't it persist until historic times?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I think the wording of "Most indigenous Australians were hunter-gatherers..." works better than the "primarily hunter-gatherers" phrase because the former includes TSI people as well as the eel-smokers and doesn't give the impression that all Aboriginal Australians were sometimes farmers, which is definitely not the case.</dd>

<p>I've added a sentence distinguishing the TSI from the mainland native people, since they are completely distinct. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 09:08, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes. I've had a bit of a tweak, but maybe it can be improved still more. It's perhaps a bit of a quibble to note that the TSI folk also lived on the mainland - they were gradually expanding southwards at the time of European settlement. However, that's probably best left to a specific article - this one is getting a bit longish and I'm thinking it doesn't need more material so much as arranging what we have better, eliminating redundancies if any can be identified. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Pete</a> 09:25, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Eels are not usually oceanic, Pete. The eel species in question is the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short-finned_Eel_0bae.html" title="Short-finned Eel">Short-finned Eel</a>. Like most others, it spends by far the greater part of its lifecycle in a home range area, typically a lake or a stretch of river. It makes just two migrations: in the first it travels from its oceanic hatching ground far off in the tropical South Pacific and winds up in a river close to the one where its parents lived. (How? Nobody knows.) At this time it's about the size of a bootlace only shorter, and not practical as a food fish (although some people in Europe eat elvers - it's a shocking waste of natural resources, but there you go).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The second migration occurs only after 15-odd years of growth in a lake or river: the mature eel travels downstream to spawn. Eels of a size worth eating, in other words, migrate once and once only: a one-way trip to the sea, then north to the Solomon Islands where they spawn and die. Catching <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salmon.html" title="Salmon">salmon</a> on the way upsteam to spawn would make sense, but salmon work the opposite way around to eels; salmon are oceanic fish that just happen to breed in rivers, where eels are freshwater fish that just happen to breed at sea.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Back to the topic now: my view is subject to persuasion, but it seems obvious to me that we are <i>never</i> going to come up with a formulation simple enough to use in this context, and yet accurate enough to stand criticsm. It might be better to resolve this point on a page where there is room to deal with it properly. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Aborigine_5939.html" title="Australian Aborigine">Australian Aborigine</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Australia_before_1901_75ec.html" title="History of Australia before 1901">History of Australia before 1901</a> both seem suitable. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 09:42, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A different way of answering the question... The King of Great Britain and Ireland [sic] was the King of Australia at the time of its creation (the constitution refers to a Queen, Queen Victoria, but she died in between the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (UK) receiving the royal assent and coming into force). In the leadup to federation, there had been some debates about being a republic, but those who had a say were generally in favor of remaining a British colony. I don't really know why 'Commonwealth' was chosen over any other term. Although it was originally a calque of Republic, it hasn't always been used with the same meaning as Republic has nowadays. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was an elective monarchy. Australia is a federation; the Commonwealth of Nations is an organisation of states (I spose Australia's definition as a federation opened the doors for it to be used for an organisation of what were originally all monarchies). <i>Edit: in America 'Commonwealth' is used to mean, for whatever reason, something along the lines of colony/territory, but I understand that's a twentieth-century development and not part of the justification for Australia's name.</i> I don't know the justification for Australia's title, though. (Australia was of course still a dominion during its early history; now the correct term is a commonwealth Realm.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The States of Australia are so named because our federation was modelled on the United States; other similarities include the names of our federal parliament (the House of Representatives and the Senate) and that residual powers are granted to the States (whereas in Canada they go to the Federal government).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Canada, on the other hand, was formed in opposition to the US. There are also various (theoretical/legal) differences between the Australian States and the Canadian Provinces, such as their head of state (the Canadian Provinces' practical heads of state are the Lieutenant Governors, representatives of the Governor General, representative of the Queen, appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister; the Australian States' pracitcal heads of state are the Governors, representatives of the Queen, appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Premiers).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Finally, while the US States which were earlier British colonies as well as the Canadian Provinces were both styled 'province' before their federations (e.g. the Province of New York), the Australian States were called 'colony' (the Colony of Victoria). Evidently they needed to be renamed, and why choose the Canadian 'Province' when the American 'State' was the model?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It should also be noted that 'province' has had some currency in the Australasian colonies/Australian states + New Zealand. New Zealand had subdivisions called provinces, and Victoria's legislative council (upper house) electorates have been called provinces until the next redistribution.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hope that gives you some insight into why they're called 'states' and not 'provinces'.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The opening two paragraphs</span></h2>
<p>Although many people regard 'Commonwealth of Australia' as an obsolescent term—an undesirable hangover from colonial days—it looks as though we'll have to put up with it as is, emblazoned TWICE across the top of the article, and several times in the rest of the text. One or more contributors clearly feel strongly about highlighting this term. While it IS embedded in the constitution, if we restricted ourselves to constitutional terminology, we'd have to give up words such as 'cabinet' and 'prime minister'. In addition, 'Commonwealth Realm' is, frankly, an arcane term that won't mean much to most readers; I don't understand why some contributors are doggedly insistent on retaining it. These terms create the wrong impression right at the start, in my view.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I'm concerned that the second paragraph of a substantial article on Australia mentions Boigu Island and crossing of the waterway between PNG and Australia; these matters would be better located much further down in the text, to leave the opening as 'broad brush-strokes'. Why not tack the first sentence—'Australia's neighbouring countries include Indonesia, East Timor, and Papua New Guinea to the north, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east, and New Zealand to the south-east'—onto the end of the opening para, and relocate the rest?</p>

<dd>"Commonwealth of Australia" is not an obsolescent term - it is the name of the legal entity of the government.

<dd><a href="../../../b/o/i/Boigu_Island_8403.html" title="Boigu Island">Boigu Island</a> does seem relevant in the sentence about our closest neighbours, which is appropriate at the top.

<p>I think the explanation of the economy is weak, or at least incomplete. I've added something about the tax system, but more is required to characterise the Australian economy, particularly in relation to other OECD countries.</p>

<p>I wonder whether we could remove the bit about AusLan (sign language), which is well and truly being superseded by other methods, including the Cochlear implant. Many hearing-impaired people claim that sign languages are retained only as a result of sentimentality.</p>

<p>'Commonwealth of Australia' currently appears TWICE at the top. Surely once is enough. The Howard government has quietly dropped the C word over the last six months, and now uses 'the Australian government'. Many readers will be confused by the use of 'Commonwealth' in two quite different senses at the top (this, plus the 'realm' bit). Very confusing; why not simplify it? Why the redundancy?</p>
<p>Auslan is not worth mentioning, in my view, particularly since the article is close to its limit in size. If Auslan is an official language, that's ... well ... quaint.

<dd>How is it an issue that Commonwealth of Australia is used twice, when both references are correct. It is the official name and the states federated to form the Commonwealth, not Australia. Furthermore, the Howard Government did not disown the word "Commonwealth". They simply established a branding format. Previously, government departments were between US-style individual logos and, well, no style. It was decided that a simple "logo" should be applied universally across departments and (most) departmental logos phased out (like the ATO logo). The "logo", as can be seen on most government websites, consists of the Coat of Arms, the name of the department, and "Australian Government" immediately beneath it. Government departments have rarely ever been titled "Commonwealth Department of" (etc), so this is hardly a huge leap. The only government that ever tried to get rid of the official styling and usage of "Commonwealth" was the Whitlam Government, and most of the changes made by said government were reversed by the subsequent Fraser Government.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 10:09, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The section has been called both government and politics. And at one point there was both a government and politics section.

<p>In addition, Kerr's use of his reserve powers 'to end the constitutional crisis' might not be neutral enough: some people would assert that rather than "ending" the constitutional crisis of 1975, his actions <i>created</i> one out of what had been merely a political crisis that was, in any case, about to be resolved in the Senate.

<p>I don't mind removing the bit about cuisine, but in terms of their unique contribution to Australian culture, the ABC and SBS are worthy of mentioning by name. Apart from the BBC, the ABC is the only public broadcaster of its type, plays an important role in the life and politics of the nation, and has been a significant force in local TV production. The commercial networks, by contrast, do not seem to me to be uniquely Australian in their contribution, and currently occupy considerably more space in the paragraph (including the citing of particular programs).</p>
<p>I wonder whether we can go back to (shorter) references to these two institutions?</p>
<p>And can the reference to Harvey Krumpet be removed? Sure, it's important and received an award, but why single it out over the multitude of good stuff that Australia has produced?</p>
<p>I'm also not sure why 'one' of the two national newspapers is mentioned by name. Surely this link can be found in one of the daughter articles on Australia.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cuisine</span></h2>
<p>Can we please remove the paragraph on cuisine, which seems all too superificial: 'oh, we have Indian cuisine here, and we even cook it in our own kitchens'; bit parochial, given that there's been an internationalisation of cuisine in many industrial countries over the last few decades. Tim Tams and Vegemite—well, if we have to cite these brands to bolster our sense of national identity, something's wrong, but I guess they could be tacked on somewhere else if someone insists. I've not acted on this, pending other people's opinions.</p>

<dd>The paragraph is a bit lacking, although there is doubtless something to be said about Australian cusine. Perhaps someone amongst us knows a thing or two about cuisine and could expand/rewrite it? From what little I know on the subject, I understand that Australia has pioneered in blended/modern cuisine, known here as "fusion cuisine". Some discussion on unique foodstuffs wouldn't go astray either, though you're right, if we're only invoking Vegemite we have things to worry about. How about native foods and/or produce and their place domestically and internationally. For instance, Australia is one of the largest wine producers in the world (fifth, I think), so why not mention that? What about native Macadamia nuts, one of the most expensive in the world? And so on. However, this is a summary article, so any such talk would need to be brief. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 15:57, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Cyberjunkie's points. But let's get rid of it unless someone comes up with something good to replace Tim Tams and talk of Indian food. I'm also mindful of the transitional opinion during the 70s, at the start of mulitculturalism, that stressed how Australia was benefiting from non-anglophone immigration through the proliferation of foreign restaurants. It ended up being just a little racist, and was much sent-up by Edna Everage, among others. I really don't think Australia can boast of much innovation in cuisine, at least not major, home-grown innovation. The wine industry is large and successful, but so are many other fine-product industries in this coutry, and fine wine is produced by many other countries. It's a 'so what' thing.</p>
<p>There are more important matters in other areas that cuisine is pushing out, because of the 40mb limit. For example, virtually nothing is said about Australian English, despite ample secondary (and primary) sources. Any claim the uniquely Australian should probably START there, perhaps as a brief paragraph under 'Culture', incorporating the current stuff about literature. It's a rich and interesting variety of English.</p>

<dd>Actually, just on the article size, we could cut it down by moving the Infobox to a separate template. Doing so would remove the imposing syntax at the begining of the article (in edit mode), which I've read off-puts newbies. The only drawback is that many don't know how to access templates to edit.

<p>I never liked the cuisine section (I wrote it so I'm allowed to say that), like a transport section, there really anything that makes Australian food exceptional. On moving the infobox onto a template, I'm not sure if there is an offical poilcy on sticking single use templates in the templates namespace, but if we did do that - it is possible to include an edit link in the template like this &lt;div style="float:right;"&gt; ''[URL to edit template space edit]''&lt;/div&gt;. It'll probably free up 1-2kb. See it in action here {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiProjectCSBTasks_dd0c.html" title="Template:WikiProjectCSBTasks">WikiProjectCSBTasks</a>}}</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re-order sections?</span></h2>
<p>Does anyone object to the relocation of 'Foreign relations and military' from before to after 'States and territories'? Currently the reader has to veer from federal political institutions to foreign relations then back to state and territory political institutions. Foreign relations was probably placed after the federal stuff because they are a federal matter, but that's probably not a good enough reason for juxtaposing these two sections. Federal responsibility for foreign relations is not mentioned anywhere, and there's mention of other federal responbilities much further down in the article. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 15:47, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Word-initial upper or lower case for positions?</span></h2>
<p>Currently, the article is inconsistent in this respect. Under 'States and territories', the words 'governor-general', 'governor', 'administrator', 'premiers', and 'chief ministers' all start with a lower-case letter; under 'Politics', all positions have been changed back to word-initial upper case letters.</p>
<p>In the major anglophone countries—and possibly more widely still—there is a significant and increasing tendency to use lower-case initials where possible when referring to job positions, even very senior ones, such as 'senator' and 'prime minister' (but apparently excepting 'the Queen'). I fought this for a while, but have given in: most style guides recommend maximising the use of lower case in this respect; and it was pointed out to me by a subeditor at the Sydney Morning Herald that consistent application of upper case leads to awkward usage, such as 'He's a Cleaner/Garbage Collector for Geelong City Council'. Similarly, lower case would apply to 'the Tasmanian parliament', and possibly even to 'the senate', although I feel the need to research those two.</p>
<p>I now think that maximising lower case is easier on the eyes and in the spirit of plain English; thus, I'd opt to apply it to the article. However, whatever people think, there should be consistent usage.</p>
<p>Sorry to badger about small aspects of usage, but perhaps it's a healthy sign that most of the larger issues have been resolved. What do other people think?</p>

<dd>They were originally consistent until you changed began changing them to lower-case. Changing an article’s existing style is generally frowned upon (a point which I have made to you on another <a href="../../../u/2E/s/Talk%7EU.S.-Australia_FTA_c958.html" title="Talk:U.S.-Australia FTA">talk page</a>). <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>, as derived from <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a>, tends towards capitalisation.

<dd>The trend of using lower-case initials is really only established in the newspaper medium (especially in those owned by <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_Corp_ffd2.html" title="News Corp">News Corp</a>).

<p>Cyberjunkie: (1) Can you provide references to support your claim that AusEng, BrEng, academia, and 'other [non-press] media' tend towards capitalisation? (2) Can you apprise us of the logical connection between minimising the use of upper-case letters in these contexts, and 'dumbing down'. (3) Will you consider avoiding the appearance of being bossy on this page, which I've noticed on three occasions—e.g., 'a point which I have made to you on another talk page' might be viewed as aggressive and unnecessarily personal.</p>

<dd>I don’t think I’m being “bossy”. While my response was mostly mere posturing, it was also my opinion. I fail to see how mentioning a related comment is “aggressive and unnecessarily personal”.

Still, I have only ever offered suggestions.</dd>

<dd>I would think it common knowledge that AusE and BE (as opposed to AmE) tend towards capitalisation; indeed, Wikipedia states so in its <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a>. And I can also refer you to many a text that capitalise the words in question. But why question this? You didn’t think it necessary to source your claim that “in the major anglophone countries—and possibly more widely still—there is a significant and increasing tendency to use lower-case initials”. Also, I think you’ve read my reference to the “dumbing down” phenomenon out of context. I was simply making an observation that the <i>overall</i> tendency to “dumb down” is one that seeks to make language plainer.</dd>

The Queen is a queen. The Prime Minister is a prime minister.” insofar as that would mean senators and members would be de-capitalised and the Parliament, the Prime Minister and the G-G (when specifically referred to) would be capitalised. I am still inclined to capitalise the States, but will let others’ decide. Commonwealth and the Senate should be capitalised in all instances (if there they were in doubt).--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 09:02, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Using the term 'Australia' to refer to the continent, as opposed to the country, raises the question of which meaning is intended at the start of the second sentence.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Boigu Island, again</span></h2>
<p>In my view, there are two problems in referring to Boigu Island at the top. The first is that it’s a tiny, unfamiliar dot of land that draws the reader away from forming an overall impression of Australia’s location and size. To refer to it right that the top of an article on Australia seems out of line with the (low) level of detail that is required here.</p>
<p>The second, more serious problem is that the existing text clearly implies that Boigu Island is the sole or main reason for ‘a complicated border arrangement allowing access …’. This is not the case; the indigenous peoples of New Guinea, the Torres Strait Islands, and the Australian continent have a long history of crossing this waterway, with or without the existence of Boigu Island; the numerous islands in the Torres Strait are the contributing factor, not just one island.</p>
<p>Here is the end of the existing second paragraph of the article:</p>
<p>‘The shortest border distance is between the mainlands of New Guinea and Australia, at about 150 kilometres; however, the northernmost inhabited island, Boigu Island, is only about five kilometres from Papua New Guinea. This has led to a complicated border arrangement allowing access for traditional uses of the waterway across the border by Papua New Guinean people and Torres Strait Islanders.’</p>
<p>I propose something simpler and shorter:</p>
<p>‘The shortest border distance is about 150 kilometres, across the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torres_Strait_7c26.html" title="Torres Strait">Torres Strait</a> between the mainlands of New Guinea and Australia. This waterway, with its numerous inhabited islands, has been and continues to be used as a traditional crossing by the indigenous peoples of the area.'</p>
<p>Boigu Island might be best referred to in one of the daughter articles.</p>

<dd>I agree that there is something wrong with this paragraph. As I understand it, the point is to talk about neighbouring countries and borders. To my mind, the "shortest border distance" is an issue of political entities, not landmasses. The distance from Boigu Island to New Guinea should definitely be mentioned, even if Boigu isn't named. Is the "access for traditional uses" only about crossing, or is there more to it than that? It doesn't need to be referred to here, but does say soemthing about the nature of the border, so it is appropriate enough. What do you think of:</dd>

<dd>I support Tony's version, since it is proper to talk about indigenous use of the Torres Straight waterway without characterising it as some sort of administrative/customs headache. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 21:39, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've Been Bold and reformulated the introduction.

<dd>I thought it was useful in the old opening to describe that most of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torres_Strait_Islands_49a4.html" title="Torres Strait Islands">Torres Strait Islands</a> are in Australia, so the Country of Australia extends almost to the island of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Guinea_eecc.html" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a>, and therefore I was OK with the idea that <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boigu_Island_8403.html" title="Boigu Island">Boigu Island</a> was mentioned by name. The current phrase <i>"The shortest border distance is about 150 kilometres"</i> is inaccurate, as the previous version said the shortest border distance is only 5 km. I think the "complicated border arrangements" belong somewhere else. There are traditional use border arrangements with Indonesia as well, so either both or neither should be in the top of this article (I'd lean towards neither). How about something like <i>"The shortest distance between the mainlands of Australia and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Guinea_eecc.html" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a> is about 150 km. Most of the islands in the intervening <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torres_Strait_7c26.html" title="Torres Strait">Torres Strait</a> are part of Australia, extending to <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boigu_Island_8403.html" title="Boigu Island">Boigu Island</a> being only 5 km from New Guinea."</i>? I'd accept leaving out the part after the last comma if people think it's to fine-grained.</dd>

<p>It's much better now, but the bit about border crossings, however interesting, doesn't belong at the opening. Indigenous people are already referred to at the top. Why not move that clause into 'Geography and climate' (or a daughter article, and tack the new sentence on population and coastal cities onto the end of the previous paragraph instead; it's big-picture stuff, and is therefore appropriate to the opening. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 02:46, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still don't like "mainland border distance". The mainland coastline doesn't define a border, it's as simple as that. ScottDavis' version is good, although it doesn't mention that NG is the closest "foreign mainland" to the Australian mainland. I don't think the border arrangement bit needs to be there, but it is quite a different thing to illegal crossings. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> 15:21, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What about removing the bit about 'convict transportation' at the top; it's a bolt out of the blue to refer to this unusual phenomenon without first introducing it. The issue belongs in 'History', where it should be covered in a little more detail.</p>

<p>This article is linked to in the lists of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continents.html" title="Continents">continents</a> but it doesn't appear to be about the continent which anyway I always thought has a long name... does the continent article need fixing or this one? --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a><a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">|talk</a> 21:07, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
