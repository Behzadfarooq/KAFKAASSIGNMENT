<p>Why cant you write this in plain english? phrases like</p>
<p>'Further finds at Afar, including the many hominid bones in "site 333", produced more bones of concurrent date, and led to Johanson and White's eventual argument that the Koobi Fora hominids were concurrent with the Afar hominids.'</p>
<p>is pompous and difficult to understand. Better to write</p>
<p>' Johanson and White found further bones dated around the same time as the previous finds at 'Site 333', and they now believe that the hominids at Koobi Fari were alive the same time as the Afar hominids'</p>
<p>If your going to write science, you need to write it in a way that the average person can understand. peppering the text with long latinised words and obscure grammar just drives people away from reading the rest and is elitist.

<p>Thats as may be, but you still need to make it readable. The sort of person that looks this sort of articlein an encyclopedia may not have a scientific background. No point in an encyclopedia if no one reads it cos its unitelligble to anyone with an IQ less than 150. Do we want to make wikpedia used by all or just by a few over educated elitist snobs&#160;? Better that its read by all , surely!!! In which case, write plain english!!!</p>

<p>I was wondering whether the subtitle under the picture of the original remainings of Lucy is correct. How come that they are in Mexico, whereas the text states that they are preserved in Addis Abeba. The latter would be more comprehensible, since it was found in Ethopia.

<p>Acording to the resources listed, nearly all of them come from people who very biased towards evolution. Evolution hasn't been proven, and intelligent design hasn't been disproven. I think it would be unfair to simply state all of this information as fact when it hasn't been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. Many scientists still hold that this "missing link" is nothing more than an extinct form of primate, not a common ancestor for mankind. Wouldn't it do more justice to science to at least make a small note or something that the information in this page isn't accepted by all of the scientific community and give a brief description from a intelligent design perspective, or at least make a note that further testing is needed before it can be said with absolute certainty to be true?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's standard practice for encyclopedia's to assume evolution is true. I believe this is done because articles are usually written by "experts" in that particular field. And the experts (biologists) believe that the evidence for evolution is more than adequate to merit general (if not universal and unequivocal) acceptance. Go figure. <a href="../../../m/c/h/User%7EMchavez_4ea6.html" title="User:Mchavez">Miguel Chavez</a> 20:19, 27 May 2006 (UTC))

<dd>The vast majority of scientists studying <i>A. afarensis</i> see the species as an ancestor of <i>Homo spp</i>. If you can provide legitimate, scholarly, peer-reviewed sources that show that some researchers disagree with this view, then perhaps those sources should be added, either to this article or to the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transitional_fossil.html" title="Transitional fossil">transitional fossil</a> article. I would argue, however, that the study of <i>A. afarensis</i> is something that can only be conducted using the scientific method, and since intelligent design inherently precludes the use of the scientific method, to discuss intelligent design on this page would be the equivalent of discussing scientific proof for the existence of <a href="../../../d/a/f/Daffy_Duck_146b.html" title="Daffy Duck">Daffy Duck</a> in that entry. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuinnHK_9b7f.html" title="User:QuinnHK">QuinnHK</a> 20:18, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">Science</a> vs. the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_Method_3bda.html" title="Scientific Method">Scientific Method</a>. Intelligent Design theory does <i>not</i> preclude the use of science. To say that it does would be equivalent to implying that scientists cannot through any means make any determination that anything was designed (light bulb, computer monitor, chair, etc.). Science is simply used to gain information. The interpretation of the data gained is another matter. As for the '<a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>,' History in general does preclude the use of the scientific method, since the first step in the scientific method is the collection of data through observation. You cannot observe the past. This article is technically not neutral in that it heavily promotes one interpretation of the data, namely Darwinian evolutionary theory (example - "lived between 3.9 to 3 million years ago" -- that is an interpretation of the data based on the presupposition that the theory of Darwinian evolution is correct.) I'm not going to dwell on that issue; however, I agree that it would be nice to read some of the findings that tend to indicate that Australopithecus is most likely an extinct ape species. There are other scientists (evolutionary and otherwise) that hold that interpretation from various scientific findings. It would be nice to have them cited here as well. (I'll personally see what I can find on that issue, though my personal library is limited.) User:Hexc0de 01:52, 23 February 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Small technical point. Didn't Lucy catch <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Johanson_0cfd.html" title="Donald Johanson">Johanson's</a></i> eye. His book <i>Lucy</i> portrays it that way, "I noticed something lying on the ground..." (p. 16) and I doubt they saw it at the same time. Also, his book says they discovered the fossil remains on Nov. 30th, not the 24th (p. 13). Am I missing something? Can anyone confirm or refute my understanding of the facts. This would be much appreciated. I am a stickler for the details, and it bothers me still when I hear that it was <i>Louis</i> that discovered <i>Zinjanthropus.</i> <a href="../../../m/c/h/User%7EMchavez_4ea6.html" title="User:Mchavez">Miguel Chavez</a> 20:13, 27 March 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>I have removed the reference to Lucy's discovery in the opening paragraph. The emphasis in the opening paragraph should be on the species that the article is about, not on a single discovery. It seems to me that the placement of importance on Lucy's discovery in the opening paragraph has only been done because this article is part of 'WikiProject Ethiopia'. Let's not bias our articles towards certain countries.</p>
<p>I removed a short sentence that tells us that Australopithecus afarensis belongs to the genus Australopithecus, which I think will be obvious to the reader.</p>
<p>'There are differing views on how Lucy or her ancestors first became bipedal full-time.' It is not universally agreed upon that <i>A. afarensis</i> did move on two legs all the time. Indeed, the article goes on to say 'In fact these hominines may have occasionally walked upright but still walked on all fours'. I have ammended this.</p>
<p>My 2004 copy of The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution puts the known date of A. afarensis at &gt;4 to 2.5 millions of years ago. This is somewhat different to 3.9 to 3 million years ago in this article.

<p>As referred to just above, I have removed reference to the Aquatic Ape theory (recently re-inserted). Whether a valid theory or not, it is not relevent to a specific entry on one particular hominin taxon such as <i>A. afarensis</i>. If it is to be discussed/debated, this should happen either on the <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html" title="Aquatic ape hypothesis">Aquatic ape hypothesis</a> page, or on more general pages on human origins. AAH enthusiasts, I request that you adhere to the spirit of this request and note that I have also removed general discussion of the savanna hypothesis from this entry as well (see <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipedalism.html" title="Bipedalism">bipedalism</a> for further discussion). I feel that taxon specific pages should not discuss too deeply broader evolutionary theories, but should stay focussed on that taxon alone.</p>
<p>While keeping it impartial to the differing academic views on <i>A. afarensis</i> locomotion, I have tightened up the English in the bipedalism section, and added some information on shoulder joint orientation, and pelvic and lower limb morphology. I've edited and retitled the "brain size" section to reflect a short but more general section on craniodental morphology as well as brain size. I also changed the section on Social Behaviour, making it more reflective of the consensus view of this issue.<a href="../../../u/c/g/User%7EUcgaweh_e3d9.html" title="User:Ucgaweh">Ucgaweh</a> 04:23, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added a bit to the bipedalism section based on criticisms of the part-time arboreal hypothesis that I think ultimately go back to Owen Lovejoy. Unfortunately I have no citation beyond "I learned it my Paleontology class from a Lovejoy fan".</p>

<p>you authors of wikipedia are <i>very</i> bias! the earth has not been around for these millions of years, and you are <b>incredibly</b> derrogatory towards creationism. 64.6.121.48 21:04, 6 February 2007 (UTC)Courtney M.</p>

<dd>Nope. No assumptions. Just good examination of the facts. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 23:13, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I see nothing derogatory in the article; in fact the article doesn't mention creationism once. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuinnHK_9b7f.html" title="User:QuinnHK">QuinnHK</a> 20:07, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm a creationist, and I also see no derision in this article. it does, however, promote one particular interpretation of the data, namely the Darwinian theory of evolution. Though, I can't agree with UtherSRG that there are no assumptions made. When dealing with the unobservable past, one has to make assumptions. Many assumptions are made here, as well as in many articles that deal with the remote past -- assumptions based on the presupposition that Darwinian evolution is true. A creationist working with the same data, can easily interpret the data to fit into the model of supernatural creation. The difference isn't the data. The difference stems from the interpretation of the data -- an interpretation which is influenced by your individually held world view. User:Hexc0de Friday, 2007-02-23 T 01:52 UTC.</dd>
