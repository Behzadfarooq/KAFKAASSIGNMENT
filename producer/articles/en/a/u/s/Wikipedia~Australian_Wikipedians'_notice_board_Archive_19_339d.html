<dd>Wow. I think there's something wrong when the caption is taking more space than the image!&#160;:) Commons is a great option for this type of thing. These things need to happen: 1) The images have to be uploaded to Commons at <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload" class="extiw" title="commons:Special:Upload">commons:Special:Upload</a>. This makes them automatically available to all Wikimedia projects, whereas at the moment they are only available to en.wp. Whoever does the uploading will need an account at Commons, as we still await the implementation of a universal login. 2) As part of this, the author needs to choose a license (eg: {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-self_86e2.html" title="Template:PD-self">PD-self</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../s/e/l/Template%7ESelf2_1f21.html" title="Template:Self2">self2</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECC-BY-SA-2.5_0981.html" title="Template:CC-BY-SA-2.5">CC-BY-SA-2.5</a>}}). See <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing" class="extiw" title="commons:Commons:Licensing">commons:Commons:Licensing</a>. 3) The images should be placed in an article (or 'gallery page') on Commons, probably <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Palm_Island%2C_Queensland" class="extiw" title="commons:Palm_Island,_Queensland">commons:Palm Island, Queensland</a>. Take advantage of the captions to give context to the images. 4) On the article here, under "see also", put {{<a href="../../../c/o/m/Template%7ECommons_44b0.html" title="Template:Commons">commons</a>|Palm Island, Queensland}} and it will automatically generate a pretty box linking to the gallery page on Commons.</dd>

<p>In response to concerns about my conduct. PSYCH was abusive and offensive to me from the beginning (last year) which is why I instituted the arbitration. The link to the arbitration could have been worded better. However, I cannot be held responsible for some rogue's mass vandalism and perhaps encouragement of mass vandalsim. Also, PSYCH made every possible effort to debate every point everywhere I made a comment and coming to a resolution was impossible. Aditionally I reserve my right to link any Wikipedia page on my user page, as should be all Wikipedia users' right. Mind you, Longhair, check out PSYCH's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/PSYCH" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/PSYCH" rel="nofollow">contributions in the last month</a> and tell me if you see any edit that was not related to me.

<p>I feel that Ambi's interactions with Lefty on Campus (a sockpuppet of PSYCH) gave the opinion that it was merely a dispute between pro-gay-rights and anti-gay-rights users, rather than a dispute between good-faith wikipedians and others.</p>
<p>For example, in <a href="../../../g/a/y/Talk%7EGay_rights_in_Australia_af79.html" title="Talk:Gay rights in Australia">Talk:Gay rights in Australia</a>, Ambi's comments to me where she says "What is your problem with this issue?" is soon afterwards echoed by sockpuppet LOC saying to me "so with all due respect, what is your problem??" None of the incivility by LOC (which included anti-religious bigotry) was criticised by Ambi.</p>
<p>Another example of PSYCH thinking that it merely an opinion dispute is that he was sending friendly messages to Ambi (at <a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbi_9ae3.html" title="User talk:Ambi">User talk:Ambi</a>) even when he was putting vulgar images elsewhere.</p>

<dd>Look, I don't condone the harrassment PSYCH has given Xtra. That is utterly not on, and I'm glad that Snottygobble went to all the trouble of expunging any libel from the site. This is not to say, however, that he's always been wrong. The instance Andjam cites was a prime example - where Andjam was trying to keep an uncomfortable fact out of the article at all cost, and was changing tact each time his new excuse was shown to be a nonsense. And what evidence do you have that Lefty on campus is a sockpuppet of PSYCH? In my limited dealings with the former, he's seemed a bit opinionated, but far from the worst. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 02:00, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But you have been silent about the harassment LOC has given Xtra. The bit where I was "keeping an uncomfortable fact out ... at all cost" was when it was LOC, not PSYCH, by the way. It seems even you can't tell them apart. Talking of facts, your track record with facts wasn't that good. You <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gay_rights_in_Australia&amp;diff=44453421&amp;oldid=44449945" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gay_rights_in_Australia&amp;diff=44453421&amp;oldid=44449945" rel="nofollow">reverted in</a> a false claim that IV drug users are able to give blood (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gay_rights_in_Australia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44444936" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gay_rights_in_Australia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44444936" rel="nofollow">twice</a>, with the first instance involving the accidental restoration of peacock terms). As well as being factually inaccurate, it was <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> - the only purpose of mentioning the status of IV drug users was to try to discredit red cross policy - LOC went on to say on the talk page that red cross policy was nonsensical. Other half-truths by LOC was his failure to mention that some sexual practices by heterosexuals can earn a ban, and failing to mention that lesbians can give blood. (I'm of the opinion that a couple of veteran editors can be a bit too sure of themselves, not just you.)</dd>

<dd>LOC isn't just opiniated. He's altered other people's comments, for example. As to why I think LOC is a sockpuppet: the two share a similar persona, similar writing styles, similar target of attacks (Xtra in particular), and LOC was largely abandoned once PSYCH was out of parole, except now, where the two are supporting each other. I guess I'm not the sockpuppet hunter, though. Can I ask if your user and talk page been two of the few that haven't been vandalised by PSYCH? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 10:35, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh okay, I should have realised the template was more robust. No worries then. All the same, some images already there may have extra information than just a dot (such as the nearest capital city or whatever). Also, if we use these two images to superimpose, can we get rid of the faint blue latitude and longitude lines.

<dd>My <i>personal</i> opinion on notability for sportspeople is roughly the precedent set by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Formula_One_4955.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Formula One">WikiProject Formula One</a> that everyone who has ever started one F1 race gets an article. I extend that to mean everyone who has competed in an international or national top-level race/game/match passes my notability test. "Top-level" is of course also subjective, but includes first-class cricket matches, Olympic, Commonwealth and Friendly Games, <i>recognised</i> world championships in just about anything. For teams, the league they play in and the place they represent should both have comprehensive articles that would become too large by merging the team info before I'd say the team is worthy of an article in its own right. Teams in national leagues, or state leagues of major sports (in that place) are roughly the level I'd stop at. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 14:09, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the salient point is that the actual league should possess a "comprehensive" article before even considering articles on individual teams. It seems pointless to have a stub on the league and then a 10,000 word article on one of the teams. Referring back to soccer - one would have thought that State league clubs would have their own articles (which means any club that has ever made it to State league level). As for the rest, probably not, although keep in mind the general proposition of a league being able to sustain a largish article in its own right. With AFL, we are talking about all of the state leagues (VFA/VFL, SANFL, WAFL, QAFL, etc.). We can throw in the <a href="../../../t/a/c/TAC_Cup_0f13.html" title="TAC Cup">TAC Cup</a> (because so many players are recruited directly from these clubs). It starts to get murky with the VAFA and the large country leagues (e.g. Ovens and Murray), which brings us back to the article about the league itself. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 02:36, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Popularity of Aussie rules revisited</span></h2>
<p>This issue has drawn a lot of attention over the past 9 months or so. In this morning's <i>The Australian</i> newspaper, Patrick Smith, a regular columnist, writes:</p>

<dd>COMMENT</dd>
<dd>Patrick Smith</dd>
<dd>April 27, 2006</dd>
<dd>THE AFL is doing very nicely, thank you. It is not just the 91,234 crowd that turned up for Tuesday's Anzac Day match that is the undeniable indicator. The AFL commission has recently viewed a 67-page document that says the competition is in health so rude it is borderline boorish.</dd>
<dd>Look every which way, for it doesn't matter. The AFL is the dominant national sport. Here's a snap shot:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The league draws the largest weekly TV audience;</li>
<li>It generates more than double the income of any competing code;</li>
<li>It is the most affordable sport;</li>
<li>It has the highest total audience;</li>
<li>It has the richest broadcast deal;</li>
<li>It has the biggest following;</li>
<li>It leads sport in total TV audience;</li>
<li>It dominates participation (a player must be registered and played minimum six games) and talent nationally;</li>
<li>It leads sporting industry in brand recognition;</li>
<li>Print coverage nationally doubles exposure of other sports;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand that this is neither here or there, and that it is a minor issue in the scheme of things. At the same time, the aussie rules article does get a lot of ill-informed criticism (and out and out vandalism), and so it's not a bad little extract to keep up our sleeves for the next time this argument flares up again. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 22:51, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why post a message about the Australian game on the Australian Wikipedians' notice board? An article that probably receives as much attention as anything else mentioned on this page? An article about an Australian subject that is actually vandalised more often than not by Australians? Why did I post it here? In fact, I posted it in three spots, including the one you suggest. But when the great Australin game needs to be discussed, then for me, this is always my first port of call. It's a place where I hope I might stumble on like-minded people, who appreciate the important things in life - who understand the things dear to an Australian's heart! <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 01:46, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comment - a lot of those points are bollocks. ODI cricket has a much higher TV audience per game than Australian Rules, but because there aren't half a dozen matches on TV every week, AFL wins through sheer attrition. Likewise, the "dominates participation" is a bit funny - it's a lot easier to kick a football around a park with a couple of dozen guys, than it is to get all the cricket gear, find a good pitch, and play for five days. While I don't doubt that in terms of raw numbers AFL wins out there, it only wins out when the rules are shifted to favour football codes.</p>
<p>Plus, I think you'll find that Australian Rules definitely plays second fiddle to Rugby League in Queensland, the NT, and much of NSW. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 03:25, 27 April 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>Everyone knows Rugby is more popular in NSW and QLD (no NT) but that doesnt answer the fact that aussie rules is far more popular nationally. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 03:38, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You'll have no argument from me that it's probably the most popular sport in Victoria, as well as SA and WA. But it's definitely in second or even third place in NSW and QLD, who all love their rugby league. It's hard to argue that it's truly a "national sport" when it only gets a summary mention <b>after</b> the league on the news in two of the biggest cities in the country. AFL can only boast such impressive stats because it dominates in Victoria. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 03:25, 29 April 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>This is what I mean about Australians being the most vociferous in their criticism of their own football code. I'm quoting an article by a recognised sports columnist - and don't think that Patrick Smith is biased - he is an astute observer of sport, and he gives it to the AFL with both barrells on a regular basis. The reasons and explanations why this report is coming up with all these stats is not the story (e.g. the Victorians have nothing better to do, Sydney siders have a real life, the culture is different between the various cities, etc.) - the stats themselves are the story. All I am saying is that those that contribute to the various aussie rules pages are continuously being attacked for exaggerating how popular the sport is, we continually come up with the numbers, but we continually get attacked. The raw numbers tell the story: AFL memberships are as much all other football codes added together; AFL crowds are as much as all other football codes added together and their new television rights are as much as all other football codes added together (the television rights are embarassingly high, considering the song and dance soccer is making about its deal with pay television which includes all international games except for the World Cup - my view is that it is an absolute blessing that we won't have to watch any nil all draws on free to air). Participation rates are probably in favour of soccer - although Patrick Smith appears to be saying that that is not the case - interesting! <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 04:48, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Australians are always going to be the most likely top criticize AFL, it doesn't exist internationally to any first-class standard and is restricted to a few expats and their personal friends who kick a ball around in the park.

<dd>The data quoted by Smith comes from an internal AFL document that has not been made public but to which <i>The Australian</i> was given limited access. I agree that Smith's column is opinion/editorial rather than reporting of news. If and when <i>The Australian</i> properly reports on the document, then if would be preferable to cite the report rather than Smith's opinion piece. Until then, I think it is reasonable to cite Smith's column in support of these claims. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 05:15, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Do we have <a href="../../../a/d/e/WP%7EADELAIDE_d47d.html" title="WP:ADELAIDE">WP:ADELAIDE</a> or <a href="../../../a/d/e/WP%7EADEL_03d8.html" title="WP:ADEL">WP:ADEL</a>? OTOH, if you {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} it, I'm almost certain that it will die a quiet death. <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> <small>(<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pfctdayelise/Translations" class="extiw" title="commons:User:Pfctdayelise/Translations">translate?</a>)</small> 15:32, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sydney Meetup/workshop?</span></h2>
<p>I'm a member of <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineers_Without_Borders_%28Australia%29_1a95.html" title="Engineers Without Borders (Australia)">Engineers Without Borders (Australia)</a>, and am trying to get other people in the organisation interested in using and developing the articles on <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appropriate_technology.html" title="Appropriate technology">Appropriate technology</a> and the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_International_development_85b4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject International development">WikiProject International development</a>. There is already some interest, but a lack of knowledge and I think a lack of appreciation for how significant a resource Wikipedia can become. So I was thinking of organising a day where we could invite people to come to hear &amp; see how Wikipedia works. The focus would be on development-related issues, but anyone would be welcome. The specific focus would allow us to focus on specific issues and examples, and get a likeminded group of people together, throwing ideas around.</p>
<p>I'm sure that some people from the Greens and people on the Aidwatch and Oxfam mailing lists would also be interested.</p>
<p>It would be good to have a location with a number of computers available. A university computer room would be ideal. Any suggestions? It's hard to know how many would turn up - if we could get half a dozen I think it would be quite worthwhile. And the process of publicising the event would be an act of awareness-raising in itself.</p>
<p>I was thinking of late May or early June, on a weekend. --<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingkong2005_96e7.html" title="User:Singkong2005">Singkong2005</a> 15:06, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see the importance of the kind of editing drive you're talking about, Singkong. I'm not in Sydney much though. Have you written any papers or something about the role of informatics/IT&amp;T engineering in development? — <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Донама</a> 01:40, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No - it's not my area (I'm a water &amp; sanitation engineer). But there are articles about ICT in development - the ones in the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Category%7EAppropriate_technology_015e.html" title="Category:Appropriate technology">appropriate technology category</a> are <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wind-up_radio.html" title="Wind-up radio">Wind-up radio</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simputer.html" title="Simputer">Simputer</a>, <a href="../../../%24/1/0/%24100_laptop.html" title="$100 laptop">$100 laptop</a> &amp; <a href="../../../j/h/a/Jhai_Foundation_348b.html" title="Jhai Foundation">Jhai Foundation</a>. Is that the kind of thing you're talking about? --<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingkong2005_96e7.html" title="User:Singkong2005">Singkong2005</a> 02:29, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
