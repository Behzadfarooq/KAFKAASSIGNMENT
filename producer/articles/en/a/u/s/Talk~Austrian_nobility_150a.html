<p>Carrying on from conversation between <a href="../../../g/r/y/User_talk%7EGryffindor_fd67.html" title="User talk:Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> and <a href="../../../c/f/v/User_talk%7ECfvh_f319.html" title="User talk:Cfvh">myself</a>, I maintain that prepositions can be carefully analysed and translated into English in order to give readers an idea as to the meaning of the title. However, that is not the case now as I am fine with having the prepositions present between the first and subsequent names within a noble title. disagreement exists on translations of titles prefixed with reichs- ... I maintain that it is implied to meaning "of the (Holy Roman) Empire", not "imperial &lt;title&gt;". I think that this deserves explaination within the article itself. Nominally, discussions of prepositions at this time are simply between Gryffindor and me, but if it is to impact the article, others ought to discuss it as well. One thing that needs to be resolved is the disagreement over edler/edle, which, is listed as a title but is really only a style of sorts with yet another style of address. Ritter was brought up, but it is never said as knight as it constitutes an awkward sort of component of a name. French titles utilizing "des" were also brought up, but this is about Austrian nobility, not French. A title such as Marquis des Baux is Marquis of Baux as the plural "Baux" needn't be introduced with "the". Some German names using "zur" and "von der" follow this note. I, myself, think that it would be better to list the families, as is, on a seperate page.

<dd>Again, I respectfully dissent. I have proven many sources where translations do not occur, unfortunately you so far have not pointed anything out to me that would convince me or other users about using English. de = von, which was also used in Austria-Hungary (and all the rest of "von und zu", "zu" "vom und zum", etc etc). As <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">User:John Kenney</a> pointed out, translation cannot work, it sounds very strange and is wrong. I understand what you are trying to say, however we are obliged to stay true to original information. Trying to translate "auf Teufel komm raus" will not work. We can use a translation for a title like "<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archduke_of_Austria_0395.html" title="Archduke of Austria">Archduke of Austria</a>", who was a "ruler", but not for "normal" noble persons like "Edler von Mises" or "Ritter von Ghega", even a case like "Kinsky von Wichnitz und Tettau" is not translatable, or it would have to be "Charles of Gaulle" as well. sorry, that just won't work... I understand what you are trying to say, but please just trust me and other users on this. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 15:41, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The difference between Charles de Gaulle and the Princes/Counts Kinksy is that Charles de Gualle has no title... Just a surname. The Kinskys have/had titles, therefore are in English Princes/Counts Kinsky of Wichnitz and Tettau. Edler and Ritter strictly aren't titles therefore needn't have the prepositions translated. I must stress that. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 01:20, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It's not quite, I think, that the German titles are <i>untranslatable</i>. What is true, though, is that one generally <i>doesn't translate them</i>. One could do so, and some titles may occasionally be translated. But as a general rule, it's more common just to leave them as is. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 16:30, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is also the additional complication of the "von"s and the "zu" or "zur" or "von der" having officially become part of the family's last names. As we do not nor should translate proper names, these words, when part of a last name should not be translated. Indeed, they should be respected in translation, otherwise logic would dictate that we translate the English "Millers" and use their German version name, "Müller", in a German article. Bottom line is, names should not be translated and these "von"s etc are part of their last names by law (at least in Germany). --<a href="../../../m/m/o/User%7EMmounties_8e5b.html" title="User:Mmounties">Mmounties</a> 16:46, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When I was talking of translation, the actual name isn't translated unless it is a territory with an English equivalent. Von, zur, etc aren't part of legal Austrian surnames... German law has no bearning on the content of this article. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 01:20, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My take on this: Nobility has been abolished. Legally, Austrian citizens don't have "titles" anymore, but are much rather called <i>Anselm Graf zu Eltz</i>, with <i>Graf zu Eltz</i> being the surname. The surname should not be translated. <i>Finito</i>.&#160;;) —<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Nightst</span></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">a</span></font></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">llion</span></a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightstallion_e2b1.html" title="User talk:Nightstallion"><i>(?)</i></a> 20:13, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "surname" of that person would simply be Eltz if he were an Austrian citizen. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 01:20, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I'm afraid that's not the case. Due to some legal flaw, he was able to maintain his name as <i>Graf zu Eltz</i> in Austrian. Trust me, I <b>am</b> Austrian and went to school with that guy.&#160;;) It's true, however, that the two or three other former nobles in my grade only had "regular" surnames without <i>von</i> or <i>zu</i>. —<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Nightst</span></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">a</span></font></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">llion</span></a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightstallion_e2b1.html" title="User talk:Nightstallion"><i>(?)</i></a> 08:32, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't really care about what the situation of today is. I think we can agree, that the names are kept in German, as well as the prepositions added with the "de" if applies, as was in the original article. Former family names as well as current ones are shown. Also this "Edle Herren" and "Frauen" needs to go, it is incorrect. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 16:22, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Charles, do you realize you're arguing here with two Austrians? (never mind the bunch of others that chimed in as well) Do you notice that you're trying to tell Austrians how things are done in Austria? Do you really think you know it better than they do? Perhaps, you might be willing to consider the possibility that their take on most things Austrian, it being their neck of the woods, is a little more accurate than your take from the distance, especially in every day matters such as last names. Why don't you give Gryffindor a break and move on? There are plenty of articles that need a discussion a lot more than this one. --<a href="../../../m/m/o/User%7EMmounties_8e5b.html" title="User:Mmounties">Mmounties</a> 20:57, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Just because they are Austrians doesn't mean they know more than anyone who is familiar with the Austrian nobility as a past-time and as a profession. The latter, I know people in that circle. I am the one who needs to be given a break. Let Gryffindor speak for Gryffindor. Gryffindor was gracious enough to lend an ear and an opinion over issues that matter.

<p>Would it be possible to put the names into tables as to avoid the issue of all the brackets?

Does he cease to have that surname? Since Mises moved to the US and at least took up the von again (and if not before elsewhere in Europe), what rationale do you have for removing it?

People have routinely changed their names when emmigrating to the U.S. As for his right to use the preposition, he had none. It was granted by the state and removed by the state. So, if he re-adopted the title (without authorization or right) then we should indicate that too. What we do know for sure is that while he was an Austrian citizen the "von" and "Edler" were dropped from his name, by law. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 02:09, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm reverting it back to Ludwig von Mises for the moment, sans the Edler. The right to use a preposition outside of Austria is not Austria's business. I said nothing about readopting a title. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 02:12, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In this case, use the name that he was most commonly known under. If his institute etc. uses the "von Mises", then so shall be it. See also <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_von_Karajan_296a.html" title="Herbert von Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a> for further reference. Adminttedly the usage of "von" in Austrian names after 1919 on Wikipedia is not too clear yet, however I see no problems with using the most common name in that case, which is codified as a rule as well. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 12:56, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is the rule for article titles, but how we name the individual within the article is another matter. However the edit that <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> made is fair enough. Thanks for everyone's input.

<p>I've gone through the article and done some copy-editing, but I'm not sure if it's enough to remove the tag. If someone more familiar with the subject could possibly go through and check if the article deserves the tag removed, that would be great. Barring that, I'd be happy to make another run-through, but I felt like I couldn't change things I had no knowledge of. —<a href="../../../k/e/a/User%7EKeakealani_18ec.html" title="User:Keakealani"><font color="#8100B4">Keakealani</font></a> <font size="1">•<a href="../../../k/e/a/User_talk%7EKeakealani_7998.html" title="User talk:Keakealani">Poke Me</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Keakealani_0c67.html" title="Special:Contributions/Keakealani">contribs</a>•</font> 22:18, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
