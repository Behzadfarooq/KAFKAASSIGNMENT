<p>I went to my mother's today, and had a look at it. Perth is indeed missing, including in the paragraph of discussion. It cites a chapter of a book as its source, and I think we should probably mention it—but I'm not sure how best to do secondary citing here. The original work was Bradley, D. (1991). ‘<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/æ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/aː/</span> in Australian English.’ In J. Cheshire (Ed.) <i>English around the world: Sociolinguistic perspectives</i>. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 227–34. If anyone can find that source, it would probably pay to see if it mentions anything about Perth, including why it was omitted. —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> <small><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECassowary_89f2.html" title="User talk:Cassowary">ɑe hɪː jɐ</a></span></small> 12:15, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>G'day Felix,</p>
<p><br />
I'm all for your splitting the article in two however I don't agree with your using /a/ and /aː/. It's all well and good to use /a/ and /aː/ amongst those who know that it really is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɐ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɐː/</span> but do we assume this? What would the point be of writing the article if it's only for those who already know AusE phonology?</p>
<p><br />
There's also the question of consistency. You haven't used /r/ but <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɹ/</span>. You haven't used /uː/ but <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ʉː/</span>. Isn't better to use the correct IPA transcription?</p>
<p><br />
I'd already changed these back to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɐ/</span> &amp; <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɐː/</span> before I read your reasoning however, for the reasons I've set out here, I'm not going to change them back.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 28Aug05</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't use /r/ because I just copy-pasted from the RP English page and removed the unvoiced [w] sound, not used in Australian English. I didn't even know I hadn't used /r/!&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for not using /u:/, but <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʉː/</span>, that's because, well, the correct sound is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʉː/</span>, according to the standard we're using.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, using /a/ and /a:/ for the open central vowels <i>isn't</i> wrong: In fact, it's what you're meant to do. They're fully open: opener than /æ/, so they aren't nearly-open central vowels, so [6] <i>isn't</i> the ‘correct IPA transcription’. Therefore, we have to pick one glyph over the other, and IPA principles state that if we have to pick two glyphs, we should pick the simpler one. Every other language which has only one fully open vowel uses /a/, in spite of the fact that the real sound is actually almost always [a_-] or [6_o], and not [a]. Why should we be different for AuE? (Hungarian, in fact, based on the graph at the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungarian_language.html" title="Hungarian language">Hungarian language</a> page, uses /a(:)/ for a phoneme even further back and higher than Australian equivalent.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, my reading indicates that the normal IPA transcriptions that are used in the literature are either Harrington-Cox-Evans with /a(:)/ (i.e. what I put up), or M.-D. (which is many times more common, anyway; even though it's less phonetically accurate).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm thinking of drawing a diagram like they have at <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch language</a> showing the positions of the vowels (after all, almost no language has the vowels in the cardinal positions—based on the Dutch language vowel chart, in fact, AuE <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʉː/</span> is further forward that Dutch /y/, and AuE /3:/ is nowhere near IPA [3:]). If we do that, would you object less?</dd>

Look at <a href="http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/vowelgraphs/AusE_Monophthongs.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/vowelgraphs/AusE_Monophthongs.html" rel="nofollow">the graph</a>: it's clearly <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɐ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɐː/</span> (and so it's labelled) it may not right on but it's closer than <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/a/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/aː/</span>. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 28Aug05</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that it's closer to the [ɐ] isn't relevant to the intended use of IPA [a] vs IPA [ɐ]. IPA [a] is clearly intended for use as a low front or low central vowel, whereas IPA [ɐ] is intended for use as, essentially, a second lower schwa. Look e.g. at <a href="../../../v/o/w/Template%7EVowels_7264.html" title="Template:Vowels">Template:Vowels</a> or <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_front_unrounded_vowel.html" title="Open front unrounded vowel">open front unrounded vowel</a>, where it says:

<dd>This symbol (i.e. [a] —FC) very frequently used for an open central unrounded vowel, and this usage is accepted by the International Phonetic Association. Since no language distinguishes front from central open vowels, a separate symbol is not considered necessary. If required, the difference may be specified with the central diacritic, [ä].</dd>

<dd>I'm not Harrington, Cox, or Evans, so I don't know why they chose [6] and not [a]. Incidentally, their IPAification appears to have been based on Clark's (1989), and he used <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/<strike>ɑ</strike>/</span>. Try finding <em>that</em> in an IPA chart. (Cox, actually, uses <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʌ/</span> and /a/ in what she's published since then.) And, like I've seen, all the printed stuff I've seen apart from HCE (1997) and the website has used either the M.-D. system (as Cox does) or HCE-but-with-/a(:)/.</dd>

I'm not Harrington, Cox nor Evans either and I can't read their minds, however, if I might be allowed to hazzard a guess, I'd assume that they've used <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɐ]</span> exactly because of this fact that it's closer to this than it is to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[a]</span>.</p>
<p><br />
Is this irrelevant? I'll go so far as to say that it is relevant ... at least for a <i>phonetic</i> transcription. Sure, if it's a <i>phonemic</i> transcription, then it doesn't matter. Perhaps the material you refer to is exactly that: phonemic transcriptions only.</p>
<p><br />
But which are we using here: a phonemic or a phonetic transcription? Both, of course, but don't we want to tell readers how we actually pronounce things? We do, don't we? Thus, I argue, we should use a phonetic transcription based on the closest IPA symbols and, to avoid confusion, base our phonemic transcription on that.</p>
<p><br />
Isn't this the reason that they used <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɹ]</span> rather than <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[r]</span> on the RP page? You speak of our using standard (with respect to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʉː/</span>). Are they using the same sandard on the RP page? Who are we? I don't know of this standard. The standard I'm using is the Mac. Uni. website the links to which you've fixed up for me (thanks for that).</p>

You link to the <a href="../../../v/o/w/Template%7EVowels_7264.html" title="Template:Vowels">Wikipedia vowel template</a> and the page on the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_front_unrounded_vowel.html" title="Open front unrounded vowel">open front unrounded vowel</a> where there is an <i>a</i> in brackets in the central position. This is interesting but why is it absent from the <a href="http://www2.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/vowels.html" class="external text" title="http://www2.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/vowels.html" rel="nofollow">IPA vowel chart</a>?</p>
<p><br />
It seems as if we agree that the vowels in <i>hut</i> and <i>heart</i> are closer to X-SAMPA /6/ and /6:/ than they are to /a/ and /a:/ respectively, as the <a href="http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/vowelgraphs/AusE_Monophthongs.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/vowelgraphs/AusE_Monophthongs.html" rel="nofollow">Mac. Uni. vowel chart</a> indicates. You've refered to it as a fact.</p>
<p><br />
What we disagree on is the relevance of this fact. Is this not the kind of fact a reader might be looking for in an encyclopædia? Where better in <i>this</i> encyclopædia to find this fact than <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_phonology_5bbd.html" title="Australian English phonology">Australian English phonology</a>? I argue that this is a fact which should be included here.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>You mention the fact that other languages with only one fully open vowel use /a/. You ask why AusE should be different. My answer is that, no, it should be no different ... if it's a <i>phonemic</i> transcription only. You mention Harrington-Cox-Evans' use of /a(:)/ in the literature. All I can guess is that they're giving only a <i>phonemic</i> transcription in this literature.</p>
<p><br />
What I argue is that we should be giving a <i>phonetic</i> transcription. Don't we want to give the whole story? Using /a(:)/ doen't give the whole story. This goes for <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɹ/</span> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ʉ:/</span>. But I'm just repeating myself now. What we need is a show of hands. I wonder who with me &amp; who's with you.</p>

<p><i>and the expression "good on you" or "although both of these are</i> - something seems to be missing between "or" and "although". --<a href="../../../o/o/p/User%7EOop_8403.html" title="User:Oop">Oop</a> 23:52, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry about not responding to your other comment there, I'll do them both now (I must've missed it in my watchlist).</p>
<p>A central [a] is missing from the IPA vowel chart because that's not its cardinal position. Its cardinal position is indeed front. That doesn't mean it's incorrect to use it in non-cardinal positions. The IPA doesn't contain symbols for every possible vowel; nor even every vowel used in a language; only for those which contrast. No language contrasts a front open from a mid open from a back open vowel, so there's no need to include three fully open vowels; languages can therefore use /a/ to phonemically represent a sound that is phonetically in a centralised position (and indeed, the IPAssociation does so).</p>
<p>If we're going for a <i>phonetic</i> transcription, we're going to have to mark a lot more—the [<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">uː</span>] allophone of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʉː/</span>; the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɔʊ]</span> allophone of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/əʉ/</span>; the fact that <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/əʉ/</span> is more like (ahem) <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɐʉ]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɜʉ]</span> depending on how liberally we wish to interpret the symbols; the fact that <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɜː/</span> is more like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[øː]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɵː]</span>. I don't think this level of detail is necessary, and in any case it's misleading as you'd have to either still include the discussion, or diacritics, because the only Australian vowel that's on (or rather, has a mean value that's basically on) the cardinal pronunciation is /oː/.</p>
<p>Secondly, the purpose of the symbols, there at least, are more to serve as a guide to interpreting pronunciations; that's why the section on vowels begins by discussing the fact that there's two ways of writing Australian phonemes. It's not meant to be, and I don't think it should be, a guide to the phonetics of Australian English. Firstly, because to do that with symbols would not do justice to the phonetics, even dressed up in diacritics. Secondly because we can do that more comprehensibly using graphics and textual descriptions, as I've already included.* Thirdly because if we write <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪə/</span> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[iː]</span> as would be phonetically justifiable/justified, we'd serve only to confuse people when they actually do read phonemic transcriptions written in Australian English. And finally because if people <i>do</i> want to know the actual phonetic pronunciations of Australian English rather than graphical, textual or symbolic approximations, they're better served by travelling to our fair country, or failing that going to the primary literature.</p>

<p>* Regarding the graphic, I've also included the GIMP source file on the Wikimedia Commons site—follow the links from it—so if you do want to change the character I've used for /a(ː)/, you can without too much difficulty, assuming you have <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.gimp.org/" rel="nofollow">the GIMP</a>. The font I've used is <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentium.html" title="Gentium">Gentium</a>.</p>
<p>When you say that perhaps the material I've been reading that uses /a/ rather than /ɐ/ is phonemic material only, to some extent you're right. It includes stuff that's been using broad phonetic transcriptions because the precise phonetics of /a/ isn't the matter. But stuff that is concerned with the exact phonetics of /a/ has either used diacritics to symbolise the low central nature of the vowel or, more often, has been using textual and graphical descriptions, including references to the frequencies of the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formant.html" title="Formant">formants</a> of the vowel. Because that's the only way you can capture the phonetics of a vowel on paper.</p>
<p>Regarding standards, I don't mean that there's some standards body that dictates or even suggests appropriate IPA characters for Australian English. I mean a standard as in the normal way of doing something. In Australian English, when length is marked, the normal way of referring to the vowel phoneme in ‘food’ is with <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʉː/</span>, so therefore, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʉː/</span> is the ‘standard’ glyph.</p>

<p>You put forth some very good points, Felix. Also, the vowel chart you've created serves to negate most of my concerns. I'd been worrying that the use of /a(:)/ would indicate quite fronted vowels but the graph makes the fact that these are central clear enough. I'm not about to go changing things back to /6(:)/ (in fact I've just done the opposite). At least not until I have a bunch of others (who seem to know what they're talking about) who also would prefer /6(:)/. Thanks for the graph. It would be nice to have one for diphthongs I'd do it myself if only I had time to figure out how. Anyway, all in all, I think you've done a good job on this page. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 1Sep05</p>

<dd>Thanks. I'd like to do one for the diphthongs too, but it's also a case of figuring out how... I don't really know if the Gimp can draw likes with arrows (I've copy-and-pasted the one for /i:/ from the Dutch diphthongs chart, but I don't know that that's suitable in general). I might see what I can do tonight though. — <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 03:43, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nice graph. Don't worry about the wonkyness of the arrows: we've got to live with pixels. Is /i:/ really a diphthong though? It certainly has a significant on glide but I though diphthongs had to have two targets. I'll see if I can't dig up that article I read ... here <a href="http://www.shlrc.mq.edu.au/~felicity/vowel_description22.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.shlrc.mq.edu.au/~felicity/vowel_description22.pdf" rel="nofollow">it</a> is. Cox found this long on glide but only one target. Also the <a href="http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/auseng_vowels.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/auseng_vowels.html" rel="nofollow">Mac. Uni. site</a> I've refered to lists /i:/ as a monophthong. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 2Sep05</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don’t know whether an onset is enough to make it phonetically a diphthong, but this is suggestive:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Two vowels classified as monophthongs may exhibit diphthongal qualities.</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/i/</span> <i>is typically diphthongal in character in that it has a variable onglide for most Australian speakers.</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/u/</span> <i>can sometimes be realised with onglide but is more typically monophthongal.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Phonemically, I think it only makes sense. In many (but not all) contexts the only distinctive feature between <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪə/</span> is length, so length has to be the thing that distinguishes them (in fact, in almost all the contexts where there's another feature that would distinguish them—e.g. word finally—<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪ/</span> isn't permitted). So phonemically the length contrast is between <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪə/</span>. Note also from what you cited <i>Short/long pairs of vowels, which are similar in phonetic quality, retain comparable onglide propotions</i> and compare and contrast <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/iː/</span> with an onglide of almost 50 per cent length, and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪə/</span> with around 10 per cent each.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/iː/</span> is another phonemic long vowel, then we need to create an extra category. Because the targets of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/iː/</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪə/</span> are close enough to be identical, it'd need to create a category of long vowel + onset or long vowel - onset, but diphthong seems to be suitable.</dd>

<dd>Anyway, it could be best not to attempt to answer the question. This version doesn’t, but it’s a lot busier. If you like it better, you can add it to the article and I’ll make one that shows only the short vowels. The article you gave indicates that this is theoretically valid (e.g. <i>The results of the duration data confirm the traditional analysis of Asutralian English vowels that there are essentially two length types: long, which includes diphthongs, and short. A three-way length distinction as proposed by Bernard (1967b) is not support by the present data.</i>)</dd>

<p>Does this include unnecessary information? Cassowary thinks that it does.

<dd>Should we include all stereotypes? (well, except for the fake ones, like the way Americans say "sprint" as "flicrk", that's a very common fake stereotype). Should we include that some Australians will stereotype Australian Wogs as doing the same? the fact that Americans will stereotype Australians as saying "buy" for "bay" or "boy" for "buy"? How about the "g'doy moyt" stereotype of Australian wogs, by non-wog Australians? Anyway, how is New Zealand English relevant to a discussion of Australian English? It's not, but in order to include that statement as relevant you'd need to explain why Aussies say Kiwis say "fush and chups" (by the way, the <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kit-bit_split.html" title="Kit-bit split">kit-bit split</a> is the wrong place to link to, because there is no split in New Zealand English).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'll agree that it might perhaps be relevant in a discussion of the differences between Australian and New Zealand English, but that's not what that is. That's a discussion of Australian English, without regard for others.</dd>

<p>Hi, at present the article on the Canberra suburb of <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kambah%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory_d17b.html" title="Kambah, Australian Capital Territory">Kambah, Australian Capital Territory</a> contains the assertion "<i>Kambah sounds like Canberra.</i>" It doesn't really the way I hear most people say the two words, maybe my hearing is not good or I move in the wrong circles.

<dd>I expect you would. Can you make a recording of both words? I would <i>guess</i> however that "Kambah" was pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/kæːmbə/</span> (i.e. first syllable like "ram", second like "slumber") and "Canberra" is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/kæːmbrə/</span>, so if my guess is right the only difference is the missing "r" in "Kambah". I've never heard the word "Kambah", so I could be way off though.

<dd>I don't have the means (or nous) to make recordings and upload them. In non-phonetic terms I believe Kambah is pronounced that the first syllable rhymes with <i>cam</i> as in 'cam shaft', the second syllable is <i>bah</i> as in 'bah humbug'. The first syllable of Canberra would rhyme with a 'can of drink'. Your IPA symbals show the pronounciation being similar but would these rhymes make a difference?

<dd>Ah well, I do think some people pronounce "Canberra" the way it's written (in IPA as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/kæːnbərə/</span>) but it always strikes me as odd and unnatural, like the way Americans say "Melbourne" as Mel-BORN instead of MEL-ben. Presumably the person who made the assertion says "Canberra" like I do, whereas you say it like it's written. Now, as for the second syllable of "Kambah", if you say it's pronounced as "bah humbug", then in the IPA that'd make it <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/kæːmbaː/</span>, but the difference in pronunciation between <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/aː/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə/</span> at the end of a word is very slight—mostly just the length of time you say it for. My guess—as someone who's only spent about an hour in Canberra, and most of it in a car—is that if you listen carefully you'll find some people pronounce it with the longer <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/aː/</span> and some with the shorter <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə/</span>. Maybe the person who wrote it used the shorter sound. Or maybe the person who wrote it was just alluding to the fact that the long and short sounds sound similar. (PS: I hope the IPA symbols are showing properly for you. I think I've explained them well enough to understand them, but if I haven't I'll try again.

<dd><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/aː/</span> is usually called "broad a" here when it comes from the TRAP-BATH split, or just "the /aː/ sound" otherwise*, with "long a" meaning <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/æɪ/</span> (taken from the Middle English value). I have no idea where I picked up the term "flat a", but it's less common and only ever used in contrast to broad a.

<dd>I think part of the reason for this is because the broad-a/flat-a split is finished and the differences are socially conditioned, whereas the long/short flat-a split still seems to be spreading to new environments (e.g. by the time English was exported to Australia (cf. the Philidelphia and Estuary English systems), it seems it hadn't yet spread to before <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɡ/</span> whereas it is now there with exceptions (either way) exclusively neologisms; in 1985<sup>†</sup>, it hadn't yet spread to before <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/dʒ/</span> whereas by now (IME &amp; unsourced) I'd say <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/bæːdʒ/</span> was the normal pronunciation of "badge").</dd>

<p>Australian English /ɐ:/ sounds more fronted to me (closer to /æ:/) in syllables ending with a (theoretical, unpronounced) "r". Any thoughts on this from native speakers of AuE? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichwales_1fa0.html" title="User:Richwales">Richwales</a> 05:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do you mean that the vowels of ‘farce’/‘farm’ and ‘pass’/‘palm’ in AusE sound different to you? They’re not. The ‘r’ is just one orthographic notation of the long vowel. For instance, when you form colloquial words by appending one of the affixes -ie/-y, -er/-a or -o after the first syllable (or some other opportune place), newly intervocallic fricatives may be voiced. Hence, ‘afternoon’ /aːftənʉːn/ becomes /aːvəʉ/, spelt ‘arvo’.</dd>
<dd>Do you also mean you’re not a native AusE speaker? Is your own accent rhotic? You could be hearing a difference you’re used to hearing as significant, when really, it’s just because the AusE vowel is central vs your own which might be back; or you might have misunderstood an allophone (I’ve heard it as a side-remark that in Melbourne, /a(:)/ is fronted after /k/).</dd>

<dd>No, I'm not a native AusE speaker. I grew up in California, but then lived for several years in Ontario, Canada before moving back to California. My everyday speech is that of Ontario (I've been mistaken many times, by Canadians, for a native speaker) — but as a result of having become "bi-dialectal", I've become consciously aware of many speech distinctions that are <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allophones.html" title="Allophones">allophones</a> in one dialect or another.</dd>

<dd>I just finished watching the public memorial for Steve Irwin.

<dd>On the other hand, most other speakers at the Steve Irwin memorial — such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Field_a65c.html" title="Anthony Field">Anthony Field</a> and Wes Mannion — did not make this distinction. I wonder if it might be a regional variation. I'm pretty sure that, when these vowel sounds are different, they are treated as allophones and the difference is not noticed by most Australians.</dd>

<dd>In Britain, and I believe Australia too, the vowel in <i>quality</i> is different from that in <i>father</i> and <i>calm</i>, and the non-rhotic vowel written <i>ar</i> is the latter. E.g. in RP <i>barmy</i> and <i>balmy</i> are both <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ˈbɑːmɪ/</span> but <i>quality</i> is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ˈkwɒlɪtɪ/</span>. So you'd need a pair like <i>balmy</i>/<i>barmy</i> to check whether the ghost of the /r/ has any effect on the vowel quality.--<a href="../../../j/h/j/User%7EJHJ_006a.html" title="User:JHJ">JHJ</a> 07:40, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As JHJ says, the vowel in ‘quality’ is different from the vowel in ‘remarkable’. ‘Quality’ is /kwɔləti/ and has the same vowel as ‘cot’, ‘hot’ or ‘what’/‘watt’. (I don’t know how much the American balm/bomb, cot/caught and very/vary mergers have affected all of this, so I’ll explain it basically all: In a word spelt with a ‘w’, ‘wh’ or ‘qu’ followed by a short ‘a’ not followed by a <a href="../../../v/e/l/Velar_consonant.html" title="Velar consonant">velar consonant</a>, the ‘a’ is pronounced as if it were a short ‘o’. So the A’s in w<i>a</i>s, wh<i>a</i>t, w<i>a</i>tt, w<i>a</i>ffle, qu<i>a</i>ntity, qu<i>a</i>lity, W<i>a</i>rrigul (a town) or w<i>a</i>rm, qu<i>a</i>rter, w<i>a</i>r are all treated as short o’s, and the words are pronounced as /wɔz wɔt wɔt wɔfəl, kwɔntəti kwɔləti, wɔrigəl/, /woːm, k(w)oːtə, woː/ respectively. On the other hand, w<i>a</i>ry, w<i>a</i>fer, wh<i>a</i>le or w<i>a</i>ck, w<i>a</i>g, w<i>a</i>ng are /weːri, wæɪfə, wæɪəl/, /wæk wæːg wæŋ/. The word ‘water’ is /woːtə/ but I have no idea why; forms of strong verbs like ‘swam’ /swæm/ are also excepted.)</dd>
<dd>I’m afraid if you didn’t hear a distinction in other speakers of AuE, it would be because you missed a distinction that was made.(*) I doubt any Australians would consider the sounds /ɔ/ and /aː/ to be alike; the difference of length (if nothing else) is very salient. Even /a/ and /ɔ/ (cut vs cot) aren’t all that alike; /æ/ and /a/ (cat vs cut) are nearer.</dd>
<dd>(*) To my (native AuE) ear and lips, the Australian English vowel /ɔ/ is probably less rounded than its symbol suggests. And this might be age-related, so John Howard’s /ɔ/ might be rounder than the younger speakers, making it easier for you to hear the difference. But that’s just a guess...</dd>

<dd>Similar. Whether it’s the same or not depends on how broad the speaker’s accent is.

The pronunciation [aː] and [aːz] like they use in England are unlikely to be heard here, but I have a friend from NZ at Uni who does precisely that. —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 08:11, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would there be any other studies conducted that include ʉː and iː? I believe that the NSW pronouciation is different, eg. "pewl" vs "pool" and "oils" vs "eels". - <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDiceman_dc75.html" title="User:Diceman">Diceman</a> 13:10, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is some variation between those two pairs (I’m not sure what you mean by ‘oils’, I suppose the vowel of ‘f<b>ee</b>’ followed be a the last syllable of ‘roy<b>als</b>’). I don’t think I’ve seen any proper regional studies on the topic tho. My impression is that it’s a change that’s probably affecting the whole country, but has spread from Adelaide to Melbourne to Sydney over a period of at least a generation so younger speakers in Sydney might still say ‘pewl’ [pʉːəɫ] whereas older speakers in Adelaide probably normally say ‘pool’ [pʊːɫ].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The only study other than the ones I’ve cited in the article that I can remember reading that discuss the issue, was one about whether a given vowel + l combination was pronounced monosyllabically or disyllabically. It didn’t actually discuss the phonetics of the vowel, but I presume that the pronunciations of /ʉːl/ were monos. [ʊːɫ] (your ‘pool’) vs dis. [ʉːəɫ] (‘pewl’) and of /iːl/ were monos. [ɪːɫ] (‘eel’?) vs dis [iːəɫ] (where [iː] contains the onset standard for AusE /iː/; ‘oil’?). It was limited to Adelaidean English, and found that there the monosyllabic pronunciation of ‘pool’ was all but mandatory for the speakers involved, but there was some amount of variation for ‘eel’.</dd>

<dd>The classic (exaggerated) example would be the Kath and Kim pronounciation of "Look at me". The other times I've heard it are on Toyota World Sport (some Rugby commentator) and the Patrick Stevedore dockworkers (their pronounciation of "defeated").</dd>

<p>Here's a potential minimal pair: <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mad" class="extiw" title="wikt:mad">madder</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/a/d/Madder.html" title="Madder">madder</a></i>.

<dd>Two sides of the same coin:</dd>
<dd>That pair alone isn’t enough to prove that /æː/ is a phoneme in Australian English; the syllable boundary could be after the /d/ in “more mad” (keeping with the morpheme boundary) but before it in the plant’s name (for a basic CV.CV word). Better evidence for the difference is pairs like ran~Wran or mad~lad. Even ran~Wran could be described with “ran” <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimality_theory.html" title="Optimality theory">being faithful</a> to the length of the base form, “run”, but “Wran” following the regular course.</dd>
<dd>As for the way you’re reading it; that’s simple: lengthening doesn’t (never) happens if the consonant is followed by a vowel or approximant, unless a morpheme boundary intervenes; the contrast is restricted to closed syllables. You’re treating the plant’s name as monomorphemic, so lengthening would be anomalous.</dd>

<dd>That's some interesting stuff there Felix. However, wouldn't /mæ.də/ break the rule (with its short stressed vowel in the open syllable)? <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">J</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jimp_f608.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jimp">i</a><a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimp_beb8.html" title="User talk:Jimp">m</a><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Jimp" class="extiw" title="wikt:User:Jimp">p</a> 07:10, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No; that’s precisely what you expect. English /æ/ lengthening is not Swedish vowel lengethening. The plant is /mæ.də/; the superlative is in some (possibly historical) way /mæd.ə/ [mæːd.ə]. Today, it might be the case that the superlative is /mæːd-ə/ [mæː.də] where the length is retained from the underlying specification, rather than added.</dd>
<dd>Also, don’t forget that /d/ doesn’t/didn’t generally cause lengthening; it’s just the case that four words ending in -d happen to have long vowels: mad, glad, sad and bad. All other words ending in -ad have a short /æd/: had, fad,[*] lad, dad, pad, ... and I also read neologisms like spad, blad with short vowels.</dd>
<dd>[*] I’ve always pronounced the “politically correct” name for a certain brand of fake cigarette lollies I liked as a kid as [fæːdz], presumably because the old name for them was [fæːgz]. But a passing superficial fashion is [fæd].</dd>
