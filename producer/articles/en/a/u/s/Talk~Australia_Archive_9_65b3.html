<h2><span class="mw-headline">Voting turnout</span></h2>
<p>The sentence about voter turnout has been removed by blatant reverts to previous versions from days ago (19th October) for no other reason than it is "irrelevant" and can be stated in other places.

<dd>Completely agree. I removed it. If it has a place, it is in a more detailed artcle. The statement that it is compulsory is enough. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 01:34, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Have you seen what the voter turnouts are like in most countries? The information is actually unusual. I think this requires more discussion. As two editors against and three for the information (so far) shows it is disputed. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 01:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I can't help but feel you're being unusually agressive. You have pursued this minor issue across a number of pages and misrepresented the facts – I have never used the word "irrelevant", and to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAustralian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;diff=82919549&amp;oldid=82917798" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAustralian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;diff=82919549&amp;oldid=82917798" rel="nofollow">state</a> I have "consistently removed statements" (paraphrase) is disingenuous.

My actual argument was that the statement was inconsistent with the article's <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">summary style</a>. Per that standard, it is sufficient to note that voting is compulsory in Australia; discussion about fines and turnout is something that is more appropriate to the section's subarticles.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 02:05, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry if this seems like I am pursuing things too vigourously, I am a little annoyed (in general) at the idea that FA's should not be expanded on, but mostly, it is my thinking that there genuinely is a place for a fact of that magnitude, on this page, and that the "compulsory voting" statement does not fit on its own. How many other countries have voter turnouts that high?</dd>
<dd>Also, sorry for misquoting you. I just do not see why it is the end of the world to delete something I, and another editor, actually went to the trouble of researching, and that is a unique fact. The article is full of facts like that already. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 02:29, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think FA's shouldn't be expanded upon; however, I do think that whatever additions take place should be in accordance with the style that attainment of FA status was contingent on. I disagree with the idea that, because a fact is unique (or referenced, as you initially proposed), it merits inclusion. To mention that voting is compulsory is a reflection on the system; to mention turnout and fines is more in-depth and opens up the issue of elections and procedure. It should be noted that the edit you wish included makes the unsuported (and potentially contentious) assertion that high turnout is because of expiations. I do not support that text.</dd>
<dd>The only thing that I could see mising from the statement about voting in Australia is age of franchise. I have thusly changed it to "<i>Voting is compulsory for all enroled citizens 18 years and over in each state and territory, and at the federal level.</i>" (the "enroled" part is there because enrolment is voluntary in SA). --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 03:17, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps there is a case for including the high turnout figures, but it must be brief. It is indeed high compared to other countries. But listing fines, etc, is just not important for this article. How about "<i>Voting is compulsory for all enroled citizens 18 years and over in each state and territory and at the federal level, and turn out rates exceed 90 per cent.</i>"????????? --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 03:23, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<p><i>(Moved from <a href="../../../a/w/n/WP%7EAWNB_94e7.html" title="WP:AWNB">WP:AWNB</a>)</i>. The page already specifies that voting is compulsory - of course the turnout would be high.

We just don't work that way. Here's how you can get information on compulsory voting into article <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert it into article <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elections_in_Australia_28e2.html" title="Elections in Australia">Elections in Australia</a>. It really is terrible that <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elections_in_Australia_28e2.html" title="Elections in Australia">Elections in Australia</a> doesn't mention this important fact. There is room in that article for a thorough discussion of the implications of compulsory voting in Australia, if you're so inclined.</li>
<li>Create a section entitled "Elections" in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Australia_b3a4.html" title="Politics of Australia">Politics of Australia</a>, to be a summary of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elections_in_Australia_28e2.html" title="Elections in Australia">Elections in Australia</a>. As a summary, it should briefly mention the fact that voting is compulsory in Australia, without going into all the details. It probably only needs a sentence or two, as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Australia_b3a4.html" title="Politics of Australia">Politics of Australia</a> has an awful lot of material to cover.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Talk%7EAustralia_2196.html" title="Talk:Australia">Talk:Australia</a>. Advise that <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Australia_b3a4.html" title="Politics of Australia">Politics of Australia</a> has recently seen the addition of material on compulsory voting, remind us that <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html#Politics" title="Australia">Australia#Politics</a> is supposed to be a summary of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Australia_b3a4.html" title="Politics of Australia">Politics of Australia</a>, and propose the inclusion of a sentence on the material.</li>

<p>I think it is actually quite interesting that the number of valid votes cast is exceptionally high, as voting is not actually compulsory, only attendance at a voting booth. It is therefore interesting that 96% of people that turn up to tick their name off go on to cast a valid vote - which is high even under compulsory attendance. It is also one of the most interesting facets of Australian politics and society, so I think it should be included. <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESad_mouse_6053.html" title="User:Sad mouse">Sad mouse</a> 18:09, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Michael, can you explain your position a bit clearer? I think there are two issues here. Firstly, the head of state <b>is</b> QE2, the GG is just her representative.

<dd>As I understand it the queen of course relates to HM the Queen of Australia, who is a different entity to HM the Queen of the UK, even if the same person. Imagine two public companies, one of which once owned the other, but now share no connection except for the same chairman of the board. The Act of Settlement, as with all British acts prior to responsible government in Australia remains in force until amended or repealed by an Australian parliament. So it is competent for Australia to amend, maybe making Princess Anne the next queen for instance, but of course this would make the whole situation even more absurb than it is now. As I said this is the constitutional position as I understand it. More to the point, this is obviously how the original author understood it, and so I think it encombant on Tony to provide a source to the contrary if he wishes to change it --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 13:32, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, Michael, the federal government <i>can</i> indeed override laws passed by state governments in a number of areas, under s. 51. Second, the UK government has the power to ask the Queen to disallow Australian legislation. Third, and most decisively, the Australian Constitution is still an act of the UK Parliament, which has the power to change it. By analogy, Pierre Trudeau managed, finally, to repatriate the Canadian Constitution back in the&#160;?1980s. This third point was reason enough for me to strike "final" from the text. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 13:43, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think Tony is right. As far as I understand... there is a lot of convention involved. The theory is different to the practice. The Governor Gerneral, for example does in fact have the power to dismiss the Prime Minister, he did so in 1975.

<p>The Australian constitution is indeed part of a UK act, but acoording to Wikipedia <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Australia_c872.html" title="Constitution of Australia">Constitution of Australia</a> <i>is now regarded as fully separated from the text in the original Act,</i> and has always been subject to amendment by referendum and without the UK amending the act. Theoreticly the UK parliament might revoke the act, butin fact gave up the right to do this by the Statute of Westminster and subsequent acts. I am sure you will find the UK government and parliament has no residual powers regarding the constitution or government of Australia, which is the question at hand.</p>

<li>Yes, it's subject to amendment by referendum, but is still an act of the Westminster parliament. Please provide evidence that the Statute of Westminster and subsequent acts remove the power of London to do anything it likes with the act. I think you'll find no such evidence.</li>

<p>Ref 1975 Whitlam in fact had the power to remove Kerr by advising the Queen to sack him. He never did because he believed Kerr would never sack him.</p>

<li>Well, no. Whitlam had the power just to <i>recommend</i> to the Queen that he be sacked. If the Queen had not accepted this, the sacking would not have occurred. This is the invidious situation that Australians find themselves in, comforted only by the small likelihood that this situation will arise. While on the subject of Whitlam, I don't have a reference for this, but I'm pretty certain that the Whitlam government asked Westminster whether it would alter the Australian Constitution, and the reply was that this would be done only with the consent of the federal and all six state parliaments.</li>

<p>Ref sect 51, this refers to areas reserved for the Federal governement, and of course the states cannot legislate in these areas.

<p><i>In an important constitutional case (Sue v Hill (1999) 163 ALR 648), three justices of the High Court of Australia (the ultimate court of appeal) expressed the view that if the British Parliament were to alter the law of succession to the throne, such a change could not have any effect on the monarchy in Australia, because of the Australia Act: succession to the throne would continue in Australia according to the existing rule, unless and until that was altered in Australia. None of the other four justices in that case disagreed with this reasoning.</i></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><i>The same case decided (and on this point the decision is binding) that the United Kingdom is a "foreign power" within the meaning of the Constitution,</i></p>

<li>With respect to Tony's argument that the UK Parliament can amend the Constitution - there's a distinction between autochthony and autonomy. The Constitution certainly derives its original legal status from an Act of the UK Parliament. But that doesn't mean that the UK Parliament still has power to repeal or amend the Constitution. The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_Act_1986_cc6d.html" title="Australia Act 1986"><i>Australia Acts</i></a> closed that door off.

<li>Um, no, Sue v Hill has nothing to do with the UK paliament's power to amend the Australian Constitution; rather, it deals with the fact that the succession of its and our head of state is governed by <i>acts of parliaments</i> in both countries.

<dd>The succession was an example used by the judges to illustrate their point. <i>Sue v Hill</i> concerned whether the UK is a "foreign power" for the purposes of s.44(i), and in answering that question, the majority considered whether the UK had any legislative, executive or judicial power over Australia. They held that it didn't: there was no judicial power since appeals to the Privy Council were abolished, and no executive power since with respect to Australia Betty acts as Queen of Australia, and doesn't take advice from UK ministers. There was no legislative power because of s.1 of the <i>Australia Act</i>.</dd>
<dd>What this means: if the UK parliament were to try to change the Constitution, it would have to be via an amendment or repeal of the Constitution Act, and any such amendment or repeal would have no effect in Australia because of s.1 of the <i>Australia Act</i>.</dd>
<dd>Naturally the question hasn't been <i>finally and completely</i> answered since the Brits have never tried this. But it's almost certain that any attempts to do so would have no effect in Australia. For the purposes of this broad summary article, "final constitutional ties" is accurate enough.

<dd>Using sources other than Wikipedia articles or editors would definitely be a good idea, as would starting the sentence with "The final", rather than "Final".

<dd>You're right that the wording supports your view, because the wording is inaccurate. The fact that the same person is monarch is not actually a constitutional tie.

It doesn't matter that Betty is both Queen of the UK and Queen of Australia, when she is acting in her capacity as Queen of Australia she acts in a distinct capacity, and takes advice <b>only</b> from her Australian ministers, and there is complete separation of executive power.

Since 1931 and the appointment of <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Isaacs_adc1.html" title="Isaac Isaacs">Isaacs</a> as G-G, it is established that the monarch acts on Australian advice in making appointments. I'll quote from <i>Sue v Hill</i>:</dd>

<p>"The point of immediate significance is that the circumstance that the same monarch exercises regal functions under the constitutional arrangements in the United Kingdom and Australia does not deny the proposition that the United Kingdom is a foreign power...

<dd>By not suggesting that the deregulations have being either minor (through the word partial) or major (through the word full) there is no degree in our writing. By balancing the degree of our writing we are able to be more neutral. For example probably is a greater degree of writing then what would be if we used the word possibly. The degree of our writing helps us be more neutral in a topic. I think this is good because of the controversial nature of WorkChocies. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolitaryWolf_cc28.html" title="User:SolitaryWolf">SolitaryWolf</a> 13:28, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't mean to sound offensive... But I think you'll find it is very verifiable to sate that WorkChoices is a form of Labour Market deregulation.

<dd>I think the issue here is the notion of <i>deregulation</i>. Does deregulation mean a <b>state</b> where no regulation exists at all, or is it a <b>process</b> of decreasing the amount of regulation. Perhaps if agreement can be found between these two different usages, then agreement can be found on what to use in the article. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 03:48, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What if the word "partial" was replaced with "comprehensive"? In this sense the series of amendments are not implied as either minor or major.

<p>A new map has been added with links to states, cities, etc. I think the concept is a great one and clearly some good work has gone into it. Two points though - which i think can be fixed: it still seems a bit, um, "messy". Can it it be tidied up some how? A border? Secondly, is it in the best position? In fact, does it mean that the existing map in the states and territories section can now be replaced with the new one? I don't think there is a need for both, and with a few more improvements, the new one could be clearly superior to the old (which i don't think actually says that much).

<li>No clear identification of what these 267 languages are (apart from "many are aboriginal").</li>
<li>Younger and different to American English is not that helpful</li>
</ul>
<p><i>There are 267 languages in Australia (many being Aboriginal languages.) Of those, 234 are living languages, 2 are second languages without mother tongue speakers, and 31 are extinct. The Australian English language is the most common and has a formal style as well as a colloquial style. Australia still has a formal style in writing while it sustains an informal style in speaking. In the history of the Australian English language, the language has its own background when compared to American English. Australian English is younger than American and its history is different and less complex. There has been no Australian Declaration of Independence like in America. However, Australian English has not moved as far from British English as American had in the period. In the greater part of Australia, the vocabulary is still Standard English (Hansford 67).</i> --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 23:39, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Settlement Vs Invasion (or a suitable compromise)</span></h2>
<p>Yanksox says "invasion" is too extreme a word, yet settlement is far too "soft" a word, anybody got any good alternatives? I'm Australian and I don't call it "the settlement", I call it "the invasion", no other word I can think of accurately describes what occured. Settlement has "peacful" connotations and I believe it is misleading. If a whole bunch of unwanted people turned up with guns and started shooting you and members of your community, you would not call it a "settlement" (I hope)....</p>
<dl>
<dd>To be honest, I'm not Australian. I do agree settlement is too soft, invasion is a bit extreme. The situation is similar to where all indigeous people were forced out. I normally call it "rape of the land," but I suppose we can't call it that. I defer to anyone with more expertise. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font><font color="red">sox</font></a> 00:41, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>cool, yeah I agree, maybe "occupation" is a bit more neutral, I'm not going to change it now (and will consult here before doing so again), but I might do a bit more research, I'm fairly sure the academic term would be invasion, but I'll ask some lecturers on what the consensus would be, anyone else feel free to leave suggestions.

<dd>Never you mind my POV, I, as an Autralian resident am saying that IMOO settlement is too soft a term for what amounted to the genocidal takeover of the peoples of an already occupied country. If what happened then happened now, it would not be called a "settlement". "Settlement" sounds like what happens when you freight potato chips around. If I came to the shores of your country, made a token offering of peace then began a capaign designed at culling the majority of your population, you would still call that a "settlement"? Don't ever assume that someone is "making a statement", I thought wikipedia offered the locals POV before the world communities views anyway?
<dl>
<dd>The indigenous inhabitants certainly would have seen it as an "invasion", but to the UK government and its colonists it was a peaceful "annexation" of unclaimed lands. Neither of these descriptions is appropriate except in the context of a balanced discussion. "Occupation" has wartime connotations; according to its <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation.html" title="Occupation">disambiguation page</a>, it means both "the period of time following a nation's territory invasion by controlling enemy troops" and "the act of settling onto an uninhabited tract of land". I propose "<b>colonisation</b>". It is accurate, it is neutral with regard to the legal and ethical aspects, yet it correctly connotes the atmosphere of Western imperialism and colonialism that prevailed at the time. <a href="../../../h/e/s/User_talk%7EHesperian_5634.html" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a>

<dd>I haven't checked the specific figures, so there may well be errors, but it is not impossible for the figures above to be correct.

<dd>Yes, of course Chuq was also right in saying that Nurg's last sentence was incorrect, but he had already implied that the smallest value was just over 1% in NSW, with all the others over 4%, which cannot be consistent with a 1% total. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 12:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I checked the figures and Nurg is probably on to something. First off, I guess that it depends on the various sources used. The total area in the infobox is different from the total area given in the geography section. The geography section uses the CIA as a source and the infobox area comes from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_and_outlying_territories_by_total_area.html" title="List of countries and outlying territories by total area">List of countries and outlying territories by total area</a> which does not list a source. In any case, if you add up the water areas in the state's infoboxes you'll get a total of 158,677 sq mi of water. Divide that by the total sq. miles of 2,988,888 (and multiply by 100) and you'll get 5.3%. According to the figures from the CIA you'll get 0.8% water. So maybe some sources need to be double-checked. —<a href="../../../m/j/c/User%7EMJCdetroit_76e3.html" title="User:MJCdetroit">MJCdetroit</a> 21:37, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Within Wikipedia, there's frequent undefined use of "water as percent of area". Usually, the unstated assumption is that a 3 or 12 mile territorial limit at the coastline describes a captured water territory. Without definition, this isn't useful, and generally would be better broken down. In the case of Australia, very arid but with a long coastline, these figures can be misleading, and not an index of anything at all. Enclosed water (lakes and rivers) plausibly relates to climate and suitability for agriculture, etc.; an extensive coastline vs. landlocked has many implications for trade, navy/military, and fishing. They don't relate to each other in any obvious way. This is a general, perhaps endemic Wikipedia problem which I hope will be addressed. Paulownia5 20:29, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I could quote many academic articles that cite examples, but many points are already listed here. The most striking is the 17 year life expectancy gap, as a comparison the life expectancy gap between white Americans and African-Americans has now shrunk to 5 years. I changed "perceived racial inequality" to "racial inequality", which was reverted back to "perceived racial inequality" on the basis of "speculation and OR".

<dd>Hi SM. "Perceived" does not in any sense means it's not real. After all, it could be real and unperceived. This article simply can't take a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Point of view</a> on the matter - it should be something that John Howard or Keith Windschuttle can read and not have factual issues with. Even they can't deny that there is the <i>perception</i> of racial inequality in Australia. My advice to strengthen this point is to add citations and evidence demonstrating the poor position of indigenous Australians. After all, external sources are much more pertinent and valuable than Wikipedia's say-so. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus">speak up!</a></small> 21:28, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mmm... I see your point. But the data in the article already (higher unemployment, higher imprisonment, lower education, a 17 year lower life expectancy) are signs on real racial inequality not signs of the perception. Also, they are already referenced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, I could add extra citations, but they are already present in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians#Issues_facing_Indigenous_Australians_today" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians#Issues_facing_Indigenous_Australians_today" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians#Issues_facing_Indigenous_Australians_today</a> - how much longer should this section be expanded? In fact (and this is speculation) I would say that Australia has a real and unperceived racial inequality, since most Australians rarely think about indigenous peoples (who are a very small minority outside the NT), but the problems they face are statistically demonstrated. Where is the citation for anyone to say that there is a perception of inequality? There currently isn't one.

<p>On a separate, and more minor, point, the politics section mentions three major parties and then the minor parties. I edited out that the minor parties "influence has been marginal" for two reasons : 1. in the hung Senate when Howard attempted major legislative changes, the support or lack of it of these minor parties was essential. I wonder about the burden of "marginal" if they are dismissed as such - perhaps in that case the Nationals should be listed as a marginal party because their influence in the Coalition legislative agenda at times has been less than that of Senate Democrats. 2. It is really just unnecessary, the parties are already called minor, this isn't an article on the politics, why go out of the way to make a contentious statement as fact? <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESad_mouse_6053.html" title="User:Sad mouse">Sad mouse</a> 21:09, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Racial inequality is the reason why we have affirmative action policies - policies that seek to redress that inequality. <a href="http://www.hreoc.gov.au/speeches/race/native_title_and_rda.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hreoc.gov.au/speeches/race/native_title_and_rda.html" rel="nofollow">Here's a link</a> to a speech on the website of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which says:
<dl>
<dd><i>Special measures permit action to be taken that assists disadvantaged racial groups. Special measures recognise that historical patterns of racism entrench disadvantage and that the prohibition of racial discrimination alone is not enough to overcome racial inequality.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Evidently the HREOC thinks its reason for existence is to overcome racial inequality in Australia. <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/expand?pub=infobike://routledg/rrse/2000/00000058/00000003/art00006&amp;unc=" class="external text" title="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/expand?pub=infobike://routledg/rrse/2000/00000058/00000003/art00006&amp;unc=" rel="nofollow">Here's a link</a> to the abstract of an academic paper in which "The empirical context of the problem of racial inequality in Australia is presented".</dd>
<dd>In light of this, the "perceived" in "perceived racial inequality" is itself a POV word; it suggests that there may only be a <i>perception</i> of inequality, which may not be grounded in reality. Is there any evidence of that? Are there any scholars out there who take this position? --<a href="../../../h/e/s/User_talk%7EHesperian_5634.html" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> 03:34, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I included "perceived" when I wrote that part of the article, mainly because I didn't do any reading and was unwilling to make the firmer statement. If there is a supporting body of literature to support the idea that racial inequality goes beyond perception, add a reference. It probably needs a qualifier though to say that inequality mostly effects indigenous Australians. Old speeches and articles on the theorhetical basis inequality in Australia vs America, probably aren't good sources.</dd>

<dd>Having a quick look around, it is hard to get a definition of racial inequality beyond "society contains different races with different levels of performance on social indicators". If someone has a hard and fast rule for how different they have to perform we can address that, otherwise the ABS reference demonstrates the point. The other issue you raised - that of racism, really is seperate, and if it can be supported it would need new references and should be in culture and not demographics probably. <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESad_mouse_6053.html" title="User:Sad mouse">Sad mouse</a> 06:06, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the marginal influence comment is unnecessary. I was probably too quick to put it back in, partly because the edit summary did not justify removing it. As for perceived racial inequality, let's take a step back and look at what the sentence is actually saying. It's not talking about the reality of the inequality - as has been said, the data is in the article already. The sentence is commenting on the fact that it is a political and human rights issue. It is definitely the perceived inequality which is the issue, real or unreal, and not any real unperceived inequality. In fact, politically, the perceptions of inequality themselves are often treated as the issue. These doesn't mean that including "perceived" is necessary (Peta's original version didn't have it, and resulted in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Talk%7EAustralia_Archive_5_766a.html#Racial_discrimination.3F.3F.3F" title="Talk:Australia/Archive 5">this</a>), but it's worth keeping in mind.

<dd>Two points to make on that : the original was racial discrimination which is different than racial inequality. It is fair to say that the ABS data does not show there is racial discrimination (there is, but that would require additional references) but it absolutely does demonstrate, unequivocally, racial inequity. As you have said, it is clear there is racial inequality, so that should be said in the article. Also, I would say that the <b>actual</b> racial inequality is the important human rights issue (and, I think, as a political issue, since no politician can 'win' on inequality until the stats improve). The point you raise about perceived inequalities I understand, but it is a little vague and unreferenced - is the racial inequality perceived by the Australian public greater or lesser than the actual level of inequality? I would guess the perceived inequality is actually lower than the actual inequality, but I have no references to demonstrate that point so it has to be left out. My solution is to call it what it is, racial inequality, ignore the part about politics and just say it is a human rights issue, adding references from AI, HRW and the UN:</dd>

<dd>The text Alex Bakharev quoted as "racial discrimination" was actually "racial inequality". I am not necessarily supporting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia&amp;diff=18655792&amp;oldid=18644018" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia&amp;diff=18655792&amp;oldid=18644018" rel="nofollow">his change</a>. Having said that, your references cite racial discrimination as the human rights issue, not inequality. However, I am not really sure what being "a human rights issue for country Z" or "for Z-ians" mean. Maybe it would be better to be more specific and say that it has been raised as an issue by A, B and C. As far as I do understand it, I would have though the inequality itself would be more of a political issue, and isn't one that gets as much attention as it could, but if it is given a mention in this context, this mention should probably be more specific too. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 16:25, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"<i>...with higher rates of imprisonment and unemployment, lower levels of education and life expectancies for males and females that are 17 years lower than those of other Australians..."</i> Although I will not deny there are issues this statement seems grossly POV.</p>
<p>For one the sources from which the stats were taken are not dated. Additionally, the possible reasoning behind these stats is not mentioned. For example Indigenous Australian communities are largely rural based. This is important because rural areas traditionally experience higher rates of unemployment. These rates are felt regardless of class or race. Consequently, higher crime rates become an issue. The isolated nature of Aboriginal communities also makes it difficult to supply them with public goods and services in a logistic sense.</p>
<p>Finally, the fact that many indigenous Australians have attained high levels of education and hold respectable positions in society should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>For an overview, I think Sad Mouses contributions demand a great deal of excess information to remain balanced. Until this issue can be resolved (scans history) I felt it was neccesary to tag the demographics section. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolitaryWolf_cc28.html" title="User:SolitaryWolf">SolitaryWolf</a> 01:54, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the POV tag really needs to be removed, most of the data you ask for is already referenced. <i>"...with higher rates of imprisonment and unemployment, lower levels of education and life expectancies for males and females that are 17 years lower than those of other Australians..." Although I will not deny there are issues this statement seems grossly POV.</i> How is that POV? They are simply data. If you go to the link most of your further questions are answered, for example the data is the most recent available (2005 and 2002). Also if you look at the breakdown the high unemployment rate is not only rural, it is also higher in the urban population. In terms of education, you can look at the percentage that finished school at grade 9 - it is double the non-Aboriginal population.</dd>

<dd>This is a better comparison than tertiary education (where they perform five times lower) because you are right that rural areas have restricted access to universities but secondary education is legislated to be available to everyone. Crime rates are not only higher (and despite what you say, this is not associated with rural areas), but of Aborigines that go to jail, they have a much greater rate of suicide. In health, the remote and non-remote population have exactly the same increase in health problems (same reference as above). In other words, there is racial inequality even in the urban population, and even in those areas where the government has legislative duty to perform (ie comparing basic health and basic education, not luxury health and luxury eduction) the rural Aborigine population is worse off than the non-Aborigine population. Finally, you note that many Aborigines have high education and respectable positions - yes that is true, but the point is <i>not as many proportionally as non-Aborigines</i> which is the very definition of racial inequality. We could make this section an entire page, but that would make a long article longer and the reference contains the required data. <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESad_mouse_6053.html" title="User:Sad mouse">Sad mouse</a> 04:08, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sad mouse's contributions changed a fairly vague sentence to a referenced one which was completely NPOV. The data was not put there by Sam mouse, but has been there for over a year. It is quite reasonable for a demographics section to speak about averages, without having to spell out that many individuals are far from average. Having said that, the current version hardly hides all mention of racial inequality - the data is given, and the reader would have to be fairly stupid not to understand that it implies inequality. As Merbabu says above, often it's best to let the facts speak for themselves. I'm not sure how appropriate it would be to describe inequality as an issue if there were references for it. However, only one of the references Sad mouse added actually addresses inequality, and I don't think allegations that specific policies are discriminatory are really necessary for a demographics section. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 12:21, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One wonders if you have actually read the link I provided. The way you keep bringing up human rights groups makes me think you didn't even click on the link, since the article it connects was <i>written solely from ABS data</i>. Consistently removing a link containing objective data (and coupled with personal comments against me) is biased. Calling human rights groups "completely unreliable" is biased (note, if you had called their conclusions into question based on objective data that disputed it, that would be fine, but to automatically group all human rights organisations together and prejudge them as completely unreliable is biased).

<p>I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that a single link should indeed be in this section of the article - in my opinion, without it, several statements are made which aren't illustrated for the non-Australian observer. While some of the edits (eg "suffer from racial inequality") are vague and should not be in an encyclopaedia at all, the information to which Sad mouse refers seems fairly safe territory - if one wanted to make it safer, finding the Royal Commission report and a few HREOC papers wouldn't go astray. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 05:09, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are a thousand things that can be mentioned about Australia, and especially relating to it's demographics.

<dd>That is interesting. Do you have any reason for why Indigenous Affairs is such a "petty issue" that we shouldn't have a simple link to it? That is all I put in, a simple link for people that might actually want to know more, isn't that what wiki is about, interlinks to articles to have information at the fingertip? I gave up actually trying to mention social inequality, but is it that much to ask to link to a relevant article? The sad thing is that many Australians do have such an underlying and unacknowledged racism that they are unwilling to even accept a link to Aboriginal Issues in an article, because anything that suggests Australia isn't perfect ruins the "neutrality of the article". I guess I won't be surprised if the next time I visit this article Aborigines have been deleted from it completely. Enjoy yourselves. 10:51, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Naming of Australia</span></h2>
<p>The section under "Origin and history of the name" in this article mentions nothing of the part played by Pedro Fernandes de Queirós in the naming of Australia. Even the article on Queiros on Wikipedia states the following:</p>
<p>"<i>The name of Pedro Fernandes de Queirós is today chiefly remembered in Australia. Many writers credit Queirós with coining the word "Australia" in the belief that he named his islands "Australia del Espiritu Santo", whereas he actually called them Austrialia del Espiritu Santo. (The name "Australia" was actually coined by his translator in 1625 and later was strongly endorsed by Matthew Flinders.)</i>"</p>
<p>This also fails to mention that it is a widely held view that he named (what he thought was) Australia, "Austrialia del Espiritu Santo" after the King of Spain at the time, Phillip III who was from the house of "Austria" (Habsberg), hence the name "<b>Austria</b>lia". Here is link to one place that confirms this but it may require confirmation: <a href="http://www.namingaustralia.org.au/Docs/Quirostriptico.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.namingaustralia.org.au/Docs/Quirostriptico.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>It seems that no-one is 100% sure of where the name is really from but if we're stating theories on how the name was derived, surely all of them should get some coverage. Regardless, Queiros should be mentioned.</p>

His title was derived from "Austria" (Österreich), meaning <b>eastern</b> kingdom in German, whereas Australia is derived from the Latin word for <b>south</b>. The words Austrialia and Australia are superficially similar, but relate to quite different points on the compass. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 04:57, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I stated "he named (what he thought was) Australia, "Austrialia del Espiritu Santo"". It also doesn't change the fact that on the Queiros page it states "<i>The name <b>"Australia"</b> was actually coined by his translator in 1625 and later was strongly endorsed by Matthew Flinders.</i>". In light of this, surely it should be mentioned on the Australia page (or conversely deleted from the Queiros page) that there is at least debate as to whether the name Australia came from the latin 'Australis' or as a corruption of 'Austrialia'.</p>

<dd>There have been maps produced for ions which have named a presumed southern continent as "Terre Australis Incognita" or something similar (my latin is non-existant). It translates as unknown southern land. Early cartographers assumed there must be a southern continent to "balance out" the northern continents. This is where the term "Australia" comes from. I have never heard of Queiros before but it would be logical for him to name newfound lands in the south of the equator as part of this continent. But I doubt he originated the name. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 01:41, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Queiros named the lands after the House of Austria, the rulers of Spain at the time, not from the Latin "Australis". Whether the name "Australia" comes directly from the Latin or from Dalrymple's translation will probably never be known. However Dalrymple used it earlier than 1771. It was in his 1765 translation of Juan Luis Arias de Loyola's book about Torres. Joesph Banks took a copy of this book on Cook's 1768 voyage. In any case, Queiros and Austrialia del Espiritu Santo do deserve a mention. <a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbromage_504c.html" title="User:Dbromage">Dbromage</a> 02:04, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unless you can provide a source to the contrary, it is clear that the name Australia came from the Latin <i>Terre Australis</i> , or South Land, a term that was widely used before Queiros. See for instance the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Sch%C3%B6ner_globe_2847.html" title="Johannes Schöner globe">Johannes Schöner globe</a>, which was made 50 years before Queiros was born.

<p>I'm not sure how much more simple I can make this. On one page in Wikipedia, the Queiros page, it states "many writers" credit the origin of the name Australia to Queiros' translator. On the Australia page it is not mentioned at all. There are two options here:</p>
<p>1. If it is complete hearsay and there is undisputable evidence that the name "Australia" came from the Latin word for south, the "Queiros theory" should be deleted from the Queiros page or altered to make it clear that this theory has been proven incorrect.</p>
<p>2. If it is a valid thoery that can't dismissed (except by Micheal Johnson's "doubts" of course), then it should be mentioned on both pages as an alternate theory as to where the name came from.</p>
<p>203.202.43.62 01:02, 21 December 2006 (UTC) Brett</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The problem is the article on Queiros is entirely unsourced on this matter. It does say:</p>
<blockquote style="border: 1px solid blue; padding: 2em;">
<p>A devout Catholic, Queirós visited Rome in 1600, where he obtained the support of the Pope, Clement VIII, for further explorations. He went to Peru in 1603 with the intention of finding Terra Australis, the mythical "great south land," and claiming it for Spain and the Church. Queirós's party of three ships, San Pedro y Paulo, San Pedro and Los Tres Reyes left Callao on 21 December 1605, with 300 crew and soldiers. In May 1606 the expedition reached the islands later called the New Hebrides and now the independent nation of Vanuatu. Queirós landed on a large island which he took to be part of the southern continent, and named it La Austrialia del Espiritu Santo (the Southern Land of the Holy Spirit). The island is still called Espiritu Santo. Here he founded a colony which he called Nova Jerusalem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This in entirely consistant with what I understand was the situation. But further down it says:</p>
<blockquote style="border: 1px solid blue; padding: 2em;">
<p>The name of Pedro Fernandes de Queirós is today chiefly remembered in Australia. Many writers credit Queirós with coining the word "Australia" in the belief that he named his islands "Australia del Espiritu Santo", whereas he actually called them Austrialia del Espiritu Santo. (The name "Australia" was actually coined by his translator in 1625 and later was strongly endorsed by Matthew Flinders.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which does not gell with the previous quote. Either he was looking for Terre Australis or he wasn't. Neither is sourced. "Many writers" is not very reliable as a source. (<i>added later</i>) We understand from the first quote that the term "Terre Australis" was in use before Queiros commenced his voyage, so he didn't coin the term. He didn't encounter mainland Australia, so didn't "name" it, and his translator apparently coined "Australia". It's not clear if Matthew Flinders (who did promote Australia) was inspired by Queiros' translator or not. So it is difficult to see why one would include him in a paragraph on naming Australia.</p>

<p>South Australia was founded as an experiment in settlement, with free settlers direct from Britain. No convicts were ever sent there. Victoria was settled as a "private enterprise" inititive from Tasmania. The first settlers probably included former convicts, and certainly many former convicts moved to Victoria as a way to advance themselves. No convicts were sent from Britain to Victoria. I don't know if any convicts still serving their term were sent from Tas to Vic, although this is possible. Also there was an attempt to establish a penal colony in Vic about 1803, but the colonists moved on to Hobart to establish Tas. WA started as a free settlement, but then asked for and received convicts to provide cheap labour, after transportation had ceased to the rest of Australia. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 05:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

The only exploration was Flinders and Baudin along the coast around 1802, and Sturt's party down the Murray around 1830. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 07:10, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>So, did (as it is said in this article) or didn't (as it is said in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Australia_5246.html" title="History of Australia">History of Australia</a>) Victoria accept penal transporatation after its fundation as a British colony? One of those articles has wrong information.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">beer</span></h2>
<p>Any desire for the culture, (or perhaps start a trivia section) to include that fact that Australia is ranked #4 in beer consumption in the world? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_consumption_by_country" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_consumption_by_country" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_consumption_by_country</a> Well, it makes me proud.  :) <a href="../../../d/r/d/User%7EDrDisco_2351.html" title="User:DrDisco">Disco</a> 17:19, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
