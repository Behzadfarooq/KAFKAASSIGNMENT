<p>As of July 2005, the requirements for grant of Australian citizenship (in force since 1984) are that the applicant:</p>
<ul>
<li>holds permanent resident status</li>
<li>has been present in Australia as a permanent resident for a total of 2 years in the 5 years before application, including a total of 12 months in the 2 years before application</li>
<li>understands of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship (except for applicants aged 60 or over)</li>
<li>is able to speak and understand basic English (except for applicants aged 50 or over)</li>
<li>understands the nature of the application</li>
<li>intends to reside in Australia, or maintain a close and continuing association with Australia</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some exceptions to the standard requirements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>children aged under 18 of former Australian citizens</li>
<li>Australian Defence Forces veterans</li>
<li>former Australian citizens and those born in Australia</li>
<li>children adopted by Australian citizens</li>
</ul>
<p>Children aged under 16 can be included in the application of a responsible parent. The standard residence requirements do not apply to such children. Children aged 16 and 17 may apply on the same basis as adults but normally require the consent of a parent.</p>
<p>All applicants aged 16 or over must attend a citizenship ceremony and make a Pledge of Commitment as a citizen of Australia before they can become Australian citizens.</p>

<p>Burma became independent outside the Crown's dominions on 4 January 1948. In the <i>Burma Independence Act 1948</i> the United Kingdom legislated to remove <i>British subject</i> status on that date from:</p>
<ul>
<li>any person born in Burma whose father or paternal grandfather was born in Burma, and neither father nor paternal grandfather born in a British territory or British protectorate; and</li>
<li>women married to men who lost British subject status by virtue of the above provision.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such persons who were domiciled in the United Kingdom or "His Majesty's dependencies" were given two years to elect to remain British.</p>
<p>Australian legislation was not updated at the time and hence the <i>common law</i> applied. British subjects connected with Burma only lost British subject status under Australian law if resident in Burma.</p>
<p>As a result, some British subjects connected with Burma acquired Australian citizenship on 26 January 1949 if resident in Australia for 5 years at that point.</p>
<p>On 29 July 1950 the Australian Parliament passed the <i>Nationality and Citizenship (Burmese) Act 1950</i> which removed the discrepancy between Australian and British law on the status of persons connected with Burma.</p>
<p>As a result of the Act, Australian citizenship was lost on 29 July 1950 by persons who had had British nationality removed from them under the UK legislation in 1948, and persons descended from or married to such persons.</p>
<p>Such persons were given until 29 July 1952 (two years from the date of commencement of the Act) to register a declaration of intention to remain a British subject. If such a declaration was registered, the person was deemed never to have lost Australian citizenship.</p>

<p>Despite being involved in a number of armed conflicts since 1949, Australia has not declared a formal state of war on another sovereign nation in that period, and hence section 19 has not operated up to now.</p>

<p>Former Australian citizens may be able to resume Australian citizenship if they fulfil certain criteria. Those who lost Australian citizenship upon naturalisation in another country (by virtue of <i>section 17</i> of the 1948 Act) may be able to resume citizenship if the person:</p>
<ul>
<li>has lived in Australia legally for a total of 2 years; and</li>
<li>is either living in Australia and plans to remain, or intends to return within 3 years; and</li>
<li>has maintained a 'close and continuing' association with Australia; and</li>
<li>did not know they would lose Australian citizenship by acquiring another; or</li>
<li>would have suffered 'significant hardship or detriment' by not acquiring the other country's citizenship</li>
</ul>
<p>These provisions, contained in <i>section 23AA of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948</i> also apply to those former Australian citizens who renounced Australian citizenship in order to <b>acquire</b> (but not retain) that citizenship.</p>
<ul>
<li>Children who lost Australian citizenship at the same time as the parent may be included in a section 23AA resumption application if they are still aged under 18. Otherwise they must apply to resume citizenship under section 23B of the Act.</li>
<li>Former Australian citizens who renounced Australian citizenship to <b>retain</b> another country's citizenship may apply for resumption of Australian citizenship if aged under 25 and meeting similar criteria to the above. This facility (section 23AB of the Act) has been in place since 1 July 2002.</li>
<li>Those who lost Australian citizenship as children may resume Australian citizenship by declaration lodged before age 19, or later if the Minister accepts 'special circumstances' under section 23B of the Act. In practise this is interpreted quite narrowly and it is difficult for former Australian citizens who lost citizenship as children to recover it if aged 19 or over.</li>
<li>Similar provisions to section 23B of the Act are in place for former (naturalised) Australian citizens who lost their citizenship under section 20 of the Act (residence outside Australia) before 1958.</li>
<li>Children born to former Australian citizens (only those who lost Australian citizenship by virtue of <i>section 17</i> of the Act) after loss of the parent's citizenship, and before the parent resumed citizenship, may be considered for a <i>grant</i> of Australian citizenship if still aged under 18. There is no requirement for the parent to resume citizenship. This policy has been in place since 13 October 2003. <a href="http://www.citizenship.gov.au/media/children.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.citizenship.gov.au/media/children.htm" rel="nofollow">Details</a></li>

<p>New Zealanders were included in the definition of <i>British subject</i> in the 1948 Act and hence many New Zealanders resident in Australia acquired Australian citizenship in 1949 when this was introduced.

<p>The facilities to become an Australian citizen by registration or naturalisation have been open to New Zealanders in Australia since 1949. However, some New Zealand citizens arriving since February 2001 are required to apply for and obtain Australian permanent resident status before becoming eligible for Australian citizenship.</p>
<p>Children born to New Zealanders in Australia have generally been Australian citizens by birth. The exceptions are:</p>

<p>As a result those born or naturalised in <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papua_%28Australian_territory%29_fafc.html" title="Papua (Australian territory)">Territory of Papua</a> acquired Australian citizenship on the same basis as any other part of Australia. However, those of indigenous descent were not automatically entitled to reside in the rest of Australia, despite holding Australian citizenship. It was possible in some circumstances for such persons to apply for and be granted a right of residence in mainland Australia.</p>
<p>Persons connected with <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territory_of_New_Guinea_55f2.html" title="Territory of New Guinea">Territory of New Guinea</a> were Australian protected persons rather than Australian citizens and for nationality purposes the territory was considered not to be part of Australia.</p>

<p>Under the Australian Citizenship Act, only a person born <i>outside</i> Australia is eligible to apply for Australian citizenship by descent. This has caused an anomaly in that former Australian citizens born in the former Territory of Papua (not New Guinea) before independence, and who lost Australian citizenship on independence in 1975, are unable to recover it through this route even if they have a parent born in mainland Australia.</p>
<p>This has been the subject of legislation in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia, who have ruled that the definition of <i>Australia</i> includes the former Territory of Papua prior to independence. However, the Australian Government has announced provisions in the <i>Australian Citizenship Bill 2005</i> which will allow such persons to apply for Australian citizenship by descent if otherwise eligible.</p>

<p>The wording of the Oath of Allegiance taken by newly naturalising Australian citizens has changed over time. In 1973 the Oath's wording was:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I, A.

</dl>
<p>Australia, however, never required new citizens to formally renounce their former citizenship under the law of that country. An equivalent wording was available in the form of a non-religious Affirmation for those who preferred.</p>
<p>In 1986 the wording was changed to:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.</i></dd>

Specific amendments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>removing the restrictive criteria on resumption of Australian citizenship and Australian citizenship by descent; and</li>
<li>allowing grant of citizenship to adult children of former Australian citizens (only where the parent lost Australian citizenship under <i>section 17</i> of the 1948 Act prior to 2002); and</li>
<li>allowing grant of Australian citizenship to people born overseas before 26 January 1949 with an Australian parent;</li>
<li>streamlining the criteria for temporary residence in Australia to be allowed as a credit against the residence requirement for grant of Australian citizenship</li>
<li>increasing the residence requirement for grant of Australian citizenship from two years to three.</li>

<p>When Australia created Australian citizenship on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_26.html" title="January 26">26 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>, not all British subjects connected with Australia became Australian citizens on that date.</p>
<p>The most notable exceptions were</p>
<ul>
<li>children born outside Australia to Australian fathers; and</li>
<li>women married to Australian men;</li>
</ul>
<p>where the child or woman had not entered Australia with a permanent entry permit before <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_26.html" title="January 26">26 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>.</p>
<p>Under the terms of section 12(4) of the British Nationality Act 1948:</p>
<ul>
<li>such persons acquired <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_of_the_United_Kingdom_and_Colonies_118e.html" title="Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies">citizenship of the UK &amp; Colonies</a> (CUKC) on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_26.html" title="January 26">26 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> on the basis of being British subjects connected with Australia, if they did not have citizenship of, or connections with, another Commonwealth country or Ireland.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>where a person had connections with another Commonwealth country that had not introduced a citizenship law as of <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_26.html" title="January 26">26 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>, they acquired citizenship of the UK and Colonies on the date the other country introduced a citizenship law if they did not become a citizen of that country at the time, if they had not acquired Australian citizenship by that point.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A complication arises if the person had a connection with India or Pakistan and such a person may have remained a British subject without citizenship if he did not acquire Indian or Pakistani citizenship, or the citizenship of any other Commonwealth country or Ireland.</li>
</ul>
<p>Persons acquiring CUKC would have retained it upon a later acquisition of Australian citizenship. However they would only be British citizens today if they had obtained a 'right of abode' in the UK under the terms of the Immigration Act 1971, such as by having a UK-born grandparent. Otherwise they would be British Overseas citizens.</p>
<p>British subjects without citizenship would have retained that status only if they did not acquire a Commonwealth nationality (or Irish citizenship) before 1983, or any citizenship from 1983 or later.</p>
<p>British Overseas citizens and British subjects may register as British citizens if they have no other nationality (and have not lost another nationality since <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">4 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>), but otherwise do not have an automatic right to live in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Under United Kingdom law, Australians are <i>Commonwealth citizens</i> and hence are entitled to certain rights in the UK:</p>

<p>In 1995 the of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library researched <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rn/1995-96/96rn06.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rn/1995-96/96rn06.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> the status of the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen</a> with regard to Australian citizenship.</p>
<p>They concluded that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Queen does not fall within the categories of citizenship by birth, adoption, descent, or grant listed in the Australian Citizenship Act 1948</li>
<li>All Australian citizens are subjects of the Queen in right of Australia. The Queen cannot be her own subject, as one only exists in relation to the other, and the two cannot as such be combined.</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears that the Queen is not therefore an Australian citizen. The Queen, however, is <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Australia_2c0b.html" title="Monarchy in Australia">Queen of Australia</a> and, by virtue of her status, does not require a <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visa_%28document%29.html" title="Visa (document)">visa</a> to enter Australia. The Queen does not hold an Australian or any other passport. Australian passports are issued <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Prerogative_cb9c.html" title="Royal Prerogative">in the name of the Queen</a>, asking foreign governments to grant the passport holders free passage, assistance, and protection. The first page of an Australian passport carries the following message:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, being the representative in Australia of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, requests all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance and to afford him or her every assistance and protection of which he or she may stand in need.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Since the Queen can personally ask foreign governments for free passage, assistance and protection, she does not carry any passport. <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/OutPut/Page4871.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.royal.gov.uk/OutPut/Page4871.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
