<h2><span class="mw-headline">Catching up with some other countries</span></h2>
<p>Over the last few days, I've been noticing a wide variety of holes in our coverage of Australian topics. There's really so much that needs doing, and it seems like the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Wikipedia%7EIrish_wikipedians%27_notice_board_5442.html" title="Wikipedia:Irish wikipedians' notice board">Irish</a> have a good thing going. I talked to <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">User:Chuq</a>, and he thought it was a decent idea, so I've gone ahead and created an Australian version. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 04:12, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nice work</span></h2>
<p>Good idea! Do you think it's worth having sub sections on the to-do list? For example, Australian politics, Australian geography, Australian music, etc. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 06:24, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you think it's necessary, sure. Our coverage of <i>current</i> politics is pretty good, though our coverage of <i>past</i> politics is dreadful. I'm not sure about geography, as that's not really my thing. As for music - all the bands on <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_J_Hottest_100_9e1f.html" title="Triple J Hottest 100">Triple J Hottest 100</a> have articles, but I'm sure there's others that need work. Getting a list of all of these that do need work would really be helpful. It seems like it's our articles on history and society that are most in need of help, though. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 06:32, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Number of articles in the to-do list</span></h2>
<p>Where should we draw the line on the number of articles in the to do list? I reckon there should be a complete list at Wikipedia:Requested Australian articles or somesuch with the most urgent listed here, as we could really go on for god-knows how long finding articles that need to be made or expanded. <b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User_talk%7ETPK_8851.html" title="User talk:TPK">T.</a></b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK">P.K.</a> <small>06:35, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I agree. I think we should have a collection of subpages of those that need doing, and then highlight a certain number to be put on the main to-do list. Btw, comments can on the main page - at least, that's there where the comments go on the Irish equivalent. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 06:40, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Featured Articles</span></h2>
<p>One thing I'd like to see is more featured articles from Australia. At the moment, I think we only have the one - <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eureka_Stockade_68e8.html" title="Eureka Stockade">Eureka Stockade</a>. What would you all think about highlighting one particular article at a time to try and get towards featured status? I think our closest two at the moment would be <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_J_376a.html" title="Triple J">Triple J</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Dam_47ac.html" title="Franklin Dam">Franklin Dam</a>, and with a bit of work, I think we could get them both featured. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:50, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WikiProject Australia</span></h2>
<p>What do people think of making a new Wikiproject for the whole of Australia? This way we can coordinate strategy better, and use this messageboard as the discussion forum. Anyway, just throwing this one out there for people's comments. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 03:00, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was just going to suggest we do something to coordinate the WikiProjects, so that we don't re-do eachother's work. I don't think a full-fledged WikiProject is neccessary though, as all the content-creation stuff for Australia is being handled nicely here already. It would be nice to have a place for creating standards and formats to share between the WPM and WPS and any future projects though. I was going to suggest creating some subpages of this noticeboard for coordinating the WikiProjects. But prehaps a Wikiproject Australia would be better as it would fit into the 'greater scheme of things', as it were, all templated up and added to the list of WikiProjects. Either way. <b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User_talk%7ETPK_8851.html" title="User talk:TPK">T.</a></b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK">P.K.</a> <small>03:09, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>That's why I created this! I'd had in mind creating some sort of Australian WikiProject, but there didn't really seem to be an appropriate space on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">Wikipedia:WikiProject</a>, and no other country had one. Then I mentioned it on IRC, and someone pointed out what the Irish had done instead, and here we are! Personally, I think TPK's idea of having subpages to co-ordinate the city WikiProjects might be the best way to go. It might be nice if we could get them off the ground for some other cities, too. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 05:08, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not so sure - as I said, I created this as a form of national WikiProject - just not under that name, and following the Irish format, because they're the only place this organised at the moment.

<p>(<i>7 indents is enough</i>) Really, I think the difference between this page and any subpages it might grow, and a WikiProject is semantic. The only difference is that the WP has a standard frontpage with the talk pages "behind" it, while this here is a talk page without a frontpage. It's not that important. Sure, the existing WPs are fine, and they are more conducive to structure and order, but for what we <strike>want</strike> need to do here, all we need is to discuss what the formats will be that will then go into the structured WikiProjects. I say we just create /WikiProjects, and any subpages under that which may be needed, for discussing anything which might be applicable to more than one CityProject. If and when we create a solid structure for how to treat all the aspects of a city in the Pedia, we can write it up as a WikiProject to allow others to use it. <b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User_talk%7ETPK_8851.html" title="User talk:TPK">T.</a></b><a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK">P.K.</a> <small>08:59, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Hi all, Recently I've been in discussion about with <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> over Australian copyright. Just to let you all know, Australia doesn't have any <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> legislation. We have fair dealing, however this is not at all like fair use. For instance for any material we gather from the Australian government, we still need permission to use the material. Also, should we add any information from a source, we need to be sure that we don't use more than 10% of that material.

<dd>Good idea. I'll add it to my watchlist. For the record, I think your absolute best bet here is to ask the Fred Hollows Foundation if they've got any public domain pictures of him. I'm sure they wouldn't mind. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 13:24, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fuzzy Wuzzy</span></h2>
<p>Okay, this is seriously bugging me. Just what are we talking about here?</p>
<ul>
<li>The term used by diggers for their PNG allies; not sure if its taken so nicely by all PNGs these days (like Aborigine can be offensive to some "Indigenous Australians", rare but not unheard of, and increasing)</li>
<li>The song (about a bear - see <a href="../../../a/c/o/WP%7EACOTW_6da5.html" title="WP:ACOTW">WP:ACOTW</a>)</li>
<li>Fuzzy Wuzzy caterpillars</li>
<li>Badly knitted woolen jumpers (or was that just me)</li>
<li>Warm fuzzies - anonymous written notes of affirmation in classrooms</li>
</ul>

<dd>Erm, the term used by diggers for their PNG allies. The other stuff isn't encyclopedic, and even if it were, would most likely be on a linked disambiguation page. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 14:27, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When i nominated it for ACOTW i was certainly talking about our PNG allies, i just added the song cause i did a google search on the term and found it, and thought it was funny, but seriously i dont think you would be able to write an encyclopedia article on the song, and even if you could would you want to? and anyway, it wouldnt be particualy AUSTRALIAN. Our PNG allies on the other hand would be very interesting, however perhaps a more objective title like <i>Australian allies in PNG during WWII</i> would be better. Coming to think about it, maybe it would be best if the fuzzy-wuzzys just became part of the <i>australian involvement in WWII</i> article that was being discussed as a section of the Australian history article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_bellman_55cf.html" title="User:The bellman">The bellman</a> 14:36, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
