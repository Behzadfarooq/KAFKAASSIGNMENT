<p>Hi, Aussie rules is the greatest sport in the world, but until at least some of the rest of the world realises that, it's pretty hard to claim that we have a team that represents Australia at Aussie rules! Until then, it's just fantasy football, IMHO, YMMV, DNCWA, etc etc. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenAveling_8f0b.html" title="User:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 10:29, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Point. Poor use of the word "representative", but it <i>is</i> a national team.

<p>This page is just taking the p*ss, especially the desperate claim that Aussie Rules has a national football team. This is a sad pathetic abuse of wikipedia simply to stop real football having its own page. soccer "mafia" indeed. --202.47.49.66 17:22, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And beacause both rugby and soccer have national FOOTBALL teams then their should be a disamb page. The AFL is put on their as well just in case someone is looking for that.

<dd>The vast majority of people searching for the Australian national football team will not be searching for the national soccer team. Most people will be australians, and as a result of this we need to ensure that wikipedia is easy to navigate for those people new to wiki. There is less confusion when there is a disamb page meaning that everyone only has one click to get to the page they want. If you redirect to soccer team then people looking for other australian national football teams will first have to look for the link, and then click twice to get to their page.

<dd><i>The vast majority of people searching for the Australian national football team will not be searching for the national soccer team.</i> Then what team will they be looking for? Read my bit above about the team. If you are talking about <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_in_Australia_2105.html" title="Football in Australia">Football in Australia</a> then yes, that should be a disambig page, and it is. This is one about the TEAM. Australian rules football doesn't have a national team (not one that actually plays), the rugby codes are referred to as rugby when talking about international competitions (for example <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_World_Cup_0c0a.html" title="Rugby World Cup">Rugby World Cup</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_League_World_Cup_23f1.html" title="Rugby League World Cup">Rugby League World Cup</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Category%7EInternational_rugby_league_teams_97fd.html" title="Category:International rugby league teams">Category:International rugby league teams</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Category%7ENational_rugby_union_teams_b1c1.html" title="Category:National rugby union teams">Category:National rugby union teams</a>). The Socceroos are called the national football team by both local fans of the sport as well as people from overseas (Wikipedia is an international project) wanting to find out about our football team.

<dd>This would mean that a diambiguation page is needed, as 65% of people would not be searching for soccer. The football in australia page shows that there are more then one type of football code. By redirecting straight to soccer is basically saying that there is only one code in australia with a national team which is completely untrue.</dd>
<dd>People is places where rugby is by far the dominant sport will call rugby, football most of the time. As for AFL, some people will probably hear of a national team picked by selectors and not know the name and hence search for australian national football team.</dd>
<dd>Yes the socceroos are called the national football team by people overseas and abroad, however there are also many that call it the national soccer team. There would probably be people from rugby areas overseas searching for the australian football team. By being an international project we need to consider other peoples views and how they think. Not all people would think of looking at the top of the page for a link to the other codes. It is simply much easier and more ergonomic for this page to be a disambiguation page. <small>unsigned comment by <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">User:GordyB</a> 14Feb07</small></dd>

<dd>Chuq, you write "Only Rugby union and soccer have national teams which actually compete in any major international competition, and people call rugby 'rugby' in this case." ... and people also call soccer "soccer" in this case especially in Australia. Not only do the majority of Australians call soccer "soccer" but so do the majority of native English speakers. So take your pick.</dd>
<dd>Yes, Wikipedia is an international project so let's cater to the international audience. Let's cater to the British for whom <i>football</i> means soccer, let's cater to the Irish for whom <i>football</i> means soccer or Gaelic football, let's cater to the North Americans for whom <i>football</i> means American or Canadian football, let's cater to the Kiwis for whom <i>football</i> usually means union ... Am I forgetting anyone? ... Oh, yes, let's cater to Australians for whom <i>football</i> usually means union, league or rules.</dd>
<dd>I'm tempted to redirect <i>Australian national football team</i> to <i>Australian national football team (disambiguation)</i> but I expect I'd only be reverted and called a vandal in the process. However, I believe that <i>Australian national football team</i> should not simply be a redirect to the disambiguation page but it should <i>be</i> the disambiguation page with the redirect going the other way. Either way, though, <i>Australian national football team</i> should not be a redirect to the national soccer team page.</dd>
<dd>I say this not as a fan of any particular flavour of football but as an Australian who believes he has some sense of normal usage of vocabulary in English and in Australian English in particular.</dd>

<dd>I am being unfair: there was a fair amount of flinging of the v-word in the other direction. Thank you for pointing me to the more full discussion over on the talk page you mention. With respect, however, why would I comment there when I propose that <i>this</i> page be changed? Why ... particularly considering that that page "is currently inactive and is kept primarily for historical interest." and was supposed to deal with "a proposed guideline for use of the word 'football' in articles." (a somewhat different issue). You suggest that the points I raise have been refuted ... if that's your take on it, great. They've certainly been <i>discussed</i>. You do point us to a number of news sites which use <i>football</i> to mean soccer but how representative are these of general usage by average Australians?</dd>
<dd>I must say that I did like this bit: "We need to decide on a convention that will keep australian, rugby and association football people happy when they do a search. A lot of soccer people around the world know that their 'football' is soccer." "... the proposed policy allows for that (articles with 'football' in the topic (eg. <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_in_Australia_2105.html" title="Football in Australia">Football in Australia</a>) will be a disambiguation page, for example)." So, allow it here: keep the rugby people happy when they search for "Australian national football team" keep the rules people happy too (even though they only find teams of little significance). <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">J</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jimp_f608.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jimp">i</a><a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimp_beb8.html" title="User talk:Jimp">m</a><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Jimp" class="extiw" title="wikt:User:Jimp">p</a> 16:41, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Ha ha ha. I keep coming across these hilarious "what does football mean in Australia" discussions. I just hope they are obscure enough that nobody from outside the country actually reads them. Howard is embarrassing enough without a bunch of chumps arguing about a word. I should say right from the outset I am a rugby union fan. In terms of this debate, soccer fans you are right, this should be your page - nobody would enter Australian national football team and be looking for anything else. But why try arguing with the AFL loonies? Just drop it, people will get to your boys (Australia's most famous footballers of any code) eventually. AFL chumps - get a grip of yourselves!! Your world is not going to come to an end if someone who is looking for a soccer team types in a word that you also like to use for your sport. It's time to grow up. Your sport is doing just fine and doesn't need your desperately defensive posturing. As for rugby union, it's going down the pan - but that's nothing to do with whether people call it football or not (very very very few do). Is there a fourth code? Can't quite remember... only kidding leaguies. You are grown up enough to let the soccer boys claim the word in this context, I'm sure. Mralph72 10:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey lads, this is gold. If I search on "Australian Football Team" I go to a page that covers the (real or imaginary) team in each of four codes of football, although I suspect there is probably a national gridiron team somewhere that gets omitted - unfairly in my book. But if I search on "Australian NATIONAL Football Team" I go straight to the Socceroos. Embarrassing stuff. Sort it out, Aussie Football Wikipedians!!!Mralph72 10:18, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>But wait, there's more!!! If I look at the discussion on "Australian Football Team" (the one that covers all and sundry), and then click on the article tab, wait for it... I go to a page on the Socceroos. Quite, quite brilliant. Well done!! Mralph72 10:21, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello my fine friends, I'm back. Here's a thing: If I search on "US Football Team", it goes straight to the article on the US soccer team. Yes, it's true!! And how many of our American cousins do you think have complained about this slur on the fine sport of American Football (not to mention rugby, league, five-a-side soccer, etc)? How many, hmmm? None. Not one. Has the sport of American Football fallen into chaos? No. Are American rugby fans scratching their heads wondering why it doesn't link to THEIR team? Apparently not. How many soccer fans are demanding it be called football or association football or football (soccer), etc, etc? Again, not one. You see, a state of adulthood IS attainable chaps.Mralph72 07:24, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some of us hear what you are saying&#160;:) But if football people make the changes that the world would expect, certain Aussie Rules editors jump up and down about it. We should just move <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_team.html" title="Australia national football team">Australia national football team</a> from <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_%28soccer%29_team.html" title="Australia national football (soccer) team">Australia national football (soccer) team</a> and be done with it, but we all know what will happen. Still things are changing. Rugby League writters in the SMH and now calling the sport football, and even the Melbourne press have woken up to the fact that football is now played in Australia 10-11 months of the year.<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancred_11fe.html" title="User:Tancred">Tancred</a> 10:36, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would reflect the views of a tiny minority in Australia. Football is still used for all the codes in the SMH, the use of the direct term "football" for soccer, and "Australian Football" for Aussie Rules. This is certainly not common usage in Sydney. The whole tone of that comment suggests that a view is being put forward rather than observing simple facts. When a prominent footballer like <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willy_Mason_12a2.html" title="Willy Mason">Willy Mason</a> can talk about wanting to captain the Australian football team, than the term is obviously not clear cut. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_144.132.221.157_bd3c.html" title="Special:Contributions/144.132.221.157">144.132.221.157</a> (<a href="../../../1/4/4/User_talk%7E144.132.221.157.html" title="User talk:144.132.221.157">talk</a>) 03:53, 17 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>
