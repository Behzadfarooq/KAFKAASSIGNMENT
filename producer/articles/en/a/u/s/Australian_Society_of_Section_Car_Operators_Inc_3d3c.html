<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Society_of_Section_Car_Operators_Inc_3d3c.html" title="Edit section: Group History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Group History</span></h2>
<p>ASSCO was founded in late 1999, after a series of informal meetings, by a group of motor section car owners operating their cars in South Australia.</p>
<p>At the time, many cars were being run using the insurance and systems of a number of heritage railways, including Steamtown, and often under the "work for ride" banner.</p>
<p>Changes to the regulatory regime in South Australia allowed for the accreditation of a body as a railway owner and operator, subject to meeting the requirements of Australian Standard AS4292 Railway safety management.</p>
<p>An incorporated body (ASSCO) was established to hold the accreditation, and in 2000, work commenced on the preparation of a safety management case for the group. The case considered obligations under the Rail Safety Act, Occupational Health Safety and Welfare Act, AS 4801/4804, AS4360, and ISO 9000 quality systems.</p>
<p>Interim accreditation was achieved in late 2000. Work to prepare the safety case was done by one of the founding members, with operational experience coming from a former railwayman, whilst a lot of the processes used by the North American Rail Car Operators Association were considered and, were necessary, modified to meet Australian Regulatory Practice.</p>
<p>By April 2001, the organisation had in place an access agreement, which meant formal accreditation could be granted. ASSCO was the first not-for-profit ("Heritage") railway to be granted accreditation as a railway operator without owning or managing its own railway line in South Australia. It was also the first heritage operator to start up under the regulatory regime since it was implemented.</p>
<p>The committee at the time, and subsequently, has avoided taking (long term) responsibility for any infastructure, because of the work and cost associated with its maintenance. That said, the group has held a lease over the railway between Kevin and Penong on the Far West of Eyre Peninsula.</p>
<p>Originally, operations focused on the railways of South Australia. Although realised early on that other states would be essential to assist the group to grow, work for access in other states did not commence for a few years.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Society_of_Section_Car_Operators_Inc_3d3c.html" title="Edit section: First Run">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Run</span></h2>
<p>After gaining accreditation in South Australia, the group made a number of approaches to heritage and commercial railway operators for access.</p>
<p>The first railway to agree to host an ASSCO meet was <a href="http://www.flinderspower.com.au" class="external text" title="http://www.flinderspower.com.au" rel="nofollow">NRG Flinders Operating Services Pty Ltd</a>, operator of the Leigh Creek Line, between Port Augusta and Copley. This was the longest run for section cars at the time, some 250km.</p>
<p>This line carries one coal train each way each day, meaning the trip crossed trains both days.</p>
<p>Since then, ASSCO has operated on railways owned by <a href="http://www.gwrr.com/default.cfm?action=rail&amp;section=3B9a" class="external text" title="http://www.gwrr.com/default.cfm?action=rail&amp;section=3B9a" rel="nofollow">Genesee and Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd</a>, <a href="http://www.prr.org.au/cms/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.prr.org.au/cms/index.php" rel="nofollow">Pichi Richi Railway</a>, <a href="http://www.railpage.org.au/aetmsa/" class="external text" title="http://www.railpage.org.au/aetmsa/" rel="nofollow">The Australian Electric Transport Museum</a> and <a href="http://www.ypr.org.au" class="external text" title="http://www.ypr.org.au" rel="nofollow">Lions Club of YPRail</a>. It has also leased the Kevin Penong line for two weekends. This was the most westerly run it has done.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Society_of_Section_Car_Operators_Inc_3d3c.html" title="Edit section: Insurance Problems">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Insurance Problems</span></h2>
<p>Like many heritage railways, ASSCO suffered the effects of the insurance crisis in the early part of the Decade. Whilst a few thought the organisation was dead, work to regain insurance continued. This included support of other programs, even when these did not benefit the organisation directly.</p>
<p>In the end, ASSCO was invited into the CHRTSA group scheme, enabling it to restart operations, as well as provide support to the other heritage railways in South Australia, by sharing the Premium burden. More recently, the group moved into other pooled premium schemes.</p>
<p>Although ASSCO does not carry members of the public, it was realised that ASSCO members are themselves tourists, and provide a considerable boost to local economies where they operate.</p>
<p><a name="Sharing_the_Benefit" id="Sharing_the_Benefit"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Society_of_Section_Car_Operators_Inc_3d3c.html" title="Edit section: Sharing the Benefit">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sharing the Benefit</span></h2>
<p>Although ASSCO is not-for-profit, early on it realised the benefit of synergistic working - that is there must be a benefit for the organisation which hosts a run, or for a commercial railway owner, the access should be cost neutral, if not at a small profit.</p>
<p>Indeed, ASSCO members have provided a number of organisations with non-percunary benefits as a result of access.</p>

<p>Although ASSCO is currently accredited in three jurisdictions, the predominant focus of its operations are in Queensland.</p>
<p>The organisation has around 110 members.</p>
