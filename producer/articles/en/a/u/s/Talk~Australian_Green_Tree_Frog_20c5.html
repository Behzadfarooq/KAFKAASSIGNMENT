<p>The life span in captivity is specifically mentioned, is the lifespan in the wild known? Since they are referred to as long lived in the conservation status, it'd be good to have the figure.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 03:20, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Basically all I can find on it, is statements like this: "life span in the wild is much shorter due to heavy predation" (<a href="http://allaboutfrogs.org/info/species/whites.html" class="external text" title="http://allaboutfrogs.org/info/species/whites.html" rel="nofollow">source</a>). However, I don't trust this, as there is no actual research cited, and I think it would be nearly impossible to figure out their avergae life span in the wild. I wouldn't mind adding "the <b>average</b> life span in the wild is shorter, due to predation" as that statement is safer. As 1) if predation is the only thing that causes shorter life, then I am sure that there have been frogs that have reached an old age (and not saying average gives the impression of all frogs live shorter life) and 2) "heavy predation" is a phrase I would like to avoid. --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 03:43, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>One last query- the lead now says they live for 16 years- is there a reference for this?- If not I think it's safest to say that it <i>lives for over 10 years</i>--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 01:00, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Tony, just some discussion on your edits and suggestions.</p>
<p>1) "It has a very distinct appearance, green or brown in colour with large features"</p>
<dl>
<dd>You removed colour, which makes it seem incomplete. I will also change it to physical features.</dd>
</dl>
<p>2) Suggestion: <font color="red">in comparison with most other frogs in captivity or in the wild? The comparison is unclear. 'throughout the world' appears a few seconds later as well.</font></p>
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't even mention in the wild, so why would that be an option of ambiguity. Would you rather "globally" than "throughout the world"?</dd>
</dl>
<p>3)Suggestion: <font color="red">So ... Victoria does or doesn't have winters that are too cold for it? Unclear.</font></p>
<dl>
<dd>Somebody changed this to "Occasionaly it is found in Victoria", it should have said that it is found in northern Victoria.</dd>
</dl>
<p>4) You started one of the paragraphs with "because", and I have always been taught that it is bad style to start a sentence, let alone a paragraph, with because. I really don't like that change.</p>
<p>5) This seems to be something you had a problem with. The repetitions found in the article, were all from the intro. I am not completely aware of the writing style of Wikipedia yet, but with most articles (non-wikipedian) the intro introduces the basic ideas in the article. The rest of the article must expand upon these ideas, which requires the restatment of them. I will give you an example. In the second paragraph of taxonomy, you deleted the leading sentence: "The species has been introduced to both the United States and New Zealand." This section was stated in the intro, but has to be repeated for the readers who are only interested in that section (and therefore skip the lead section). If you remove it, the entire paragraph is not introduced properly and results in fragmentation. "The species has been introduced to two regions in Florida, in the US, possibly through the pet trade." You have basically repeated what you omited from the lead sentence, but placed it within the sentences already there. There is no reason for this, and it just makes it a lot harder to read. The same goes with your other intro repetition changes.</p>
<p>Thanks for your other edits and suggestions.</p>

<dd>Thanks ALoan, I have always had trouble with the lead section. I tried to have as little repetetion, by keeping out specifics. However during the peer review, the changes made by people suggested that they like some specifics in the lead. E.g. I had originally said "large frog", which was later elaborated on, by adding "up to 100mm". --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 03:00, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>'Colour' seems redundant after green or brown; much better removed. 'Physical features' is <i>still</i> unclear; do you mean cancerous tumours, or what? I'm unsure what was wrong with the changes to the NZ/US sentence, which appeared to be much improved, but has now returned to repetitiveness. There's no need to deal with both countries in the opening sentence—that forces you to add more words. Why not deal with one at a time? <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 23:41, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is good for the paragraph to have an opening sentence, so as to set the subject of the paragraph. It should flow, from the basics of that subject into the specifics. Your suggestion goes straight into the specifics, making it flow much less. I cannot see the repetition, unless you are talking about the intro (see above).

<dd>Yes, your paragraph opening is better, liquidGhoul, don't change it. Since the paragraph is about the US and NZ, its <i>topic sentence</i> (=first sentence) does need to mention both, even at the expence of using a (very) few more words. It would be confusing to have the topic sentence imply that only half the topic (=the US) will be dealt with. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 06:38, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>NZ/US thing is OK, I guess. In 'Ecology', common nouns, such as 'toilet', 'summer', 'sink', and 'dog' have been delinked—turns it into a dictionary. High-value links are welcome, but the higher the density of links, the harder it is to read, the less attractive on the page, and the less likely readers are to hit the focused ones.

<p>Can someone fix this sentence, I have tried but cannot get anywhere. The problem is with the second section, it is far too fragmented.</p>

<p>I avoided the implication that the frogs are uncertain. If you're unhappy with the number of commas (I think they're ok), try:</p>

<p>Some questions that I had while reading the article.</p>
<p>What's a downpipe?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know a synonym for it (maybe there is an American word for it), but I can describe it. It is the pipe that leads from the gutter to the tank. --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 04:01, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That'll do it. We call it a downspout (and ours usually don't lead to tanks, but instead to drains or paved areas from which water can run off). Wikipedia is extremely poor in this area, and I'd do some work on it if I knew anything.</dd>

<dd>I put in a link—hope I got it right. Possibly "<a href="../../../c/i/s/Cistern.html#Rain_barrel" title="Cistern">rain barrel</a>" is closer. I didn't want to make such a big change at this point, but you might consider saying in the opening summary just that the frog is often seen and heard around houses, and saving the downpipes and windows and stuff for the more complete section later.

<p>How does the color depend on the temperature of the environment?</p>

<p>I tried to reorder the paragraph about diet, but decided I couldn't because I don't know whether there's any connection between the WTF's unusual methods of catching prey and the unusual size of its prey. Is there? If so, it probably needs to be explained. If not, the two topics probably shouldn't be in the same sentence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, there is. If the prey is too large for the frog to use its tongue, then it will capture it by pouncing. I have changed it to say that. Thanks for pointing it out. --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 04:01, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's much better, but do you want to add that the WTF eats prey that are bigger in comparison to its size than other frogs, which the previous version implied? (Or would that be true? I had the impression that other frogs ate with their hands too.)</dd>

<dd>No, I think it was just worded wrong before. The prey must be about the size of its head to eat it (the basic rule for all frogs).

<p>I think it's misleading to say that WTF change color to match the environment. this is a misconception commonly held about color-changing organisms. more accurately, the color changes according to temperature (as the article says) and mood. I don't think a WTF would, say, turn brown to match a brown log. It would turn brown because it was cold, or frightened. I'm not sure about this though. Don't have any sources. ---a reader</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would say that temperature has more of an effect on the colour, than does the colour of the surrounding environment. However, you will find that some frogs never go green because of their location. It is not instant, in that they will turn brown on a log, however, they will be brown, if they are constantly in a brown environment. This is something I am interested in, and am continuing my research on it. I would like to find scientific papers on it, as all I have found so far is "pet care" type articles. --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 02:54, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No it shouldn't. First of all, I am the one who created the article, and I am the one who changed it back to capitals. Secondly, the "original" title was "White's Tree Frog", it was first changed by Neutrality to "White's tree frog" when I asked him to do a copy edit of the article, and I changed it back to the original name later down the track when I found that both were acceptable.

<dd>In all the Australian frog books I own this species is plain and simply refered to as the Green tree Frog, however the texts that I own that refer to the species as the whites tree frog are all american published (probably refering to it as whites tree frog in order to avoid confusion with the american green tree frog). I believe the Australian Green Tree Frog would be a better name for the article because it is an Australian species and almost all australian authors would refer to this species as the green tree frog. Also the majority of Australian people in generaly would refer to this species as the Green Tree Frog not the Whites Tree Frog. However I dont really mind what the articles is called, because I mostly use scientific names when talking about frogs (as common names get confusining when there is more than 1 name-like for this species).--<a href="../../../t/n/a/User%7ETnarg_12345_636b.html" title="User:Tnarg 12345">Tnarg 12345</a> 09:57, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You mention that there are both blue and green pigments, and a yellow layer. Is there a reference for this is?</p>
<p>My understanding was that there is a yellow pigment, over a skin layer that refracted the light and made it appear blue (similar to Rayleigh light scattering that makes the sky look blue). When the frogs were preserved in alcohol (ethanol) the yellow pigment dissolved leaving a blue frog. If you've ever put a green Litoria frog into alcohol the alcohol turns yellow within a few weeks.

<p>The reference for the info you referenced is a TFH book, so I'm even more sceptical now. I'll track down the TFH book, and also see what I can find in a decent text.</p>
<p>The webarticle you referenced for the pigment info contains several glaring errors (which you largely left alone), notably about behaviour. It must be noted that GTF's are widespread, and it's possible the Northern and South-eastern Australian populations are different subspecies, as they can be distinguished by skin peptides (reference available). They also have different coloured thigh flashes.</p>
<p>If you're interested and time permits I'd like to discuss several points in your article, but give me some time to find references to support any changes.</p>
