<p>Have removed "and <i>freeway</i> is the most common word for a high-speed, grade-separated road, though <i>motorway</i> is also sometimes used, particularly for toll roads (although tollway is also used)." As far as I'm aware 'freeway' is never used, and is, in fact, and example of the dreaded creeping Americanisms (if ever uttered at all). They're <i>highways</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What the hell are you talking about. The word "freeway" is definitely used, at least in Victoria anyway. It is used in the Melways &amp; UBD street directories, used on street signs, and are always referred to when uttered. The word "motorway" is hardly ever used, especially in Victoria with "freeway" the preferred word. The word "highway" is used for large main roads, not freeway type roads. I'm going to reinsert it. <i>Also <b>please</b> sign your name</i>. Mark 02:28, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The anonymous writer might be from NSW, where they can't handle paying a toll on a <b>free</b>way, so renamed them to motorways.

<dd>Highway's, Freeways and motorways are considered to be 3 distinctly different roads in Queensland. We have the gateway motorway (a 4 lane road designed to get you from one side of the city to the other), The Bruce Highway, another 4 lane rd though this one will take you for 1700Kms or so and then there's the South East Freeway. A 6 lane 'Freeway' designed to carry large amounts of traffic from the city centre to the outskirts. It also connects with the Pacific Highway.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is certainly no basis for a claim that Freeway is the most commonly used term in my experience.</p>
<p>This should be easy to solve. The terms highway, freeway and motorway are not interchangable. They are provided in the name of the road by the relevant authorities. Shouldn't be difficult to count the number of highways, freeways and motorways in Australia. Beats relying on your anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>Sorry freeway people. You're going to struggle to justify your stance here. Almost all major high speed roads in Australia are called Highways. Do a search and count the number of freeways you find in comparison to highways.</p>

<dd>Just found our very own wikipedia article on the subject <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_highways.html" title="Australian highways">Australian_highways</a>. If you can find a list of freeways that outnumbers this list of highways in Australia I will hapily eat my hat.</dd>

<dd>Here is the list of freeways <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_freeways_in_Australia_bd02.html" title="List of freeways in Australia">List_of_freeways_in_Australia</a>, many of which are made up of roads that include the words 'Motorway' or Highway in their names and not the word 'Freeway' which seems to be defined here as a road with a toll.
<dl>
<dd>Wouldn't a <i>free</i>way, by definition, be a road <i>without</i> a toll?&#160;;-) To me a highway is a more generic term which can include everything from major roads in the country to inner city roads with traffic lights every block. (It does here in WA anyway.) Whereas I would consider a freeway to be a high speeed multi-lane road without any traffic lights. There are no motorways in WA. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 16:51, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me that the whole problem here is that there are multiple definitions of "freeway", "highway" etc. current in different parts of Australia, and Australians from the various regions don't really seem to realise that. I presume that the person who added the original statement used a definition of "freeway" along the lines of major, high-speed (100 km/h +), divided road; whereas the definition of "highway" was major, mid-to-high speed (80 km/h +, faster in the country), not necessarily divided and almost never grade-separated. By this definition, "freeway" certainly seems to be the most common name for that sort of major road (and it contrasts with the "motorways" and "expressways" you find in Sydney). Presumably to other Australians, there is no such distinction (and they don't realise a lot of people only know of such a distinction). Thus, any uses of the word "highway" need to show not only that they're highways, but that they are used for I (and others who make the distinction) would call a "freeway". —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> <span class="usertalk">(<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECassowary_89f2.html" title="User talk:Cassowary"><span title="Ae hI: ja" class="IPA">ɑe hɪː jɐ</span></a>)</span> 03:42, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Based on wikipedia articles <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeway.html" title="Freeway">freeway</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorway.html" title="Motorway">motorway</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway.html" title="Highway">highway</a> I have confirmed that my understanding of what these terms mean is correct. Overall it should be noted that freeway and motorway are two different words for the same thing, but a highway is something different. When these terms are used or applied in Aust the original meanings are completely retained. Though there are few freeways outside Vic and NSW, it seems <i>freeway</i> is the prefered term in Vic, and <i>motorway</i> the term in NSW. Both words mean the same thing. Freeway is the US word, Motorway the UK word. I don't know why people have brought highway into the discussion though because that was never mentioned by the article, and highways are different things from freeway/motorway. One locality may have both highways and freeways. It is very frustrating having to read these arguments. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinorEdit_0301.html" title="User:MinorEdit">MinorEdit</a> 12:52, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ever driven down the Hume Highway or the Bruce Highway between Brisbane and Caboolture? These both fit the description you offer for Freeway/Motorway. I bet there are more examples of highways fitting the description than freeways.
<dl>
<dd>As I said above, highway seems to be a more <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generic.html" title="Generic">generic</a> term. That is, <i>some</i> roads which are called "_____ Highway" could also be called freeways/motorways. But not all of them. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 14:11, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have certainly driven on the Hume Hwy. I have also driven on the Hume Fwy. The bits of it that are named "Hume Hwy" are very definitely highways according to my definition, and not freeways. The bits of it that are called "Hume Fwy" are very definitely freeways according to my definition, and not highways. (Applies only to the road in Victoria.)</p>
<p>The Hume Hwy also has the additional distinction that because it's such an important road that started out its life as the Hume Hwy and has been upgraded progressively to the Hume Fwy, the road, taken as a whole, is generally called "the Hume Hwy". That's a particular instance that applies to <i>that road</i> and not to <i>freeways in general</i>. Similar things could be said about the Princes Hwy, though not (say) the Calder Hwy/Fwy (out to Bendigo) or the Western Hwy/Fwy (out to Ballarat) because it's not as culturally important, and when you do "Calder" is more than clear enough. Nevertheless, both the official name of the road when it's a freeway, and the common name for the sort of road it is when the Hume/Princes F/Hwys are freeways, is "freeway".</p>

<dd>There are plenty of highways in WA but none of them, or any part of them, is ever called a freeway. (The reverse was true of the southern end of the <a href="../../../k/w/i/Kwinana_Freeway_9d52.html" title="Kwinana Freeway">Kwinana Freeway</a> between the mid-1990s and 2002, as it was interrupted by traffic lights at several intersections.) Anyway, my point is that freeway/motorway are much more specific terms and are generally interchangeable. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 09:35, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yesyes, certainly I agree with you. I was replying to your parent-poster; I was meaning to be a sibling to you. (But I don't like having two different responses at the same indent level immediately after another, so I changed it by going back to zero. That's usually what it means if I go back to zero. Perhaps this is confusing and/or nonstandard.)

<p>Note that it's an overstatement to say that the diminutives/abbreviatives are unique to Australian English. Although the -o ending hasn't been much used outside the upper classes in Britain since the 1940s (aggro is the only common exception that I can think of offhand), the -ie diminutive is widely used in Northern English and Scottish dialects (including terms like biccie, etc.) and the <i>-za</i> or rather <i>-zer</i> endings are also used although they form a subclass of the <i>-er</i> ending (Bazzer, rugger, etc.). It would be fair to say that these endings are more commonly used in Australian English rather than that they are unique to it. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></p>

<dd>Yeah. There are plenty of <i>-ie</i> endings in UK and US speech (<i>undies, hottie, panties, bookie, Trekkie</i>...) and <i>-o</i> endings as well (<i>aggro</i> in the UK). Some of the US <i>-o</i> endings are distinctly American and not used too often in Aust (<i>wino</i>, <i>sicko</i>). Many others are universal such as <i>wierdo</i>. True that Aust as a unique set of diminutives though. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinorEdit_0301.html" title="User:MinorEdit">MinorEdit</a> 03:59, Jun 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not sure how much personal experience counts, but I've heard that sort of thing used (by teens/YAs) and used it myself (Aged 20). I'm not sure how much it's an Australians-Mocking-Aussie-Slang thing, it could easily be the product of someone not being able to come up with a metaphor in time to finish the sentence. From my own knowledge (Urban, General Australian English), use of phrases like 'built like a brick shithouse' while not all that common is still pretty acceptable - nay funny (when creative), espically in an ironic way. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolanyist_c24b.html" title="User:Polanyist">Polanyist</a></p>

<dd>I'd agree with that; I'm of that generation (I'm 22), and if someone tried to say "slow as something that's really slow", I'd probably have to struggle not to laugh. I see it as wordplay: a good simile is funny and true at the same time, and shows a bit of wit.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Name of Australian English</span></h2>
<p>The name used by linguists (and educators) to refer to the mainstream English spoken in Australia is Standard Australian English, abbreviated as SAE.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Stressing long vowels</span></h2>
<p><i>The Australian English accent stresses a long "ay" sound, whereas the New Zealand English stresses a long "i" sound.</i></p>
<p>Surely such wishy-washy terms as <i>long "ay" sound</i> and <i>long "i" sound</i> have no place in an encyclopædia for grown-ups. What really is a <i>long "i" sound</i> anyway: the first vowel in <i>lighter</i> or the vowel in <i>litre</i>? For that matter, there is a word <i>ay</i> (also spelt <i>aye</i>) meaning<i>yes</i> and homophonous with <i>eye</i> and<i>I</i>. Instead, what should be used is an IPA based phonemic transcription.</p>
<p>In linguistic lingo the term "stress" has a particular meaning. In NZE as in AusE primary stress falls on the first vowel in both <i>ligher</i> and <i>later</i>. It can't be stress that the writer was refering to (unless the writer was just plian wrong). Maybe it's some other kind of emphasis but something tells me "No". Worse than being poorly written, I have my doubts as to whether there is any truth in this statement.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Concerning the current Edit War</span></h2>
<p>Dear anonymous Contributor:</p>
<p>As established on this Page, the corresponding Article and others throughout the World at large, there is a Distinction in Australian English between the Phonemes /æ/ and /æ:/. One cannot derive a Set of Rules based only the phonetic Environments in which the Sounds occur to determine whether [æ] or [æ:] will occur, and words with a merged Phoneme that also have the same Coda (such as Lad and bad) do not necessarily rhyme. Worse still, minimal Pairs exist (generally spelt the same). For these Reasons, you cannot accept that [æ] and [æ:] are Allophones in Australian English unless you wish to redefine ‘Allophone’, which is inappropriate for an Encyclopedia. What holds for other Varieties of English does not necessarily hold for all Varieties: Nor is the Maquarie Dictionary a good Source for Information conecrning Australian Phonetics.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some Words which vary between broad and flat A's (such as <i>Castle</i>) use short flat A's when flat; whereas others (such as <i>dance</i>) use long flat A's. This is of course important and not entirely intuitive, particularly for Speakers of Philidelphian English. These People similarly have two flat A's, though one is tense and the other lax (due to Differences between our System and theirs), and normally a Philly Tense-æ that does not correspond to an Aussie Broad-a corresponds to an Aussie /æ:/; however, in these Case, it does not. (This may not be a concern of any Philidelphian Speakers.)</p>
<p>Lastly, as there's two Phonemes /æ/ and /æ:/, it is incorrect to say that those Speakers who do not use /a:/ in <i>dance</i> or <i>France</i> use /æ/: Quite plainly they do not, if they use /æ:/.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problem sentence</span></h2>
<p>I find the following sentence problematic: "Aside from this the Australian vowel system is quite different from that of other dialects."</p>
<p>Which other dialects are those? The sentence seems to imply that all other (English Language?) dialects are all the same as one another and that it is just Australian that is different. This is clearly not the case - something that seems quite clear when the range of accents from Boston to Brummie to Cockney to Somerset is considered. Is the sentence trying to say "Different from <a href="../../../r/e/c/Received_Pronunciation_c480.html" title="Received Pronunciation">RP</a>" or should it be totally deleted? <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinorEdit_0301.html" title="User:MinorEdit">MinorEdit</a> 06:22, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suspect the next sentence is (part of) the key to decoding it (at least if you read it your way). I also disagree with your reading, I read it as saying it's disimilar to others rather than that all others are a similar point to measure from. I would suspect it was added because Australians don't like being lumped in with Brits by Americans&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you read it your way though, it's still not unreasonable. Read the next sentence—most other Englishes are described as having tense and lax vowels, but in Australian English most tense:lax oppositions have been replaced with a long:short or diphthong:pure opposition. No-one in their right mind would say that there's a link between AuE /e/ and /æi/ the same way there's a link between AmE /E/ and /e/. The sounds are radically different. Hence, the logical partner of \E\ /e/ is \AIR\ /e:/; of \lAd\ /æ/ is \bAd\ /æ:/; of \UH\ /a/ is \AH\ /a:/, whereas \AI\ /æi/, \Y\ /Ai/, \OH\ /@ʉ/ have no logical partners (except via orthography and history). Possibly this statement is untrue, I understand some varieties of British English (though typically still spelt phonemically as early or mid 20th C RP or RP-alike) form similar pairs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In either case, it's clearly ambiguous and should be rewritten. I would like some comments on my two ideas before I make an attempt.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The opening</span></h2>
<p>In my view, the opening needs to be recast. It should more smoothly paint the big picture; specific examples should be relocated to other sections.</p>
<p>It should mention that AusEng has distinctive features in both oral and written modes. It might mention the influence of indigenous languages, particularly on place names, as a cultural courtesy as much as for other reasons. It should definitely classify AusEng as non-rhotic: that's a very basic feature.</p>

<p>What influence has Aboriginal English had on Australian English? Coo-ee and what else? (almost) Everything else is a feature of World English. Wagga Wagga isn't called Princeville in America, and kangaroos aren't called Australian Giant Rabbits in Britain. Other than that, I agree.</p>
<p>(As for non-rhoticness, it occurs to me I have come across a handful of rhotic Aussies. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to why they speak rhotically (i.e. no regional nor social variation), and it's not the kind of rhoticness you associate with American English where the the following /r/ tends to bleed into the vowel, but rather stressed vowels which have a written &lt;r&gt; sometimes or always get a /r/ put after them. They may also put the /r/ in unstressed vowels, in which case it tends to be [@r\], not [r\=] like in American. I don't know if it's a personal affectation or if it's that one parent or another spoke rhotically but they developed Aussie vowels in school or what. These are, however, merely personal observations and don't constitution grounds for objection to mentoining AusE as non-rhotic, because it overwhelmingly is and you can't understand it's phonology without understanding that.)</p>

<dd>I know an Australian guy who has an unnaturally American pronunciation. He has never been to America, but he was not very well socialised as a child and probably picked up the accent from TV and a special education computer program. When I questioned him, about whether he normally says "fast" as /fa:st/ or /fæ:st/ he told me /fa:st/, but about thirty seconds later, speaking naturally he pronounced it /fæ:st/. He also speaks rhotically. I was also wondering if I'm the only one who naturally and unconsciously adopts an American accent when saying something intentionally stupid... sorry Americans, this is not my view of ALL of you... just the ones that voted for Bush. (Sorry, I don't know how to put in the phonetic "length" symbol, so I figured a colon is close enough. If it bothers anyone, they can change it.) - Ben from Brisbane</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I think a lot of people adopt an Americanised accent when saying something stupid, and quite often when quoting people. But it's not true to say it's an <i>American</i> accent, because it's still fundamentally Australian, I think. Things like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/fæːst/</span> (retaining the length of Australian <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/faːst/</span>, but using a fronted quality) whereas Americans say <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[fæst]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[fɛəst]</span> (if they don't rhyme ‘mass’ and ‘class’). I think the same thing also happens when most/many people say ‘ass’ instead of ‘arse’, as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/æːs/</span> so that it’s different from ‘ass’ meaning donkey, as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/æs/</span>.</dd>

<li>regarding the quotation marks around ‘American’—they either are American, or they aren’t. If they are, then the quotation marks are redundant. If they aren’t, then a more appropriate word/expression should be sought.</li>
<li>regarding ‘and so forth’—that expression is redundant with the initial ‘such as’. You don’t need to say it twice; it simply reads badly. This doesn’t even change the meaning, so I’m not sure what your problem with it is in even the remotest way.</li>

<dd>There's little that can be done about anonymous users without a static IP number who edit in bad faith, use deceptive edit summaries, etc. So I agree with AxSkov that we need to keep a light-hearted attitude about wikipedia: maximise fun, minimise stress. That said, I strongly disagree with the use of the term "confused" when referring to Australian spellings. I did rewrite the paragraph to avoid making a judgement either way, and kept it to a simple observation (see below). Naturally it was quickly reverted&#160;:P. I think the sentence "exposure to American and British spellings has led to..." is unnecessary. I grew up in Australia with exposure to different styles of writing and spelling; it wasn't American or British, but a variety of <i>Australian</i> spellings — which had been in use for a century. And it didn't confuse me or my peers! It's like saying Australians "confuse" the terms "license plate" (US) and "number plate" (UK), when we simply use both. For the record, here's my suggested wording:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In general, Australian convention allows for both British and American spelling of words such as organise/organize and colour/color. British spelling is generally preferred, although some words are usually written in the "American" form, such as 'program' and 'jail'. Publishers, schools, universities and governments typically use the Macquarie Dictionary as a standard spelling reference. Both -ise and -ize are accepted, as in British English, but '-ise' is the preferred form in Australian English by a ratio of about 3:1 according to the Austrailan Corpus of English.</i></dd>

<dd>The <a href="http://khnt.hit.uib.no/icame/manuals/ace/INDEX.HTM" class="external text" title="http://khnt.hit.uib.no/icame/manuals/ace/INDEX.HTM" rel="nofollow">A.C.E.</a> is a database of Australian English texts containing over 1 million words, collected and maintained by the linguistics department at <a href="http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/centres/sc/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/centres/sc/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Macquarie Uni</a>. It is the primary resource for the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corpus_linguistics.html" title="Corpus linguistics">corpus linguistics</a> of Australian English, similar to the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_Corpus_aa0e.html" title="Brown Corpus">Brown Corpus</a> of American English. It is actually very relevant to this page! I wasn't the one who put the ref there, and I don't know about the 3:1 ratio, but it seems reasonable. <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 04:55, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was the one who added the ACE reference to this page, because I thought it made some sense, but I guess I should have done some research regarding it. I got that reference from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_English_14ee.html" title="Commonwealth English">Commonwealth English</a>, where it was added by another user – <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a>, who has since left Wikipedia – and I'm not sure where he got the information from. This is his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_English&amp;diff=8270192&amp;oldid=8170180" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_English&amp;diff=8270192&amp;oldid=8170180" rel="nofollow">edit</a> regarding the reference.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps ACE deserves a page of its own and then linked to the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a> page? – <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">AxSkov</a> (<big><a href="../../../a/x/s/User_talk%7EAxSkov_04ac.html" title="User talk:AxSkov">☏</a></big>) <small>04:16, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>
