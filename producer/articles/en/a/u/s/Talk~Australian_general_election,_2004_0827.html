<p>Basically, this is an excellent piece of writing. It was written from a highly accomplished author, <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam Carr</a>, and is quite NPOV. It also is quite an excellent overview of the 2004 Australian Federal election. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 11:36, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Support. I'd been planning to nominate this myself. It was just about feature-worthy before the election, and has been just about completely rewritten since. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 11:42, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Support. I'm from Australia and followed the elction fairly closely. It looks good <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychobabble_be56.html" title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a></li>
<li>Object. Current event status is a serious hinderance to featured article status in my mind. The results won't be final until around 31 October, plus a week or so to resolve lingering POV, pictures, analysis, grammer etc. Excellent candidate for feature article after 7 November. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 23:35, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<li>See my response to Aaronhill's comment below. Secondly, if there are problems with lingering POV, pictures, analysis and grammar, where are they? For the objection to be actionable, we need some pointers to where these may indeed be. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:33, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>Slightly object</s> Conditional support for much the same reason as Fifelfoo. To quote: "Current event status is a serious hinderance to featured article status in my mind". The article is still using the provisional results and the dust has still not yet settled on the election. It, after all, was last Saturday and there are still seats in doubt. Predicting the Senate results for sure is still difficult. I guess this is a "yes, but not just yet". This is not to say that the work is not quality, because it is probably one of the best articles available on the election on the entire internet, but it is just not appropriate for featured status just yet. (I guess this would be a partial self-objection&#160;:-D) - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 08:22, Oct 15, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>IMO, this shouldn't be a problem. There's very few undecided seats at the moment - it's down to about four in each house, and those are being updated practically daily with the latest details. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:33, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do not believe the article is POV or that it has problems with pictures or grammar, I do however think that it is necessary to wait until after the dust has settled on this still current event (the makeup of the senate is still far from certain) for it to be featured on the front page. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 10:57, Oct 15, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then don't feature it on the main page for at least two weeks, but don't oppose its nomination either. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 11:07, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On that condition, I strongly support the nomination of this article. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 12:07, Oct 15, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Object: the lead section is far too long and detailed, and, again, the actual references used need to be stated explicitly. I am also concerned about the provisional nature of the article as it stands. I know no article is never finished, but this is about an event in progress and so is even less finished than the average FA. Probably nominated two weeks too soon. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> 11:14, Oct 15, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have inserted a header to make the intro section shorter. I don't follow this suggestion that the article needs more "references." References to what? The article has been mostly written by Australians who have all been close observers of, or (as in my case) participants in, the election process. It is not based on secondary sources and therefore doesn't need references. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:46, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So we just reference the AEC and ABC sites a few times, I don't think referencing is really that bigger deal, it just makes the people who don't live in Australia feel warm and fuzzy inside knowing that we aren't inept hacks. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 07:22, Oct 25, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It'd probably be good to reference a few more news articles and opinion pieces. Either that or get rid of the section entirely, it does look kinda flimsy at the moment. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychobabble_be56.html" title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a>
<dl>
<dd>It should be easy enough to solve this by slipping in links to a few statistics pages (be they from the ABC, AEC, or Adam's site), where we've made (obvious) conclusions based on those statistics. It might also be nice to add the first paragraph that's now under the "overall result" heading back as part of the lead section, to counter the (likely) objection that the LS is too short. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 13:00, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, the lead paragraph should definately state the results, the swing to the Coalition and the significance of it controlling both houses, if it does so in the end.<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychobabble_be56.html" title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a></dd>

<dd>It doesn't need to be long but I reckon it should give the important information on the election to someone who isn't familiar with it. Ie, seats won, what the election said about the population's support for the incumbent govt (ie swing) and the potential action the government will take with its 2-house majority (if it gets it). <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychobabble_be56.html" title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a></dd>

<p>I notice that <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychobabble_be56.html" title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a> has just reinserted the prediction that the coalition is likely to hold 39 seats. I thought the 39th seat (in Queensland) was still very much up for grabs. It was the last time I heard, anyway. Has anything changed, or am I missing something? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 10:23, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It hasn't. Barnaby Joyce has slipped ahead again in counting, after falling behind late last week, so he's still the favourite to win the seat. But there's every chance that Drew Hutton could come back - and there's still every chance that regardless of who wins, the result could be disputed in the High Court. We won't really know until Wednesday. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:47, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Yesterday's Age had an article strongly predicting a National win. I was going to reference it on the page but the article is pword protected <a href="http://theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/24/1098556293432.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/24/1098556293432.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (dailykos/dailykos works). PS. What's with the HC challenge?
<dl>
<dd>Greens allege irregularities. Nationals also threatening to allege irregularities if they lose. For the current status of things, see <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/25/1098667690058.html" class="external text" title="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/25/1098667690058.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a>. It still seems a little too close to call, though Joyce remains the favourite. Another thing of note in that article is it looks like the Democrats are headed for another leadership challenge. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 00:14, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That article didn't have anything about irregularities or court challenges, maybe you linked the wrong one. As for the Democrats, I know the leader of the young Democrats in Victoria and he reckons the party will go into liquidation soon, it's got massive debts and no real prospect of recovery. That's just his opinion though. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychobabble_be56.html" title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a>

<p>If Joyce loses he will have very good grounds for complaint, since the AEC deprived hundreds (at least) of farm families of their votes by screwing up the postal vote delivery, which clearly disadvanted the Nats.

<p>Does anyone else find the following</p>
<p><i>The National and Liberal Parties won the fifth and sixth seats respectively in Queensland, thus giving the Coalition 39 seats and outright control of the Senate. Labor won the final seats in New South Wales and South Australia, giving it 28 seats. The Greens won the final seats in Western Australia and Tasmania.</i></p>
<p>confusing? If someone isn't paying attention, could someone think that the Coalition won every seat in Queensland? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 02:20, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, this is confusing. The reference is to Senate seats only and should clearly state that - or a have a subheading to that effect <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 04:57, 28 December 2005 (UTC).</dd>

<p><i>The Democrats in turn did a preference deal with the Family First Party, despite the great ideological differences between the two parties.</i></p>
<p>Apart from VSU, and religious issues (abortion, gay marriage, etc), it could be argued the two parties are not that different. They're pro-reconciliation, ambivalent about IR changes, opposed the Iraq war but supported subsequent peacekeeping. I guess people thought FF would be a proxy for the Coalition, but they've since opposed a lot of their legislation. Maybe it should be re-worded to say that some people viewed the deal as a cynical deal, especially if any notable politicians denounced it thus. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 02:39, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. I think Howard has been taking votes of the "ALP core" as more "workers" prosper, own homes and have mortgages - hence the interest rates &amp; economic credibility scare run by the Coalition. Some of the "Liberal core" is undoubtedly going elsewhere (to Greens &amp; ALP) as per "doctors wives" and general discontent about Howard's lack of substantive action on environment/climate change etc AND on treatment of asylum seekers. Howard successfully stopped some of this drifting vote by running the "extreme kooky greens" scare campaign. For every action there is a reaction. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 02:21, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The list of preferences for the senate were available from the AEC website weeks before the election and should have been available at all polling places. It was not something that was hidden. If people wanted to know where their preference went, they could have easily checked. Thus, it is assumed that people voted for who they wanted to be elected, and in the order of preference that they wanted that person elected. Why else would 5% or over 500,000 people make the effort of filling in all 100 (+/-) boxes. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 12:12, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps the point that needs to be made, rather than saying that people didn't know where their vote went, is the difficulty in tracking where your vote goes under the system. I remember Antony Green saying once that he was unable to predict where a particular vote would go before the election, and in large states it can be nigh on impossible to fully understand what those sheets say.

<dd>Not only it user-friendly, but it's hardly surprising that most people don't check.

People check the box of the party they like, and assume that that party is going to preference according to the policies of that party - this is precisely why Labor's decision was controversial. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 13:57, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. There was very little media attention on the ALP &amp; Democrat deals with FF prior to them getting up in Victoria. Antony Green predicted it, but there was very little coverage or discussion on this topic. Very few ALP voters knew that their Senate preferences were going to FF - as evidenced by the backlash after it became clear that this was what happened - eventually causing the resignation of the Vic State Secretary (Erik Locke), who fell in his sword over this issue - as reported by Crikey. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 05:32, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please don't assume things. Although I, like most people, have political beliefs, I am not politically affiliated at all. Joyce didn't even win the last seat, so I don't see how he, alone, one out of 39 Coalition Senators, can deliver a majority. The site to which you have linked does not say that Joyce caused the Coalition control of the Senate. The heading is "NATIONALS DELIVER CONTROL OF THE SENATE" and in the text: "I am delighted that The Nationals, in their own right, have been able to deliver control of the Senate to the Coalition". Anderson congratulates Joyce for winning the fifth seat, but he also mentions Fiona Nash. However, no mention of his giving the Coalition control of the Senate. <a href="../../../j/s/i/User%7EJSIN_5bfe.html" title="User:JSIN">JSIN</a> 06:50, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nonsense. Joyce's was the last seat undecided. If it went to Joyce, as it did, the government would have a majority. If it went to the Greens, as was the alternative, the government would not have a majority. Thus Joyce's victory did give the government a majority in the Senate. That Russell Trood was technically the last elected is irrelevant - due to the distribution of preferences, it was Joyce's backside on the line, not Trood's. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 07:45, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's rather rude to dismiss other people's contributions as "[n]onsense". Joyce's seat was not the only that relied on the distribution of preferences. And if any of the other 38 Coalition Senate seats went to any other party the Government would not have a majority. Some people might reason that it was Joyce who gained the Coalition's majority in the Senate, stating that as a fact is POV and readers should be allowed to decide for themselves.

<p>It is of course true that the Coalition controls the Senate because it holds 38 seats, and each of them is as important in that sense as any other. However what <i>gave</i> control of the Senate to the Coalition was their unexpected success in winning four seats out of six in Queensland. The question therefore is, which Senator was the unexpected winner of the fourth seat? My view is that it was not Joyce, because most commentators expected the Nationals to regain the seat they lost to One Nation in 1998. The real surprise was the Liberals winning three seats, and so it was Trood's election which gave the Coalition its majority. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 09:32, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whether winning 4 seats is unexpected is a matter of opinion. Some people may be equally surprised that the ALP won any seats at all. I guess it depends on how you define the "mainstream" for mainstream opinion. Out of curiosity, what odds did the bookies give for a 4th coalition seat in QLD? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 10:17, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>NARDA GILMORE: Nineteen days after his election victory, John Howard has another reason to celebrate.</dd>
<dd>RON BOSWELL, NATIONAL PARTY: Prime Minister, you just have control of the Senate.</dd>
<dd>NARDA GILMORE: A computer in Brisbane delivered the verdict on the deciding Senate seat and the National Party's Senate leader Ron Boswell wasted no time in letting the Prime Minister know the Coalition had won an outright majority.</dd>
<dd>RON BOSWELL: You've got it open, OK.</dd>
<dd>NARDA GILMORE: Ron Boswell insisted that didn't mean open slather, a prospect John Howard's been quick to play down.</dd>
<dd>JOHN HOWARD, PRIME MINISTER: It's a very good outcome, but I want to assure the Australian people that the Government will use its majority in the new Senate very carefully, very wisely.</dd>
<dd>CHRIS EVANS, OPPOSITION SENATE LEADER: I'm fearful the Government will abuse their power.</dd>
<dd>Power unchecked is generally power abused.</dd>
<dd>NARDA GILMORE: The deciding Senate seat in Queensland went to the National's Barnaby Joyce.</dd>
<dd>From July next year the Coalition will hold 39 seats in the Senate, Labor keeps its 28, the Greens have four, the Democrats four, and Family First one.</dd>

<dd>Joyce getting the 5th seat is not in dispute - the article clearly states this is the case. The text that was removed was "with Barnaby Joyce providing a Senate majority for the Liberal/National Coalition". So it was either Joyce's "unexpected win" of the 5th seat, or as Adam points out, perhaps Trood's "expected win" of the 6th seat. Either way, the outcome in QLD (and its timing) delivered the coalition the seats that gave them full control of the Senate. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter C</a> <small><a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_Campbell_854e.html" title="User talk:Peter Campbell">Talk!</a></small> 11:40, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just because media taking heads say something is true doesn't make it so. The expected outcome in Qld was 2 ALP, 2 Libs, 1 Nat, one other. What happened was 2 ALP, 3 Libs, 1 Nat. So the unexpected Senator was Trood, and it was the extra Lib that gave the Coalition the 38th seat. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 11:12, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Does it matter whether the psephologists underestimated the number of National seats or the number of Liberal seats? They got it wrong either way. If they all thought the coalition would only gain 3 seats as said above, then it suggests they've got a groupthink problem. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 11:31, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What was wrong with the name 'Australian Federal Election 2000'&#160;? The problem with 'Australian legislative election' is that suggests the election only involved the legislative arm (i.e.: the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Representatives_5c56.html" title="House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, not the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate.html" title="Senate">Senate</a>).

<dd>I agree that the title of the article is a bit bizarre. All elections in Australia are "legislative", there is no such thing as a non-legislative election, there is no direct election of judges or the executive. In response to Kransky, both the House of Reps and and the Senate are legislative, the reason the election affects the executive is because the numbers in the House of Reps determine who is Prime Minister, ie the winner of the election. The term "General Election" is widely used, so the full title of the article should be "Australian General Election 2004"LimitedNews 21:55, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Wikipedia convention is to class elections as either legislative or presidential. "General election" is in any case a British term not an Australian one. Strictly speaking the 2004 election was an election for the House of Reps and half the Senate. You won't get any support for changing the title. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 08:47, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
