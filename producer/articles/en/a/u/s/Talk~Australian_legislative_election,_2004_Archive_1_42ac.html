<h2><span class="mw-headline">Timing</span></h2>
<p>If the 3-year term is dated from the first sitting after the previous election, which was in March 2002, why then can the next election be delayed until as late as April 2005? Where does the extra month come from? Can anybody explain this? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 13:03, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The answer appears to be as follows:</p>
<p>Section 28 of the Constitution says: "Every House of Representatives shall continue for three years from the first sitting of the House."</p>
<p>Section 32 of the Constitution says: "The writs shall be issued within ten days from the expiry of a House of Representatives or from the proclamation of a dissolution thereof."</p>
<p>Section 156 (1) of the Electoral Act says: "the date fixed for the nomination of the candidates shall not be less than 10 days nor more than 27 days after the date of the writ."</p>
<p>Section 157 of the Electoral Act says: "The date fixed for the polling shall not be less than 23 days nor more than 31 days after the date of nomination."</p>
<p>This parliament first met on <b>12 February 2002</b>. Therefore it expires on <b>12 February 2005</b>. The writs must therefore be issued by <b>22 February</b>. The last date on which nominations can close is therefore <b>11 March</b>. The last Saturday on which polling can take place is therefore <b>9 April</b>.</p>
<p>This should probably be incorporated into the article.</p>

<p>Adam, thanks muchly for that very interesting information. However something is not right with the dates you've shown compared with the provisions you've cited. If the parliament first met on 12 Feb 2002, three years later is 12 Feb 2005. Ten days after the expiration is 22 Feb 2005. This gives us the latest possible date of the writ. So far, so good. The nomination date can be as much as 27 days after that, which is 21 March. The poll can be as much as 31 days after that, which 21 April. But that day is a Thursday, so the latest possible Saturday would be 16th April, not 9th April. Is my maths up the pole? In the words of a former celebrity, "Please explain".

<p>You are right. I miscounted the 27 days from 22 Feb. The last date on which the election can be held is 16 April. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a></p>

<p>Just as regards Bob Brown, I think there's probably a bit of a definitional issue as to what precisely constitutes the "Australian left". I'm perfectly aware that a great many people would not eg. describe Latham as left-wing. But then again, there probably are many who would.</p>
<p>I think I remember reading on the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Brown_5419.html" title="Bob Brown">Bob Brown</a> entry itself that he was described as the leader of the "anti-American left" or something like that. Now while I don't think that's great phraseology, I think it expresses that there's a particular segment of the left among which he is undeniably the most prominent member (where previously it might have been Kernot or Stott-Despoja).</p>
<p>I don't know what to do. I think it'd be legitimate to describe him as the most prominent figure in the anti-war movement, but I think that that is probably too narrow a description of his general appeal. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 00:36, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tables Mark I</span></h2>
<p>I added tables (more or less directly imported from the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2004.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2004">Candian election</a> page) to liven up the ASCII and make the data more readable. I'm not an Australian, so there may be nuances in the old version that I failed to transfer (e.g., the position of the National Party to indicate a coalition?); screw with it as much as you want. <a href="../../../j/x/g/User%7EJxg_e6de.html" title="User:Jxg">Jxg</a> 22:06, 9 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can't tell you how hideous I think these multicoloured tables are. The colours are far too strong, they make the text hard to read and they contribute no information. I hate them at the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2004.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2004">Candian election</a> page, but since I have done no work on that page I didn't feel I had any right to delete them from there. But since I have largely created this page I feel more entitled to resist their inclusion. When the election actually happens we can decide what kind of table format we want. In the meantime I am deleting them. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 04:27, 10 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't change the seat listing to tables this time, but I think we need to make a decision on what form the listing should take. Fixed-text or tables? I would tend to side with tables, but only if we can integrate more information into them. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 01:24, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Those tables do look good, though maybe the background colours could be less dominant and changed to be more suitable to the parties (consistent with the ABC News colours maybe?)... a column for party logos perhaps as well? I think <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam Carr</a> is strongly against tables and I'd like to hear from him before taking any action, especially as he is reverting any attempt to convert to tables (and considering the current state of the tables proposed, quite correctly). I also think that the tables should have a row combining the totals of the Liberal and National Parties (ala <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Australian_legislative_election%2C_2004&amp;oldid=5512038" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Australian_legislative_election%2C_2004&amp;oldid=5512038" rel="nofollow">this revision</a>) because it is the easiest way to quickly compare the total of the Coalition majority with the number of ALP seats. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 03:31, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not opposed to tables <i>per se</i>. I am opposed to these ugly pseudo-tables which Aaron has been trying to install. I also dislike the obtrusive multi-coloured tables at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2004.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2004">Canadian federal election, 2004</a>. My choice is the type of tables at <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_legislative_election%2C_2004.html" title="Spanish legislative election, 2004">Spanish legislative election, 2004</a>, which are both functional and aesthetic. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 03:59, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Woah, calm down, I haven't tried to install anything since you reverted my first and final (thus far) attempt at formulating tables and in retrospect I agree that the fixed text format is the better format <b>at the moment</b>, as I stated in my previous comment. I do agree with you about the Spanish election tables, they are quite good and I prefer the lack of colour, however we need to consider how they could be adapted to Australia's electoral system, especially the two party preferred aspect. I think that the fixed text format should be maintained for the historical seat listings. I'm going to play around with the Spanish tables and try to bring about a positive change, I'll post it here before acting of course. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 07:32, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've updated the format of two existing tables. I've left one table for now so you can decide whether it is an improvement. If you have any better ideas, you can take it further, but I think the new format is at least an improvement on the fixed-width alternative. <a href="../../../m/2E/e/User%7EM.e_04b3.html" title="User:M.e">m.e.</a> 12:22, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC) I later reformatted the Senate table the same, and also my suggestion at the end of <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a>'s tables. <a href="../../../m/2E/e/User%7EM.e_04b3.html" title="User:M.e">m.e.</a> 09:48, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>"this issue is gaining traction for the Greens in electorates with large gay and lesbian populations, such as Sydney, Grayndler and Melbourne".</p>
<p>This seems an obtuse statement to me: does this mean there are less gay people in Brisbane and Perth? Just because they hold the Mardis Gras in Sydney doesn't mean, I would say, all the gay people in Australia have moved to live there. Wouldn't the 'gay vote' be roughly the same across Australia, definitely urban areas? Feel free to shoot me down if I'm wrong, that's why I didn't edit the article&#160;:D</p>

<p>Well, if you think about it, there are larger gay communities in Sydney and Melbourne than in other areas because they're Australia's biggest cities. And since the electorates within those cities are both more numerous and smaller than elsewhere (say, Brisbane), the gay community within a small electorate will have more clout than one within a larger, more diluted electorate that covers a wider geographic area. There tend to be more gay voters within inner city suburbs than outer suburbs - in some areas, there are what are referred to as <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_village.html" title="Gay village">gay villages</a>. And Sydney in comparative terms does have quite a sizable gay population; I've heard it referred to as the city with the second largest gay population in the world (outside of San Fransisco). I have no idea if that's true, but at any rate, even if its <i>size</i> isn't so great, its organisation and community linkage are considerable, meaning that gay issues have comparatively wide prominence and influence over votes. At least, so is my understanding, anyway. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 05:30, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it is generally agreed that if there is an indentifiable gay and lesbian vote (note correct usage) in Australia it is concentrated in inner-city areas, that is in the seats of Sydney, Wentworth and Grayndler (NSW), Melbourne, Melbourne Ports and Batman (Vic), Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. Most of these are safe Labor seats so the g&amp;l vote doesn't have much influence, but Ports, Brisbane and Adelaide it may do. The Dems are running a gay candidate in Ports, and the Libs are running a lesbian in Brisbane (which takes some gall after their marriage bill stunt). The Greens will be looking for g&amp;l votes in Sydney and Melbourne, which they have hopes of winning. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:15, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just wondering why the Greens are preferencing Pauline Hanson before Family First and One Nation in Queensland? Why hasn't this been mentioned? I am sure I have heard Bob Brown call Hanson Many unpleasant things over a period of time. Are they be preferencing her over Family First because they prefer her policies, or some other reason? <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">X</a></p>
<p>This whole preference thing gets rather silly at times. You can't put all the nasty candidates last, and it makes no practical difference whether you preference someone last or second last. In Queensland it is probably a fair call that Hanson, running as an independent, is not quite as odious as One Nation or the FFP or the CEC.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Greens and Family First</span></h2>
<p>This article's tone seems very "nice" to Family First, and very downplaying toward the Greens. The Greens are now the third largest party in Australia, yet they are described in a paragraph which begins with "minor parties generally polled poorly." In that same "minor parties polled poorly" paragraph, Family First is mentioned as polling "better," despite having a swing comparable to the Greens (and a primary vote nowhere near the Greens).</p>
<p>The Senate seat Family First may have won was the result of very unusual preference deals in Victoria, yet it is mentioned twice, in very redundant tone: "may have a working majority with the support of the conservative Family First Party, which may win a Senate seat," followed soon by "The Family First Party did better, possibly winning a Senate seat." This strikes me very much as "playing up" Family First. One (yet to be confirmed via preferences) Senate seat does not warrant so many mentions; or at least, not while the Greens are so downplayed.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting, I'd imagine, that this election seems to mark the "death" of One Nation. One Nation experienced a negative swing near-exactly equal to the positive swing recieved by the Coalition. On the same "One Nation doing badly" note, Pauline Hanson's bid for Senate made no impact on the election whatsoever. The Democrats were also wiped out, but this is already mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>I'm willing to discuss edits before I make them.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reason why the tone is "nice" to Family First is probably because of excessive self-checking of the main editors' biases (which if I am correct, are mostly Labor/Green).

<p>I agree with Aaron to some exent. The editing reflects both editors (including me) taking great care not to be nasty about Family First, and the fact that although the Greens improved their position, they did not live up to expectations before the election. They may in fact only gain one Senate seat, they lost Cunningham, and they fell well short in Sydney and Melbourne. Family First, on the other hand, exceeded expectations, coming from nowhere to snatch a Senate seat (I am told by experts that this is nearly certain, thanks to the Democrats' rotten preference deal.) Once the dust has settled we can write a more balanced text. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:32, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Understood. I suppose I tend to shy from placing tone in an article based upon "expectations." The media here (QLD), for example, is already painting Family First as "surging" (despite lackluster primary votes and only one seat gained by a rubbish preference deal); all I hear of the Greens in the news is that "they didn't do as well as expected" (despite that they are now easily the third-largest party in Australia). I prefer to write based upon the numbers, and usually avoid trend-guessing unless it's clearly reflected (as with the One-Nation-to-Liberal effect, and the Democrats dive). When votes are all counted, preferences shifted, I'll come back around. Thanks for the clarification and help (both of you).</dd>

<dd>The Greens performed very well in this election in terms of primary votes in the House of Representatives, sometimes with 10% of the vote. From what I could see on my quick perusal of the AEC online tally room, it looked like their increased primary vote came mainly from former Labor supporters, while the Coalition absorbed the deflating One Nation and Democrats support base. Unusual, when you think the Democrats are closer in policy to Labor than Liberal. Either way, the Family First party do deserve a mention because they were virtually unknown to the people in the lead-up to the election. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 07:32, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In no way was I suggesting that Family First did not deserve mention. Just working to avoid a presentation of "Family First did well, and the Greens didn't do as well as expected." Both statements are true if standing alone (Family First did do well to perhaps gain a Senate seat in their debut, regardless of preference circumstances; the Greens did not reach the solid 10% they had hoped for), but paint a <i>rhetorical</i> picture which is not present. I do lean toward Labor-Democrats-Greens in the Australian scene, I won't pretend otherwise, but I'd like to think that my concerns about the post-result presentation (based upon media coverage here in QLD, again) aren't a matter of editorial bias.</p>
<p>If Family First does indeed gain that Victoria seat, it is very much "big news," assuming they cast their vote with the Coalition (which so far as right-left goes, they most likely would). The article already covers this, and rightfully should.</p>
<p>I'm very satisfied with the edits/additions that've been made since my initial comment, though. So long as the article is not written in a manner that unjustly downplays (or "up-plays," as well) what's happened to any of the third party results. And again, the dust hasn't settled yet. Can't say as I have much else to add until all votes are in (and preferences set in stone). <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShem_Daimwood_ae70.html" title="User:Shem Daimwood">Shem</a> 08:09, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bush Victory</span></h2>
<p>It seems to me that this is a poltical victory for George W. Bush - He's retained a faithful ally for Iraq, and Australians have rejected the message of John Kerry's sister.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Kerry has a sister?! I think you misunderstand how little most Australians care about American politics. We can barely raise enough interest in our own elections! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 05:18, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article already mentions John Howard's apparent vindication of involvement in Iraq. I see no reason to suggest that it is a "victory" for George W. Bush or John Kerry, as both supported Howard over Mark Latham. Regardless of who wins the U.S. election, they'll have to clean up a mess in Iraq. John Kerry needs a cooperative partner in Iraq just as much as President Bush, hence why he stated opposition to Mark Latham's plans to withdraw troops. -Shem 203.214.148.234 08:37, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whilst it could be played in the US as a win for Bush; Iraq or even the FTA that appears to have come about as our "reward" for support, didn't seem to play any role in the election at all. Maybe something should go into the US election article about how the result could be spun to be supporting of Bush, I don't believe anything should go into this article unless the spin is used.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteven_jones_881c.html" title="User:Steven jones">Steven jones</a> 02:20, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Iraq was hardly mentioned as an issue once the campaign began. But the damage to Latham was done back in March with his off-the-cuff "out by Xmas" comments to Mike Carlton. That produced an immediate dip in the polls and he never recovered his earlier standing, not so much because of the issue itself but because of the impression it gave of policy-on-the-run. But it was economic issues that cost Labor the election. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 04:40, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll add my voice to the chorus, Iraq was a non-issue in the election. I've seen a number of right wing blogs spin the election as something of a referendum on Bush's war but that couldn't be further from the truth. It was a remarkably (perhaps sadly) domestic-based election. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychobabble_be56.html" title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Mackerras_e663.html" title="Malcolm Mackerras">Malcolm Mackerras</a>' prediction</span></h2>
<p>Okay, folks. Here is where I draw a line in the sand: Historical accuracy. Over a few months now I have several times inserted and later seen removed the mention of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Mackerras_e663.html" title="Malcolm Mackerras">Malcolm Mackerras</a>' prediction in January 2005 about the election. Whether you like him or not, he predicted it. It happened! He deserves recognition.</p>
<p>As of right now, the Mackerras Pendulum image is still there but the paragraph has been removed, thus losing the sense and historical importance of the pendulum/image. (The paragraph morphed after the link to <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">User:Adam Carr</a>'s pendulum was added, and it remains.) The Mackerras entry went in the edits at <b>23:43, 11 Oct 2004</b> by <b>202.154.105.254</b>.</p>
<p>If it is unacceptable to record the historically quite accurate prediction in the <i>body</i> of the entry, as it seems from people's censoring of the mention of Mackerras' prediction, then I imagine that no-one will complain if I create a separate section for the history of predictions about this election. Other people's predictions can then be documented, too. I await your advice and, if no-one objects, will do this late in the weekend. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Ellis_602e.html" title="User:Peter Ellis">Peter Ellis</a> 03:21, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have the Mackerras piece ("Nothing for certain in landslide danger zone," <i>Australian</i>, 5 January 2004) in front of me and he does <b>not</b> predict the election result, or even attempt to do so. In fact he said: "I have no idea how the Australian people will divide their votes and nor does anyone else." He posits a 3% swing to the coalition as a hypothesis, but further down the column he posits a swing to Labor of 4%. Mackerras does not in general make election predictions. <b>I do not appreciate being accused of censorship.</b> Research should precede accusation. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 04:10, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Adam, please do not be touchy. (I realise that you have opinions about how people in Wikipedia are behaving at the moment, and I am almost certain from what I can read that I'm on your 'side'.) Notice that I made the point that the edits in which the Mackerras matters were removed were by 202.154.105.254 and <i>not</i> you. As for the prediction, have I mis-attributed the prediction to the article rather than the list/pendulum he has on <a href="http://www.pol.adfa.edu.au/staff/mackerras.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pol.adfa.edu.au/staff/mackerras.html" rel="nofollow">his web site</a>? If so, I'll correctly attribute it to his site. (See the predicted situation/pendulum as recorded in detail at the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Mackerras_e663.html" title="Malcolm Mackerras">Malcolm Mackerras</a> entry <i>and</i> in the image of the pendulum.) I think that most folk would call saying something will occur in a particular way 10 months and 4 days ahead of time a <i>prediction</i>; I'll call it a <i>prophecy</i> if that is clearer. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Ellis_602e.html" title="User:Peter Ellis">Peter Ellis</a> 05:11, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That link is dead. If the pendulum is the same as the one in the <i>Australian</i>, it makes no prediction. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:54, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmmmm... Seems to me Malcolm Mackerras is more famous for the consistent <b>inaccuracy</b> of his predictions than anything else. He's been getting it wrong for 30 years to my knowledge - when will he ever learn that the past is no predictor of the future, particularly in political contexts? Why are his predictions, or anybody else's, of any real interest to Wikipedia? I can predict anything I like, and the fact that I have made such a prediction then becomes a part of world history, but that doesn't mean it's of any interest or value to anybody but me.

<p>Mackerras is a good statistician and deserves credit for inventing the pendulum and the idea of the two-party vote and the two-party swing (in <i>Australian General Elections</i> 1972), but when he ventures into political commentary and prediction he is a bit of a dill. In the article cited above his only actual prediction was that Labor would win Wakefield, which it didn't. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 08:14, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>If all votes are assumed to be ticket votes, then the final vacancy in Tasmania goes to Jacquie Petrusma of Family First ahead of Christine Milne from the Greens. However, the final margin of victory is only 4,300 votes. In 2001, one in five Tasmanian votes, or around 60,000 ballot papers, were cast below the line. Christine Milne is a well known political figure in the state, and it is quite likely that many below the line votes from the Labor, Liberal and Australian Democrat tickets will leak to Milne. The final result in Tasmania will now be known until all below the line votes are entered into the computer counting system, and the button is hit to distribute preferences.</i></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Electoral fraud and complaints</span></h2>
<p>During this election there have been a number of reports and complaints made to the AEC regarding activities and material which may constitute <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_fraud.html" title="Electoral fraud">electoral fraud</a>. I think we should include a small section on this, with focus on those incidents which can be confirmed (i.e. those reported to the AEC) and obviously being careful with the NPOV and defamation (in other words, just because it may have benefited one particular party, does not necessarily mean it was the work of that party).</p>
<p>Anyone have any particular views on this front before I start adding a new section? Also, if anyone has relevant URLs available, it would be appreciated. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenM_41a8.html" title="User:BenM">BenM</a> 02:04, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>There have been several press reports about the use of misleading how-to-vote cards, such as the "Green Liberal" card in Melbourne Ports. I would not call this "electoral fraud," although it might be found to breach s329 of the Electoral Act. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:16, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dodgy HTVs have a long and glorious history in Australian politics, and MPs who lose their seats by very narrow margins (like Anthony, who is a nice bloke but a political dud, and lost his seat all by himself) often find them a convenient excuse. It's never been proved that they really have much effect, although the Melbourne Ports one certainly cost the Greens some votes. I don't know who was behind the Richmond one.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Qld Senator #6</span></h2>
<p>the last senate spot in qld is very interesting to watch. it is extremely close between the nationals and the greens. added to this are the legal threats of both the nats and the greens to have the election overturned if they don't get their way. most importantly though is that if the nats get joyce up, the coalition will have a majority in the senate. however, this may not mean absolute control to howard, as the qld nats have made it clear that they are under no binding obedience to the coalition. at the moment, after the nats were trailing by a few hundred votes on friday, they are now ahead. there is every possibility that the qld nats will become the balance of power in the senate. this may be commentworthy. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 10:22, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
