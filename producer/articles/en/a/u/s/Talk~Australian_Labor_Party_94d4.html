<p>I wish you conservatives would stop deleting any reference to the White Australia Policy and the ALP. Like UGHHH? Why are you so worried about "Two Wongs don't make a White"? Why do you have to constantly rewrite history? --Ed</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think this is the paragraph in question:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The ALP was also committed to a platform of racialist political theories, as well: the White Australia Policy -- a political platform that discriminated against anyone not from a white, Anglo-Saxon background -- was one of the ALP's central political planks for more than 50 years, and prolonged and extended the genocidal treatment of Australian indigenous people for much of the 20th Century.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While I believe that this deserves mention, despite my anger that any policies like this were ever supported by a mainstream political party in Australia. However, I think a lot of the language (genocidal?) used is just inflammatory and understates the actions of Labor politicians in dismantling these policies (Gough Whitlam, Don Dunstan to name just two). The paragraph also fails to note that the White Australia Policy was bipartisan. I am not trying to alter history, just preventing it being "spun" in a way that suits the political persuasions of editors. I'm also unimpressed about being called conservative, but I'll leave that to another day. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 08:31, Oct 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In every single Australian State, ALP governments carried out assimilationist, genocidal policies against Australian indigenous people. If you care to examine any of the current claims lodged by indigenous people for their back wages that were appropiated by various State or Federal governments, ALP governments figure prominently.</p>
<p>Personally, I think that omitting the White Australia Policy from an 'encyclopedia' article on the ALP is remarkably like writing an essay on Adolf Hitler and neglecting to mention that he wasn't overly enamoured with Jews, Gypsies or Communists.</p>
<p>--Red ted 09:34, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not supporting its omission, I just object to the current language being used. Provide proof of your claims, I do not doubt that they are true and I am ashamed of my party's heritage, but verify controversial claims first. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 10:06, Oct 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The entire process of 'assimilation' -- adopted by the ALP and other conservative governments -- fits the UN definition of 'genocide' to a tee. The breeding out of 'inferior races', the destruction of traditional cultural and familial identities, and the destruction of traditional labour patterns all fit the UN definition, however you care to examine it. --Edward 05:03, Oct 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Personally, I think that omitting the White Australia Policy from an 'encyclopedia' article on the ALP is remarkably like writing an essay on Adolf Hitler and neglecting to mention that he wasn't overly enamoured with Jews, Gypsies or Communists.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And personally, I think hyperbolic mis-statements such as that blow your credibility right out of the water. That notwithstanding, I envision the article detailing the ALP's support for White Australia, as being part of a fuller section talking about the history and development of ALP social policy. What we are intrested in is having it stated dispassionately, however strongly we may feel about it personally. (Of course it was heinous; but I think John Howard's re-election was heinous too, and you don't see me seeking to describe it as such on the appropriate entries). A balanced representation of events lets the facts speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Major problems with the proposed paragraph are - (1) "Discriminated against" is so broad as to be meaningless. The best approach is probably simply to link to an article with a detailed history of the <i>Immigration Restriction Act</i> and its consequences. (2) A "central policy plank for more than 50 years", is, to say the least, an exaggeration. Support for the policy was extremely strong at the time of the ALP's inception; once implemented, it ceased to be an issue and steadily slipped from prominence. (3) "Prolonged and extended" - this is a huge claim that would require detailed substantiation, or, at least, proper attribution. As far as "genocide" goes, there needs to be some reflection that not everybody (rightly or wrongly) would agree to use such a word. Your strongly held views on the subject do not serve to change that. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 10:46, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry about the hyperbole, but studying Australian political history has gradually turned my sense of humour into the darkest shade of black.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Despite your protestations, Lacrimosus, the White Australia Policy was indeed an ALP political platform for more than 50 years: it remained in force until the early 1960s, when it gradually was pushed into the 'impossible to maintain any longer' basket. If you are foolish enough to want proof, I´d recomend reading virtually any of Arthur Calwell's speeches or writings on the topic: he was the author of the famous "Two Wongs don't make a white" dictum, that characterised the early post-war immigration debate. And that policy was indeed followed by the ALP. --Edward 08:50, Oct 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have now written a paragraph which discusses this issue in a balanced way and without imposing on it the ideological categories of post 1960s leftism. Incidentally, Ted, the CPA opposed immigration too. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:00, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I seem to recall it was the "Australian <b>Labour</b> Party" until some time in the late 1970s, when the spelling and the name were officially changed to "Australian <b>Labor</b> Party".

<li>The ALP itself states: <i>"During the early years of the ALP, the Party was referred to by various titles differing from colony to colony. It was at the 1908 Interstate (federal) Conference that the name 'Australian Labour Party' was adopted. In its shortened form the Party was frequently referred to as both 'Labor' and 'Labour', however the former spelling was adopted from 1912 onwards, due to the influence of the American labor movement."</i><a href="http://www.alp.org.au/about/history.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alp.org.au/about/history.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> They don't mention O'Malley. It is my experience that actually many words were spelt with an "or" ending earlier last century that we now spell "our" - the most noticeable being <i>World War I Honour Boards</i> - many of which are in fact "<i>Honor</i>" boards.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A&#160;Y&#160;Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 03:11, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've been hearing a lot about factional issues of the Labor party recently. What factions are there and what are the differences between them?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thats a difficult question! Broadly, there is the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_socialist_left.html" title="Australian socialist left">socialist left</a> and the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_labor_right.html" title="Australian labor right">labor right</a>, but the actual factions differ from state to state. In South Australia (where my knowledge is centered), there is the Labor Unity faction which is part of the labor right and used to be led by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyn_Evans_0fce.html" title="Martyn Evans">Martyn Evans</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Cox_7c74.html" title="David Cox">David Cox</a> (who both lost their seats at the election), the "Duncan Left" which was a centre to centre-left faction led in its heyday by the old member for Makin, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Duncan_052b.html" title="Peter Duncan">Peter Duncan</a> and the left faction which used to be led by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Bolkus_d0e4.html" title="Nick Bolkus">Nick Bolkus</a> who quit before the election. If that sounds complex, remember that SA's factional system is far far less complex than that in NSW and Victoria... -- <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 22:41, Oct 20, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The section about factionalism probably needs to be expanded; i might borrow out <i>The Machine</i> and get on to that. But the thing to note, as Aaron says, is that factions are overwhelmingly state-based: the National Right and the National Left are really (very!) loose coalitions of state groupings. In many states, the Right and/or the Left factions are split (for example, the Right in Queensland is divided into Labor Forum - <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Swan_950b.html" title="Wayne Swan">Wayne Swan</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Con_Sciacca_353d.html" title="Con Sciacca">Con Sciacca</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Ludwig_94f6.html" title="Joe Ludwig">Joe Ludwig</a> etc, and Labor Unity - <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arch_Bevis_2412.html" title="Arch Bevis">Arch Bevis</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Rudd_578c.html" title="Kevin Rudd">Kevin Rudd</a>). The Centre Left (ie. a grouping between the Right and Left), whose most prominent member is <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Jones_d1eb.html" title="Barry Jones">Barry Jones</a>, had prominence at a national level especially during the Hawke years but has since faded. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 20:41, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Union affiliations are something I believe might be wrong in the article. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDankru_31b7.html" title="User:Dankru">Dankru</a> 06:37, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Adam Carr deleted the following paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In its initial stage, the ALP was also significantly influenced by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System</a> school of political economy, as exemplified by <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_O%27Malley_19b6.html" title="King O'Malley">King O'Malley</a>, who proclaimed, "I am the Hamilton of Australia."

King O'Malley was chiefly responsible for the adoption by the ALP of the American-style spelling of Labor.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would like to know exactly what is being disputed. Adam, are you claiming that the O'Malley quote is illegitimate? That he was not American-born? That the national bank is not central to the American System approach? I know you are not asserting that O'Malley had nothing to do with the American-style spelling of "Labor," because I got that particular piece of information from you. To revert this material with the ad hominem attack "LaRouche nonsense" is simply avoiding responsibility for making the article accurate and complete. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky">Herschelkrustofsky</a> 14:52, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am disputing that the so-called "American system" had any influence on anything in Australia. The idea of a state bank was universally held among left-wingers at the time, and no American influence need be postulated. Intellectual influences on the Australian labour movement at that time where overwhelmingly English. O'Malley was widely regarded as a fool and had little real influence in the Labor Party despite his endless self-promotion. Secondly, we all know that everything you write is LaRouche propaganda, so spare us your pious crap. I withdrew from editing non-Australian topics so I wouldn't have to waste my time arguing with fools like you, but I won't allow you to contaminate Australian articles. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 23:12, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Call me ignorant if you must, but I really don't think Joan Kirner deserves to be listed as a prominent past premier. While she may have been the first woman premier of victoria, she never was elected to this position, having succeeded John Cain. If she had won in 1992, I'd be in favour, but since she never won an election in her own right, she is not really that prominent.</p>

<dd>I agree. "Prominent" is inherently POV. Besides, one could argue that they are already sufficiently prominent by virtue of having been premier. I have been bold and started the changes: "Prominent" removed; Kirner reinstated; three Labour premiers of WA added; list reordered into descending chronological order of first taking office as premier. <a href="../../../h/e/s/User_talk%7EHesperian_5634.html" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> 04:45, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would argue that despite the use of the words "<a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_socialism.html" title="Democratic socialism">democratic socialism</a>" in the ALP constitution, the party is not and never has been, a democratic socialist party. The bank nationalisation battles in the late 1940s which could probably be considered as the high tide of the socialist tendency within the Labor Party were more consistent with social democratic thought at the time rather than democratic socialism. Furthermore, the Hawke-Keating Government pulled down trade barriers, embraced economic rationalism and governed in much of a "third way" social democratic mould. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> July 5, 2005 00:31 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is all correct, although it should be noted that the ALP still contains the SL, a large faction dedicated to retaining a "democratic socialist" policy, and which has so far successfully blocked efforts to remove "clause 2," which is otherwise a dead letter. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 5 July 2005 01:35 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that we need more on the current policies and beliefs of the party, but I'm not willing to put them in the page without a discussion on Talk first. Here's what I've got:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Labor tends to believe that government is generally a positive force in the community and that it is the responsibility of governments to intervene in the operation of the economy (and society in general) to improve outcomes. Labor believes that the government should ensure that all members of society receive a basic income in order to have a "decent quality of life". Labor also believes that the government should ensure that all members of society are able to access quality and affordable housing as well as education and health services <a href="http://www.alp.org.au/about/values.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alp.org.au/about/values.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Taking these objectives into account, Labor has, like most social democratic parties around the world, embraced more free market principles. For example, Labor supports (and implemented while in government) the dismantling of trade barriers and deregulation of industry. However, the party argues that he makes these changes more moderately and with greater concern for those made worse off from these changes than the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_%28Australia%29_d450.html" title="Coalition (Australia)">Coalition</a> would have. Labor's policy shift has had critics from both the left and the right. The left says that Labor has abandoned its traditional base and values and that it is indistinguishable from the Coalition. The right argues that Labor doesn't embrace enough neo-liberal economics and that it is sticking to a tired ideology.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Labor supports <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiculturalism.html" title="Multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a> and generally is more likely to approve of higher immigration levels than the Coalition. Labor is the primary supporter of issues that affect <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">indigenous Australians</a> like land rights and supports a formal apology on the issue of the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_generation.html" title="Stolen generation">stolen generation</a>. Labor is also more likely to support additional rights for gay and lesbian people and it is a stronger supporter of equal opportunity legislation than the Coalition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Internationally, Labor generally believes in <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multilateralism.html" title="Multilateralism">multilateralism</a> and but is often more critical of Australia's relationship with large international powers like the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and historically the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> than the Liberal Party. However, many members of the Labor Party (especially those affiliated with right-wing factions) are strong supporters of the alliance with the United States. This support is also offical party policy. In his welcome speech to <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">US President</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

<dd><i>The Australian perspective is bound to differ, from time to time, with the perspective of the United States. Of course, on occasions, friends disagree, as we on this side did with you on the war in Iraq. But, such is the strength of our shared values, interests and principles, those differences can enrich rather than diminish, strengthen rather than weaken, our partnership. Our commitment to the Alliance remains unshakeable, as does our commitment to the War on Terror, but friends must be honest with each other.</i><a href="http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2003/10/03-10-23b.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2003/10/03-10-23b.shtml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<dd>Labor also supports a greater level of Australian integration with Asia then the Liberal Party, but this distinction is starting to narrow with increasing Liberal Party support for stronger Asian relationships, especially with <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>.</dd>
