<dd><i>Hi, I am looking to do some cleanup on the articles in the above but I'm stuck with what the naming convention should be. Most of them are just called: Pub name or Pub Name, Suburb. I took a look around and read some of the naming convention articles and see three options: Pub name, Suburb OR Pub name, Suburb, State OR Pub name, Suburb, Australia. The o/seas pubs aren't much help either. Can I get your thoughts on this? <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmitch_cbf2.html" title="User:Amitch">amitch</a> 13:08, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>How about <i>Pub name</i> if it's pretty unique sounding (we can change it to be at the <i>Pub name, Australia</i> article later if it turns out to be not quite so unique, eg. <i>Maid and Magpie</i> in SA)? For places like "Queens Arms" or "Brighton Hotel" which are bound to be replicated all over the Anglophone world, <i>Pub name, City/suburb/town</i> is in order I think. What do others think? — <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Донама</a> 01:51, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Experimental Sydney Locator Map</span></h2>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I've been on a wikibreak, and so I missed the above section about <a href="#Map_generation_using_Template:Superimpose" title="">Map generation using Template:Superimpose</a> until now. What a bloody fantastic template - but we can do so much more with it! .... So, I'm now trying to take the next logical step, which is generate a metro area map to show suburb locations. This can be done by combining four elements, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../s/u/p/Template%7ESuperimpose_2ca2.html" title="Template:Superimpose">Template:Superimpose</a>.</li>
<li>The long + lat coordinate data that we already have against every Sydney suburb.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/y/d/Image%7ESydLGAs.png_f80b.html" title="Image:SydLGAs.png">A map of Sydney</a>.</li>
<li>The new #expr parser functions to do the maths to work out where to show the marker.</li>
</ol>
<p>This has been done in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Template%7ESydney_Locator_Map_53ce.html" title="Template:Sydney Locator Map">Template:Sydney Locator Map</a>.</p>
<p>You can now see some examples of this being used for three Sydney suburbs: <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bundeena%2C_New_South_Wales_e252.html" title="Bundeena, New South Wales">Bundeena</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warragamba%2C_New_South_Wales_c7f8.html" title="Warragamba, New South Wales">Warragamba</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_Beach%2C_New_South_Wales_f226.html" title="Palm Beach, New South Wales">Palm Beach</a> (you may need to scroll down to see the map).</p>
<p>For the people who live somewhere that's not Sydney, the same basic approach should also work for you too. Note however that currently this is very much an experiment, so potentially you might want to hang back a bit and see what happens and whether it works out okay or not.</p>
<p>What do people think of this? Useful, or not useful?</p>
<p>Open questions I have are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we add borders to the map, and/or right align it, and/or add a caption? (I haven't looked into <a href="../../../s/u/p/Template%7ESuperimpose_2ca2.html" title="Template:Superimpose">Template:Superimpose</a> yet to see whether this is possible).</li>
<li>Is it desirable to add this to <a href="../../../m/a/p/Template%7EMapit-AUS-suburbscale_7585.html" title="Template:Mapit-AUS-suburbscale">Template:Mapit-AUS-suburbscale</a>, so that all suburbs in a city will have this, without having to manually add it? (e.g. we could have if lat/long are in Sydney show location on a Sydney map, if lat/long are in Melbourne show location on a Melb map, if lat/long are in Canberra etc etc, else don't show a map).</li>
<li>Is it even technically possible to add this to <a href="../../../m/a/p/Template%7EMapit-AUS-suburbscale_7585.html" title="Template:Mapit-AUS-suburbscale">Template:Mapit-AUS-suburbscale</a>? My reading of the #ifexpr parser function makes me think the answer is "no", because of the way it handles the "|" symbol.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments / ideas / ways of improving all welcome as usual.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Popularity of aussie rules revisited (2)</span></h2>
<p>Not long ago I made reference to an opinion piece in <i>The Australian</i> by Patrick Smith that referred to an AFL commissioned report that indicated that most of the relevant stats point to aussie rules being ahead of all other sports by an absolute country mile in every indicator imaginable. That is my summation of what Mr Smith had to say. I was rightly questioned why I would copy that info to this notice board. My reasoning can be seen from this quote from the article <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>:</p>

<p>"other popular sports include aussie rules..." with a ho ho ho. I am not going to get involved in this, but if anyone honestly thinks that this truly reflects the sporting landscape in Australia, well, three big letters come to my mind and you all know what they are. The rugby fraternity might be pleased with themselves in dumping aussie rules into the same basket (case) as soccer, when, as I have said previously, AFL memberships, crowds, TV earnings and merchandising sales are as much in AFL as all the other codes combined. Feel free to draw your own conclusions from these facts, but please do not respond with: Melburnians have nothing else to do, it's simply a difference in culture, etc. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 07:16, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

In fact, this isn't really about the subject - it's about the generic issue of introducing new material (backed to the hilt with all the stats you could ever wish to swim in) and not being able to get too far because of "ownership" (something that Wikipedia is not meant to be about, but...).

<p>It seems there are a lot of people who are involved in Australian sport articles. Why not create a wikiproject for it. You already have one for AFL, I am sure it would be good for the sports people to have their petty little arguments in a place where everyone will be interested. This board is not a sports debate board, yet it is flooded with sports debates (more specifically, codes of footy). If you look at the other subjects that are on this board, they will either state something, ask something, or invite people to a debate which is <i>somewhere else</i>. --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 11:16, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know many struggle to understand the prime position aussie rules has in Australian history and her culture, perhaps this quote from today's Age, by John Harms, will assist in a small way: <i>As I clicked through the turnstile at the MCG...I was reminded that the battles on Corio Oval during the 1880s, when Geelong won half a dozen premierships, weren't just footy matches, they were about Geelong people righting injustice</i> (that Melbourne had connived to become the capital city of Victoria over Geelong). Similar tales can be told about most senior clubs in Australia, they all have a similar tale to tell, and invariably they take us back to pre-Federation days - even in Sydney, which has a few clubs dating back to the 1890s. More often than not, the tales, the folklore, the mystique, of certain clubs take us back to the 1860s and 1870s (1859 in the case of Melbourne). Now, apart from the Melbourne Cup and cricket, both extremely important in terms of Austrlian culture, what other sport in has left as large a footprint on Australian history, folklore and culture as Australian football? <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 02:58, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aussie Rules? More like Victorian Grammar School Rules. To argue that most Australians care about the preferred pasttime of a few Victorian communists and homosexuals is preposterous! What game did Brant Webb and Todd Russell want to play when they got out of that mine? It wasn't a game invented in Victoria, I can assure you of that! What Footy Show consistently outrates the other one in two of the three biggest television markets in the country? No surprise, given that one features men's men like Paul "Fatty" Vautin, who's still tough enough to crack his head on a concrete slab and front up for that night's show, versus another show featuring an effeminate quiz show host that wears more makeup than Courtney Love? What game does little Aussie hero Jandamarra O'Shane dream of playing for Australia? Which code of football has a leading football club owned by international superstar Russell Crowe? Apart from the aforementioned quiz show host, is there anyone even remotely interesting in the Victorian Football management? What game were the ANZACs thinking about when they came ashore at Gallipoli?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Wikiproject for Aussie towns and cities</span></h2>
<p>What do you all think about creating a wiki project to standardise our towns, suburbs, communities? There is already a lot of standardisation amongst many suburbs and towns -- particularly the naming convention (which is a good headstart) but it's difficult to know how to create a new town or suburb article for a newcomer except by following some other example. A wiki project would help.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Dutch_municipalities_2c85.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Dutch municipalities">Dutch</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_German_districts_d589.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject German districts">German</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_French_communes_0841.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject French communes">French</a> municipality wiki projects are probably ahead of us here, not to mention the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_UK_subdivisions_d637.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject UK subdivisions">UK subdivisions</a> and plethora of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_U.S._states_389a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. states">USA town/city categorisation</a> projects.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what would be most helpful, perhaps a standard infobox for Australian suburbs, another for towns...? An agreed-upon precision for geo coords? Automated creation of stub articles for each missing article in each state's list of towns and list of suburbs? But before this, do you think it is worth starting a new wiki project to assist with this kind of decision-making and collaboration? — <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Донама</a> 05:08, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good idea. For exmaple, in the Perth articles, the LGA and their associated suburb are still lumped together.

<p>Being so envious of the organisation of the Dutch municipalities project, I went ahead and created "Aussie Cities and Towns" (<a href="../../../a/c/a/WP%7EACAT_9f32.html" title="WP:ACAT">WP:ACAT</a>) wiki project as a "parent" project of the existing 9 Aussie city wiki projects.</p>
<p>Please help in setting it up if you're interested in getting some nationwide standardisation (or even just guidelines, nice-looking templates, etc) of town and city articles happening. I wrote in the scope that this new project would explicitly absorb any standards we've already developed for the cities, and to have a special focus on how to standardise the articles about communities with smaller populations. — <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Донама</a> 07:45, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

It was first called <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezza.html" title="Hezza">Hezza</a> but that is now a redirect to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Heseltine_7c96.html" title="Michael Heseltine">Michael Heseltine</a>. The article is now called Gazza (nickname). It had a very UK slant to it, but after I rased debate on <a href="../../../h/e/z/Talk%7EHezza_90f0.html" title="Talk:Hezza">Talk:Hezza</a>, it has more of an Australian slant. I suspect the UK use started after <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Barry_McKenzie_4749.html" title="The Adventures of Barry McKenzie">The Adventures of Barry McKenzie</a> film. Gazza (nickname) is a terrible name for this article. If we can not find a better title, I think the article will have to be deleted. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 02:29, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Redirect Bazza to Barry (name), Gazza to Garry, etc. I know many might disagree with this, but frankly I'd have no time for these. In the international scheme of things, the Aussie habit of shortening "xxxxx" to "xxza" or to "xxxxs" should be documented but I don't think all the possible cases can be documented. Could redirect it to the existing article about Australian English and add it as a section there perhaps? — <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Донама</a> 03:05, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One problem is that the main editor of the article thinks that recent British useage, about politicians, such as Tony Blair saying "I prefer Prezza to Hezza" is more notable than Australian useage. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 05:02, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just noticed the recent changes to categories applied to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornelia_Rau_fc16.html" title="Cornelia Rau">Cornelia Rau</a>'s article. Is she a German emmigrant, an Australian German, a German person living in Australia or what? Probably all of the above. I noticed <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayumashu_b61f.html" title="User:Mayumashu">Mayumashu</a> changed the category <a href="../../../g/e/r/Category%7EGerman_emigrants_b947.html" title="Category:German emigrants">Category:German emigrants</a> to Category:Australian people of German descent, but since the latter isn't a child of the former I re-added the former. Then today Jcaragonv added <a href="../../../g/e/r/Category%7EGerman_Australians_f4f3.html" title="Category:German Australians">Category:German Australians</a> to her article. She is also in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_people_4823.html" title="Category:Australian people">Category:Australian people</a> cat. That's a total of four categories all to do with her nationality/ethnicity/place of residence. Surely a maximum of three would be required!?</p>
<p>In related discussions, I noticed all of the "Xxxx emigrants" categories are being proposed for deletion. I think the idea is that these will be replaced by the "Yyyy people of Xxxx descent" category. If anyone here is really invovled in this discussion could they please explain how it's meant to work here -- particularly since Australia tends to be very rich in immigrants or people who are second generation Aussies but still identify as some specific ethnicity apart from Australia or even have citizenship in some other country.

<dd>Doesn't Category:Australian people of German descent cover it all? Perhaps the only time that it wouldn't would be where a German-born person has lived a short time in Australia without taking out citizenship, but I guess that would simply make them German. Would we call someone Australian if they were not a citizen of Australia? The only other question re ethnicity is where the adjective is not related to a nation-state, for example: flemish, catalan and sardinian. Can they be used? I would have thought yes, but I have come across people with very strong views contrary to this notion. I notice that <a href="../../../j/e/l/Jelena_Dokic_3b51.html" title="Jelena Dokic">Jelena Dokic</a> is listed as both a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Category%7ESerbian_tennis_players_531d.html" title="Category:Serbian tennis players">Serbian tennis player</a> and an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_tennis_players_c455.html" title="Category:Australian tennis players">Australian tennis player</a>, but not an Australian of Serbian descent. Serbia is actually currently a part of a nation-state called <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia_and_Montenegro_aebc.html" title="Serbia and Montenegro">Serbia and Montenegro</a>, for how much longer, I am not sure. But I guess that answers my question about using adjectives to describe ethnicity that do not relate directly to the official name of the nation-state. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 06:17, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The new Australian collaboration is another already-substantial article: <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_Hall_of_Fame_910a.html" title="Australian Football Hall of Fame">Australian Football Hall of Fame</a> with ten votes (<a href="../../../a/u/s/Wikipedia%7EAustralian_Collaboration_of_the_Fortnight_History_7803.html#Australian_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="Wikipedia:Australian Collaboration of the Fortnight/History">nomination</a>). Please help to improve it in any way you can. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:51, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You may be interested in knowing that <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcription_of_Australian_Aboriginal_languages_a5bc.html" title="Transcription of Australian Aboriginal languages">Transcription of Australian Aboriginal languages</a> is a couple of spots from being voted Translation of the Week on Meta. While it is an interesting subject, I am definitely not looking forward to translating it! <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 04:08, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This isn't Wikipedia related, but I heard about it here - I have been waiting for years for a version of <a href="../../../w/h/e/Where%27s_George__4e8c.html" title="Where's George?">Where's George?</a> for Australian notes to show up, and now it has! I found it in the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currency_bill_tracking.html" title="Currency bill tracking">currency bill tracking</a> article above. The more notes entered, the more interesting these sites are, so grab your wallet and start typing those serial numbers at <a href="http://www.moneytracker.com.au" class="external free" title="http://www.moneytracker.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.moneytracker.com.au</a>&#160;! (After re-reading this, it looks kinda spammy, so a disclaimer - I have no personal/financial etc interest in the site apart from wanting to see the number of bills listed grow!) -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 13:57, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
