<p>The flag shown in the article is NOT the flag of Austria-Hungary. It is the common merchant ensign (well, not entirely, two coat of arms have to be added). The Austrian-Hungarian monarchy didn't have a common national flag. Each of the two entities had their own one.

<p>As discussed above, there was no common national flag of Austria Hungary (the one shown in the box is therefore wrong).

<dd>Someone should remove this red-white-red/green flag again. As discussed various times before (for example here and on the corresponding talk page of de-wikipedia), a national flag of Austria-Hungary did simply not exist. Both Austria and Hungary had national flags on their own as correctly depicted below in the flags and heraldry section of the article. Common Flags have only existed for duties that were commonly administered by the two parts of the empire, so there have been a merchant flag and a war flag but a common national flag was not in use. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexander_Fischer_eba4.html" title="User:Alexander Fischer">AlexF</a> 19:04, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Those two were linked by a government under a monarch wielding, in theory, absolute power, although in practice the power of the monarch was limited. The monarch’s common government was responsible for the army, navy, foreign policy, and the customs union.</i></p>
<p>How accurate is the claim that the dual monarch held absolute power? What I've read elsewhere suggested that the monarch did in fact wield absolute power as Emperor of Austria, having authority (which was exercised on occasion) to suspend constitutional government and make law as an autocrat, his powers as King of Hungary were more limited by the Diet. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimmin_7c2f.html" title="User:Shimmin">Shimmin</a> 17:21, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Depends on what you mean by absolute power. In theory he did have the power to suspend the constitution and pass unilateral decrees. However, he almost always consulted fairly widely and respected the wishes of regional diets and politicians in both Hungary and Cisleithania because he knew that his powerbase was increasingly fragile. He wanted to ensure continued loyalty from the nationalities, many of whom saw him as their "defender" to some extent. I think that fits the bill for not using his absolute power in practice.</dd>

<dd>The Austrian National Anthem's words were changed to honour each emperor in turn, though using the same tune. The original 1797 version was Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser for Franz II. After he died in 1835 the new emperor Ferdinand's anthem began "Segen Öst'reichs hohem Sohne / Unserm Kaiser Ferdinand!" ("Blessings to Austria's high son / Our Emperor Ferdinand!"). After he abdicated in 1848, the original words were reinstated for Franz Josef for a few years before the 1854 version was introduced. Apparently they never had time to rewrite the words for emperor Karl in 1916... -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 22:28, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There were translations in EVERY language of the Monarchy. It was the anthem of every part of the doubble monarchy. Kaiser Franz Joseph I wanted in 1854 an anthem whe can also use his succsessor.

<p>I figure it's local bias, people from areas that used to be part of the Kingdom of Hungary tend to refer to it like that because it may have been supremely Austrian but the Hungarians still had precedence/influence. Regardless, it is indicative that Transleithania was of the same size or larger than Cisleithania for at least 68 years before the Ausgleich (and after that they existed like that for 51 year). --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a> 01:12, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the Kingdom of Hungary was the Kingdom of Hungary from 1699.

<dl>
<dd>Cisleithania/Transleithania is post-1867 terminology, isn't it? And did the Military Frontier still exist in 1856? At any rate, while the Military Frontier existed, it was administratively separate from Hungary, but my understanding was that it was still considered a part of the Kingdom of Hungary. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 19:38, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know about the timing of that terminology, I was merely trying to say that the Hungarian domain was noticably large before the creation of Austria-Hungary (indeed, that was one of the main reasons for the latter action). The Military Frontier was finally abolished only in 1881, so it had to have existed in 1856. I don't know whether the Austrians considered it part of KoH, but it was centrally administered by Austrian military leaders from Vienna, not Budapest, so I wouldn't go so far to say that it was a part of KoH. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a> 20:52, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>john k and Joy, I'm reading this entry precisely because an article I was reading somewhere else, celebrating the 150th anniversary of Freud's birth, said he was born "in the Austro-Hungarian Empire on May 6, 1856", and I was thinking "er, no, that was still the *Austrian Empire*". I knew this not because I'm a historian or particularly interested in the period, but because I'm Hungarian, and 1867 is one of the twenty or so dates we usually remember from our grade school history lessons (provided we ever paid any attention at all&#160;:-)) I think it's more likely that the mix-up or extension of meaning is fairly common in non-historian circles *outside* the area (this one was an American article), but I've certainly never encountered it in Hungary. I suspect Austrians would be unlikely to make this mistake, though I imagine that the nations that were under Hungarian rule and justifiably resented this situation might not see much difference between the pre-1867 and the post-1867 period (as Joy said). <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArankine_105d.html" title="User:Arankine">Arankine</a> 23:46, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The disputes between the halves of the empire culminated in the <b>mid-1900s</b> in a prolonged constitutional crisis -- triggered by disagreement over the language of command in Hungarian army units, and deepened by the advent to power in Budapest (April 1906) of a Hungarian nationalist coalition. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.98.174.43 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.98.174.43_db7e.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.98.174.43">contribs</a>) 21:23, 28 August 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>twice it's suggested in this article that the power-vacuum in austria following WW1 somehow led to the rise of naziism 10 years later. Now I'm not a big history buff, but this seems a dubious claim. Hitler's ascendancy as I understand it was the result of events more or less exclusively within Germany (collapse of the mark, prolonged economic hardship, hatred of communism, resentment of jews, etc.) Is the article suggesting that a strong authority in Austria would have acted as a check on Hitler, and would not have been so easily subjugated by him?</p>
<p>Perhaps just the wording of the article should be changed, so it's not suggested that the Austro-hungarian dissolution led directly to Hitler's rise. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 143.53.158.201 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_143.53.158.201_b596.html" title="Special:Contributions/143.53.158.201">contribs</a>) 16:17, 18 November 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Well its a complicated issue. A lot of the same issues present in Germany were in Austria as well. ie. fear of Eastern Europeans, anti-semetism, instability, etc.... However, I would agree that the actual rise of the nazi party was largely a domestic German affair. What I would say needs clarification is that the destruction of Austria-Hungary as a central European power to check Germany allowed Germany to easily divide and conquer the resulting nation states. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine981_72a6.html" title="User:Peregrine981">Peregrine981</a> 00:41, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Croatian was the only official language in Croatia-Slavonia according to the Croatian-Hungarian settlement of 1868. There was a well-known riot when the Hungarian state railways attempted to put up signs in Hungarian in Croatia.&#160;:-) Bosnian was very much alive and kicking during the days of Austria-Hungary. Only in the last years of the Monarchy was it suppressed and the "Serbo-Croatian" used instead (although the language continued, of course). There was even an officially prescribed high-school grammar book "Gramatika bosanskoga jezika" (<i>A grammar of the Bosnian language</i>). --<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElephantus_ade7.html" title="User:Elephantus">Elephantus</a> 09:52, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aha, yes; I know well about the Croatian langauge - but I fail to see the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_langauge.html" title="Bosnian langauge">Bosnian langauge</a>. That Grammatics dates from the late 19th century - and I doubt that the Monarchy instutited the Bosnian language after 1908 (as you said, it promoted <i>Serbo-Croatdom</i> at the end). Why then mention the Serbian name? In Vojvodina, the Illyrian language was official - until its replacement with the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbo-Croatian_e9af.html" title="Serbo-Croatian">Serbo-Croatian</a>. As far as I know, the Illyrian language was forged in <i>Croatia and Slavonia</i> - and it was sometimes refered to as the <i><a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_language.html" title="Croatian language">Croatian language</a></i>. It would become Serbo-Croatian as well, if I'm wrong. What wonders me is which language was official - given the 1850 Convention in Vienna, isn't it presumably logical that that language was constitutionalized on the Monarchial level (and local official languages being Croatian, Illyrian, Serbo-Croatian)? P. S. I wouldn't say that Hungarization's funny.

<p>Something doesnt fit about languages in Kustenland: In the article it has been written that slovenian was the main language (37.3%) while italian is ranked second (around 34%). Yet I see in the article on Austrian Littoral that italians summed up to 237616 while slovenian were 209698.... I suspect that the data about slovenian as main language is manipulated.

<p>There are official names of Austria-Hungary in German and hungarian in the table. Why there is no name in latin. Wasn't it one of the official languages of this state?--133.41.4.46 18:22, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is the Republic of Poland listed in the successor states? I mean, I know that it was created back then - but larger portions of territory were annexed by the Kingdom of Italy and oh-so-much the Kingdom of Romania. Why makes Poland more important? --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 13:47, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The heading is "New states". Poland regained independence at the time of Austria-Hungary dissolution. Romania and Italy had already existed as sovereign states before. But I agree that calling Poland a "successor state" of Austria-Hungary is not very accurate. If you can come up with a better wording, please go ahead and change it. — <a href="../../../k/p/a/User%7EKpalion_93cc.html" title="User:Kpalion">Kpalion</a><sup><a href="../../../k/p/a/User_talk%7EKpalion_7aef.html" title="User talk:Kpalion">(talk)</a></sup> 22:59, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Er....a little voice tells me that part of the following extract from the article is vandalism:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Alan Sked has advanced the view that, "to speak of decline and fall with regard to the Monarchy is simply misleading: it fell because it lost a major war." (The Decline and Fall of the Habsburg Empire 1815–1918)</dd>
<dd>David F. Good supports Sked's view.</dd>
<dd>Others, such as Solomon Wank, remain skeptical.</dd>
