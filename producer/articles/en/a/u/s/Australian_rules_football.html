Precise field and goal kicking using the oval shaped ball is the key skill in Aussie Rules Football</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Australian rules football</b>, also known as <b>Australian football</b>, <b>Aussie rules</b>, or simply "<b>football</b>" or "<b>footy</b>" is a <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">code of football</a> played with a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prolate_spheroid.html" title="Prolate spheroid">prolate spheroid</a> <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28ball%29.html" title="Football (ball)">ball</a>, on large <i><a href="../../../o/v/a/Oval.html" title="Oval">oval</a></i> shaped fields (<a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> fields), with four posts at each end. No more than 18 players of each team are permitted to be on the field at any time, with three so-called interchange players on the bench, which functions rotationally, and the primary aim of the game is to score by <a href="../../../k/i/c/Kick_%28football%29.html" title="Kick (football)">kicking</a> the ball between the posts. The winner is the team who has the highest total score by the end of the match.</p>
<p>There are several different ways to advance the ball, including kicking and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handpass.html" title="Handpass">hand passing</a>. When hand passing one hand must be used to hold the ball and the other fist to hit it — throwing the ball is not allowed. Players running with the ball must bounce or touch it on the ground every 15 metres. There is no <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offside.html" title="Offside">offside</a> rule and players can roam the field freely. Australian rules is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contact_sport.html" title="Contact sport">contact sport</a>. Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_kick_%28Australian_rules_football%29_e087.html" title="Free kick (Australian rules football)">free kick</a></i> is paid. Players who hold on to the ball too long are penalised if they are <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tackle_%28football_move%29.html" title="Tackle (football move)">tackled</a> by an opposition player who is then rewarded, whilst players who catch a ball (known as a <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_%28Australian_football%29_c537.html" title="Mark (Australian football)">mark</a></i>) from a kick exceeding 15 metres are awarded uncontested possession. The duration of play varies, but is longer than in any other code of football.</p>
<p>Frequent contests for possession including aerial marking or "<a href="../../../s/p/e/Specky.html" title="Specky">speckies</a>" and vigorous tackling with the hands, <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bump_%28football%29.html" title="Bump (football)">bumps</a> and the fast movement of both players and the ball are the game's main attributes as a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spectator_sport.html" title="Spectator sport">spectator sport</a>.</p>
<p>The code originated in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1858.html" title="1858">1858</a>, and was devised to keep <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricketers</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_fitness.html" title="Physical fitness">fit</a> during the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter.html" title="Winter">winter</a> months. The first <a href="../../../l/a/w/Laws_of_Australian_football_e90d.html" title="Laws of Australian football">laws of Australian football</a> were published in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1859.html" title="1859">1859</a> by the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Football_Club_b6bf.html" title="Melbourne Football Club">Melbourne Football Club</a>. The dominant governing body and most prestigious <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_sport.html" title="Professional sport">professional</a> competition is the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Australian Football League</a> (AFL), which culminates in the annual <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL_Grand_Final_9ad3.html" title="AFL Grand Final">AFL Grand Final</a>, the highest attended club championship event in the world.</p>
<p>In recent times, the sport has been rocked by allegations that many of its players have been linked to illegal recreational drugs. The administration maintains a regular drug testing regime for AFL players but has come under fire for not releasing positive drug tests until the player has tested positive three times. It is thought by many that this policy lags behind other professional sporting organisations in Australia. In the context of Australian sport, this will need to be overcome if the sport is to reclaim the respect it once had.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The <i>football season</i>, proper, is from March to August (early <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autumn.html" title="Autumn">autumn</a> to late winter in Australia) with finals being held in September. In the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropics.html" title="Tropics">tropics</a>, the game is played in the <a href="../../../w/e/t/Wet_season.html" title="Wet season">wet season</a> (October to March). Pre-season competitions in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Australia_e427.html" title="Southern Australia">southern Australia</a> usually begin in late February.</p>
<p>The most powerful organisation and competition within the game, the AFL, is recognised by the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Sports_Commission_d05d.html" title="Australian Sports Commission">Australian Sports Commission</a> as being the National Sporting Organisation for Australian rules football. There are also seven state/territory-based organisations in Australia, most of which are now either owned by or affiliated to the AFL. Most of these hold annual semi-professional club competitions while the others oversee more than one league. Local semi-professional or amateur organizations and competitions are often affiliated to their state organisations.</p>
<p>The AFL is also the <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a> world governing body for Australian rules football by virtue of the fact that the game is not played extensively outside of its heartland of Southern Australia. There are also a number of organisations governing <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_rules_football_leagues_outside_Australia_dc37.html" title="List of Australian rules football leagues outside Australia">amateur clubs and competitions around the world</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike most <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">soccer</a> competitions there are usually no separate "league" and "cup" trophies. The team finishing first on the ladder is often referred to as a 'minor premier', although this bears little or no significance. The <a href="../../../m/c/c/McClelland_Trophy_8a7d.html" title="McClelland Trophy">McClelland Trophy</a> in the AFL is considered a consolation prize. For almost all Australian rules competitions the focus is almost always on winning the premiership. The team which finishes at the bottom of the ladder at the end of the season is said to get 'the <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wooden_spoon_%28award%29.html" title="Wooden spoon (award)">wooden spoon</a>'.</p>
<p>The premiership is always decided by a finals series. The teams that occupy the highest positions play off in a "semi-knockout" finals series (The <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL_finals_system_5fb9.html" title="AFL finals system">AFL finals system</a> differs from many amateur competitions in that it gives some teams a double chance). The two successful teams meet in the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Final_1c42.html" title="Grand Final">Grand Final</a> to contest the <i>Premiership</i>. The winner is awarded the <i>Premiership Cup</i>.</p>

The playing field, which may be 135-185m long and 110-155m wide. The centre square is 50x50. The curved fifty metre line is 50m away from the goal line. Adjacent goal posts are 6.4 metres apart.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Both the ball and the field of play are <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellipsoid.html" title="Ellipsoid">oval</a> in shape. No more than 18 players of each team are permitted to be on the field at any time. Up to four <i>interchange</i> (reserve) players may be swapped for those on the field at any time during the game. There is no <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offside_rule.html" title="Offside rule">offside rule</a> nor are there set positions in the rules; unlike many other forms of football, players from both teams disperse across the whole field before the start of play. However, only four players from each team are allowed within the 50m centre square before every centre bounce, which occurs at the commencement of each quarter, and to restart the game after a goal is scored. There are also other rules pertaining to allowed player positions during set plays (i.e., after a mark or free kick) and during kick-ins following the scoring of a behind.</p>
<p>A game consists of four quarters. The length of the quarters can vary from 15 to 25 minutes in different leagues. In the AFL, quarters are 20 minutes, but the clock is stopped when the ball is out of play, meaning that an average quarter could last for 27 to 31 minutes. Games are officiated by <a href="../../../u/m/p/Umpire_%28Australian_rules_football%29_c5ec.html" title="Umpire (Australian rules football)">umpires</a>. Unlike other forms of football, Australian football begins similarly to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a>. After the first <a href="../../../s/i/r/Siren_%28noisemaker%29.html" title="Siren (noisemaker)">siren</a>, the <a href="../../../u/m/p/Umpire_%28Australian_rules_football%29_c5ec.html" title="Umpire (Australian rules football)">umpire</a> <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ball-up.html" title="Ball-up">bounces the ball on the ground</a>, and the two <a href="../../../r/u/c/Ruckman_%28Australian_rules_football_position%29_e765.html" title="Ruckman (Australian rules football position)">ruckmen</a> (typically the tallest man from each team), battle for the ball in the air on its way back down.</p>
<p>The ball can be propelled in any direction by way of a foot, clenched fist (called a <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handball_%28Australian_rules_football%29_394d.html" title="Handball (Australian rules football)">handball</a> or <i>handpass</i>) or open-hand tap (unlike rugby football there is no knock-on rule) but it cannot be thrown under any circumstances. Throwing is defined in the rules quite broadly but is essentially any open hand disposal that causes the ball to move upward in the air.</p>

<p>A player may run with the ball but it must be bounced or touched on the ground at least every 15 metres. Opposition players may <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bump_%28football%29.html" title="Bump (football)">bump</a> or <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tackle_%28football_move%29.html" title="Tackle (football move)">tackle</a> the player to obtain the ball and, when tackled, the player must dispose of the ball cleanly or risk being penalised for <i>holding the ball</i>. The ball carrier may only be tackled between the shoulders and knees. If the opposition player pushes a player in the back whilst performing a tackle, the opposition player will be penalised for a <i>push in the back</i>. If the opposition tackles the player with possession below the knees, it is ruled as a <i>low tackle</i> or a <i>trip</i>, and the team with possession of the football gets a free kick.</p>
<p>If a player takes possession of the ball that has traveled more than 15 metres from another player's kick, by way of a catch, it is claimed as a <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_%28Australian_football%29_c537.html" title="Mark (Australian football)">mark</a></i> and that player may then have a <i>free kick</i> (meaning that the game stops while he prepares to kick from the point at which he marked). Alternatively, he may choose to "play on:" forfeiting the set shot in the hope of pressing an advantage for his team (rather than allowing the opposition to reposition while he prepares for the free kick). Once a player has chosen to play on normal play resumes, and the player who took the mark is again able to be tackled.</p>
<p>There are different <a href="../../../s/t/y/Styles_of_kicking.html" title="Styles of kicking">styles of kicking</a> depending on how the ball is held in the hand. The most common style of kicking seen in today's game, due principally to its superior accuracy, is the <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drop_punt.html" title="Drop punt">drop punt</a> (the ball is dropped from the hands down, almost to the ground, to be kicked so that the ball rotates in a reverse end over end motion as it travels through the air). Other commonly used kicks are the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torpedo_punt.html" title="Torpedo punt">torpedo punt</a> (also known as the spiral or screw punt; the ball is held at an angle and kicked, which makes the ball spiral in the air, resulting in extra distance) and the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checkside_punt.html" title="Checkside punt">checkside punt</a>, used to curve the ball towards targets that are on an angle. Forms of kicking which have now disappeared from the game include the <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drop_kick.html" title="Drop kick">drop kick</a> (similar to the <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drop_punt.html" title="Drop punt">drop punt</a> except that the ball is allowed to make contact with the ground momentarily before being struck with the foot) and place kick (where the ball is first placed on the ground when shooting for goal, similar to the place kick used in <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a>).</p>
<p>Apart from free kicks or when the ball is in the possession of an umpire for a <i>ball up</i> or <i>throw in</i>, the ball is always in dispute and any player from either side can take possession of the ball.</p>

Australian rules football goal posts - the two tall central posts are the goal posts, and the two shorter outer posts are the behind posts.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At each end of the field are four vertical posts. The middle two are the <i>goal posts</i> and the two on either side, which are shorter, are the <i>behind posts</i>, or <i>point posts</i>.</p>
<p>A <i>goal</i> is scored when the football is propelled through the goal posts at any height (including above the height of the posts) by way of a kick from the attacking team. It may fly through on the full or bounce through and must not be touched, on the way, by any player from either team. A goal cannot be scored from the foot of an opposition (defending) player.</p>
<p>A <i>behind</i> is scored when the ball goes across the line between a goal post and a behind post, or if the ball hits a goal post, or if an attacking player sends the ball between the goal posts by touching it with any part of the body other than a foot. A behind is also awarded to the attacking team if the ball touches any part of an opposition player, including their foot, before passing between the goal posts. When an opposition player deliberately scores a behind for the attacking team (as a last resort, due to the risk of them scoring a goal) this is termed a <i>rushed behind</i>.</p>
<p>A goal is worth 6 points whereas a behind is worth 1 point. The <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goal_Umpire_23f0.html" title="Goal Umpire">Goal Umpire</a> signals a goal with two hands raised at elbow height, a behind with one hand, and then confirms the signal with the other goal umpire by waving flags above his head.</p>
<p>The team that has scored the most points at the end of play wins the game. If the scores are level on points at the end of play, then the game is a draw.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a match between <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Kilda_Football_Club_349f.html" title="St. Kilda Football Club">St. Kilda</a> and the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Swans_645f.html" title="Sydney Swans">Sydney Swans</a>. St. Kilda's score of 15 goals and 11 behinds equates to 101 points. Sydney's score of eight goals and ten behinds equates to a 58 point tally. St. Kilda wins the match by a margin of 43 points.

A letter by Wills was published in <i>Bell's Life in Victoria &amp; Sporting Chronicle</i> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">10 July</a> <a href="../../../1/8/5/1858.html" title="1858">1858</a>, calling for a "foot-ball club" with a "code of laws" to keep cricketers fit during winter.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> An experimental match, played by Wills and others, at the Richmond Paddock (later known as <a href="../../../y/a/r/Yarra_Park%2C_Melbourne_f6e4.html" title="Yarra Park, Melbourne">Yarra Park</a> next to the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground_93ce.html" title="Melbourne Cricket Ground">MCG</a>) on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_31.html" title="July 31">31 July</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1858.html" title="1858">1858</a>, was probably the first game of Australian football. Unfortunately however, few details of the match have survived.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">7 August</a> <a href="../../../1/8/5/1858.html" title="1858">1858</a>, two significant events in the development of the game occurred.

However, the rules used by the two teams in 1858 could not have had much in common with the eventual form of Australian football since Wills had not yet begun to write them.</p>

<p>The Melbourne Football Club rules of 1859 are the oldest surviving set of laws for Australian football. They were drawn up at the Parade Hotel, <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Melbourne_d82d.html" title="East Melbourne">East Melbourne</a>, on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_17.html" title="May 17">17 May</a>, by Wills, W. J. Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and Thomas Smith (some sources include H. C. A. Harrison).<sup id="_ref-piesse_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-piesse" title="">[2]</a></sup> The 1859 rules did not include some elements that soon became important to the game, such as the requirement to bounce the ball while running, and Melbourne's game was not immediately adopted by neighbouring clubs. Before each match the rules had to be agreed by the two teams involved. By 1866, however, several other clubs had agreed to play by an updated version of Melbourne's rules.</p>
<p>Though it may never be known exactly what inspired Tom Wills' game, the influence of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school.html" title="Public school">public school</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">university</a> football codes, while undetermined, was clearly substantial. Wills had been educated at <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_School_344a.html" title="Rugby School">Rugby School</a> in England (where <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_football.html" title="Rugby football">rugby football</a> was first codified in 1845). Wills had also, like W. J. Hammersley and J. B. Thompson, played at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, although he did not study there.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup>. The <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Rules_42ca.html" title="Cambridge Rules">Cambridge Rules</a>, drawn up in 1848, included some elements which are important in Australian football, such as the mark.</p>
<p>It is also often said that Wills was partly inspired by the ball games of the local <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Aboriginal</a> people in western Victoria. <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marn_Grook_ffaa.html" title="Marn Grook">Marn Grook</a></i>, a sport that used a ball made out of <a href="../../../p/o/s/Possum.html" title="Possum">possum</a> hide, featured jumping to catch the ball for the equivalent of a free kick. This appears to have resembled the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specky.html" title="Specky">high marking</a> in Australian football. The original recorded size of the Aboriginal playing field varies with records, but most records state that the playing field was about 1.6 km (1 mile) long, with teams playing until there was one winner.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>While it is clear even to casual observers that <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_Australian_rules_football_and_Gaelic_football_a434.html" title="Comparison of Australian rules football and Gaelic football">Australian rules football is similar to Gaelic football</a>, the exact relationship is unclear, as <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_football.html" title="Gaelic football">Gaelic football</a> was not codified by the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_dab2.html" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a> (GAA) until 1887. Long before either code existed, traditional Irish football games, known collectively as <i><a href="../../../c/a/i/Caid_%28sport%29.html" title="Caid (sport)">caid</a></i>, were being played. Historian B. W. O'Dwyer points out that Australian football has always been differentiated from <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_football.html" title="Rugby football">rugby football</a> by having no limitation on ball or player movement (that is, no offside rule). The need to bounce or toe-kick the ball while running, and punching the ball rather than throwing it, are also elements of modern Gaelic football. O'Dwyer suggests that some of these elements may be attributed to the common influence of older Irish games.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1877, the game's first league, the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Football_Association_c33a.html" title="Victorian Football Association">Victorian Football Association</a> (VFA) was formed. Gradually the game – known at first as "Melbourne Rules", "Victorian Rules" or sometimes as "Australasian Rules" – began to spread from Victoria into other Australian colonies in the 1860s, beginning with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football_in_Tasmania_05ab.html" title="Australian rules football in Tasmania">Tasmania</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/6/1864.html" title="1864">1864</a>), <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football_in_Queensland_64ed.html" title="Australian rules football in Queensland">Queensland</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>) and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football_in_South_Australia_3fd3.html" title="Australian rules football in South Australia">South Australia</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>).

However, factors such as interstate rivalry and the denial of access to grounds in Sydney caused the code to struggle in New South Wales and Queensland. A rift in the VFA led to the formation of the <a href="../../../v/f/l/VFL_AFL_0d5c.html" title="VFL/AFL">Victorian Football League</a> (VFL), which commenced play in 1897 as an eight-team breakaway of the stronger clubs in the VFA competition. By 1925, the VFL consisted of 12 teams, and had become the most prominent league in the game.</p>
<p>The first <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_matches_in_Australian_rules_football_c6f8.html" title="Interstate matches in Australian rules football">intercolonial match</a> had been played between Victoria and South Australia in 1879.</p>

<p>For most of the 20th century, the absence of a national club competition — and the inability of players to compete internationally — meant that <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_matches_in_Australian_rules_football_c6f8.html" title="Interstate matches in Australian rules football">matches between state representative teams</a> were regarded with great importance. Because VFL clubs increasingly recruited the best players in other states, Victoria dominated these games. <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_origin.html" title="State of origin">State of origin</a> rules were introduced in 1977, and saw Western Australia and South Australia begin to win many of their games against Victoria.</p>
<p>In 1982, in a move which heralded big changes within the sport, one of the original VFL clubs, South Melbourne, relocated to the <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> stronghold of <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> and became known as the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Swans_645f.html" title="Sydney Swans">Sydney Swans</a>. In the late 1980s, strong interstate interest in the VFL led to a more national competition; two more non-Victorian clubs, the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Coast_Eagles_14b7.html" title="West Coast Eagles">West Coast Eagles</a> and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Bears_Football_Club_4f2c.html" title="Brisbane Bears Football Club">Brisbane Bears</a> began playing in 1987. The league changed its name to the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Australian Football League</a> (AFL) following the 1989 season. In 1991, it gained its first South Australian team, <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Crows_d561.html" title="Adelaide Crows">Adelaide</a>. During the next five years, two more non-Victorian teams, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fremantle_Football_Club_702f.html" title="Fremantle Football Club">Fremantle</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club_3729.html" title="Port Adelaide Football Club">Port Adelaide</a>, joined the league. The AFL, currently with 16 member clubs, is the sport's elite competition and the most powerful body in the world of Australian rules football.</p>
<p>Following the emergence of the Australian Football League, the SANFL, WAFL and other state leagues rapidly declined to a secondary status. Apart from these there are many semi-professional and amateur leagues around Australia, where they play a very important role in the community, and particularly so in rural areas. The VFA, still in existence a century after the original schism, merged with the former VFL reserves competition in 1998. The new entity adopted the VFL name and remained a primarily state based competition. State of origin games declined in importance, especially after an increasing number of withdrawals by AFL players, and Australian football State of Origin matches ceased in 1999. The second-tier state and territorial leagues still contest interstate matches.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as the game was becoming established in Australia, it had spread to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football_in_New_Zealand_fb00.html" title="Australian rules football in New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football_in_South_Africa_c961.html" title="Australian rules football in South Africa">South Africa</a> followed in the 1880s, with the help of Australian gold miners and then soldiers. In 1908, New Zealand defeated both New South Wales and Queensland at the <b>Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival</b>, an event held to celebrate 50 years of Australian Football.</p>
<p>The profound effects of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> caused the gradual demise in the game in countries outside Australia, including New Zealand.</p>
<p>The longest running international fixture is the annual Oxford versus Cambridge Varsity match in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> The match was first played in 1921 and has emerged into a fierce rivalry. The match is worthy of <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_Sporting_Blue_0c5c.html" title="University Sporting Blue">half-blue status</a> at Oxford, who have dominated the event in recent years.</p>
<p>The first nation outside of Australia to take the sport up seriously was the former Australian territory of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football_in_Nauru_7e76.html" title="Australian rules football in Nauru">Nauru</a>, which began playing in the 1930s.

<p>Since 1967 there have been many matches between Australian and Irish teams, under various sets of hybrid, compromise rules. In 1984, the first official representative matches of <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_rules_football.html" title="International rules football">International rules football</a> were played, and these are now played annually each October.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football_in_New_Zealand_fb00.html" title="Australian rules football in New Zealand">New Zealand</a> resumed a local competition in 1974.</p>
<p>The first ever international match involving Australia was played in 1977 at under 17 level between Australia and Papua New Guinea in Adelaide, with Australia taking the honours.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup> Since then, Australia have been peerless in the sport and seldom compete at international level.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s and 1990s, as distance became less of an obstacle, amateur teams were established in many parts of the world. Most of these were initially established by Australian expatriates but are collecting growing numbers of native players. The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Australian_Football_Council_633e.html" title="International Australian Football Council">International Australian Football Council</a> (IAFC) was formed after football first featured at the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arafura_Games_f735.html" title="Arafura Games">Arafura Games</a> in 1995. Inspired by successful Arafura Games competitions, the inaugural <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_International_Cup_edd9.html" title="Australian Football International Cup">Australian Football International Cup</a> was held in Melbourne in 2002, an initiative of the IAFC and the AFL. With the closure of the IAFC subsequent cups are staged by the AFL.</p>
<p>Since 1998, the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barassi_International_Australian_Football_Youth_Tournament_3918.html" title="Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament">Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament</a>, endorsed by the AFL as part of its International Policy, has hosted several junior teams from other countries.

The AFL hopes to develop the game in other countries to the point where Australian football is played at an international level by top-quality sides from around the world. The AFL plans to host the International Cup regularly every four years, beginning in 2008, the 150th anniversary of the code.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>Australian Rules is a sport rich in tradition and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_culture.html" title="Australian culture">Australian cultural</a> references, especially surrounding the rituals of gameday for players, officials and supporters.</p>
<p>As part of their uniform, players wear <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guernsey_%28clothing%29.html" title="Guernsey (clothing)">guernseys</a>, which are similar to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> shirts, but of a more robust design, often referred to in Australia as "jumpers". In the early period of the game's development players often wore sleeveless lace-up tops which gradually disappeared between the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. A few players choose to wear a long sleeved variation of the modern guernsey design. Players wore full length pants, before adopting shorts in the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>. Tight-fitting shorts were a notable fashion trend in most leagues in the 1980s and some players began to wear <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamstring.html" title="Hamstring">hamstring</a> warmers. A brief experiment with <a href="../../../l/y/c/Lycra.html" title="Lycra">lycra</a> by the AFL in the State of Origin series was quickly abandoned for more traditional wear. Padding is rare, but some ruckmen wear shin pads and thigh pads and players with head injuries sometimes wear soft helmets. Long socks (football socks) are compulsory, and mouthguards are worn by most players. Boots with moulded cleats or studs for gripping the ground are worn (screw-ins have been banned from most leagues since the 1990s).</p>
<p>Traditionally, umpires have worn white. However, in the AFL, umpires now wear bright colours chosen not to clash with the guernseys of the competiting teams. AFL goal umpires now wear t-shirts and caps, rather than the traditional white coat and <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trilby.html" title="Trilby">broad brimmed hat</a> which was similar to what was worn by many cricket umpires.</p>
<p>Australian rules is often referred to as the <i>people's game</i> due to its ability to transcend class and racial boundaries, unify supporters and attract crowds.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fans <i>barrack</i> for their team rather than support or <i>root for</i> (in Australia, 'root' is slang for <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a>). The term <i>barrack</i> is believed to derive from early matches between soldiers stationed in army barracks near the MCG. One of the first things many Melburnians will ask when meeting someone new is which football team they 'barrack' or 'go' for.</p>

Supporters run onto the field to celebrate the game and play games of <a href="../../../k/i/c/Kick-to-kick.html" title="Kick-to-kick">kick-to-kick</a> with their families. In many suburban and country games, this also happens during quarter and half-time breaks.

<p>Australian rules football is the most highly attended spectator sport in Australia: government figures show that more than 2.5 million people (16.8% of the population) attended games in 1999.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[11]</a></sup> In 2005, a cumulative 6,283,788 people attended <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Australian Football League</a> premiership matches, a record for the competition.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[12]</a></sup> A further 307,181 attended <a href="../../../n/a/b/NAB_Cup_86a5.html" title="NAB Cup">NAB Cup</a> pre-season matches and 117,552 attended Regional Challenge pre-season practice matches around the country.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>As of 2005 the AFL is one of only five professional sports leagues in the world with an average <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_attendance.html" title="Sports attendance">attendance</a> above thirty thousand (the others are the <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> in the United States and <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> in the U.S. and Canada, and the top division soccer leagues in <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bundesliga_%28football%29.html" title="Bundesliga (football)">Germany</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Premier_League_68f5.html" title="FA Premier League">England</a>).</p>

The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Sports_Commission_d05d.html" title="Australian Sports Commission">Australian Sports Commission</a> statistics show a 42% increase in the total number of participants over the 4 year period between 2001-2005.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Australian rules football is fast growing as an amateur sport in more than 20 countries around the world. In 2004, there were a total of over 25,000 participants outside of Australia.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many related games have emerged from football, mainly with variations of contact to encourage greater participation. These include <a href="../../../k/i/c/Kick-to-kick.html" title="Kick-to-kick">Kick-to-kick</a> (and its variants such as 'Marks Up), <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auskick.html" title="Auskick">Auskick</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rec_Footy_5f8e.html" title="Rec Footy">Rec Footy</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_Footy_8b16.html" title="Women's Footy">Women's Footy</a>, <a href="../../../9/-/a/9-a-side_Footy_e83d.html" title="9-a-side Footy">9-a-side Footy</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masters_Australian_Football_1be7.html" title="Masters Australian Football">Masters Australian Football</a>, handball and longest-kick competitions.

<p>For many years, the game of Australian rules football captured the imagination of Australian film, music, television and literature.</p>
<p>Many songs inspired by the game have become anthems of the game, none more so than the 1979 hit <i><a href="../../../u/p/_/Up_There_Cazaly_bd2b.html" title="Up There Cazaly">Up There Cazaly</a></i>, by <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Brady_%28musician%29_803d.html" title="Mike Brady (musician)">Mike Brady</a>. Brady followed the hit up with <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Day_in_September_%28song%29_04a9.html" title="One Day in September (song)">One Day in September</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>. Both are frequently used in Grand Final celebrations.</p>
<p>Australian Rules Football can also be seen screening on a Television set during the Season 1 episode of '<a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Angel_%28TV_series%29_b030.html" title="Dark Angel (TV series)">Dark Angel</a>' titled 'Flushed' (Season One, Episode Four). 'Dark Angel' is set in the year 2019 in a United States which is now barely more than a <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_World_e346.html" title="Third World">Third World</a> nation. With this in mind, the creators opted to show the characters watching sports from other countries as American sports would no longer be around.</p>

<p>For the centenary of the VFL/AFL in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_Hall_of_Fame_910a.html" title="Australian Football Hall of Fame">Australian Football Hall of Fame</a> was established. That year 136 identities were inducted, including 100 players, 10 coaches, 10 umpires, 10 administrators and 6 media representatives.</p>
<p>The selections have caused some controversy, partly because of the predominance of VFL players at the expense of those who played in other leagues, in the years before there was a national competition.</p>
<p>The elite <i>Legend</i> status was bestowed on 12 members of the Hall of Fame in 1996; eight other football identities have subsequently received this honour.</p>
