<h2><span class="mw-headline">Too many links?</span></h2>
<p>My impression is that the article is heaving with blue patches. Wikipedia's style manual says:</p>
<p>'... On the other hand, do not make too many links. An article may be considered overlinked if ... more than 10% of the words are contained in links; [if] it has more links than lines; [if] a link is repeated within the same screen—40 lines, perhaps;...'</p>
<p>The manual refers to years, such as 1995, 1980s, as 'low added-value links ... date forms such as year only (e.g., 1981) should be treated like any other words and linked only if there is <i>some particular relevance.'</i> (My highlighting)</p>
<p>The opening of an article probably requires a higher density of links, but could I put in a call that we keep our eyes out for unnecessary links, such as 'islands' in the very first sentence; Wikipedia is not a dictionary. There are two links, not all that far from each other (although more than the prescribed 40 lines) to '1 January 1901', 'penal colony' and 'Crown colony/ies'. I wonder why a reader would suddenly want to switch to the article on 'the United States', a little-known entity, in the middle of reading a short summary of Australian history. And just why a year such as '1911' is linked is a mystery; many other years aren't linked, and a whole year is too broad to be of value as an adjunct to this summary. While the article needs to give readers opportunities to access material that is clearly associated with the theme, and reasonably focused, I suspect that the current density of links risks pandering to attention deficit disorder.</p>
<p>A rough, back-of-the-envelope tally gives the following proportions of words that are in links:</p>
<p>Para 1 23%</p>
<p>Para 2: 19%</p>
<p>Para 3: 18%</p>
<p>Para 4: 9%</p>
<p>Para 5: 20%</p>
<p>In my view, a balance is required to make the text easy to read.</p>
<p>What do other people think?</p>

<p>Thanks, Scott. So, does anyone mind if I go through and judiciously remove a few links? ... Like the year-only dates, words such as 'island' and repeated links, such as 'penal colony'? Should I first list the ones proposed for delinking here? 203.217.76.203 07:53, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was going to say "go ahead", but then found a reason not to for most examples, so perhaps you better list them here first. <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penal_colony.html" title="Penal colony">Penal colony</a> is linked twice from different sections, and a person reading one and interested to follow the link may not have found the other one. Both <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/2/1829.html" title="1829">1829</a> articles contain the event referred to where they are linked from. I would usually prefer to err on the side of too many links rather than not enough, so perhaps waiting for a few more responses is good, too. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 10:08, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Points noted, thanks. I'll list some here for delinking soon. I'm inclined to think that readers shouldn't be encouraged to switch to a link on penal colony at the top, which is big-picture stuff; I'm hoping that readers who might be interested in that link would bother to soldier on down to the history section, where it <i>is</i> linked. I think we'd still be erring on the side of too many links even if we delinked a quarter to a third of them, according to Wikipedia's guidelines. I don't always agree with the guidelines, but on this matter I can see where they're coming from (readability). Many W articles are overlinked, I reckon. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 13:16, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, to be honest, that's why this article should be consistent with that. I reckon we should go with actual practice, as opposed to what that particular guidline seems to be saying. I'm a little bit puzzled: it doesn't do any positive <i>harm</i> to link to other articles. Extensive cross-referencing is a great strength. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 09:35, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Slac, don't you think that peppering the text with blue links makes it just a little harder to read, and synoptically less attractive? The denser the linking, the less the prominence of each link; part of my push to ration links is to invest those that <i>are</i> valuable with greater importance for the reader.</p>
<p>Another problem with using low-value links, e.g., 'islands', '19th century' encourages readers, esp. children and relatively uninformed readers, to divert and get lost in a sea of unfocused information. I think that one of the key advantages of presenting information on a computer is the ability of the writers/designers to <i>hide</i> information as much as to <i>display</i> it. I know it sounds controlling, but I think readers like to be funnelled in a particular direction, and that many people find it daunting to have too much choice. In my view, Wikipedia should strengthen its policies on linking; overall, I think there are far too many links in W articles. What do you think? <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 04:03, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We discussed this on the previous page, and people seemed to favour upper case for items such as 'Prime Minister'.

So perhaps I'll not revert my lower case changes (as I said I would) until people have had a chance to form a view about the W Style Manual on this matter. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 13:24, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The lower case versions rub quite badly against my instincts. I'm going to re-install the upper-case versions, since as far as I've encountered (constitutional texts, etc.) they are meant to be capitalised. I think this is probably more a feature of Australian than American English. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 09:37, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. The MoS is a guideline, and its two most fundamental recommendations are that an article's original style be respected and that there should be consistency of style within an article. Moreover, there are exceptions to recommendations insofar as they conform with the national variety of English used. I have stated before (not without disagreeance) that Australian English capitalises the words in question.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 10:06, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, where are your references for this assertion about Australian English? I have to say that this notion of the ultimate conservatism with respect to not changing style will petrify the language if taken to extremes. Why should it be the case? Why shouldn't existing style, as statements are, be subject to review.</p>
<p>I note that you start by saying that the MoS is a guideline to support your view that this article should go against the MoS in this respect. These 'fundamental recommendations', then, are also just guidelines.</p>
<p>I really <i>do</i> want to see some references cited for your assertions about AustEng.</p>

<dd>I don't quite understand what's going on here. The MoS just after the sentence that Tony quotes, suggests that capital letters are appropriate for most of the references in this article, as they are formal names of office, or references to a specific office. As I read it, the MoS is possibly contradicting itself in some areas, but is definitely supporting the use of upper case for describing the office of Prime Minister, etc. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> 11:47, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Austraian Style Manual has the same recommendation as the MoS. 'prime minister' does not need to be capitalised every time it is used. If the rule is that reference to a specific office is capitalised then no occurrence of a phrase like 'prime minister' can ever be lower case except in the rare instances where generic prime ministers are dscussed. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgri_a5f5.html" title="User:Algri">Alan</a> 03:20, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Something important to consider is that the average reader of the article may not be well-read or may have english as a second language. So I would argue that many of the dictionary definition links would be useful for that type of reader.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Improving the bit on political parties?</span></h2>
<p>The section on politics currently finishes this way:</p>
<p>There are three major political parties: the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a>, the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal Party</a>, and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_of_Australia_5507.html" title="National Party of Australia">National Party of Australia</a>.

<p>For the foreigner, this is a bit of a jumble of party names that provides no useful description of the state of play in Australian politics (perhaps there's nothing to say?). I wonder whether we could go with John Howard's own description of his party, add a pretty uncontentious equivalent for the ALP, and mention the minor parties. Here's a draft.</p>
<p>There are three major political parties: the centrist <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a>, and the centre-right <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_of_Australia_5507.html" title="National Party of Australia">National Parties</a> (which traditionally form a coalition representing, for the most part, urban and rural/regional constituencies, respectively).

<p>What is <i>remotely</i> left-wing about the ALP nowadays? Some elements of the party might describe themselves as left-wing, although whether this is in the traditional sense is doubtful (some elements of the Australian Democrats and the Greens might be a little closer to the mark). But the ALP is now dominated by a conservative, cautious strategy designed to appeal to (conservative, cautious) swinging voters in marginal electorates, both as the opposition in Canberra and as the party of goverment at state and territory levels. 'Social democratic' or 'centre-left', in my view, would give a foreign/uninformed reader the impression that the ALP acts as a significant force against unbridled capitalism, which doesn't appear to be the case in modern Australia. The Hawke-Keating government may have marginally influenced industrial relations in the interests of unions and 'workers', but in the larger scheme it implemented reforms that the majority saw as improving the efficiency of capital. I see no evidence that the party has drifted to the 'left' since then; on the contrary, it has drifted to the right under the shadow of the Howard government. That is why I used the term 'centrist' in the draft; it's not specific enough to give the wrong impression, and characterises the party as a little to the left of the Coalition. Anything stronger would, frankly, be wishful thinking. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 13:11, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is why defining parties in terms of each other is difficult (as a matter of interest, historically this is how the Australian political spectrum works but in reverse: every other party defines itself primarily as <i>not being Labor</i>. This is seen most obviously with the Democrats and the Greens). Treating "Left" and "Right" as some sort of absolute leads to problematic assumptions such as the idea that a left-wing party is one that is "a significant force against unbridled capitalism" - cf. <a href="../../../l/e/c/Lech_Walesa_265e.html" title="Lech Walesa">Lech Walesa</a>. The very problem with "centrist" is its non-specicifity. As <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granny_Weatherwax_11b3.html" title="Granny Weatherwax">Granny Weatherwax</a> once said, "it's not where you stand, it's which direction you're facing". I know some Greens who dismiss the idea that they are "left-wing" any more than they are "right wing" - Green politics doesn't focus on such a spectrum. Similarly, it doesn't necessarily matter how close the ALP's policies are to anyone else's, since we're looking for what makes it distinct, not what makes it similar to anything else. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 23:01, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had some interesting discussions when I was living in New Zealand with people studying New Zealand politics. The strategy there for political parties is to try and appear centerist, and to discredit oppositon by painting them as right or left wing. I can seem similarites here. Without having the section turn into a messy political spectrum, I think the section would work fine without applying an arbitrary statement of political ideology.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 00:55, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, this certainly has generated a lot of text.&#160;:-) I can live with 'centre-left' for the ALP, I guess, and I think it's helpful for outsiders to try at least a vague comparison of the angle of the main parties, however similar they are now. Slac, perhaps politics now suffers from 'non-specificity'.

<dd>(Coming in late here) I don't like the idea of describing parties as "right", "centre", "left", etc. Every country has its own ideas of what the political spectrum means (how many Australians would consider the US Democratic Party left-wing?), and this entry (IMHO) is of most value if written for an audience outside Australia. Is it possible to write the party descriptions so that their core constituencies/ideals (union-rural-greenies-protesters etc.) become the primary thingies? I must admit I can't see a way of doing it well. For one thing, the Liberal Party would prove a sticking point. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> 22:26, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I actually don't think it's relevant, there are many engagements in the Pacific where Australia was not significantly supported by the US and vice versa.

<dd>Well, that's where you are wrong. McArthur controlled access to all information to the media (as would be expected in time of war) but <i>also</i> controlled access to information to the <i>government</i>. American forces <i>did</i> play a limited role in the defense of Australia on Kokoda track. That McArthur hindered troops can be seen by his reaction to the fighting withdrawal of Maroubra force by Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell. McArthur evidently didn't understand the terrain (he advocated that they defend "the Gap", believing this to be the best place to concentrate Japanese forces and halt them. The problem was there was no "gap" in the Owen-Stanleys - according to <i>Quadrant</i>:</dd>
<dd>But why, people are asking, didn’t they stop to defend the Gap, about which there has been so much song and dance? The reason is simple. There ain’t no Gap. There is just a broad saddle on the back of the Range with two tracks straddling over it. The Gap was named by the commercial pilots who found here a wide break in the line of the Owen Stanley Range and flew through it. On the ground itself there is no defile, no gorge, no precipitous mountain pass, nothing which can remotely be called a Gap from the point of view of anybody on the ground. One or two of us have said this before, but it doesn’t seem to have sunk in yet in certain quarters. <a href="http://www.quadrant.org.au/php/archive_details_list.php?article_id=325" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.quadrant.org.au/php/archive_details_list.php?article_id=325" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>He also didn't understand how to drop supplies: supplies were dropped from planes <i>without</i> parachutes: a decision made by the top in Australia. There were several documented cases of mortar crews dying because their ordinance exploded when in the weapons - a direct result of dropping ammunition without parachutes. They refused to land planes to fly out the sick and wounded citing safety reasons: yet several times they landed personnel and supplies (towards the end of the campaign it was announced that "hospital planes" were to be built: a tacit acknowledgement that this should have been done in the first place).</p>
<dl>
<dd>So, yes, MacArthur hindered Australian troops. Of that there can be no doubt.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Lastly, you make out that Paul Ham's book is the opinion of just one author. Nothing could be further from the truth: Ham's book was read to critical acclaim in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Australian_d6f4.html" title="The Australian">The Australian</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald_4298.html" title="The Sydney Morning Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Courier_Mail_1e7c.html" title="The Courier Mail">The Courier Mail</a></i>. Extensively footnoted and researched, no fact in the book was without a reference to back it up. Paul Ham researched the Batallion histories, interviewed the original soldiers of the campaign, and cites plenty of secondary sources to back up what he has to say. If anything, the book is well measured, well researched and accurate. I shall put back my material in an altered form. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 03:36, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I still fail to see how any of this is relevant to this article. McArthur wasn't a great general- the article doesn't even mention him.

<dd>I (from Melbourne) agree with Randwicked. The two pronunciations I'm familiar with are /Ostræij@/ and /@stræili.@/. A song is a bad guide to pronunciation, particularly the number of syllables, because it mandates them. 'Toil', for instance, is normally pronounced to rhyme with 'royal', but in the anthem I often hear it more like 'tawl' because it's meant to be one syllable. I also agree that [lj] is difficult to say; my pronunciation of 'aluminium' approaches ['æ.j@mInj@m] and of 'failure' tends to be more like [fæili@], still rhyming with a four-syllable version of Australia. (As for John Howard, his accent sounds fake, so I wouldn't use it as a guide.) — <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 22:37, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The productivity comission did not describe a nationwide housing shortage, in fact the only shortage it describes is in Sydney and is specific to first home buyers. A housing shortage implies that there are not places for people to live, which is clearly not the case. The number of factors contributing to a shortage of homes for first home buyers is enormous and cannot be pinpointed to immigration, to say it's the immigrants fault when you could as easily blame old people for not dying or rich people for buying investment propperties, is POV.</li>

<dd>I think it's okay, but I have a few concerns. I realise it isn't contradiction per se to say that Australia is experiencing both "relatively low fertility rates" and "relatively high population growth" in the same paragraph, but it appears contradictory and repetitive. Also, the population growth rate is "high" relative to the OECD, not generally. In a global context, Australia's growth rate could be said to be quite low, relatively.

<p>In response to the points made here let me reply. The Productivity Commission Report does cite immigration/population as a factor in raising demand for housing in the body of the report, if not in the conclusions. I could instead cite material by Doctor Bob Birrell from Monash University - I will have to find it. The comment by Scott Davis that the rate of immigration is "falling again" is completely incorrect. The ABS has changed the way it calculates the net migration statistic, Immigration has consistently increased for at least the last eight years. This is also demonstrated on the DIMIA website. It is not necessarily correct to say that Australia has “relatively low fertility rates”. The source of this quote is from 1996, and is thus out of date. And what is it relative to? Since then the fertility rate in Australia has in fact increased. The main point that needs to be made is that the article contains a number of comments in favour of immigration, and I was trying to add some balance to the article. The other alternative is to delete the favourable references to immigration. Jigjog</p>
<p><br />
Immigration causing an increase in housing demand is a far cry from a housing shortage. The arcile as it was said (a) that there is immigration to Australia and (b) that immigratiion had contributed to multiculturalism. Both true and neither POV.

<p>You do not seem to have noticed that I changed my original wording of “nation-wide housing shortage” to “a shortage of affordable housing”. I think that is indisputable. It has been widely reported that housing affordability has decreased substantially in the last few years. At least one user is pro-immigration because he/she commented that he/she would remove my edits because they were negative towards immigration. Jigjog</p>
<p>I don't care for immigration one way or the other. The PC report identifies immigration as one of many factors that have incresed demand in the housing sector, to single it out as the cause is POV.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 10:33, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did not "single out" immigration, I said it has "contributed" to a shortage of affordable housing. Anyway, I have decided to keep the comments I was trying to add out of the Australian demographic section and instead create a new sub article within the "immigration to Australia" article, entitled "Views on Immigration". Jigjog</p>
<p>Whether immigration has caused a shortage of housing is difficult, if not impossible, to prove; housing supply and demand are related to a number of complex, interacting forces, including interest rates, the taxation system, competition between banks for lending, and cultural factors, aside from changes in population levels. It's so complex that senior economists typically cannot reach agreement, even on the fundamentals of the area. I think we're on unstable territory to attempt simple assertions here. Aside from that, linking high or low levels of immigration to positive and negative effects on the economy is a highly emotive issue that is likely to reduce the authority of the article for many readers. Perhaps these matters should be debated with respect to a daughter article. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 11:37, 11 August 2005 (UTC) PS I don't see a clear relationship between housing and stock investment: it's multifactorial.</p>
<dl>
<dd>My comment that immigration is falling was based on the sentence <i>"Preliminary net overseas migration was 29,300 persons during the December quarter 2004, a 14.2% decrease on the December quarter 2003."</i> which appears as the third bullet in the "December Key Points" near the to of the <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/mf/3101.0?OpenDocument" class="external text" title="http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/mf/3101.0?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">referenced ABS page</a>. The main cause of a shortage of available housing in Sydney is some bizarre desire by too many people to want to live in Sydney. If they were prepared to move to other places, it would be more affordable. There have been several rural towns <b>giving away</b> land for housing with the catch being that the "buyer" must build a house and live in it (ie not try to rent it out). --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 14:32, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A fall in net migration from one quarter to the next is statistically meaningless. The quarterly figures often go up and down. The annual figures are certainly increasing, and the Australian Government (via the Department of imimgration) has certainly increased the immigration quota every year for the last number of years (nearly a decade I think). Re the shortage of affordable housing, if you look at what organisations like ACCOSS have been saying, you will certainly see that there is a shortage of affordably housing right across Australia. Jigjog</p>
<dl>
<dd>The quarterly fall I noted is not statistically meaningless, as it is a fall between December quarters of successive years. I agree more numbers would give better indications of trends. Most of the page discusses quarterly effects, so it's hard to interpret what longer-term trends there are. <i>This annual population growth rate (1.2%) has been consistent with the levels recorded in previous years.</i> covers all forms of population movement. It says over 5 years annual immigration is up 20.9% and emmigration up 41.1%. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 03:00, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The population of Australia has quadrupled since WW1, so there is no point in the article saying that it has doubled - that is misleading.</p>
<p>The reference to the Inquiry into Australian Expatriats is useless, because not only does the link not go to the actual report, but there is no page or chapter reference. My reference to the Productivity Commission was criticised for the same reason, and I inserted the page number.</p>
<p>I also think the paragraph does not read well by jumping from the ageing demographic to the expatriat issue, then to immigration in no logical sequence, and think this could be improved. Jigjog 01:54, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could a writer more experienced in politics do a little rewrite on the beginning of the paragraph on the three major parites. As written it is kinda muddled with: "(which traditionally form a coalition representing, for the most part, urban and rural/regional constituencies, respectively)." I know it is kinda tricky breaking it apart but a reader can get lost in it. The information is exactly correct, but hard to decode if you are not aware of the way the parties form coalitions, and the "urban and rural/regional" reference is not really attached to what it means to be associated with.</p>

<p>Also, it would be very informative here to indicate that currently all the state governments are headed by Labor while the federal government is headed by the Nationals.

<p>During Premier Carr's period in office in NSW a noticable shift has occured with the states leaving to the federal government authority what in the pre-Carr era were given more of a tug of war between the states/federal. It would be useful to describe what the current difference in responsibility is between the states and the federal governments.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This roles of the state governments are covered in the states and territories section. I think its a bit soon to comment on the changes of government in NSW and what difference it will make to state/federal realtions, and it is probably not relevant to this article--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 01:40, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, for non-Australians it would be very informative to state that voting is mandatory in federal elections with a fine assessed for nonvoting. I was not sure where this would be placed, and I am not sure whether voting is also mandatory at the state level.</p>

<p>I took out the "outback" ref again, but it could probably go back in somewhere (not necessarily the intro though).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Genocide</span></h2>
<p>I take exception to the sentence:</p>
<p>"The Indigenous Australian population, estimated at about 350,000 at the time of European settlement,[2] declined steeply for 150 years following settlement, mainly because of infectious disease, and forced migration, the removal of children and other colonial government policies that by today's understanding constitute genocide."</p>
<p>Aboriginal history is disputed in this area (take Keith Windshuttle's The Fabrication of Aboriginal Histiory, for example) and the concept of considering the decline of aboriginal populations as genocide is controversial. I would suggest that "that by today's understanding constitute genocide" be removed as it is opinion, not fact.</p>
<p>--Fremantle74</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree (sort of): the question of whether the British and Australian policies towards the Aborigines constitutes "genocide" is far from settled ('cept maybe in Tasmania?), and answering it here probably counts either as POV or OR. The "sort of", of course, comes from the simple fact that Windschuttle (however his name is spelled) is not the most reliable source in town ;-). I personally think "genocide" is a reasonably apt description, but there are enough people out there who'd hit me over the head and complain about the type of coffee I'd drink if I drank coffee that I'm not about to use it in polite convos. Assuming somebody else doesn't get in first (be <b>bold</b>, Fremantle74!), I'll try to think of a way to paraphrase. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> 16:55, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I´ve looked at the Wikipedia article on genocide and it isn´t much help. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide</a>. Is it genocide when the intentions are good? The Nazi Holocaust was indisputably genocide and deserving of condemnation, but when children are removed for their own protection, it is hard to say that this constitutes genocide. There were two test cases some years back, and it was found that there was no evidence of forced removal, and in one case the ¨half-caste¨ child had been apparently stuffed into an anthill and left to die!</p>
<p>For an encyclopedia, surely we need authoritative sources, and if there is debate, then both sides should be presented. --Surgeonsmate</p>
<p>I suggest you take the time to read the ATSIS research paper that is referenced by this article where the Australian situation with respect to the United Nations <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convention_on_the_Prevention_and_Punishment_of_the_Crime_of_Genocide_2f25.html" title="Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide">Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</a> of 1948 is discussed in length. From the article,</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Even so, we have to look to the philosophy inherent in the legal wording of Article II (of the 1948 convention), namely, that genocide is the systematic attempt to destroy, by various means, a defined group's essential foundations. In this tighter legal sense, Australia is guilty of at least three, possibly four, acts of genocide: first, the essentially private genocide, the physical killing committed by settlers and rogue police officers in the nineteenth century, while the state, in the form of the colonial authorities, stood silently by (for the most part); second, the twentieth-century official state policy and practice of forcibly transferring children from one group to another with the express intention that they cease being Aboriginal ; third, the twentieth century attempts to achieve the biological disappearance of those deemed "half-caste" Aborigines; fourth, a prima facie case that Australia's actions to protect Aborigines in fact caused them serious bodily or mental harm.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So the statement in the article, that by todays standards (the Convention) that actions of the European settlers constitute genocide, in my opinion, is accurate. There is no debate, there are facts and there are people that want to deny them. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 00:57, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nixie's right. It is a valid conclusion to make under today's understanding, an understanding which is agreed in Article 2 of the CPPCG, to which Australia is signatory <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/treaty1gen.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/treaty1gen.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 01:15, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm new here, and please forgive me if I'm out of line, but it seems that the Wikipedia article on genocide, this article, you, and that quote above are all saying different things when you examine the details. Who has committed the genocide? The European settlers? The colonial governments? The Commonwealth? There is a conflict amongst the sources provided. Personally, I find 'biological disappearance of those deemed "half-caste" Aborigines' hard to understand. Does biological disappearance mean physical extermination? --Surgeonsmate</p>

<dd>"Biological extermination" would mean the intention to have those deemed "half-caste" absorbed into the European population, and thus become no-longer half-caste. That was theory at least: the aboriginal population at large was seen as a dying race, and the "half-caste's" were supposed to eventually "blend-in" or "assimilate". However, I do see your point about semantics. Who, indeed, are we suggesting committed these acts. It would be difficult to narrow it to just one of the possible subjects.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 01:36, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still disagree that the decline of Aboriginal society is universally considered genocide. Definitely tragic, definitely an unintended consequence of British, colonial, Commonwealth and Church policies. By labelling what happened to the Aboriginals as genocide, you dilute the currency of the term and the crime. I am unaware of any legal ruling or prosecution that definitively concludes that genocide occured. ATSIS is hardly an independent and objective source and their case is yet to be tested by the law. As a movie cop might say, "Stick to the facts, Ma'am". There is sufficient debate surrounding this issue by reasonable and rational individuals without political agendas for it to be considered disputed. --Fremantle74, 08:51 18 August 2005

<dd>Because it doesn't state whom considers it genocide. Why does the article need to refer to genocide at all? Stating that aboriginals were displaced by British settlement, had their population decimated by disease, were victim to instances of colonialist violence and were subject to removal of children by religious and state authorities are facts. My only beef is with the leading statement <b>could be considered genocide</b>. Genocide is a modern crime, defined in the 1930s and institutionalised in 1949. Applying a modern moral standard to past events might be useful to demonise those events and push a modern political barrow, but they do nothing to help us understand our history and the reasons behind those events. I consider, with the exception of the isolated out and out slaughter of aborignals by settlers, most dealings with the aboriginals had largely benign motives, wholely in line with the moral code that dictated behaviour of the day. Concluding that the results of interaction were devastating is valid, but ignoring motivation and applying modern morality is a misleading interpretation of history. --Fremantle74, 16:36 August 2005</dd>

<p>If I read my Australian history right, the only reason it was not systematic genocide as strictly defined by todays standards, was that the settlers had neither the manpower nor the technology to carry it out effectively, especially in country as large as Australia is and even more so was then. There seems to be quite a few historians here, are any of you going to claim that whenever white people clashed with aboriginals, it nearly always ended up with dead aboriginals? And yes, we have Tasmania as well. BTW, if are to judge history, how are we to do it, by todays standards or by the standards of the day? And if it was by the standards of the day, was it true back then that systematically killing 50 or 50,000 people was comsidered acceptable?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tonys Flag Contro</span></h2>
<p>While it may be true that there is a big flag controversy I'll be frank, that from a distance in North America reading online The Age, SMH, Brisbane Courier, The Australian, as well as listening to John Laws, 4BC, 3AW and Southern Cross News I have never heard reference to this controversy. That does not mean it has not been an issue in these forums, I only state that I have never come across it or heard it discussed in the electronic media. So if it's there, it's not very visible in MHO.</p>
<p>Nothing pops up in google.com.au news on "flag redesign + australia"</p>
<p>Anyway, the placement in the article seems awkward to me where it is, and also seems to make a political point, perhaps POV, that is one sided just by bringing it up. If editorial sentiment says keep the information, I would suggest it be placed in another context/subheading.</p>
<p>The opposition could restate the same issue by saying: "There is a movement in some quarters to keep republican sentiment from destroying the historic relationship of Australia with Great Britain by fighting attempts to redesign the flag..."

<dd>AFAIK, it still is considered an island, just not universally. It's not usually thought of as an island singularly, but rather as an "island continent". I would think this is what Australians are still taught. I accept and was taught that Australia is both the smallest continent and the largest island. Although I think geologist's generally agree that Australia is a continent, some disagree with the island descriptor and insist that Greenland is in fact the largest island. Perhaps "island continent" was a phrase coined in compromise because Australia has features of both formations? I think this should be mentioned as well. However, geology is not really my area (okay, not at all. It's, like, rocks and stuff..:). --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 14:34, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's another aspect. I think the issue is a disagreeance over what an island actually is, beyond that it's surrounded by water. If it were as simple as that, everything landmass could be considered an island. But an island continent, I beleive, is something that could rule out other continents bar Antarctica. Why isn't it, too, considered an island? Perhaps because it is vastly larger than Australia? --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 15:39, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been looking at the article on Island, and it doesn't seem to say what defines an island. I recall in the very distant past reading something saying that an island doesn't have any inland water bodies without outflow to the sea, or something like that. But I'm sure Japan has lakes that are landlocked. So what are the criteria for calling a land mass an island? If we could answer that then we'd know why Australia is an island or not. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadThomson_0474.html" title="User:ChadThomson">ChadThomson</a> 12:56, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is indeed the key. However, when geologists themselves cannot decide, we cannot really progress. As I understand it, geologists still can't offer a resolute definition of either a continent or an island - hence Australia's problem. If a continent is considered in terms of endemism, than Madagascar proves a stumper. Others argue that culture should be considered when determining what constitutes a continent (or island); ie, Europe is a continent because its inhabitants see it such, whereas Australia is also an island by the view of its inhabitants.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 14:29, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although Australian voters rejected a move to become a republic in 1999 by a 55% majority,[5] Australia's links to its British past are increasingly tenuous.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd disagree with this - while it's fair to say that the average urban Australian no longer regards themselves as British, the links between Britain and Australia remain strong and ongoing. What proportion of Australians between 20 and 34 are living in London at any one time? A not insubstantial group - and while the numbers are probably smaller there's no shortage of British backpackers and short-term residents here either. How many expat Poms are living in Perth? How much of each other's television do we watch? And while UK trade and investment levels are smaller than they once were, I think you'll still find that they are proportionately much higher than with other European countries. And most importantly, how damn good has this Ashes series been? :) --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 01:07, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"As Australian links with Britain became increasingly <i><b>attenuated</b></i> after the Second World War, and particularly from the 1970s, Britain and Australia were increasingly thought of as two separate countries with their own distinctive interests. A shared history and culture was part of the context of the relationship, but essentially Britain and Australia were two independent states pursuing their particular interests as they saw fit" (added emphasis)</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Stating that Australian-British ties are increasingly tenuous is a not uncommon observation. Sure, there will always be a cultural bond between the two nations, perhaps more than with any other (bar NZ for us). However, the link, in a political and economic context, has lessened to a point where it can no longer be considered "unique" or "special". As fellow English-speaking countries, interaction is a given, and as similar societies (ie, Commonwealth), it will probably be disproportionate. But <i>tenuous</i> is an accurate observation. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 03:16, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do y'all think?

<li>The question as to whether or not Australians have a right to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">Freedom of speech</a> gave me pause for thought. The <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html#Australia" title="Freedom of speech">Australian section of the Freedom of Speech article</a> mentions how the High Court has interpreted our constitution in the absence of such a right being enshrined in either our constitution, a bill of rights, or any Act of Parliament. It may be worth mentioning this in the Australia article even though it is mentioned elesewhere in the wiki (including at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Australia_c872.html#Bill_of_Rights" title="Constitution of Australia">Constitution_of_Australia#Bill_of_Rights</a>) as it is a distinction from many other nations and not necessarily one that we would expect. For example, by way of contrast, India, another Commonwealth country, has freedom of speech guaranteed overtly within its constitution. Canada has a Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</li>

<p>I can see why one might include the point about free speech in the section on culture though I agree it was not placed in entirely the right spot.

On page 28 Williams points out that this "popular truism" has been stated in relatively recent times by prime ministers Fraser and Keating who he excuses as being poorly advised. He has little time for the historian Laffin though who wrote of the soldierly reputation of the 1st AIF rivalling "that of any army in the entire 3500 year recorded history of warfare" but failed to provide sources for the concensus or name the authoratative "military historians and generals".</li>

NZ had 16,000 (.27 times). France had 1.375m (22.9 times). Using today's population figures just to get a sense of the ballpark as I am not sure where to source 1914 figures.Australia's population est for 2005 (from this article) 20,406,800. Also from Wikipedia: UK 59,834,900 (July 2004 estimate), NZ 4,098,200 (2005 est), France 63,056,200 (Jan 2005). These population figures compared with Australias pop are: UK 2.93 times, NZ .2 times, France 3.1 times. And the casualty rate expressed as % of today's population is Australia .3%, UK 1.19%, NZ .4%, France 2.2%. These proportions seem to substantiate William's claims and hence I would take him against the BBC and leave out the casualty rate claim.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">User:AYArktos</a> | <a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">Talk</a> 20:15, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>It needs to be noted that Australia is shifting into a new political and sociological stage and that a republic is an historical inevitability. Therefore when it is posted that AUS is a commonwealth is is essential to also explain our ever changing political position and to note the change of title to the "Republic of Australia." I didn't say it was a republic. Clearly you didn't read when I explained "soon to be". Also, to clear up about the military changes- all the information that was provided was from the Australian bureau of Statistics (ABS). Everybody knows that Germany and UK forces are the most highly trained and effective fighting forces in the world, and that AUS does cross-train with them. Also, in culture, it is important to show that certain stereotypes are politically incorrect and that my statements once again, were fully justified, also If anyone in AUS likes Australian Rules football then they obviously have no skill or sense of dignity. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> User:Valley2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EValley2_3d3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Valley2">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

However, to be honest I really don't care if you <i>are</i> a university lecturer - your edits will be judged on their merits. Currently, they don't fit into what we are trying to do. I wouldn't presume to tell you how to lecture at a university without at least acquainting myself with some basic operational procedures, why do you think that this site is any different? I've blocked you for 24 hours anyway. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 13:08, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With respect, perhaps you should read the policies before criticising my or others' actions, since these policies are what explain our actions. You certainly don't have "no say": that's what this talk page exists for. When your edits are clearly in violation of policy, they will be removed by others.</dd>

<dd>To touch briefly on your response: I'm happy you are a university lecturer. Many of our editors are professional academics and a great many more have a wide variety of academic qualifications. As an academic, you would be aware that good writing seeks to avoid bias and work on the basis of published sources rather than personal predelictions. But as far as the community is concerned, quality edits are what make a valued contributor ahead of real-world status. To imply that other users deserve less of a say based on the assumption that they have "less experience" than you would be pretty obviously fallacious. For a few specific points:</dd>

<ul>
<li>"a republic is an historical inevitability". This is clearly an opinion rather than a fact, by virtue of its being widely disputed and the contrary position being argued by many. Any hypothetical future change of title is a nebulous future event with no kind of official reference to back it up.</li>
<li>"Everyone knows that . . ." - these are three extremely dangerous words. The ABS does not keep information on how well-trained troops are, which is largely a subjective measure. Your membership of the military does not give you indisputable authority to evaluate other countries' military training practice, not even our own in fact.</li>
<li>Thirdly, your points on AFL suggest to me that your edits are sorely lacking in <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a>.

<dd>While we should definitely avoid implying that they are no longer living there with distinct cultural practices, the sentence is in a paragraph discussing (ancient) history, so it shouldn't hurt to have the whole thing in past tense. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> <a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">(talk)</a> 10:10, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Australia is not and was never a British colony. The states of Australia were all individually British colonies. But this all ceased at federation. Also, the present legal/political sittuation in Australia is not that of a British colony. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 14:17, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's wrong with the category? I take no offense in the notion that my nation was colonized by the British, existing under the Queen's protection and at the expense of the natives.

<dd>Xtra makes the excellent point that <i>Australia</i> is <i>not</i> a former colony.

<dd>Exactly. Australia was a <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominion.html" title="Dominion">Dominion</a> from federation, at which point the colonies ceased to exist.
