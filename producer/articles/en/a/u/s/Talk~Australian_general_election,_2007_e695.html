<p>The following line is simply opinion and assertion without citation: "Labor would also need to win the seat of Wentworth, which has existed since 1901 and never elected a Labor member."

<p>Firstly, what the hell is 'Australian legislative election'? When has any Australian election ever been referred to as a "legislative election"? Or anyone referred to Cth parliament as the 'legislature'? That's one completely counterintuitive title. Commonwealth, Federal, Australian and Parliamentary (or a mix'n'match combination) would all be better adjectives.</p>
<p>Also, given the hate and then love that developed between Evolver of Borg and Adam, the point(s) about the Bennelong entry seem to have been lost.</p>
<p>1. It's not a 'key marginal', any more than any other marginal is 'key'. Seeing that (on any view) there are peculiar factors that may well take it in a different direction to the electorate as a whole, the fate of Bennelong will actually be an unusually poor barometer of which side will win the entire election, compared with other marginals held by similar margins.</p>
<p>2. "This area of Sydney has undergone substantial demographic change" is an unsourced and vague assertion. I mean, pretty much all areas of Sydney have undergone substantial demographic change in the last 50 years. That demographic change is only relevant in the context of this page if it causes an electoral trend (e.g. Richmond, Adelaide, Kooyong). Bennelong's results have displayed no consistent trend over the last 15 years. In lieu of any evidence (which, if it exists, should be referred to), there's no reason to think that Bennelong's demographic change has either been more substantial, or more electorally significant, than anywhere else. I'd recommend just deleting the sentence.203.3.176.10 04:09, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"To gain a majority in the Senate, Labor, the Greens and/or the Democrats would need to win two seats from the Coalition. Given that these parties won three of the six vacancies in each state at the 2001 election, they would have to win four vacancies out of six in two states when these seats come up for re-election in 2007. This is considered unlikely. If Labor or the Greens gain one seat from the Coalition, Steve Fielding of the Family First Party would hold the balance of power."</p>
<p>The author of these comments appears to view the Greens, Democrats and Labor as some kind of block. If the government lost two seats, there would be no majority in the senate. If the government lost two seats, Steven Fielding would not hold the balance of power, he would hold it in conjunction with the Greens and Dems.</p>
<p>"This is considered unlikely". Who consider's it unlikely? Perhaps: "This is unlikely" or, "This would require a signifigant swing against the government" --<a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKieran_Bennett_95ef.html" title="User:Kieran Bennett">Kieran Bennett</a> 10:47, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In reply:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the 1996, 1998 and 2001 parliaments the ALP, Greens and Dems <i>did</i> function as an "anti-Howard bloc" on many issues, although not all (the Dems passing the GST being the most obvious example). If these parties were to gain two seats from the Coalition in 2007 they would no doubt do so again, making a Coalition government's life more difficult.</li>
<li>Fielding's loyalties have not been tested in this parliament because the Coalition has a majority on most issues without him. If the Coalition is re-elected in 2007 but loses one seat to the ALP or Greens, they will need Fielding to pass <i>all</i> legislation, and then his basic loyalties will be exposed. Few doubt that he would support the Coalition most of the time. Thus it is true to say that he would hold the balance of power, between the Coalition and the ALP-Green anti-Howard bloc.</li>
<li>I am happy to change "This is considered unlikely" to "This would require a signifigant swing" - I haven't worked out exactly what swing would be needed in which states for the Coalition to lose one, let alone two seats (swing is a slipperly concept in Senate elections), but I would imagine the required swing is substantial. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 11:47, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>But this statement still implies that Labor and the Greens/Dems are guaranteed to vote against the Liberals on all legislation. Of course they would vote against the Liberals while they were in power- smaller parties have a history of "ganging up" on the govt to block legislation- who is to say they would not do the same should Labor win the election? Besides there have been notable points in history when Liberal/Greens or Liberal/Dems <b>have</b> teamed up to pass legislation (Liberal/Dems for the GST to pass and Liberal/Greens for the 2005 Budget to pass before the coalition had a senate majority on July 1 of that year). <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonan.evans_06cb.html" title="User:Ronan.evans">Ronan.evans</a> 10:50, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have already answered both those points. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 11:54, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I changed the section slightly to point out that Feilding would only hold balance if Labor/Greens/Dems did vote together. Hope it is acceptable to both sides. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonan.evans_06cb.html" title="User:Ronan.evans">Ronan.evans</a> 02:30, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your latest edit works well. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonan.evans_06cb.html" title="User:Ronan.evans">Ronan.evans</a> 08:19, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I also changed the section. It was inconsistent, in that it at one point referred to Labor, the Greens and the Democrats as a group, while at other points it assumed that no Democrats were elected. While I don't believe that the Dems will get anyone elected, it's either one way or the other, and to keep it safe we should include them with that "left bloc". I also moved the list of Senators facing re-election. It's listed as a subchapter in the Senate section, but the rest of the section is then listed under that subchapter. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraue_8793.html" title="User:Braue">Ben Raue</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraue_14e3.html" title="User talk:Braue">Talk</a>) 08:21, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I tried to fix up this section, but talking about what it would require for the Coalition to lose majority, which is much simpler than talking about Labor/Democrats/Greens acting as a block which is clearly not true (eg GST). Also I added that if Labor wins the lower house they'll almost certainly have to work with a minority upper house. <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESad_mouse_6053.html" title="User:Sad mouse">Sad mouse</a> 18:23, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I quote the article:</p>
<pre>
   * Tasmania: 3.34
   * Victoria: 3.27
   * New South Wales: 3.20
   * South Australia: 3.12
   * Western Australia: 2.97
   * Queensland: 2.74
</pre>
<p>Notice the Non Labor/Democrats/Greens parties got only 3.73 quota's in Victoria (7 quotas roughly make a whole) yet still managed to get 4 seats. The assumption that 4 quotas are needed for 4 seats is incorrect. Frevidar 13:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are wrong. The ALP and the Democrats have never won four seats between them at a half-Senate election in Victoria. Of course you don't need four quotas in primary votes to win four seats: you need four quotas after preferences. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 14:25, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Although the wording was confusing Frevidar is actually right, since he was talking about the Libs/Nats/FF, not ALP/Dem. Yes, it is obvious that the four quotas are after preferences, but that means that it is wrong for the article to use the primary votes to calculate the increase needed to gain seats from the government. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 14:57, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aside from Gwydir what will the proposals mean for the other named seats? (and how much will the final changes be different from the proposals?) J.J. Popplewick 12:04, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A few things:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Greenway - goes from being very marginal Liberal to safe Liberal</li>
<li>Hughes - becomes more marginal Liberal</li>
<li>Macarthur - has shifted away from the ALP recently, now has been pushed out of reach by being pushed further out of Sydney.</li>
<li>Farrer - inclusion of Broken Hill makes it more friendly to ALP.</li>
<li>Macquarie - lost Hawkesbury and gained Lithgow and Bathurst, will become marginal and possible gain for ALP in 2007.</li>
<li>Calare - Peter Andren's seat has been split in two, making it difficult to predict how Andren would perform in the new Calare, which includes only half of the old Calare.</li>
<li>Apparently Lindsay (Penrith), Wentworth (Eastern Suburbs) and Bennelong (Ryde &amp; Epping) have also become more marginal Liberal seats. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraue_8793.html" title="User:Braue">Ben Raue</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraue_14e3.html" title="User talk:Braue">Talk</a>) 14:06, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't done any calculations yet (I am in Thailand this week), but that all seems to be correct. The only really important changes are the abolition of Gwydir, the conversion of Greenway into a safe Liberal seat and the change of Macquarie from Liberal to Labor. Hughes certainly becomes more winnable, particularly if Vale retires. The changes in Wentworth and Bennelong are fairly minor. Broken Hill only has 13,000 voters these days and doesn't make Farrer loseable for the Libs. I would think Andren can win Calare on any boundaries, although since he is from Bathurst he might run in Macquarie which would be very interesting. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:48, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Will there be any major changes in the final boundaries compared to the proposals? J.J. Popplewick 08:54, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It has been known to happen. The abolition of Gwydir and the creation of a very big Parkes is open to challenge on community of interest grounds. An alternative would be abolishing Farrer and dividing it between Riverina and Parkes, while ceding parts of Parkes to Grydir. That would avoid creating a huge western NSW seat. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 03:31, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here are some rough calculations of the new 2-party majorities in the most marginal government seats. They are literally "original research" (by me) so I suppose they can't be used, but I will leave that to others. Possibly if I post them to my own website someone else can cite them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Macquarie NSW (Kerry Bartlett, Lib) ALP 0.5 (changed by redistribution)</li>
<li>Kingston SA (Kym Richardson) Liberal 0.1</li>
<li>Bonner Qld (Ross Vasta) Liberal 1.0</li>
<li>Parramatta NSW (Julie Owens, ALP) Liberal 1.0 (changed by redistribution)</li>
<li>Wakefield SA (David Fawcett) Liberal 0.7</li>
<li>Makin SA (Trish Draper) Liberal 0.9</li>
<li>Braddon Tas (Mark Baker) Liberal 1.1</li>
<li>Hasluck WA (Stuart Henry) Liberal 1.8</li>
<li>Stirling WA (Michael Keenan) Liberal 2.0</li>
<li>Wentworth NSW (Malcolm Turnbull) Liberal 2.5</li>
<li>Bass Tas (Michael Ferguson) Liberal 2.6</li>
<li>Solomon NT (David Tollner) Liberal 2.8</li>
<li>Lindsay NSW (Jacquie Kelly) Liberal 2.9</li>
<li>Moreton Qld (Gary Hardgrave) Liberal 3.0</li>
<li>Eden-Monaro NSW (Gary Nairn) Liberal 3.3</li>
<li>Bennelong NSW (John Howard Liberal 4.1</li>
<li>Dobell NSW (Ross Ticehurst) Liberal 4.8</li>
<li>McMillan Vic (Russell Broadbent) Liberal 4.9</li>
<li>Blair Qld (Cameron Thompson) Liberal 5.0</li>
<li>Page NSW (Ian Causley) National 5.5</li>
<li>Wright Qld (new seat) National 6.0</li>
<li>Longman Qld (Mal Brough) Liberal 6.0</li>
<li>Herbert Qld (Peter Kindsay) Liberal 6.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Two seats have changed sides - Macquarie from Lib to ALP and Parramatta vice versa. Thus Labor still needs 16 seats, everything down to Dobell. If Bartlett holds Macquarie Labor will need McMillian as well. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 04:06, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Government marginals are much more important, because they are the seats that the Opposition must win to gain government. When the redistribution is finished we can add a complete table. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 04:48, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The way it is at the moment implies there are no seats that the Govnt can win, therefore it is unbalanced. Either have tables for both or neither.</dd>

<p>I don't believe that government and opposition should be treated equally on an issue like this. The truth is that government marginals are more important than opposition marginals. If the government wins opposition seats, the composition of Parliament changes, but the government stays with the same party. Yet if the opposition wins enough seats, then the government will change. But I'll add a clause stating that Labor may well lose seats, etc. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraue_8793.html" title="User:Braue">Ben Raue</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraue_14e3.html" title="User talk:Braue">Talk</a>) 08:27, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As it stands at the moment either Julie Owens, Labor Member for Parramatta, needs to be removed from the list and the 16th most marginal <b>Coalition</b> parties' seat added or we need to change the phrasing of the introductory paragraph: <i>On the new boundaries, the following are the Coalition parties' 16 most marginal seats.

<p>Perhaps some detail on Howard vs Beazley would be good. Look at 19/07/06:Personality traits of Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition on <a href="http://www.newspoll.com.au/cgi-bin/polling/display_poll_data.pl?url_caller=latest&amp;state=Any&amp;mode=file&amp;page=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.newspoll.com.au/cgi-bin/polling/display_poll_data.pl?url_caller=latest&amp;state=Any&amp;mode=file&amp;page=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.newspoll.com.au/cgi-bin/polling/display_poll_data.pl?url_caller=latest&amp;state=Any&amp;mode=file&amp;page=Search</a> ... Howard has the numbers on decisiveness, vision, and understanding of major issues, whilst Beazley has the numbers on caring for people, being likeable, in touch with the voters, and more trustworthy. I was quite suprised myself at how well Beazley had done in those areas. Perhaps a preferred PM section should be written up in the article by someone, or do people prefer to keep the leaders of the parties out of it? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 18:06, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can we use numbers from a commercial poll? There is no doubt that they are both excellent, though quite different, leaders. Elections nowadays are usually "presidential" style, with the campaign depending on the leader to a huge extent. Look at Latham last time around - any number of excellent Labor candidates musy have been grinding their teeth over the way he performed, and the Liberal newcomers elected then would probably be John Howard's strongest supporters. We should focus on the leaders, but it would be difficult to keep POV out of such intangibles as "likeableness" etc. I've fixed the image as best I can. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a></dd>

<p>Is there any reason why someone keeps on deleting what are cited by the media as the main issues in the lead-up to the election? One would think that a list of those topics most highly cited by political commentators as election issues would be worth mentioning in an article on the election. This is the text I added:</p>
<p><i>Issues expected to play the highest importance in the upcoming election campaign include Howard's controversial advocacy of nuclear energy, global warming policies, new pro-business Industrial Relations laws, increases in interest rates, the corruption in the AWB, Iraq war policy, and Beazley's personal unpopularity.</i></p>
<p>Okay, it isn't great, but it is kind of hard for people to work on improving it when it is constantly deleted. I honestly can't see why people are citing this as original research, each of these issues gets major play in the Australian media in regards to the 2007 election.</p>

<dd>Fixing the section is easier the more decent stuff there is to work with. "Predicted by the Australian media" is better than the original "expected", but still seems quite weaselly. However, the main problem is that most of the references given don't actually back up what is claimed in the sentence. It <i>is</i> original research to take the issues you see most mentioned in the media and say that they are predicted as the highest importance issues. (It's arguably even OR to say that they are the issues most mentioned in the media.) Yes, it's worth mentioning important issues, but it's hard enough to do that well aftdr the election, and takes even more care now. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 12:47, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To try to impart an understanding of the election to our readers without some discussion of the key issues would be impossible.

<p>When you say "corrections," bear in mind that there is no absolutely "correct" version of the pendulum, because NSW and Qld have been redistributed, and the 2-party majorities for seats in these states must be guesswork.

<p>Attention whoever is creating and inserting enormous tables: I know making tables is fun, but they must be of a proportionate size to their importance in the article. I have removed the table showing the complete membership of the Senate: it is not directly relevant to this article.

<p>I disagree. First, I have only ever seen the pendulum published with the most marginal at the bottom - as the pendulum metaphor implies (a motionless pendulum points down, to 0%). Second, the state of the parties in the Senate, and in the reps, is directly relevant to this article. The table consolidates the available information and makes it comprehensive. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestella_3257.html" title="User:Joestella">Joestella</a> 11:28, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The state of the parties in the Senate and the Reps can be stated in two sentences, and indeed is already stated. It doesn't need two humungous and not-very-clear tables. I agree that in a standard pendulum the marginal seats appear at the bottom, but the table as presented is not really a pendulum, it is two parallel lists. The important information in this list is: what are the 16 most vulnerable government seats? This should appear at the top where it can be seen most readily. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 11:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "pendulum" is a standard feature of Australian politics, and it is drawn with the marginals at the bottom.

<p>I don't think anybody cares about AWB to the extent of it swaying a vote, and I am surprised to find it listed as one of the major issues. --<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Pete</a> 00:50, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I found the best way to tackle this when I worked toward getting the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Australian_general_election%2C_2006_f5b5.html" title="South Australian general election, 2006">2006 South Australian general election</a> rated as one of Wikipedia's featured articles is to simply include every single issue you can find as long as you can provide citation for it - that way there can be no claims of bias. And also, the issues section does not belong in the lead. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 01:02, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've reworded it a bit. Have removed AWB. + I agree with Timeshift, it shouldn't be in the lead. <a href="../../../j/m/o/User%7EJmount_2263.html" title="User:Jmount">Rafy</a> 14:58, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not too sure Preferred prime-minister/2PP ratings should be included in the top table below the pictures of Howard and Rudd. To put them in a table like that is to present them as fact- yet they are merely a reflection of a poll of a relatively small - albeit representative - slice of the Australian population. By all means keep the table of poll results futher down the page because that explains the results are not fact - just a poll result. The 2PP of the last election should probably be kept in the top table because it is an accurate reflection of an actual election result. If one wants to keep the Preffered PM and 2PP section in the top table it should probably be labelled as "AC Neilsen Poll - Preffered PM" and "AC Neilsen Poll - 2PP" to reflect that these are just poll results - and not fact. Might be worth including Newspoll results there as well. Hope I havent put anyone out and rest assured this is not a critisism of the person who included these stats in the table, in fact thanks for taking the time to try and improve this article.

<dd>I agree. Remove them from the top table, especially since there are multiple pollsters. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 01:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
