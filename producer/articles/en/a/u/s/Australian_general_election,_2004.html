<p>The Coalition parties won 46.7% of the primary vote, a gain of 3.7% over the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_legislative_election%2C_2001.html" title="Australian legislative election, 2001">2001 election</a>. The opposition <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a> polled 37.6%, a loss of 0.2%. The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Greens_3689.html" title="Australian Greens">Australian Greens</a> emerged as the most prominent minor party, polling 7.2%, a gain of 2.2%. Both the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Democrats_2114.html" title="Australian Democrats">Australian Democrats</a> and <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Nation_Party_46fb.html" title="One Nation Party">One Nation</a> had their vote greatly reduced. After a notional distribution of preferences, the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Electoral_Commission_268c.html" title="Australian Electoral Commission">Australian Electoral Commission</a> estimated that the Coalition had polled 52.74% of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_electoral_system.html" title="Australian electoral system">two-party preferred vote</a>, a gain of 1.7% from 2001.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party won 74 seats, the National Party 12 seats and the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_Liberal_Party_9e6c.html" title="Country Liberal Party">Country Liberal Party</a> (the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Territory_b19a.html" title="Northern Territory">Northern Territory</a> branch of the Liberal Party) one seat, against the Labor opposition's 60 seats. Three independent members were re-elected. The Coalition also won 39 seats in the 76-member <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Senate_6fa9.html" title="Australian Senate">Senate</a>, making the Howard Government the first government to have a majority in the Senate since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>. The size of the government's win was unexpected: few commentators had predicted that the coalition would actually increase its majority in the House of Representatives, and almost none had foreseen its gaining a majority in the Senate. Even Howard had described that feat as "a big ask."</p>
<p>The election result was a triumph for Howard, who in December <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> became Australia's second-longest serving Prime Minister, and who saw the election result as a vindication of his policies, particularly his decision to join in the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. The results were a setback for the Labor leader, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Latham_1e63.html" title="Mark Latham">Mark Latham</a>, and contributed to his resignation in January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. It made Labor's task in winning <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_legislative_election%2C_2007.html" title="Australian legislative election, 2007">the next election</a> more difficult. (A provisional pendulum for the House of Representatives can be seen at <a href="http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/2004/pendulum2004.txt" class="external text" title="http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/2004/pendulum2004.txt" rel="nofollow">Adam Carr's Electoral Archive</a>. It shows that in order to win the next election, Labor will need to win 16 seats, which could be generated if it picked up a nationally-uniform swing of about 5%.) However, <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Beazley_97c0.html" title="Kim Beazley">Kim Beazley</a> said that the accession of Latham to the ALP leadership, in December 2003, had rescued the party from a much heavier defeat. <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/09/1097261866624.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/09/1097261866624.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Beazley stated that polling a year before the election indicated that the ALP would lose "25-30 seats" in the House of Representatives. Instead the party lost a net four seats in the House, a swing of 0.21%. There was a 1.1% swing <i>to</i> the ALP in the Senate. The fact that the Coalition gained control of the Senate was enabled only by a collapse in first preferences for the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Democrats_2114.html" title="Australian Democrats">Australian Democrats</a> and <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Nation_Party_46fb.html" title="One Nation Party">One Nation</a>.</p>

The Coalition thus had a net gain of four seats.</p>
<p>The Liberal and National parties run joint tickets in some states. The figures under "Seats" show the number of Senate seats won at this election. These have been added to the number of seats won in 2001 to give the total number of seats in Senate which each party will hold after July 1 2005, when the new Senators take their seats.</p>
<p>The National and Liberal Parties won the fifth and sixth Senate seats in Queensland, thus giving the Coalition 39 seats and outright control of the Senate. Labor won the final Senate seats in New South Wales and South Australia, giving it 28 seats. The Greens won the final Senate seats in Western Australia and Tasmania, increasing their Senate seats from 2 to 4.</p>

<p>John Howard told the press conference that the election would be about trust. "Who do you trust to keep the economy strong and protect family living standards?" he asked "Who do you trust to keep interest rates low? Who do you trust to lead the fight on Australia's behalf against international terrorism?"</p>
<p>Howard, who turned 65 in July, declined to answer questions about whether he would serve a full three-year term if his government was re-elected. "I will serve as long as my party wants me to," he said.

<p>The campaign began with Labor leading in all published national opinion polls.

Most commentators, however, expected the election to be very close, pointing out that Labor was also ahead in the polls at the comparable point of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_legislative_election%2C_1998.html" title="Australian legislative election, 1998">1998 election</a>, which Howard won.

To secure government in its own right, Labor needed to win twelve more seats than in the 2001 election. In the same poll, John Howard increased his lead over Mark Latham as preferred Prime Minister by four points.

<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">September 9</a>, during the second week of campaigning the election was rocked by a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Jakarta_embassy_bombing_6faf.html" title="2004 Jakarta embassy bombing">terrorist attack</a> on the Australian <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embassy.html" title="Embassy">embassy</a> in <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jakarta.html" title="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>.

Mark Latham committed the Labor's "full support to all efforts by the Australian and Indonesian governments to ensure that happens". The parties reached an agreement that campaigning would cease for <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_10.html" title="September 10">September 10</a> out of respect for the victims of this attack and that this would be in addition to the cessation of campaigning already agreed upon for <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">September 11</a> out of respect for the victims of the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11_terrorist_attacks.html" title="September 11 terrorist attacks">September 11 terrorist attacks</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.

<p>A debate between John Howard and Mark Latham was televised commercial-free on the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Network_03d3.html" title="Nine Network">Nine Network</a> at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a>. In a change from previous election debates, which involved a single moderator, the leaders were questioned by a five member panel representing each of the major media groups in Australia. There was a representative from commercial television (<a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurie_Oakes_b6c7.html" title="Laurie Oakes">Laurie Oakes</a>), the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation_9631.html" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">ABC</a> (Jim Middleton), <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_Corporation_d115.html" title="News Corporation">News Limited</a> (Malcolm Farr), <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Fairfax_Holdings_dbd9.html" title="John Fairfax Holdings">John Fairfax Holdings</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Grattan_4d79.html" title="Michelle Grattan">Michelle Grattan</a>) and radio (<a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Mitchell_ef29.html" title="Neil Mitchell">Neil Mitchell</a>). After an opening address, Howard and Latham responded to questions posed by the panel and had the opportunity to make a closing statement. The Nine Network permitted other television organisations to transmit the feed, but only the ABC decided to.</p>
<p>The debate was followed (only on the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Network_03d3.html" title="Nine Network">Nine Network</a>) by an analysis of the leaders' performance by the "<a href="../../../w/o/r/Worm_%28marketing%29.html" title="Worm (marketing)">worm</a>". The worm works by analysing the approval or disapproval of a select group of undecided voters to each statement that a leader makes. Throughout the debate, according to the worm, Latham performed strongly and Howard performed poorly. A final poll of the focus group found that 67% of the focus group believed that Latham won the debate and that 33% of the focus group believed that Howard won. Major media outlets generally agreed that Latham had won the debate, although they pointed out that with no further debates scheduled and nearly four weeks of the campaign remaining, Latham's gain in the momentum from the debate was unlikely to be decisive. Political commentators noted that the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> election debate, between Howard and then opposition leader <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Beazley_97c0.html" title="Kim Beazley">Kim Beazley</a>, gave the same worm results yet Labor still lost that election.</p>

<p>By the midpoint of the campaign, after Labor had released its policies on taxation and education, polls showed that the election was still too close to call. The Newspoll in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Australian_d6f4.html" title="The Australian">The Australian</a></i>, showed (<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_21.html" title="September 21">September 21</a>) Labor leading with 52.5% of the two-party vote.

A Galaxy Poll in the Melbourne <i><a href="../../../h/e/r/Herald_Sun_1ee3.html" title="Herald Sun">Herald Sun</a></i> showed the Coalition ahead with 51%, but showed Labor gaining ground.</p>
<p>Despite Latham's strong performance in the debate, most political commentators argued that he had not gained a clear advantage over Howard. They pointed to anomalies in Labor's tax policy and the controversy surrounding Labor's policy of reducing government funding to some non-government schools as issues which Howard was successfully exploiting.</p>

<p>In the last days of the campaign the environment policies regarding the logging of Tasmania's old-growth forests were released by both major parties, but too late for the Greens to adjust their preference flows on how-to-vote cards in most electorates as the majority were already printed. In the game of "cat and mouse" on Tasmanian forest policy between Mark Latham and John Howard, Latham eventually lost out when <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Adams_%28politician%29_281d.html" title="Dick Adams (politician)">Dick Adams</a> (Labor member for the <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmanian</a> seat of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Lyons_29d8.html" title="Division of Lyons">Lyons</a>), Tasmanian Labor Premier <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Lennon_1fbb.html" title="Paul Lennon">Paul Lennon</a> and CFMEU's Tasmanian secretary Scott McLean all attacked Latham's forest policy. At a timber workers' rally on the day Labor's forestry policy was announced, Scott McLean asked those gathered to pass a resolution of no confidence in Mr Latham's ability to lead the country<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200410/s1219546.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200410/s1219546.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_O%27Connor_7584.html" title="Michael O'Connor">Michael O'Connor</a>, assistant national secretary of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Construction%2C_Forestry%2C_Mining_and_Energy_Union_6275.html" title="Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union">CFMEU</a> said the Coalition's forest policy represented a much better deal for his members than Labor's policy <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/Election-2004/Howard-trades-trees-for-jobs/2004/10/06/1096949589167.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/news/Election-2004/Howard-trades-trees-for-jobs/2004/10/06/1096949589167.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Australian Labor Party national president <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmen_Lawrence_05ac.html" title="Carmen Lawrence">Carmen Lawrence</a> later said that "Labor has only itself to blame for the backlash over its forestry policy" and that it was a strategic mistake to release the policy so late in the election campaign.

<p>Treasury and the Department of Finance reported on the validity of Labor's costings of their promises. They claimed to identify a different flaw to that identified by Liberal Treasurer Costello, but overall Labor was satisfied with the report.</p>

<p>The final opinion polls continued to be somewhat contradictory, with Newspoll showing a 50-50 tie and the Fairfax papers reporting 54-46 to the Coalition.

<p>As in all Australian elections, the flow of preferences from minor parties can be crucial in determining the final outcome. The close of nominations was followed by a period of bargaining among the parties. Howard made a pitch for the preferences of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Greens_3689.html" title="Australian Greens">Australian Greens</a> by appearing to offer concessions on the issue of logging in old-growth forests in <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, and the Coalition directed its preferences to the Greens ahead of Labor in the Senate, but the Greens nevertheless decided to allocate preferences to Labor in most electorates. In exchange, Labor agreed to direct its preferences in the Senate to the Greens ahead of the Democrats (but critically, not ahead of other minor parties), increasing the chances that the Greens would displace <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Democrats_2114.html" title="Australian Democrats">Australian Democrats</a> Senators in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia.</p>
<p>The Democrats in turn did a preference deal with the <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_First_Party_1e5d.html" title="Family First Party">Family First Party</a>, which angered some Democrats supporters who viewed Family First's policies as incompatible with the Democrats'.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_general_election%2C_2004.html" title="Edit section: The effect of preference deals on Senate outcomes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The effect of preference deals on Senate outcomes</span></h3>
<p>In <b>Victoria</b>, Family First, the Christian Democrats and the DLP allocated their senate preferences to Labor, in order to help ensure the re-election of the number three Labor Senate candidate, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacinta_Collins_0b38.html" title="Jacinta Collins">Jacinta Collins</a>, a Catholic who has conservative views on some social issues such as <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a>. In exchange, Labor gave its Senate preferences in Victoria to Family First ahead of the Greens, expecting Family First to be eliminated before these preferences were distributed. In the event, however, Labor and Democrat preferences helped Family First's <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Fielding_570e.html" title="Steve Fielding">Steve Fielding</a> beat the Green's <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Risstrom_9227.html" title="David Risstrom">David Risstrom</a> to win the last Victorian Senate seat <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/10/1097406425742.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/10/1097406425742.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and become Family First's first Federal parliamentarian. This outcome generated some controversy and highlighted a lack of transparency in preference deals. Family First were elected in Victoria after receiving 1.88% of the vote, even though the Greens had the largest minor party share of the vote with 8.8%. In Australia, 95% of voters vote "above the line" in the Senate<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/guide/senatevotingsystem.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/guide/senatevotingsystem.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Many "above the line" voters do not access preference allocation listings, although they are available in polling booths and on the AEC website, so they are therefore unaware of where their vote may go. The end result was one Family First, three Liberal and two Labor Senators elected in Victoria.</p>
<p>In <b>Tasmania</b>, Family First and the Democrats also directed their Senate preferences to Labor, apparently to preclude the possibility of the Liberals winning a majority in the Senate and thus reducing the influence of the minor parties. The Australian Green's <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Milne_2463.html" title="Christine Milne">Christine Milne</a> only narrowly gained her Senate seat before a Family First candidate, despite nearly obtaining the full required quota of primary votes. It was only the high incidence of "below the line" voting in Tasmania that negated the effect of the preference swap deal between Labor and Family First <a href="http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=3359" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=3359" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. The end result was one Green, three Liberal and two Labor Senators elected in Tasmania.</p>
<p>In <b>New South Wales</b>, Democrat preferences flowing to Labor rather than the Greens were instrumental in Labor winning the last Senate seat. Had Democrat preferences flown to the Greens rather than Liberals for Forests and the Christian Democrats, then the final vacancy would have been won by the Greens' <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kaye_7219.html" title="John Kaye">John Kaye</a>. The scale of Glenn Druery's (of the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberals_for_Forests_1d85.html" title="Liberals for Forests">Liberals for Forests</a> party) preference deals was revealed by the large number of ticket votes distributed when he was eliminated from the count. He gained preferences from a wide range of minor parties such as the Ex-Service Service and Veterans Party, the Outdoor Recreation Party, and the Non-Custodial Parents Party. Liberals for Forests also gained the preferences of two leftish parties - the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Labour_Party_e73e.html" title="Progressive Labour Party">Progressive Labour Party</a> and the <a href="../../../h/e/m/HEMP_Party_86a0.html" title="HEMP Party">HEMP Party</a>. When Druery was eventually excluded, these preferences flowed to the Greens, but the Greens would rather have received the preferences earlier in the count. In the end, three Liberal/National Senators and three Labor Senators were elected in New South Wales. <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/results/sendNSW.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/results/sendNSW.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p>In <b>Western Australia</b>, the Green's <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Siewert_db6c.html" title="Rachel Siewert">Rachel Siewert</a> was elected to the final vacancy after the final Labor candidate was excluded. This was a gain for the Greens at the expense of the Democrats <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Greig_4792.html" title="Brian Greig">Brian Greig</a>. While the Democrats had done a preference swap with Family First, the deal in Western Australia did not include the Christian Democrats. As a result, when the Australian Democrats were excluded from the count, their preferences flowed to the Greens, putting them on track for the final vacancy<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/results/sendWA.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/results/sendWA.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. The end result was one Green, three Liberal and two Labor Senators elected in Western Australia.</p>
<p>In <b>South Australia</b>, the Australian Democrats did a crucial preference swap with Family First that prevented the Greens winning the final vacancy. If the Democrats had polled better, they would have collected Family First and Liberal preferences and won the final vacancy. Former Democrat Leader (now Progressive Alliance Senator) <a href="../../../m/e/g/Meg_Lees_1614.html" title="Meg Lees">Meg Lees</a> also contested the Senate in South Australia, but was eliminated late in the count. However, Lees did have some impact on the outcome, as there were large numbers of below the line preferences for both the Progressive Alliance (as well as One Nation) which were widely spread rather than flowing to the Democrats. When the Democrats were excluded, preferences flowed to Family First which prevented the Greens' <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Noone_7a0b.html" title="Brian Noone">Brian Noone</a> passing the third Labor candidate. This resulted in a seat that could otherwise have been won by the Greens instead being won by Labor on Green preferences. The flow of One Nation preferences to Labor made it impossible for either Family First or the Liberal Party to win the final vacancy. Labor's <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dana_Wortley_6076.html" title="Dana Wortley">Dana Wortley</a> was elected to the final vacancy<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/results/sendSA.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/results/sendSA.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. The end result in South Australia was split 3 Liberal, 3 Labor.</p>
<p>In <b>Queensland</b>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_Hanson_2918.html" title="Pauline Hanson">Pauline Hanson</a> attracted 38,000 below the line votes and pulled away from One Nation. Preferences from the Fishing Party kept the National Party’s <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnaby_Joyce_b32c.html" title="Barnaby Joyce">Barnaby Joyce</a> ahead of Family First and Pauline Hanson. Joyce then unexpectedly won the fifth vacancy ahead of the Liberal Party. The sixth and last vacancy was then won by Liberal <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Trood_1a0c.html" title="Russell Trood">Russell Trood</a><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/results/sendQLD.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/results/sendQLD.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. The final outcome was 1 National, 3 Liberals and 2 Labor.</p>
<p>The election of both Barnaby Joyce and Russell Trood to the Senate in Queensland resulted in the Coalition gaining control of the Senate and was confirmed by the National Party's Senate Leader <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Boswell_a62b.html" title="Ron Boswell">Ron Boswell</a>'s in a televised telephone call to Prime Minister <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1230231.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1230231.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.

<p>Despite constant media attention on preference deals, and a widely held belief that the two party preferred result for the election would be close, the Newspoll figures during the three months prior to the election showed little alteration in the first preference margin between the parties, nor was there any evidence of any voter volatility. The figures suggested, then, that as the Coalition’s first preference vote was healthy, the most likely result was a Government victory. This was born out in the election results when the Liberal first preference vote of 40.5 per cent was 3.4 percentage points higher than in 2001, while Labor’s first preference vote of 37.6 per cent was its lowest vote since the elections of 1931 and 1934 <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RB/2004-05/05rb13.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RB/2004-05/05rb13.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. Preference flows from minor parties are much more likely to affect an election outcome when the two major parties are close. The collapse of Labor's primary vote therefore negated this effect, even though 61 out of 150 House of Representative seats were decided on preferences <a href="http://results.aec.gov.au/12246/results/HouseSeatsDecidedOnPrefs-12246-NAT.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://results.aec.gov.au/12246/results/HouseSeatsDecidedOnPrefs-12246-NAT.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> had been an MP since <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, leader of the Liberal Party since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> (he was previously leader from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>), and Prime Minister since March <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>. He turned 65 in July <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, and is more than 20 years older than Mark Latham. Howard is by far the most experienced politician in Australian federal politics and is considered a master of political strategy, a reputation which was enhanced during the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> campaign. Although most commentators agreed that he did not perform in well in the debate with Latham, his dogged campaigning on interest rates, economic certainty and national security was effective in persuading voters in marginal seats to stick with the Coalition.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Anderson_%28Australian_politician%29_2df6.html" title="John Anderson (Australian politician)">John Anderson</a> had been an MP since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> and leader of the National Party and <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Australia_af2a.html" title="Deputy Prime Minister of Australia">Deputy Prime Minister</a> since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. Although talented and personable, he was unable to stem the long-term decline in the Nationals' rural electoral base. During <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> he considered retiring from Parliament at this election, but was persuaded not to. Despite his personal standing, the Nationals lost another seat (Richmond) and struggled to win a Senate spot in Queensland. Anderson stepped down as leader in July <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Latham_1e63.html" title="Mark Latham">Mark Latham</a> had been an MP since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> and was elected leader of the Australian Labor Party in December <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. Latham initially made a good impression, but a series of controversies during <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> caused much criticism of his alleged inconsistency and volatility. His campaign was aggressive and colourful, with a series of bold policy announcements late in the campaign. This galvanised Labor's base but many commentators felt that Latham's policies and personality alienated middle class voters. In retrospect Labor's forests policy was a major miscalculation, costing two seats in Tasmania. Latham also failed to effectively counter Howard's campaign on interest rates. Latham resigned for health reasons in January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> from both his position as Leader of the Opposition and as Member for Werriwa in the House of Representatives.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Bartlett_4d25.html" title="Andrew Bartlett">Andrew Bartlett</a> had been a Senator since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> and leader of the Australian Democrats since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. His efforts to revive the Democrats' fortunes after a year of damaging internal conflict were severely set back by an incident in December <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> in which he accosted Liberal Senator <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jeannie_Ferris_9d19.html" title="Jeannie Ferris">Jeannie Ferris</a> in the Senate chamber while visibly drunk. After keeping a low profile during <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, he led the Democrats to their worst-ever election performance. After the election he was replaced by Senator <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyn_Allison_a2a8.html" title="Lyn Allison">Lyn Allison</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Brown_5419.html" title="Bob Brown">Bob Brown</a> had been a Senator and the informal leader of the Australian Greens since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>. By resolutely opposing Australia's participation in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">Iraq War</a> he established himself as the most prominent figure of the Australian <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left.html" title="Left">left</a>. But media predictions that the Greens would greatly increase their vote and win a Senate seat in every state, or even win House seats, were not realised. Although the Greens took many votes from the Democrats, predicted big inroads into Labor's base vote did not occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Howard and Brown were thus the only leaders of Parliamentary parties to make gains at the elections, and the only ones who retained their leadership positions ten months after the elections.</p>
