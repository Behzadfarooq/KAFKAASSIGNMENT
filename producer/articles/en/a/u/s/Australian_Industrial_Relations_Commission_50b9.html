<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission_50b9.html" title="Edit section: The Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration</span></h3>
<p>Originally it was The <b>Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration</b></p>
<p>The court was created in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a> by the <i>Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904</i>, an Act of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Australia_68dd.html" title="Parliament of Australia">Parliament of Australia</a>. Its functions were to hear and <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitration.html" title="Arbitration">arbitrate</a> industrial disputes, and to make <a href="../../../a/w/a/Award_%28Australian_industrial_relations%29_2072.html" title="Award (Australian industrial relations)">awards</a>. It also had the judicial functions of interpreting and enforcing awards, and to hear other criminal and civil cases relating to industrial relations law. The court's first President was <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Court_of_Australia_754b.html" title="High Court of Australia">High Court</a> Justice <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_O%27Connor_%28Australian_politician%29_b722.html" title="Richard O'Connor (Australian politician)">Richard O'Connor</a>.</p>
<p>The early role of the <b>Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration</b> was clear. It resolved industrial disputes which extended beyond the limits of any one state. In practice this became a system of 'paper disputes' where a union or other employee organisation would write to a group of employers and demand certain terms and conditions (<b>a log of demand</b>). The Employers would then reject part or all of the demands creating an industrial dispute. This dispute would then be arbitrated on, the result of the arbitration was an <b>Industrial <a href="../../../a/w/a/Award.html" title="Award">Award</a></b>.</p>
<p>The court was initially less important than the various <a href="../../../s/t/a/States_and_territories_of_Australia_07c2.html" title="States and territories of Australia">State</a> commissions, which had jurisdiction over all disputes which occurred within states. The court's workload was so low that it only made six awards in the first five years after it was created.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_six_awards"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/s/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission_50b9.html#endnote_six_awards" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/s/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission_50b9.html#endnote_six_awards" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span> One of these early awards was the famous <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvester_Judgement_95c9.html" title="Harvester Judgement">Harvester Judgment</a>, delivered by <a href="../../../h/2E/b/H.B._Higgins_83aa.html" title="H.B. Higgins">H.B. Higgins</a>, which first introduced the concept of the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Living_wage.html" title="Living wage">living wage</a> (also known as a basic wage). Another of its early acts was to set the standard <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_time.html" title="Working time">working week</a> at 48 hours.</p>
<p>However through a sequence of High Court authorities over the first twenty years of Federation, it became clear that by this process, the <b>Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration</b> could exercise broad jurisdiction over a wide range of industries. However, it could not create an industry wide award, rather all of the employers who were to be bound by the Award had to be personally involved in the dispute. (which in practice meant that a log of claims needed to be served on them).</p>
<p>The court was reformed in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a> following amendments to the <i>Conciliation and Arbitration Act</i>. The changes included replacing the President with a Chief Judge alongside other judges, and ensuring that all cases involving the basic or living wage would be heard by a full bench of the court. The changes also allowed for the appointment of Conciliation Commissioners, with a role similar to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediation.html" title="Mediation">mediators</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>Conciliation and Arbitration Act</i> has always been controversial and highly political. This is not surprising as it establishes the minimum wage regulator. The <b>Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration</b> was almost dismantled by Prime Minister <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Melbourne_Bruce_cf07.html" title="Stanley Melbourne Bruce">Stanley Melbourne Bruce</a> in 1929. However <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Morris_Hughes_a0ce.html" title="William Morris Hughes">William Morris Hughes</a> crossed the floor and the legislation was voted down. The move proved politically unpopular and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Melbourne_Bruce_cf07.html" title="Stanley Melbourne Bruce">Stanley Melbourne Bruce</a> became the first and only Prime Minister to lose his own seat in a Federal Election. (His party also lost the election). Subsequently no Prime Minister attempted to remove the wage setting powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, until <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> in 2006 with the enactment of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workchoices.html" title="Workchoices">Workchoices</a> reforms.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>, the court reduced the standard working week to forty four hours, down from forty eight. During the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_in_Australia_18d0.html" title="Great Depression in Australia">Great Depression</a>, the court reduced wages by 10%. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, the working week was reduced again, to forty hours.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_stats"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/s/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission_50b9.html#endnote_stats" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/s/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission_50b9.html#endnote_stats" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The court was changed again in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> to increase the role of the Commissioners, leaving the judges to conduct the judicial work, and a select few matters of arbitration including the basic wage and the minimum wage for women.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_reform"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/s/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission_50b9.html#endnote_reform" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/s/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission_50b9.html#endnote_reform" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span></p>

<p>The court was abolished in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> following a decision of the High Court in <a href="../../../r/_/v/R_v_Kirby%3B_Ex_parte_Boilermakers%27_Society_of_Australia_bb3e.html" title="R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia">the Boilermakers' case</a>.

<p>Following the decision, two new bodies were created to emulate the function of the defunct court; the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission (later the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">as of 2006</a> the Australian Industrial Relations Commission) was created to carry out the non-judicial functions, and the Commonwealth Industrial Court (later subsumed into the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Court_of_Australia_a393.html" title="Federal Court of Australia">Federal Court of Australia</a>) was created to exercise judicial powers. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission (which was originally called the Australian Industrial Relations Court) was established under the Concilliation and Arbitration Act which was finally passed under the Government of Prime Minister Reid. By the time that the Act was passed two Prime Ministers (<a href="../../../w/a/t/Watson.html" title="Watson">Watson</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deakin.html" title="Deakin">Deakin</a>) had both lost their control of Parliament due to disagreements about the content of the Act.</p>
<p>Throughout its time the Commission created Awards which covered a whole raft of industries. These Awards with Awards made by Industrial Relations Commissions of the respective six states of Australia acted as the unique system of minimum wage setting in Australia. The Commission also registered a large number of trade unions to assist in the Award formation process.</p>
<p>The Commission is famous for its cases on equal work and equal pay, as well as decisions on unfair dismissal, and redundancy pay.</p>
<p>One issue which dogged the Commission was that of what "pertained to the relationship between employer and employee". This had been a question of importance, since the Constitution required the Commission settle industrial disputes. These disputes were later categorised as a "dispute about matters which pertained to the relationship between employer and employee." The question continued to surface and in 2004 the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Court_of_Australia_754b.html" title="High Court of Australia">High Court of Australia</a> in the case of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrolux_v_AWU_b85f.html" title="Electrolux v AWU">Electrolux v AWU</a> applied the question (which had historically been applied to Awards) to Enterprise Bargaining Agreements. This led to around 6 months of industrial confusion until the Australian Industrial Relations Commission handed down the landmark decision of the Schefenacker, the Murray Bridge and the La Trobe University certified agreements (<a href="../../../%E2%80%98/t/h/%E2%80%98the_three_certified_agreements_case%E2%80%99.html" title="‘the three certified agreements case’">‘the three certified agreements case’</a>) <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. It was seen by many as fitting that the last significant decision made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission was to conclusively determine which matter did or did not pertain.</p>

<p>Throughout the years from 1904 to 2006 the Australian Industrial Relations Commission created Awards which set the minimum terms and conditions of employment for people who worked for certain employers. A standard Award would have approximately 20-30 conditions and would be around 40 pages in length. The Award were periodically reviewed.</p>
<p>The Australian Industrial Relations Commission would also certify enterprise bargaining agreements. These agreements were negotiation collective contracts commonly between a union (as representative of the employees on the site) and an employer of a site.</p>
<p>The Australian Industrial Relations Commission also registered trade unions and dealt with demarcation disputes between unions.</p>
<p>Finally the Australian Industrial Relations Commission dealt with unfair dismissal application.</p>

<p>In 2006, under the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workchoices.html" title="Workchoices">Workchoices</a> laws effected at the end of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> the role of the AIRC has been redefined.
