<p>I thought it would be useful to have a discussion about what we expect to see in an Australian school stub - for example, perhaps the minimum standard of a stub article should include location and level of school, ... and further what criteria we should use to destub an article. For example for destubbing of Australian geography stubs (see <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category_talk%7EAustralia_geography_stubs_69b9.html" title="Category talk:Australia geography stubs">Category talk:Australia geography stubs</a>) the criteria is: - to destub the article most of the following should be present:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Article is 250 words plus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Article is correctly categorised</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. Article mentions which local government area it falls within and/or nearby towns/highways, longitude and latitude</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. Article describes basic stats, like population at census 1996 or 2001</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>5. Article mentions historical information and/or activities in the town now that make it interesting.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Criteria for ddestubbing school articles would probably have reference to <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_BEEFSTEW_8c5d.html" title="User:Dpbsmith/BEEFSTEW">User:Dpbsmith/BEEFSTEW</a> ie</p>
<p>A) Is the article more than two sentences long?</p>
<p>B) Does the article contain at least one coherent paragraph of text (other than list items)?</p>
<p>C) Is the article more than 2000 bytes long?</p>
<p>D) Does the article contain at least three facts that are not on the following list:</p>
<pre>
       The school's name, address, telephone number, website.
       The school's current enrollment
       The name of the school's principal.
       The school district or athletic conference/league to which it belongs.
       The school colors, school mascot, and name of one athletic team.
</pre>
<p>E) Does the article include a photograph of the school?</p>
<p>F) Does the article list at least one alumnus notable enough to be the subject of a Wikipedia article?</p>
<p>G) Does the article mention a regional or national news story that mentions the school? (Not descriptions of athletic events in local media)</p>
<p>H) Besides F and G, does the article make a serious effort to establish the school's notability and describe some distinct things about it that distinguish it from other schools?</p>
<p>I) Would an alumnus of the school, reading the article, be pleased at how knowledgeable the article was?</p>
<p>J) Could a teacher learn anything relevant to a job search by reading this article (other than basic contact information)?</p>

<dd><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html#Structure" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Schools#Structure</a> suggests the following structure:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The article should start with a good <b>introduction</b>, giving the full complete official name of the School, detail about location (in suburb, downtown, where?), founder and founding name, and affilation with any larger school system, if applicable. Also, add a few facts about the school that make it unique.</p>
<p>Next, there is a table about the school. <i><b>Should we develop an Australian school's template?</b></i></p>
<p>Sections of the article:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>History</b> — Describe the history of the school, including noteworthy milestones in its development.</li>
<li><b>Campus</b> — Describe the overall shape and size of the campus. Mention any famous buildings or stadia and their architects.</li>
<li><b>Students</b> — Statistics on students, size of student body. Mention of individual current students or individual student's achievement while at the high school is not suggested.</li>
<li><b>Faculty</b> — State the number of faculty members, statistics on faculty, student-to-teacher ratio, etc. Distinguish between tenure/nontenured, full- and part-time (if possible). Names of noteworthy (e.g. award-winning, published) faculty of the past can be mentioned.</li>
<li><b>Extracurricular activities</b> — Mention the sports team(s) of the school and what is notable about them. Here is also a good place to mention specific traditions of school, like <a href="../../../s/t/u/Students%27_union.html" title="Students' union">students' union</a>/student council activities, a student newspaper, clubs, regular activities, etc. The heading may be changed accordingly in regard to the importance of sports, clubs, traditions, students' unions etc. For example, alternative headings could be <b>Students' Union, Sports and Traditions</b> or <b>Students' Union Activities</b>. Mention significant championships for the sports teams.</li>
<li><b>Curriculum</b> — If the curriculum of the school is especially unique or notable, mention why here. For instance, if the high school is called a culinary academy, elaborate on this here.</li>
<li><b>Noted alumni</b> — Bulleted list of alumni that are notable. Mention the graduation year and give a short description why they are famous. Also, include an annotation to show that they did indeed attend the school.</li>
<li><b>External links</b> — Give a link to the website of the school.</li>
</ul>

<p>To my mind all Australian school stubs should at the very least mention the full complete official name of the School and the location of the school including, suburb or town, city, state. Stubs should also include a link to the school's web page (very few Australian schools, if any, do not have a web page). As well as being labelled with the Australian school stub tag and thus being cateogrised as an Australian school stub, the school should also be categorised as a school within its state eg if in Tasmania it should be tagged with <a href="../../../s/c/h/Category%7ESchools_in_Tasmania_1b59.html" title="Category:Schools in Tasmania">Category:Schools in Tasmania</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Australian_school_articles_not_tagged_as_stubs_should_include" id="Australian_school_articles_not_tagged_as_stubs_should_include"></a></p>

<p>Destubbing requires (in addition to minimum that all Australian school stubs should include as per above, ie location and web site link 1. Article is 250 words plus. 2. Basic stats such as number of students 3. History of the school, including date of founding and any notable alumni 4. Photograph of the school</p>

<p>As mentioned above, <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caulfield_Grammar_School_6987.html" title="Caulfield Grammar School">Caulfield Grammar School</a> has reached featured article status and is thus potentially a model for good Australian school articles. The article covers the following contents:</p>
<pre>
   * 1 History
         o 1.1 Yarra Junction Campus
         o 1.2 Nanjing Campus
   * 2 Academics
         o 2.1 Middle School structure
         o 2.2 The VCE
         o 2.3 "The virtual campus"
   * 3 Caulfield student life
         o 3.1 Sport
         o 3.2 The Arts
   * 4 School uniform

<p>Note in the <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Caulfield_Grammar_School_97aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Caulfield Grammar School">peer review comments</a> the following suggestion was made as to how to create a great article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"go into the underlying detail regarding the events that they do mention. For example, they might mention the school's football championships, when it built its campuses and when it celebrated its 100th anniversary, but [should also cover] why the school opened these campuses, why it decided to become a boarding school, what sort of competition it had to face in the football league, what the 100th anniversary celebrations were like, and so on."</i></dd>
