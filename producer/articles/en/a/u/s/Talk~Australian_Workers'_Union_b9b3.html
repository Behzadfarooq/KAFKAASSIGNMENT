<p>The AWU is clearly a significant union with a very interesting history - if someone has the time or inclanation it would be useful to insert some of that history into other Australian Labour articles. The absence of the AWU and other right wing unions from these pages have the effect of giving an unbalanced view of the Australian Union movement. <a href="../../../h/m/e/User%7EHmette_f25e.html" title="User:Hmette">Hmette</a> 16:10, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a right unionist myself&#160;:), I don't necessarily know if there is any absence of information compared to left unions - more just unions in general, I think. The article on the AWU is in fact one of the larger articles on an Australian union. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 20:09, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was reffering particularly to articles such as <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_labour_movement.html" title="Australian labour movement">Australian labour movement</a> where there is a diatribe about the IWW without any reference to the AWU's opposition to this organisation, or the role that other right wing unions played at that time. History also shows that this organisation like so many radical left wing movements ahs disapeared, the AWU has had influence going right back to the very beginnings of the Australian union movement - a history that continues. Re: removal of some material - I figured this would not necessarily be all that appreciated, my rational is that the AWU as a union which is what I think is described here probably doesn't have as much influence over the Labor party nationally as suggested by your article. However, particularly in Queensland, the AWU is more than an organisation of workers - it is entrenched in Governement, the judiciary and in the broader political movement. I dare say it has more influence in Queensland than any other state. The strength of the AWU is that it has exercised its power both through its political wings, through the union and like minded unions like the SDA. This has given its leaders considerable political influence. The situation in NSW is somewhat different in that the right is made up of more unions, and the AWU is considerably smaller. In NSW many unions that are in the left in Qld are solid right wing unions - eg. the Clerks and the TWU. I agree that this is one of the longer articles, but for a union in its position there is a very rich history that is worth expanding upon. <a href="../../../h/m/e/User%7EHmette_f25e.html" title="User:Hmette">Hmette</a> 00:20, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's part of the systemic left-wing bias at Wikipedia. An emphemeral fringe group like the IWW gets reverential treatment while major mainstream unions get no articles at all. Of course they are not as colourful, I grant you. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 09:05, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to see more articles on the restructure of the unions. Targeting solution for the demographic time-bomb in the work place. Here is something I whipped together i will still like to enter comparisons and other facts and figures. Holger I would like your response to bench marking jobs and concern you might have, seeing that you have been so involved in the union articles .</p>
<p>Currently the union legislation in Australia has been changed and many people are scared about the uncertainty of their jobs and livelihood. I am currently working on a project that could take a lot of strain and uncertainty. Australia needs to become more transparent.</p>
<p>This is partly achievable by forecasting when workers skills need updating, for example when a job becomes more demanding or when new technology will make current employees competencies redundant. By allowing time for adequate, government subsidised, training the workforce will have the capacity to grow whilst becoming united in strength and versatility. Keeping the workforce one step ahead is essential for triumphing over future adversities all the while being competitive in a global economy.</p>
<p>This system occurs in South Africa. By continuously educating people in jobs they are able to move higher up, creating a circular movement for the up and coming or in Australians case immigrants whilst some retire. With the aging population this could be very beneficial however the process is not currently transparent hence corruption in some sectors is almost a guarantee.</p>
<p>The government is essentially moving away from rewarding complacency, and with less regulation in the unions potential investors are less likely to be intimidated in entering into the market. These changes have create more incentives for employees with the capabilities to take the financial risk in creating a their own business with the benefits out waying the negatives. Whilst in the transitional period many people might feel the adverse effects of these new legislations. The best answer lies in bench-marking every job individually. Those of you who are reading this might think that it is a daunting task and I welcome any concerns or questions <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Cwaldie (<a href="../../../c/w/a/User_talk%7ECwaldie_a70b.html" title="User talk:Cwaldie">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cwaldie_2dd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cwaldie">contribs</a>).</small> <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 10:20, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
