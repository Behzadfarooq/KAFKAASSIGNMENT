<p>The word "smears" seems to be very POV. Wouldn't "criticisms" or "reports" be more neutral?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. "Allegations" is a rather neutral word (if anything, it slightly suggests "unproven"), and is much more suitable. Smear is inherently POV and contains a claim about motives that is not currently supported.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 11:44, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All of the external links for various branches go to near identical pages. I think the National Office one shall suffice. If people want to find out more they can easily click through to the other pages from there, but Wikipedia is not an advertising service for political groups. I've also removed the nonsense about "smears" - as said above, it's completely NPOV. Some users seem intent on completely sanitising any mentions of neo-Nazism from this page. The nazi leanings of Australia First seem to be a fairly major element of the group and should not be disregarded. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrett_ca1d.html" title="User:Drett">Drett</a> 23:11, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Comparison of AFP branch sites shows substantial differences, with particular regard to the national, Sydney, and Melbourne sites - these have been left in to enable quick access to full information about the AFP.</p>
<p>I've also removed the nonsense about "neo-nazism", it's completely POV, and obviously part of a political smear campaign, as was also used with regards to One Nation (another patriotic/nationalist group). It is a fiction to say that AFP has nazi leanings, and such propaganda POV should be disregarded.</p>
<p>As an aside, one wonders why Drett etc have not edited the Australian Labor Party article to say it has communist leanings; indeed, it is interesting to note that the ALP article on Wikipedia makes no mention, even in the DLP split paragraph, of the heavy communist influence within the ALP, which still continues to this day.

<p>On this subject, it is worth noting the research of Peter Charles Henderson in his BA (Hons) thesis, A History of the Australian Extreme Right Since 1950, who said:</p>
<p>“There is also a tendency to label groups with titles like 'neo-Nazi' as a form of censure even when the group has no links or sympathies toward Nazism. This name calling has originated not only on the left but on the right where terms like 'femi-Nazi', reputedly coined by US talk back radio personality Rush Limbaugh to describe feminists, has gained currency”. <a href="http://library.uws.edu.au/adt-NUWS/public/adt-NUWS20030924.134813/index.html" class="external free" title="http://library.uws.edu.au/adt-NUWS/public/adt-NUWS20030924.134813/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://library.uws.edu.au/adt-NUWS/public/adt-NUWS20030924.134813/index.html</a> (p.8) (see also pages 28-29) It should be noted that Henderson is a leftist (p.31) (all these pages are in the Introduction, 01Front.pdf). RedDawn 11:35, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How is that relevant? Yes, the term Nazi is misused for propaganda purposes. Nothing unexpected.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 11:42, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, propaganda lies are not unexpected, but they are combattable. Hence it is proper not to allow continuance of propaganda lies in Wikipedia. RedDawn 12:02, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the interests of giving a full picture of the Australia First Party, it seems right that their neo-nazi leanings should be mentioned in the opening paragraph, so as not to give the reader a false impression about the party. Their links to National Action, the BNP, Volksfront and the New Zealand National Front are well documented in reliable sources (the media). It's interesting that their current webmaster, Andrew Guild (aka RedDawn) was the Victorian chairman of the violent neo-Nazi group National Action. RedDawn was also the One Nation candidate for the seat of Deakin. It would be good if he could put his bias aside for the purposes of creating a NPOV wiki article. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrett_ca1d.html" title="User:Drett">Drett</a> 15:26, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most enlightening, thanks. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 21:35, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>How strange. Drett seems to think he has a crystal ball that gives info on the identity of Wikipedia contributors. Can he provide proof of his claims? No? I didn't think so.</p>
<p>Also, Drett deliberately seeks to give a false impression of AFP by alleging "neo-nazi leanings" (this is a common tactic with people from FightDemBack [sic]). He also tries the same tactic with National Action, which was not neo-nazi either.</p>
<p>To label nationalist groups as "neo-nazi" is as silly as labelling democratic socialist groups as "communist", but there are those who seek to deliberately mislead people in this regard. It is a standard propaganda tactic used by globalists to demonise their nationalist opposition by calling them neo-nazis, even when they know that it is not true.</p>
<p>It is quite obvious that Australian nationalists are not neo-nazis. Nations who believed in pro-White racial integrity (racial seperateness or racial protectionism) fought the Nazis in WW2 (Australia, the USA, South Africa; possibly Canada and the UK), but would be slandered nowadays by globalists as "nazi", which is plainly ridiculous. Those pro-White nations were democracies and were anti-Nazi.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the globalists of that era (pro-communists) who advocated not going to war against the Nazis (until the Nazis invaded the USSR in 1941). It is the multiculturalists-globalists of today who are the closest thing we have to nazism (for instance, see <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/planet/panca/nazi_intro.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.angelfire.com/planet/panca/nazi_intro.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/planet/panca/nazi_intro.htm</a>).</p>
<p>Pro-White countries waged war against Nazi Germany for two main reasons: 1) The issue of national integrity, re. Germany's espansionism (esp. culminating with Poland). 2) The issue of democracy. Australia, the USA, South Africa, etc. were all democracies, and were opposed to the authoritarianism of Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>That is why White Australia fought the Nazis, it was a war of democracy vs anti-democracy. And Australian nationalists like the AFP follow in the same vein of promoting democracy, such as by advocating Citizens' Initiated Referenda.</p>
<p>Thus, it is demonstrated that Drett's wish to slander AFP with a false neo-nazi tag is simply an issue of him/FDB wanting to use Wikipedia as a propaganda tool to further globalist ideology. RedDawn 06:11, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for all that irrelevant rhetoric. Do you deny that you are Andrew Guild, former Victorian chairman of National Action, as alleged? There is no rule that contributors have to disclose their real names here, but it would obviously be interesting to know that we have a real live neo-Nazi among us. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:31, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you actually read the info provided, then you would know that it is factual, and not irrelevant - except that the Truth is often irrelevant to many globalist propagandists. I have no current intention to confirm or deny any name that Drett puts forward. Maybe I should do so after he provides us with "proof" of his claim - that would be most interesting. I note that you also use the "neo-nazi" smear. Am I to assume by this that you are another globalist propagandist? Am I supposed to return the favour by labelling you a Communist? Or, assuming you are a Multiculturalist, should I be labelling you a Multicultural Nazi instead? Please advise, as I am unsure of the ettiquette in name-calling slanging matches on Wikipedia. RedDawn 07:33, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Either you are Andrew Guild or you aren't. If you aren't, you should say so and then it will be up to Drett to prove that you are, if he wishes.</li>
<li>"Neo-Nazi" is not a "smear" when it is applied to neo-Nazis, just as "communist" is not a smear when it is applied to communists.</li>
<li>Turning the argument back on me won't wash. I use my real name here and my political views are stated at my user page. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 07:44, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Yes, either I am or I am not. However, it is Drett who is crystal-ball gazing, it is Drett who asserts he knows who I am, so it is up to him to provide his "proof" (Come on, where is it?). I am not making any claim, he is. As I said, "I have no current intention to confirm or deny any name that Drett puts forward. Maybe I should do so after he provides us with "proof" of his claim - that would be most interesting." RedDawn 08:11, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You and Andrew Guild have the same IP. Since he is Australia First's webmaster and you are trying to whitewash the Australia First article I made the gigantic cognitive leap that you might be the same person rather than you being somebody who sneaks into Andrew's house at night under the cover of darkness and tries to legitimise political groups of which he is a member. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrett_ca1d.html" title="User:Drett">Drett</a> 21:46, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Two very simple points to make here: 1) I use a very common ISP, along with I would guess 100s of 1000s of people (including quite a few people I know of), so strike one against you there. I'm pretty sure that 100s of 1000s of people aren't coming into my house to use my computer (well, apart from some friends on occasion), but I'll stay up tonight and keep a watch out for them just in case. 2) I just had a look at the history page, and the only ISPs listed are for unregistered contributors, so strike two against you. Since I mentioned the anti-nationalist propaganda being put on Wikipedia to a few people, there's no surprise about people wanting to get rid of that globalist propaganda.

<dd>No, I wrote that you have the exact same IP address. You have the same ISP, obviously, but that's not what I was saying. There is no 'globalist anti-nationalist propaganda' being put on this page. Only factual information about a neo-nazi group.
