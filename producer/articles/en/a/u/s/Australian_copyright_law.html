<p>Australian copyright law has been influenced significantly by the structure of English law as well as the Berne Convention. Thus there is an exhaustive set of types of material protected, and an exhaustive set of exclusive rights.</p>
<p>In terms of the <i>types of material</i>, Australian law confers rights in works, also known as "Part III Works" (after the Part of the Act dealing with this): namely, literary works, musical works, artistic works, and dramatic works. It also confers rights in "other subject matter" (Part IV Subject Matter), which cover the kinds of material protected in some countries by 'neighbouring rights': sound recordings, films, broadcasts, and published editions. To be protected, material must fall into one of these exclusive categories. The rights in Part IV subject matters are more limited, because infringement requires exact copying of the actual subject matter (sound-alikes or remakes are not covered).</p>
<p>In terms of the <i>exclusive rights</i>, different kinds of subject matter have different rights. Owners of copyright in works have rights to reproduce, publish (meaning publish for the first time), perform, and adapt the work, and communicate it to the public (including broadcast, or communicate by making available online). The rights of owners of copyright in artistic works are more limited (there is no right to control public display of artistic works). Owners of copyright in other subject matter have the exclusive right to make copies, to communicate them to the public, and to cause them to be heard/seen in public.</p>
<p>Infringement occurs where a person does an act falling within the copyright owner's exclusive rights, without the authorisation of the copyright owner (assuming that one of the exceptions does not apply).</p>

<p>Prior to the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S.-Australia_Free_Trade_Agreement_3865.html" title="U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement">U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement</a>, Australia used a "plus 50" rule for determining when a work will enter the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>. Put simply, a "work" (ie a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work) entered the public domain 50 years following the year of the creator's death, with exceptions. With the signing of the FTA in early 2005, copyright should now be understood as "plus 70", in line with the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> and other regions. The extension to "plus 70" was not applied to Crown-owned copyrights.</p>
<p>Similar to the foreign reciprocity clause in the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> copyright law, the "plus 70" rule is not retroactive. In short, this can be interpreted as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any work that was published in the lifetime of the author who died in 1954 or earlier, is out of copyright.</li>
<li>Any work that was published in the lifetime of the author who died after 1954, will be out of copyright seventy (70) years after the author's death.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also any work that was published after the death of the author, will be out of copyright seventy (70) years after the year of first publication. Unpublished works hold copyright indefinitely.</p>
<p>Photographs, sound recordings, films, and anonymous/pseudonymous works are copyright for seventy (70) years from their first publication. Television and sound broadcasts are copyright for only fifty years after the year of their first broadcast (though the material contained in the broadcast may be separately copyrighted). Most other works are also dated from the first publication/broadcast/performance where this occurred after the author's death.</p>
<p>The period of seventy (70) years is counted from the end of the relevant calendar year.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Bono_Copyright_Term_Extension_Act_f688.html" title="Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act">Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act</a> (1998) defines an entirely different rule based on the year of first publication in the US: generally, anything published before <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> is <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>. An interesting consequence of this for the Internet is that a work may be public domain in the US but not in Australia, or vice versa. It is important to note that copyright does not depend on the country of origin of publication or of the author. A work published in the US by a British author may still be public domain in Australia if the author died more than seventy (70) years ago or died before 1955.</p>
<p><a name="Fair_dealing_and_other_exceptions" id="Fair_dealing_and_other_exceptions"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_copyright_law.html" title="Edit section: Fair dealing and other exceptions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fair dealing and other exceptions</span></h2>
<p>The main exceptions to copyright infringement in Australia come under the general hearing <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_dealing.html" title="Fair dealing">fair dealing</a>. Fair dealing is comparable to the United States' <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>, is a use of a work specifically recognised as not being a copyright violation. However, unlike fair use, in order to be a fair dealing under Australian law a use must fall within one of range of specific purposes. These purposes vary by type of work, but the possibilities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>review or criticism</li>
<li>research or study</li>
<li>news-reporting</li>
<li>judicial proceedings or professional legal advice</li>
<li>parody or satire (this last is new: it was added by the Copyright Amendment Bill 2006)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for a certain use to be a fair dealing, it must fall within one of these purposes and must also be 'fair'. What is fair will depend on all the circumstances, including the nature of the work, the nature of the use and the effect of the use on any commercial market for the work.</p>
<p>Fair dealing is not the same as <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>, a term which is generally used in relation to the US's open ended exception, which allows any use (regardless of purpose) as long as it is 'fair'. This has, for example, been interpreted by US courts to allow for reasonable personal use of works, e.g. media-shifting, which would not necessarily be permitted under Australia's fair dealing laws. Australian copyright law does, however, have a number of additional specific exceptions which permit uses which may fall outside of both fair dealing and fair use. For example, a number of exceptions exist which permit specific uses of computer software (see <a href="#List_of_some_possibly_non-violating_actions_in_Australia" title="">List of some possibly non-violating actions in Australia</a> below).</p>
<p>In late 2006, Australia added several 'private copying' exceptions. It is no longer an infringement of copyright to record a broadcast to watch or listen at a more convenient time (s 111), or to make a copy of a sound recording for private and domestic use (eg, copy onto an iPod) (s 109A), or make a copy of a literary work, magazine, or newspaper article for private use (43C).</p>
<p>Australia also has:</p>
<ul>
<li>a special division of exceptions applying to computer programs (for interoperability, security testing, normal use);</li>
<li>a special division of exceptions applying to artworks in public places (to allow photography, incidental filming etc);</li>
<li>statutory (ie compulsory) licenses that allow use by schools, universities, and others on payment of a license fee set either by agreement or by the Copyright Tribunal (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Because Australian copyright law recognises temporary copies stored in computer memory as 'reproductions' falling within the copyright owner's exclusive rights, there are also various exceptions for temporary copies made in the ordinary course of use or communication of digital copies of works.</p>
<p><a name="Moral_rights" id="Moral_rights"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_copyright_law.html" title="Edit section: Moral rights">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Moral rights</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_rights.html" title="Moral rights">moral rights</a> were recognised in Australian copyright legislation. Only individuals may exercise moral rights. The moral rights provided under Australian law now are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A right of attribution
<ul>
<li>the right to be clearly and reasonably prominently identified as the author, in any reasonable form</li>
<li>the right to avoid false attribution, where the work is falsely presented as being another's work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integrity of authorship
<ul>
<li>the right to not have the work treated in a derogatory manner (this is a right to protect the honour and reputation of the author)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Automatic resale rights (royalty payments to the author on subsequent resales of the original and reproductions) are not covered by Australian legislation. To the disappointment of artists' groups, the Australian government quietly announced its intention not to pursue resale rights (droit de suite) in 2006.</p>
<p>There are also proposals in Australia for the recognition of "Indigenous communal moral rights", aimed at assisting indigenous people to protect the integrity and sanctity of indigenous culture. A draft bill was circulated to a limited set of stakeholders in 2003; since then the Bill has been listed as one the government planned to pass, but has yet to be introduced.</p>
<p><a name="Ownership_of_copyright" id="Ownership_of_copyright"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_copyright_law.html" title="Edit section: Ownership of copyright">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ownership of copyright</span></h2>
<p>Copyright is free and automatic upon creation of the work. In general, the first owner of copyright will be the author (for literary, musical, dramatic and artistic works) or producer (for sound recordings and films) or broadcaster (for broadcasts). Under Australian law, where an employee is the author, the first owner of copyright is the employer (this is slightly different to the US works-made-for-hire doctrine: in Australia, duration of copyright is still measured by the lifetime of the employee author). In 2004-2005, Australia also introduced some complicated provisions that give performers part ownership rights in sound recordings, and directors some limited ownership rights in relation to films.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_notice.html" title="Copyright notice">copyright notice</a> (©) is not required on a work to gain copyright, but only the copyright owner is entitled to place a notice. It is useful in publishing the date of first publication and the owner. Where a copyright notice is used, the onus in infringement proceedings is on the defendant to show that copyright does not subsist or is not owned by the person stated in the notice.</p>

<p>The Australian Commonwealth and State governments routinely own copyright in Australia. While this could be seen as being due to the concept of the Crown being traditionally paramount rather than the people, it is more influenced by the then <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">British Commonwealth</a> acting as a copyright policy-making body in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, which was the basis of the 1968 Copyright Act.</p>
<p>The Australian government does not infringe copyright if its actions (or those of an authorised person) are for the government. A "relevant collecting society" may sample government copies and charge the government.</p>
<p>The State governments follow different practices in regard to <a href="../../../l/i/c/Licensing.html" title="Licensing">licensing</a>, fees and <a href="../../../w/a/i/Waiver.html" title="Waiver">waivers</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_of_Australia_1c40.html" title="Attorney General of Australia">Australian Attorney-General</a>'s <a href="http://www.ag.gov.au/www/clrHome.nsf" class="external text" title="http://www.ag.gov.au/www/clrHome.nsf" rel="nofollow">Copyright Law Review Committee</a> completed a <a href="http://www.clrc.gov.au/agd/WWW/clrHome.nsf/Page/Overview_Reports_Crown_Copyright" class="external text" title="http://www.clrc.gov.au/agd/WWW/clrHome.nsf/Page/Overview_Reports_Crown_Copyright" rel="nofollow">large review of Crown Copyright in April 2005</a>. In summary, the Committee recommended that the Crown be treated like any other employer (ie, owner of material produced by its employees), and that for certain materials (legislation, government reports, commissions of inquiry reports) either copyright be removed, or a generous and generalised license be granted for re-use. As of early 2007, several governments appear to be considering the use of open licenses modelled along the lines of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> model.</p>
<p>Copyrights owned by the Crown in Australia have different durations to publicly held copyrights, as below:</p>

<p>A number of copyright collecting societies operate in Australia. Collecting societies are established to collect royalties for uses of copyright material on behalf of authors and copyright owners: they assist to overcome the significant transaction costs that would face individual creators in monitoring, enforcing, and licensing their rights. A notable feature of some of the Australian collecting societies is that some are 'declared' to be the society with the function of being the sole collector of royalties under the statutory licenses. The collecting societies in Australia are:</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_copyright_law.html" title="Edit section: 2006 Changes to Australian Copyright Law">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2006 Changes to Australian Copyright Law</span></h2>
<p>In 2006, a major piece of copyright-amending legislation - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/caa20061582006240/" class="external text" title="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/caa20061582006240/" rel="nofollow">the Copyright Amendment Act 2006</a> - was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. The legislation completed changes required by the <a href="../../../u/s/-/US-Australia_Free_Trade_Agreement_d397.html" title="US-Australia Free Trade Agreement">US-Australia Free Trade Agreement</a> - in particular, it strengthened anti-circumvention laws, for the first time making it illegal in Australia to circumvent technical measures used by copyright owners to protect access to their works, and expanding the measures which count as technological protection measures which may not be circumvented. Like the FTA language, the new anti-circumvention law is closely modelled on the US <a href="../../../d/m/c/DMCA_bb76.html" title="DMCA">DMCA</a>, although it is not identical.</p>
<p>The Act also introduced a series of new exceptions into Australian copyright law. The most well known are the private copying exceptions, which follow on from proposals by <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Ruddock_dd3f.html" title="Philip Ruddock">Attorney-General Philip Ruddock</a> to allow people to record most television or radio program at home to watch at a later time with family or friends, and to 'format-shift' their music (make copies from CDs onto personal computers and portable music players such as iPods). Unlike some countries in Europe, or Canada, there is no fee or license paid on players to compensate copyright owners for these private copies, although the exceptions are narrowly defined, and do not allow, for example, making copies for friends or family. The Act also introduced a copyright exception allowing parody and satire, and an exception to allow certain non-commercial use by public sector institutions like universities, schools, art galleries, and archives, provided that an Australian court decides an exception would be consistent with the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berne_three-step_test.html" title="Berne three-step test">Berne three-step test</a>.</p>
<p>The other notable change made by the Act was to expand the provisions concerning criminal copyright infringement. The Act introduced strict liability offences for some copyright infringements, and a system of 'Infringement Notices' (on the spot fines). The stated aim of these provisions is to make copyright easier to enforce, particularly against commercial infringers. After concerns from user groups and a Senate Committee, many strict liability offences that would have applied to non-commercial acts were removed from the final bill.</p>
<p>A discussion of the Act and its changes by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is available <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/legcon_ctte/copyright06/report/interim_report/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/legcon_ctte/copyright06/report/interim_report/index.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
