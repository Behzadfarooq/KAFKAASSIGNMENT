<li><a href="../../../g/i/p/Gippsland_phantom_cat.html" title="Gippsland phantom cat">Gippsland phantom cat</a> - an urban legend centered on the idea that United States soldiers based in Victoria, Australia during World War II, brought with them a pair of pumas (or other large cats) as mascots.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greta_Bunyip_a3b1.html" title="Greta Bunyip">Greta Bunyip</a> - a bunyip which was believed to have lived in the swamps of the Greta area, in Victoria, Australia.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/y/r/Lyrebird.html" title="Lyrebird">Lyrebird</a> - The Lyrebird is said to mimic a wide variety of sounds.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Bradman_c1d9.html" title="Donald Bradman">Don Bradman</a> - perhaps the greatest cricketer ever, the fact that he needed only 4 runs in his last innings in order to retire with a test average of 100 but was uncharacteristically bowled for a duck (leaving him stranded on an average of 99.94) has become a part of Australian folklore and added greatly to his mystique.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Buckley_%28convict%29_a2bd.html" title="William Buckley (convict)">William Buckley</a> - an Australian convict who escaped and became famous for living in an Aboriginal community for many years.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/z/a/Azaria_Chamberlain_d2ef.html" title="Azaria Chamberlain">Azaria Chamberlain</a> - the name of two-month-old Australian baby who disappeared on the night of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_17.html" title="August 17">17 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> on a camping trip with her family. Her parents, Lindy Chamberlain and Michael Chamberlain, reported that she had been taken from their tent by a <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dingo.html" title="Dingo">dingo</a>, but they were arrested, tried, and convicted of her murder in 1982. Both were later cleared, and thus the case is best remembered for what was an injustice and for highlighting the prejudices of the average Australian. The Chamberlains were <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church_a1ea.html" title="Seventh-day Adventist Church">Seventh-day Adventists</a> and an urban myth had developed that they were required to sacrifice a child as part of their religious beliefs and that the name Azaria meant "sacrifice". These statements are false.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawn_Fraser_7bb7.html" title="Dawn Fraser">Dawn Fraser</a> - perhaps the greatest Australian female <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming.html" title="Swimming">swimmer</a> of all time. Known for her <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politically_incorrect.html" title="Politically incorrect">politically incorrect</a> behaviour or <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larrikinism.html" title="Larrikinism">larrikin</a> character as much as her athletic ability, Fraser won eight <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic</a> medals, including four golds, and six <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Games_09a6.html" title="Commonwealth Games">Commonwealth Games</a> gold medals. It was alleged that she took the flag from <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Hirohito_198a.html" title="Emperor Hirohito">Emperor Hirohito</a>'s palace, while this was proved false, the incident became part of the folklore.</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/e/d/Ned_Kelly_8bc7.html" title="Ned Kelly">Ned Kelly</a> - Australian 19th century bushranger, many films, books and artworks have been made about him, possibly his exploits have been exaggerated in the public eye and become something of folklore. It especially surrounds his capture at <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenrowan.html" title="Glenrowan">Glenrowan</a> where the Kelly gang tried to derail a train of Victorian police which were arriving, and where surrounded in the hotel, they had made armour from stolen iron mould boards of ploughs, and came out shooting, whereupon they shot in the feet. The image of Ned Kelly with a helmet with just a small slit for the eyes is very much a part of this.</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/e/l/Nellie_Melba_494a.html" title="Nellie Melba">Dame Nellie Melba</a> - an Australian <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">opera</a> <a href="../../../s/o/p/Soprano.html" title="Soprano">soprano</a>, the first Australian to achieve international recognition in the form. The French dessert <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peach_Melba_0c07.html" title="Peach Melba">Peach Melba</a> is named after her. Many old theatre halls in regional Australia persist with rumours that she once graced their stage, most notably, that of the gold mining town of <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulgong%2C_New_South_Wales_af8d.html" title="Gulgong, New South Wales">Gulgong</a> in <a href="../../../n/s/w/NSW_7fd5.html" title="NSW">NSW</a>. She is also remembered in the vernacular Australian expression "more comebacks than Nellie Melba", which satirised her seemingly endless series of 'retirement' tours in the 1920s.</li>
<li><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Holt_d0dc.html" title="Harold Holt">Harold Holt</a> - a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Australia_3aa3.html" title="Prime Minister of Australia">Prime Minister</a> who disappeared while swimming in 1967. Popular theories include Holt being picked up by a Chinese submarine, faking his own death, suicide, and CIA involvement. An eventual inquest in 2005 determined that he drowned accidentally.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/q/u/Squizzy_Taylor_d9aa.html" title="Squizzy Taylor">Squizzy Taylor</a> - a petty criminal turned gangster from <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. He is believed to have constructed a series of underground tunnels throughout the inner suburbs of <a href="../../../f/i/t/Fitzroy%2C_Victoria_9e47.html" title="Fitzroy, Victoria">Fitzroy</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collingwood%2C_Victoria_a445.html" title="Collingwood, Victoria">Collingwood</a>.</li>

The idea that Australian soldiers were mowed down by Turkish gunfire following stupid decisions of the British commanding officers is part of the folklore. As is the escape from Gallipoli, where the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_and_New_Zealand_Army_Corps_3954.html" title="Australian and New Zealand Army Corps">Anzacs</a> used rifles rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger to make it seem like there were still soldiers in the trenches as they were leaving.

On the morning of the victory (Australian time) the then Australian Prime Minister, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hawke_e803.html" title="Bob Hawke">Bob Hawke</a>, famously advised all employers that if they sacked any of their employees for not coming in, they were a "bum".

The term "Colliwobbles" was to enter the Victorian vocabulary to signify a choking phenomenon.

Probably subject to more conspiracy theories than any other racehorse (in relation to the cause of his death). His name entered the Australian lexicon in the following expression: to have a heart bigger than Phar Lap's, referring to someone's tenacity and courage. It is part of Australian folklore that Phar Laps' heart, physically, was twice the dimensions of the average sized heart of a horse.</li>
