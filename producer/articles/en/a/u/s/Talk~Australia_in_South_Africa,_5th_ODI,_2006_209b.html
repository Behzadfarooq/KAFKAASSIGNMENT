<p>"The early loss of Boeta Dippenaar for 1 didn't help the cause" I'm not sure I agree with that. I'd argue that the early loss of Dippenaar was instrumental in South Africa's win.&#160;:) I mean it really was the early Smith/Gibbs partnership that enabled South Africa to be in a position to win the match and it was very important that Gibbs started his innings so early in the game. There's no way to verify this but I think it's highly doubtful that Dippenaar would've been able to have such a partnership with Smith. 203.212.133.70 13:13, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This seems a bit POV, and I think to claim this in the first paragraph because a few tabloids said this is a bit of a joke. I don't have much faith in tabloid newspapers, because I think they are more interested in glamour, so they would jump to the conclusion that MANY SIXES = THE BEST. There is no way to verify that the standard of cricket skill in the game was one of the highest ever seen - reasons for a high score could include - pro-batsman conditions (small ground, perfect pitch, more powerful cricket bats), and possibly - bad bowling. eg Hayden's 380 and Lara's 401 are not regarded as the best ever batting performances, because they were considered to be made under highly favourable conditions for batting (and weak bowling in the case of Hayden). <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 01:15, 16 March 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>There is however a tendency for the media to value new things above old ones. I personally think the tied world cup semi-final was a better game. But in the article we only say that many commentators are reporting it as the greatest game, which is undeniably true, and we also mention the semi-final as another candidate later on. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephen_Turner_5111.html" title="User talk:Stephen Turner">Talk</a>) 10:58, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the reaction section balances this out a little (there are probably more quotes or viewpoints that could be sourced to expand here on the points you make). But perhaps the leading paragraph needs to be qualified a little. Regarding "The match broke many records,", what other records besides highest score &amp; highest chase did the match break? Should we restrict this statement to breaking run scoring records? <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteCat_53fa.html" title="User:WhiteCat">WhiteCat</a> 07:23, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I tried the first two links in the list. Number one is a dead link. Number two is a ball by ball commentary of an old semi final world cup match between SA and Australia which isnt relevant to this match.

<dd>Number two is a reference for the claim "Some followers of the game consider this to be the greatest game of all time [1][2]." in the <i>background</i> paragraph, which is why it's relevant.

<p>What do other people think about the Trivia section of this article? I removed it on the grounds that no doubt lots of people made lots of comments which could later be interpreted as predictions, and only the most accurate ones were remembered. This is especially true of the South African team trying to encourage each other that they could just win. But worst of all, most of the "eerily precise prognostications" are actually surprisingly imprecise. If they happened as reported, one of the four was accurate, two were inaccurate, and one was very non-specific and was only said after the conclusion of the match. Is that really the best they could come up with from four hours of conversations? It seems to me that it's the kind of thing which is interesting for a newspaper article, but doesn't really stand up to serious scrutiny.</p>
<p>Anyway, the (I think) original author just restored it on the grounds that it was credibly sourced (which I don't dispute) and that the facts will linger in the collective memory about this match (which can't be proved or disproved yet; I'm slightly skeptical, but I can't judge from here how much currency these predictions have in South Africa now).</p>
<p>So after all that, I thought I'd bring it here. What do other people think?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I was the original author and can see your point, but would argue that such "trivia" will be exactly the kinds of 'cute' anectdotes people will remember about this game in the years to come. Yes, many of the player's bold "predictions" were slightly imprecise (and perhaps "precise" should be changed to something more, uh, precise), but we could certainly say the same about Nostradamus (he mispelled Hitler's name for instance), yet the man is still held in high regard in some corners for his "eerily precise prognostications" (or, at least, approximations of such). At the end of the day, I don't see how the "Trivia" section detracts from the article (which it would if it was improperly sourced), yet it certainly does something to the "story" of this game. It is information in which some people are interested and so I can't really see why you want to deny access to that information. I'm not sure also what you mean by "serious scrutiny". What exactly is the difference between what should go in to a newspaper article and what should go into Wikipedia?</p>
