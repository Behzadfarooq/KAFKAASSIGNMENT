<p>I just changed <i>Dingo</i> to <i>dingo</i>. Can somebody explain why <i>Dingo</i> is consistently written with a capital D in the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dingo.html" title="Dingo">dingo</a> article and why <i>Kelpie</i> is written with a capital letter in the title of this article, but not in the text. <a href="../../../d/h/u/User%7EDhum_Dhum_eaee.html" title="User:Dhum Dhum">D.D.</a> 20:03 25 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a very old question, but as I started answering before I noticed that - I'll leave a reply for future browsers...The problem is a long running dispute about capitalisation on Wikipedia. Generally we use lower case, except for proper nouns. The question has always been - are common names of species properly capitalised or not. This argument has extended to breed names in the dog section. In order to cool the dispute the compromise has been that both capitalised and non-capitalised are acceptable in these areas - but the redirects should always be set up from the alternative. In the dog breeds section, we decided that the convention should be that breed names are capitalised. But there are sometimes articles written with the opposite form, and we don't always catch all cases of this quickly. The Dingo is also a slightly different case in itself because it is usually regarded as a sub-species rather than a breed - and mammals usually are in the non-capitalised form. Last time I looked, the Dingo article was using "dingo" (IIRC) - looks like that's switched over again. I think all the "Kelpies" in this article are fixed now, and I've switched the "Dingo" back to the capitalised form -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 11:36, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suggest that the whole article be renamed from "Australian Kelpie" to just "Kelpie". In brief, there are no other Kelpies -- so the name is unique. Most Australians who look for the article will first (as I did) look under "K", then wonder why such an important dog has no Wikipedia entry. <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordonE_0fb0.html" title="User:GordonE">Gordon</a> | <a href="../../../g/o/r/User_talk%7EGordonE_616b.html" title="User talk:GordonE">Talk</a>, 17 April 2006 @05:37 UTC</p>

<p>The Kelpie breed is currently split into "Working" and "Show". The "Show" Kelpie is bred for a limited range of colours and other conformations and usually wouldn't know what to do with a sheep. The "Working" Kelpie is bred for working ability, working ability and working ability, with colours and conformation a very unimportant consideration.</p>
<p>The term "Australian" is used as a general (and redundant) adjective for the breed name as noted above in "Name of Article". <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordonE_0fb0.html" title="User:GordonE">Gordon</a> | <a href="../../../g/o/r/User_talk%7EGordonE_616b.html" title="User talk:GordonE">Talk</a>, 17 April 2006 @05:50 UTC</p>

<p>It is important to understand that the ancestors of the Kelpie were simply (black) dogs, called Colleys or Collies. The word "collie" has the same root as "coal" and "collier (ship)". Today's Collie breeds were not formed until about 10 or 15 years after the Kelpie was established as a breed. Some of these Colleys were imported to Australia for stock work in the early 1800's, and were bred to other types of dogs (including the odd Dingo), but always with an eye to working sheep without direct supervision.</p>
<p>The first Border Collie was not seen in Australia until after Federation... <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordonE_0fb0.html" title="User:GordonE">Gordon</a> | <a href="../../../g/o/r/User_talk%7EGordonE_616b.html" title="User talk:GordonE">Talk</a>, 17 April 2006 @06:15 UTC</p>

<p>We don't have "Ranchers" in Australia, I've changed it to "stockmen" as this more accurately reflects the people who would use herding dogs generally, and Kelpies especially.</p>
<p>Ummm... No, Kelpies don't usually have double coats. They used to, but somehow they just changed.</p>
<p>The sizes and weights given here are a bit on the large side. 30Kg is very much in the German Shepherd class!

<p>The indecisiveness of the constituancy of this breed IMHO makes it not a breed. Cattle mongrels that have been bred from working dogs brought over hundreds of years ago are invalid unless we can say they come from a discernable heritage (see: breeding) and thus can label it's breed.</p>
<p>What's with all these 'Australian &lt;insert real breed&gt;' breeds of dogs around about anyway? Apparently, all these Australian &lt;Breed&gt; dogs are only known outside Australia?

<p>I think it doesn't matter what the medium used is - you are only using one breeder's view on Kelpie so it isn't particularly a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Can the same information be pulled from <i>articles</i> in a breed magazine / newsletter? (even if the same person is the contributing author - the fact it is in the breed association's publication rather than the breeder's commerial/ advertisement website lends credibility). Remember: nobody can really dispute, on their own website, their view of what a kelpie is but in an association magazine they'd be shot down if they went too far from the consensus of <i>all</i> (registered) kelpie breeders.<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 06:26, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><b>North American Border Collie Rescue Network</b> The keen herding instinct and great power over sheep that working collies possessed were such useful assets that it was worth trying to find a milder-natured type to cross with them. A Northumbrian farmer, Adam Telfer, succeeded in finding the right blend of types in 1894. The Border Collie of today is descended from Telfer's dog, "Hemp". Not only various temperaments, but a variety of working styles and skills, were combined in Hemp to produce the Border Collie.  <a href="http://www.sandybeach.com/nabcrn/history.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.sandybeach.com/nabcrn/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sandybeach.com/nabcrn/history.htm</a></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b>The Border Collie - History</b> In the nineteenth century we can find several publications in which dogs with the description 'Collie' or 'Colley' are mentioned. Illustrations dating from this time show a varying exterior. Sometimes the dogs look more like the current Scottish shepherd, in other cases they look like the Border Collie, and sometimes it is impossible to recognise a current breed. At the end of the nineteenth century, you can find a type of 'Colley' that resembles the current Border Collie a lot. With the birth of the legendary Old Hemp in 1893 and Old Kep in 1901, the current Border Collie type has emerged.  <a href="http://www.bordercollies.nl" class="external free" title="http://www.bordercollies.nl" rel="nofollow">http://www.bordercollies.nl</a></p>

<dd>I'm sure they can. However, I am by nature lazy, and the Noonbarra Stud "THE KELPIE STORY" has it all together: I didn't have to wander far! Now, about Red Cloud Kelpies. I would <u><b>lo-o-o-ve</b></u> to find a better source than a "Personal Correspondence". BUT, sadly, I cannot find <u>any</u> reliable published sources either way, for or against. I have lots of opinion, gossip and anecdotes, but nothing that would stand up in court. In defence of the "pers. comm." citation, Wikipedia is one of the very few places which doesn't recognise it. Most authoritative journals recognise it, subject to a couple of important rules: one, it must be produceable, ie., the original must be available for perusal by reviewers (<i>Yes, I have it</i>); and two, the author(s) must be authorities in the field (<i>Yes, they are</i>). So, given your rather hostile tone in this criticism, I leave it to YOU to search diligently for <b>authoritative</b> references affirming or negating the existence of the Red Cloud Kelpie as a sub-type of the Kelpie breed.  <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordonE_0fb0.html" title="User:GordonE">Gordon</a> | <a href="../../../g/o/r/User_talk%7EGordonE_616b.html" title="User talk:GordonE">Talk</a>, 11:16, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The policies of this site place the onus on the editor making the claims to provide relaiable sources.</dd>
<dd>In this instance the hostile action would be to remove every statement which I feel is not cited to a reliable source. In doing so I would be in line with the policy and procedures but not in line with the actual practices.</dd>
<dd>Please note, my comments were made in line with what appear to be efforts to get this article up to the level required to be classed as a <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">good article</a>.</dd>
<dd>Whatever opinion or acceptance other journals (which aim to be a secondary rather than a tertiary source of information) hold regarding personal corrospondance, Wikipedia regards them as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a> of information. <i>In general, Wikipedia artciles should rely on reliable secondary sources</i> - in this regard the use of personal correspondance as a citation for one fairly minor (overall) point of the article is acceptable, if unusual (on this site). However in combination with the extensive reliance on the website of an individual stud (which is a business directly involved in the subject matter, so has a potential conflict of interest in ensuring that their own product comes out smelling like roses), the result is this article seems to be relying too heavily on primary sources.</dd>
<dd>Rather than relying on a website published by an individual stud, if similar information is available from either the WKC or ANKC then this is more likely to be information which has been agreed upon by the breeding community, rather than information which has the potential for bias in favour of a single breeder.</dd>
<dd>I actually have real issues with quite a bit of this article which is heavily POV currently in favour of WKC-type dogs &amp; breeders. (eg: lead section: "The Show Kelpie is the variety that is seen at conformation dog shows. They usually have little or no herding instinct" - no citation yet the [<a href="http://www.ankc.aust.com/austkelp.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ankc.aust.com/austkelp.html" rel="nofollow">ANKC</a> states "It has a natural instinct and aptitude in the working of sheep, both in open country and in the yard")<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 22:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
