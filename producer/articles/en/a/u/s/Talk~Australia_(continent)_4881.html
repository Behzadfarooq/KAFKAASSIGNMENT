<p>I propose that this article be merged into <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Australia_2ac0.html" title="Geography of Australia">Geography of Australia</a>. I note that the distinction between the geography of the Commonwealth of Australia and the continent has been discussed there. Before tagging - any views?

<dd>Perhaps it would be better merged with <i><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-New_Guinea_b540.html" title="Australia-New Guinea">Australia-New Guinea</a></i>. It is clear that the two articles are about the same thing the only problem is whether to merge <i><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australia (continent)</a></i> into <i><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-New_Guinea_b540.html" title="Australia-New Guinea">Australia-New Guinea</a></i> or the other way around. I think, perhaps, it would be best to merge them both to <i><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australia (continent)</a></i> as I haven't heard or read the other term outside Wikipedia. I think I'll do this. If, after all, <i>Australian-New Guinea</i> is the better place, then it won't be hard to move it back there. Something would have to be done about the map, though, because inspite of the article <i>Australia (continent)'</i>s insistance that to exclude <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Guinea_eecc.html" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a> is a mistake the map does just this. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 25Jan06
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm. I'd support merging <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-New_Guinea_b540.html" title="Australia-New Guinea">Australia-New Guinea</a> into <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australia (continent)</a>, since authoritative references to the former may not be forthcoming or in abundance and most sources – including dictionaries – will hark of the simpler term to describe the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> (where the simpler term is also abound). I don't think appropriate elements should merely be dumped into <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Australia_2ac0.html" title="Geography of Australia">Geography of Australia</a> (and shouldn't be merged with it), since there may be ambiguity there about whether the article does (or should) deal with the country alone or continent. To compare: crack is a form of cocaine, but not vice versa. This move/merge to the current locale would also be inline with the common naming convention and the practice of naming articles that are ambiguous; see <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia.html" title="Georgia">Georgia</a>, etc. (Also note that there are more Google hits for Sahul than "Australia-New Guinea" and scant few for Meganesia.)</dd>
<dd>And I'll fix/update the maps, which I didn't have a chance to properly update earlier. Thoughts? E Pluribus Anthony | <a href="../../../e/_/p/User_talk%7EE_Pluribus_Anthony_adc5.html" title="User talk:E Pluribus Anthony"><i>talk</i></a> | 22:29, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've merged the former <i>Australia-New Guinea</i> here as discussed. I agree that this article should not be merged with <i><a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Australia_2ac0.html" title="Geography of Australia">Geography of Australia</a></i> nor have appropriate elements dumped into it. As discussed on that article's <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeography_of_Australia_51cf.html#Subject_of_page" title="Talk:Geography of Australia">talk page</a> it seems that the article is, should be and always had been intended to be about the geography of the Commonwealth of Australia. It would also seem that the main reason that a merge with <i><a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Australia_2ac0.html" title="Geography of Australia">Geography of Australia</a></i> was suggested in the first place was that it appeared unlikely that <i>Australia (continent)</i> would "develop into a significqantly distinctive article,". Well, I think that by merging <i>Australia-New Guinea</i> here it has so developed. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 07:39, 29 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Works for me! When the geography article is more refined (or even before), it might also be wise to add a hatnote atop the that article to promote clarity.

<dd>Furthermore, I've updated the map (and have made appropriate article edits) to include New Guinea and intervening islands; since the continental shelf boundary is rather undefined (and based on some online searching), I colourised <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> (including <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torres_Strait_Islands_49a4.html" title="Torres Strait Islands">Torres Strait Islands</a>), and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Guinea_eecc.html" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a> (including the eastern portion of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/u/Aru_Islands_e0d7.html" title="Aru Islands">Aru</a>/<a href="../../../m/a/l/Maluku.html" title="Maluku">Maluku Islands</a>)) and mainland provinces of <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papua_New_Guinea_eb0d.html" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>).</dd>

<p>Is the part that says <i>Australia and New Guinea both sit on top of a single tectonic plate, the Indo-Australian Plate, and are connected by a shallow continental shelf. All were joined onto Antarctica as part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana until the plate began to drift north about 96 million years ago (mya)</i> relevant?

<dl>
<dd>"... only a theory ..." a favourite catch phrase of Young-Earth Creationists. It's not <i>only</i> a theory: it's a <i>scientific</i> theory.

<p>Since when does Europe have its own continental plate? Since when does Asia sit on only one continental plate? This is not how continents are defined at all.

<p>I agree there's is nothing of geological in the definitionof continents. After the name itself ("land together") it's only a conjecture about the shape of the lands. For example, Asia and India are on different c. shelves. 145.94.13.99 15:27, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Dept of Foreign Affairs link you provided was not talking continents in the geological sense. It is talking Commowealth of Australia. The Indonesian Government is talking faunal distinctions and the Sahul Shelf. It contradicts nothing in the Australian Government's Australian Institute of Marine Science site. Similarly the Indonesian academic's site does not contradict but augments the AIMS site. The DFAT site you gave <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/island_continent.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/island_continent.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> does not deal with the detail of whether or not the Sahul shelf (which incorproates New Guinea) is or is not part of the continent - ie it does not contradict the wikipedia article or clarify as it lacks the necessary detail. It refers to the <i>Australian continent is part of the Indian–Australian tectonic plate</i> but does not say what is or is not included. This page <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/oceans/mc_LawSea.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ga.gov.au/oceans/mc_LawSea.jsp" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> includes a map prepared by Geoscience Australia which makes the distinction between claimed political boundaries and the continental shelf. You will see that New Guinea is art of the Australian continental shelf. Can you find a scientific site that disagrees the Sahul shelf is part of the Australian continent? Not even the Indonesian governemnt disagrees? Your issue with Indonesian sources seems very POV and not warranted. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">Arktos</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 01:10, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is not a POV, it is a simple fact, as of this moment, Indo-Australian relations are very strained due to drug traffiking and smuggling problems that what either side says about the other should not be taken into consideration. Now, you keep finding "excuses" to counter the claim that Australia is an island-continent, despite the fact that you apparently haven't done any research into the subject. Google returned "18,900" results to "island continent +geography" when you punch it in and i took 6 articles that show references to it. Despite all else, you have to accept the fact that island-continent is a commonly used alternate name for Australia, even if you don't approve of it as a continental definition. But you have made it clear that you don't like any changes to your page, so i'm not going to try anymore. -59.167.38.13 01:16, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with Arktos that just because we sometimes call it "the island continent" doesn't actually make it so. Nevertheless, the fact that we sometimes call it "the island continent" is a notable cultural reference to the subject of the article. I suggest the creation of a "Cultural references" section, to include text something like:</p>

<p>Although Australia may be considered a continent by itself,more often it is included as part of Oceania-this also includes New Zealand,Fiji,Samoa,Tonga and various other Pacific islands. It is as part of Oceania that Australia competes in varying sporting events. Despite Jasbutal's assurance that 'Wikipedia says so' Australia is not considered as part of Asia and Australians are not regarded as being Asians.

OK, if that's what the consensus is, fair enough. But Wikipedia has to be consistent about this, and that's not the case at present. Our article on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> has the following statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Australia ... is a country in the Southern Hemisphere comprising the world's smallest <u>continent</u> and a number of islands in the Southern, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.</i>
<ul>
<li><b>This assumes that the continent does not extend beyond the mainland of the Commonwealth of Australia.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>The <u>continent of Australia</u> has been inhabited for more than 42,000 years by Indigenous Australians.</i>
<ul>
<li><b>There's no mention of inhabitation by native New Guineans.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>After sporadic visits by fishermen from the north and by European explorers and merchants starting in the seventeenth century, the eastern half of the <u>continent</u> was claimed by the British in 1770 and officially settled through penal transportation as the colony of New South Wales on 26 January 1788.</i>
<ul>
<li><b>That British claim did not include any part of New Guinea as far as I know.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

See the article on <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lie-to-children.html" title="Lie-to-children">Lie-to-children</a> which explains the concept of pedagogic simplification - ie <i>Such statements are not usually intended as deceptions, and may, in fact, be true to a first approximation or within certain contexts.

<dd>The idea that a continent includes all the islands on the continental shelf is new to me, but makes sense. Given my biological background, I'm very aware of the Wallace Line through Indonesia, which marks the divide between Asian and Australian fauna. By implication, the Australian continent extends all the way to Lombok, just across the water from Bali. However this is a difficult concept for many to come to terms with, although I notice the article does address the issue. I think some headings would help emphasise the point, though. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 03:04, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The scope of this article is good but I think there are better names for it. There is much debate above about the Australia-only vs Australia-New Guinea basis for the continent. Good points have been raised by JackofOz and others and while I think they are ultimately red herrings, they have been dismissed with arguments that don’t stand up.</p>
<p>There are several different meanings of the words continent and continental. One is a continuous landmass or mainland, a second is all the lands and islands on a continental shelf and a third includes associated oceanic islands not on the shelf. Taking Europe for example, the “Continent” or “continental Europe” is only the mainland, the 2nd definition includes islands on the shelf like the British Isles and the 3rd includes oceanic islands like Iceland.</p>
<p>In the case of Australia, the first and most common meaning is the Australian mainland. To dismiss this as pedagogic simplification is (ironically) an oversimplification, if not actually wrong. Sometimes continent appears to be a synecdoche for the whole of the country of Aust., as in the title of the book by historian David Day, “Claiming a continent: a history of Australia” (1996). And sometimes it means Aust and NG. To dismiss the term “island continent” as an informal term for marketing is incorrect. Sir Grenfell Price, a leading Australian geographer, titled his 1972 book about Aust, "Island Continent". Arthur Scholes, in the foreword to his book about Aust, "The Sixth Continent" (1958), said “[this] is the story of an island continent”. A much more recent publication, "Australia: the complete encyclopedia" (2001) says, “Today the island continent of Australia extends from about 10 S to 45 S”.</p>
<p>Writers, from scholars to journalists, usually mean the Aust mainland. Marcus Clarke titled an 1877 book “History of the continent of Australia and the island of Tasmania”. Geographer Ronald Heathcote made a similar distinction, “around Tasmania and the southeastern coasts of the continent” (‘’Australia’’ 1994, 12), while also recognising the broader definition: “If the boundaries of the continent are extended to the 100 fathom line to include the offshore continental shelf, a … component forming a link with the island of New Guinea could be distinguished. However … attention here will be limited to the main continental area” (p15). Flannery and Schouten said, “Australia, which comprises the bulk of Meganesia, is indeed the smallest continent” (in Natural History 102 (6) 40-45, 1993). I searched the SMH <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.smh.com.au/" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> for “continent” and all the references in the Australian context seemed to refer to the mainland. And as JackofOz points out above, many Wikipedia articles refer to the mainland as the continent. This is not wrong – it is just different from the concept that this article is based on.</p>
<p>I think the best solution is to rename this article. Note that Johnson (2004, 12) (cited by Snottygobble/Hesperian) said “the continent extends to the edge of the continental shelf”. He did not say, “Australia extends to the edge of the continental shelf”. In fact, on the same page he has an image of Australia that does not include NG, and elsewhere he refers to “the Australian continent” with no indication he means to include NG (eg, p 106). Much of the earlier debates above are about the ambiguous terms “the continent Australia”, “the Australian continent” or “the continent of Australia”. The objections raised are unlikely to be raised if we were instead discussing the continent of “Australia-New Guinea”, “Sahul”, “Meganesia” etc.</p>
<p>An article name, to distill down Wikipedia’s article naming convention, should be well-known (easily recognised and readily thought of when making links) and reasonably unambiguous. Unlike article content, common usage is more important than recent scholarship – see <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMMONNAME_4276.html" title="WP:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a>. By these criteria, the merits of the candidates are:</p>

<dd>Clearly this debate is in good hands. I support Nurg's proposal for a rename, and I'll trust his judgement on the new name. <a href="../../../h/e/s/User_talk%7EHesperian_5634.html" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> 11:57, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand the points made by Nurg, but the point of this article (and I queried its intention early on) was to talk about the continent and not the island. In the first instance the lead should define what we are talking about and I think does so. If we want to move away from <i>Australia (continent)</i> as an article title, then I favour either <i>Sahul</i> or <i>Australinea</i>, but I suspect both those terms come with their own baggage and are not quite as general and I would prefeer redirects from those to the simpler Australia (continent). I do not favour Australia-New Guinea as that seems too tied up with political boundaries.</dd>
<dd>Nurg makes the point about continental Europe excluding say the British Isles. I feel that is because it is an Anglocentric term and the Continent is somewhere you travel too. The English of a certain generation and class would use it in the same breath as talking about the "Near East" and the "Far East" ... fine terms for the English of a certain period but we are talking continent small c and lining up with articles such as that on <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, different discussion to English travelling in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Often for many people North America is synonomous with the United States but they can quickly disentangle themselves from that as Canada is so large. Note that North America as a continent does not equal <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Plate_8b63.html" title="North American Plate">North American Plate</a>. If you ask somebody to list continents they do not go Africa, Asia, North and South America, Antarctica, Sahul ... or Australinea or Australia-New Guinea - the last in that list is Australia. We need to make it clear in the name that we are not talking the political entity. We need to make it clear in the lead how we have defined our terms. The term continent, as per the English travelling classes to name just one group, can be used in different ways. Wikipedia has an article on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">Continent</a> and there it has listed the subject of this article as Australia, another name would not match the list in that article in my opinion - but we should certainly discuss it there too if changing the article name.</dd>
<dd>If any editor thinks that the term "island continent" does not derive from pedagogic simplification ... I have no difficulty with a rewrite of that section and an expansion to acknowledge popular usage, for example as per Nurg's search of the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> and reference to various scholars (normally in the arts though). My write up on that point was in response to a couple of comments on the article such as can be seen above, for example those by DXRAW, on this talk page, which were asserting "<i>every single student in Australia is taught that Australia is a continent of its own</i>" plus "<i>In Australia we are taught that the continent of Australia is only our country and that New Guinea and other country&#160;:P are part of Asia. This is what the Australian education system says.</i>" from Rkeys.</dd>
<dd>As one point of reference of what Australian school children are taught, the NSW HSC curriculum at <a href="http://hsc.csu.edu.au/earth_environmental/core/tectonic/9-2-4/ees9.2.4.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://hsc.csu.edu.au/earth_environmental/core/tectonic/9-2-4/ees9.2.4.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> states "The Australian continent lies entirely within the Australia-India plate, and so it does not experience plate boundary processes." At <a href="http://hsc.csu.edu.au/earth_environmental/core/tectonic/9-2-3/ees9_2_3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://hsc.csu.edu.au/earth_environmental/core/tectonic/9-2-3/ees9_2_3.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> doesn't help with a definition but for example discusses the "Interaction between the converging Australian and Pacific plates has produced the current New Guinea mobile belt." They also refer to continent probably as in island continent at <a href="http://hsc.csu.edu.au/ab_studies/land/aboriginality_and_land/alresponses.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://hsc.csu.edu.au/ab_studies/land/aboriginality_and_land/alresponses.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> and <a href="http://hsc.csu.edu.au/pta/PTC_Planner2_06v3.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://hsc.csu.edu.au/pta/PTC_Planner2_06v3.pdf" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> <a href="http://hsc.csu.edu.au/music/musicology/info/topics/australian_music/australian_music_meale_voss.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://hsc.csu.edu.au/music/musicology/info/topics/australian_music/australian_music_meale_voss.htm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> etc - it isn't clear.

<dd>Not sure where that leaves us, other than the importance of a lead clearly defining terms and robust referencing.

<dd>It is totally correct that the term continent is used in different ways. The different usages are now explained better on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> page. It is also correct that when people list the continents they say Australia. But exactly what they mean by Australia varies. Often it will be the mainland of Australia only; relatively few people will be thinking of New Guinea as well. Most dictionaries include "continuous" land in their definitions of "continent" (see references in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a>); only some extend it to the shelf as an additional definition. When Wp articles refer to the mainland of Australia as a continent (either explicitly or implicitly), or use continent as a synecdoche for the whole of the country of Aust., they should link to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>; when they refer to the continental-shelf continent, they should link to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australia (continent)</a>/<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-New_Guinea_b540.html" title="Australia-New Guinea">Australia-New Guinea</a>. The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> article links to both as appropriate - and also to <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceania.html" title="Oceania">Oceania</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australasia.html" title="Australasia">Australasia</a>, to cover all usages! Granted there is ambiguity between Australia the mainland and Australia the country. But the ambiguity is reality and we have to accept it (and explain it where necessary). And that ambiguity will not be resolved by whatever we call this article - it could be resolved by creating an additional article for the mainland alone (but I'm not suggesting that be done - I can live with the ambiguity). <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_7392.html" title="User:Nurg">Nurg</a> 05:59, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sure that Matthew Flinders and Lachlan Macquarie were not thinking of New Guinea when they proposed "Australia" as the name for the country (although it wasn't a country back then, just a collection of British colonies, which did not even cover the entire big island). The issue seems to be that geographers, in their wisdom(?), have only relatively recently given the name "Australia" to a continent, when the name already applied to a country that was a part of that continent. <i>(God only knows what they were thinking of. They would never have named Africa "Nigeria", for example, because of the obvious scope for confusion.)</i> I wonder if we can find out when this continent-naming occurred, and why they chose that particular name. If "Australia" is indeed the accepted formal technical geographical term for the continent, I don't think that Wikipedia has any brief - consensus or not - to go around renaming it to anything else, as this would breach our no original research policy. Besides, nobody but us few would know of the existence of this new name, and we'd have an article that few people would ever read. But on the other hand, "Sahul" also exists. So are geographers unanimous in what they call the continent? If not, why not, and do they intend to get together to agree on what the continent will be known as? Can we do anything to influence that decision to ensure it is NOT called "Australia". In the meantime, I still firmly believe that readers of the article about the country Australia need to be informed that the same name also refers to a larger entity, and that the continent and the country are not coterminous, but overlap. Another issue that's just dropped into my mind is that some years ago Australia the big island lost its claim as the world's largest island, on the basis that it is more correctly described as a continental land mass, and the honour now goes to Greenland. I can accept that. However, if the big island is no longer viewed as a continent but only part of a continent, doesn't that mean that it's an island after all and should be restored to its place as the world's largest. If it's not a continent in its own right, and it's not an island, what is it? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 23:08, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think disambiguation by <i>(continent)</i> is appropriate and adequate to distinguish from the other uses of the word Australia. That to date the article on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> refers to it as Australia is a good indication that the most common term to think about the subject of this article is Australia and not some other term. I think other terms including <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-New_Guinea_b540.html" title="Australia-New Guinea">Australia-New Guinea</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahul.html" title="Sahul">Sahul</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/g/Meganesia.html" title="Meganesia">Meganesia</a>, Greater Australia and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australinea.html" title="Australinea">Australinea</a> should all be redirects (as they are in fact are with the exception of Greater Australia) and thus they will work as search terms. The word <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/synecdoche#Noun" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:synecdoche">synecdoche</a> is absolutely perfect for describing the quandary but I don't think the answer is to rename with another term. The answer is I believe to have a good lead to the article defining what we mean and proper references to support our assertion.</dd>
<dd>I note that <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-New_Guinea_b540.html" title="Australia-New Guinea">Australia-New Guinea</a> has been used quite frequently in other articles, particularly zoology articles (see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Australia-New_Guinea_4102.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Australia-New Guinea">Special:Whatlinkshere/Australia-New_Guinea</a>) and the next most commonly linked term is Sahul - refer <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Sahul_52a6.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Sahul">Special:Whatlinkshere/Sahul</a></dd>

<p>I can appreciate the reasoning behind this proposed move, but the problem is that there is really no alternative. None of the alternatives proposed are commonly known. In fact, I'd say they're only known to the geologist community, and the chances of them needing to research on Wikipedia seems slim. The current title seems like the least worst alternative, to me.</p>
<p>My other problem is that including New Guinea seems frightfully arbitrary, while there is some legitimate scientific opinion holding that they're the same 'continent', it doesn't seem to be dominant. To me, putting the two together just because they're on the same continental shelf seems like moving <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> to Europe-Britain, or <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> to North America-Newfoundland.</p>

<dd>"Australia-New Guinea" may not be commonly known but surely when people come across it, they quickly deduce what it means with considerable accuracy. On the other hand, "Australia (continent)" is highly ambiguous as it commonly refers to the Australian mainland only. Can you explain what you mean when you say including New Guinea seems arbitrary? It seems to me a fairly precise name. The analogy with "Europe-Britain" and "North America-Newfoundland" is not quite apt as neither Europe nor North America are individual countries. Likewise we do not have articles called Europe (continent) or <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_%28continent%29_3add.html" title="North America (continent)">North America (continent)</a>, but it would also be inapt to use that fact as an argument in favour of my proposed change, so I merely slip the fact in. I don't think scholars in Britain or Newfoundland would object as much to being told they are part of Europe or North America, as scholars in <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papua_%28Indonesian_province%29_07ff.html" title="Papua (Indonesian province)">Papuan Indonesia</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papua_New_Guinea_eb0d.html" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> would object to being told they are in Australia, the continent. <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_7392.html" title="User:Nurg">Nurg</a> 11:09, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello - two cents worth from North America -- Speaking as a geologist, I know that Australia and New Guinea and a few other items like Timor are more or less on the same tectonic plate (although it could be argued that NE New Guinea is a zone caught up between the Australian and Pacific Plates) and as you all know, they share the same continental shelf. But if you say to me "the continent of Australia," I would hear that in the geographic, not geologic context, and would think of Australia per se, plus Tasmania, perhaps. If you look up the area of Australia in any atlas or almanac, it includes neither the continental shelf nor New Guinea. It seems to me that this is mostly a matter of semantics, but since the lead paragraph of the article starts with "In geology...", then as long as you are clear what you mean (as it seems to me you all are), then just go with it. There might be a reason for a link on New Guinea pages to this one.

<dd>Ah, Geologyguy, I have been deferring doing anything about the "In geology..." bit which Michael Johnson added. I think it is inappropriate. The majority of the content is about geography (including biogeography) and biology. There is a little about geology and brief reference (which could be expanded) to archaeology. Of the 5 categories, 2 are explicitly geography, 2 more I consider also geography and the 5th is natural history (which can include geology but is also much broader). A geology article of relevance is actually <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Plate_37d7.html" title="Australian Plate">Australian Plate</a>, although it's not called that (not sure why it doesn't have its own article). I don't think it is necessary to have "In ..." anything at the start, but if we do, I think "In geography" is more appropriate. The concept of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> is primarily geographic, is it not? Geology deals more with plates and cratons than continents, does it not? Geologists and Michael Johnson (biologist) - your thoughts?</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I understood the article was to be about geology, which is why I added the (admittedly clumsy) "in geology". Clearly the definition of the area covered is not a bioligical, historical, cultural, political or geological definition. If it has no validity in geology, then what reason is there for it? --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 01:19, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, what reputable geology sources say that "Australia" is the name of the continent which embraces Australia and New Guinea? If scholars won't even call it "Greater Australia"<sup id="_ref-Denoon_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Denoon" title="">[1]</a></sup>, I'd be very surprised if they called it "Australia". <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_7392.html" title="User:Nurg">Nurg</a> 11:09, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, I agree (as I tried to say in my roundabout way above!) that the concept of continent is basically geographic. And indeed, the geologic concept is "Australian Plate" or, as redirected, "Indo-Australian Plate" - there is not a separate page because the Indian Ocean plate and Australia are more or less moving together as one. Just as you say, to me as a geologist, "Australia" does not mean the plate, it means either the country, or the continent which would be more or less one and the same (depending mostly on how you count Tasmania). The Australian (or Indo-Australian) plate has little to do with the continent (though it does include it), or even the continent+continental shelf, inasmuch as the plate includes vast areas of oceanic crust. I'm not familiar with a usage of the word 'continent' that automatically includes the continental shelf - without specification, shelfal areas are not counted in areas, nor (I think - I am not a lawyer) in determinations of international boundaries etc.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, even though I sort of applauded the intro "In geology..." above, I was actually still uncomfortable with "Australia (continent)" because in geology, the word continent alone would, I think, usually imply the geographic context. We would go on to talk about continental shelves, continental crust, continental rocks, none of which would necessarily be coincident with the geographic continent. I would definitely make a distinction between any 'continent' and 'continental areas' - I would say that is general among geologists, though obviously I can't speak for the entire profession. Thus, the sentence in paragraph 3, <i>"Geologically the continent extends to the edge of the continental shelf, so the now-separate lands can still be considered a continent"</i> would for me need to be re-phrased as "Geologically continental rocks extend to the edge of the continental shelf, so the now-separate lands <b>would all be considered part of the same continental mass</b>." To me, below-sea-level areas are in no way "continents" (geographically) even though they may indeed be continental in nature (geologically). "Continental" and "continent" have significantly different technical meanings, which seems to me to be the source of much of the disagreement (most amicable disagreements, might I note!) here.</dd>

<dd>No, I'm not aware of sources that equate "Australia" the continent with Australia+New Guinea, unless in something where it was defined for convenience. Likewise, there might exist refs that called "Greater Australia" some who-knows-what entity that might include Indonesia (or parts of it) and even New Zealand, for some specific purpose. To me such writing is confusing, though if the rationale and definition for convenient reference are made clear, I guess it is OK - but not in general and not for an encyclopedia (except in disambiguation, I guess).</dd>

<p>On 16 December I raised (but did not promote) the possibility of creating an additional article for the mainland alone. I am now firming up this suggestion as it may resolve some of the issues in some people's minds. I have created a <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_Australia_%28mainland%29_494d.html" title="User:Nurg/Australia (mainland)">draft</a> which I have tentatively called "<a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_Australia_%28mainland%29_494d.html" title="User:Nurg/Australia (mainland)">Australia (mainland)</a>". So I now propose either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rename the present article "Australia-New Guinea" (as already discussed) and create the new article called either "Australia (mainland)" or "Australia (continent)".</li>
<li>Just rename the present article "Australia-New Guinea" (as already discussed).</li>
</ol>
<p>What does everyone prefer? I am happy with either and if a new article is created, I am happy with either name for it. If we go with the first option, we would need to think carefully about the mechanics in order to minimise the amount of link-changing required - but for now we just need to decide in principle.

<p>Nurg's article is good as far as it goes, and why not just put it up? As for Australia (continent) what is to be done? I don't know what it is, I just know what it isn't!

<p><b>Support</b> the move back to Australia-New Guinea, which is where this article used to live. Australia (continent) is unhelpful, as the geological and geographic senses of "continent" are not entirely synonymous. Sahul and Meganesia aren't bad choices either, but Australia-New Guinea is probably most widely used and understood. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Radulovich_3e4e.html" title="User:Tom Radulovich">Tom Radulovich</a> 07:33, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Support</b> fot the move away from Australia (continent), assuming the article continues to be about a wider area than the Australian mainland. See discussion in subsequent sections, in which Nurg has pointed out that Australia (continent) is unverifiable for this. I also reject Australia (continent) for an article about the mainland only, despite frequent reference to the mainland as a "continent" (as opposed to an "island"), because of its incorrect implication about New Guinea. Incidentally, imo we should clearly support the concept of the continent in question covering the whole of the island of New Guinea, which is both physically and culturally correct; if <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> can be in two continents then so can <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewfinder_116d.html" title="User:Viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> 09:42, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Australia (continent) is fine. Or you could go with "Continental Australia". Either way, I think such a long and pointless discussion about changing an article such as this merely demonstrates the pedantry of those concerned, and though I hestitate to claim dfference from such a despiccable and embarassing state by prostrating myself to the level of you all in order to carry forth this discussion, I feel I must in order tom via one last act of pedantry, dissolve such a concentration of ridiculous pedants that it hurts my brain.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In a geologic context, Australia (continent) is technically bunkum anyway; it's the Indo-Australian Plate. It is composed of several distinct fragments of continental crust in a mire of oceanic crustal material, a few remnant ocean island plateaux and failed rifts. However, I agree with everyone who disagrees with a geological basis for naming this article, not because they are more right or less pedantic than the rest of you (and you guys are WAY pedantic, even by Wiki standards!), but because even if the current article lacks coherent geological information it is only a matter of time to put this in with some creative copy editing and a cut and paste, but because it makes no sense to do this because the majority of humans are NOT geologists and consider only continents as being land masses <i>above</i> mean sea level.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>All the other terms, <i>especially</i> Australia-New Guinea and the like, are obscure terms far from the common usage of most people interested in "Australia, the only nation which owns an entire continent", etcetera. Sahul, meganesia are both rarely used, if not completely obscure terms. Meganesia is to my mind just a flippant anthropological foil to "micronesia"; the anthropological grouping of the Australian aborigine with the micronesian and polynesian peoples. Which is bullshit anyway, as the two groups are completely culturally and historically seperate. So micronesia is out. Sahul? I haven't even heard of it before, and I'm an Aussie.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Functionally, there is no synedouche or pedagogical or semantic reason, if anyone really gives a flying fuck, about whether you call an apple an apple or a spade a spade. Why change the name of an article just because it sounds clunky? Really, be honest. You all just want a flashy name which fits just right and doesn't have parentheses in it, because it makes it seem like we can't come up- with a perfect one word name for an article. But this is ridiculous; Australia (continent) obviously means many things; this page could EASILY be turned into its own disambiguation page into Australia (continental geology), Continental Australia (biology), or whatever. But should we split or keep, is more a question of clunkiness of the article than of the title.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I vote, that <i>until such times as the article becomes so large, unweildy and rotted with the cankers of sub-headings within nested sub-headings and above 30kb in length</i> it should be left well enough alone and our efforts devoted to Christmas cheer, and New Years festivities. Or, you know, not wasting too much time with pedantry.<a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolinator_4b12.html" title="User:Rolinator">Rolinator</a> 03:49, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems to me that the claim by Nurg that the Australian continent does not include New Guinea is like claiming that the European continent does not include Great Britain. Are all the world's islands excluded from its continents? So I don't live in Europe after all? I apologise for claiming that the matter has not been discussed on the talk page, that was incorrect, but if there really is a majority in favour of Nurg's changes that I am frankly amazed. I do not think that their logical extensions have been considered, and they are inconsistent with Wikipedia's continental maps. <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewfinder_116d.html" title="User:Viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> 05:07, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to the Times Atlas, New Guinea and New Zealand are included within a continent called "Australasia". While this authority should not be taken as indisputable, I really do not think that the view that the Commonwealth of Australia occupies an entire <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> is the majority view worldwide. It seems to me that this matter should at least be the subject of discussion on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> talk page before Nurg's changes are reinstated. <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewfinder_116d.html" title="User:Viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> 05:52, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Viewfinder. New Guinea is not part of the contiguous continent of Australia. It does share a continental shelf with Australia and is therefore part of the more broadly-defined continent of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-New_Guinea_b540.html" title="Australia-New Guinea">Australia-New Guinea</a>. Similarly, as you note, Great Britain is not part of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Europe_11b3.html" title="Continental Europe">Continental Europe</a> but is part of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Yes, a continental map for the mainland of Australia is required, in addition to the Australia-New Guinea one. It is true that some geographers take Australasia (and even Oceania) to be equivalent to a continent. This is already covered in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html#Extent_of_continents" title="Continent">Continent#Extent_of_continents</a>. However, when the 7 most-commonly recognised continents are listed, "Australia" is most often mentioned, followed perhaps by Oceania ahead of Australasia. The problem with including NZ is that it is on a separate continental shelf (<a href="../../../z/e/a/Zealandia.html" title="Zealandia">Zealandia</a>). If this doesn't answer all your concerns, feel free to restate any issues. Regards <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_7392.html" title="User:Nurg">Nurg</a> 06:52, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Nurg, thank you for your response and again I apologise for my incorrect edit summary in the main article. But I am concerned about your claim that a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> has to be contiguous. I agree that this is so according to a narrow definition of continent, but I think that this is a minority definition. The world is divided up into continents, and imo the world's entire land surface has a continent. <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceland.html" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> tectonically belongs to North America but is still considered to be in Europe. Even if the relevant continent is most frequently referred to as "Australia", that does not imply that it includes only its contiguous part. There needs to be a proper distinction between Australia (continent) and the Commonwealth of Australia. Should we list an alternative European continent on the continent page, that excludes Britain and Ireland? To my mind, there should be eight continents, including an Australia (continent) which includes the island of New Guinea, and an Oceania which includes New Zealand and other oceanic "continents".</p>
<p>In summary, it seems to me that having a article <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australia (continent)</a> about a continent that includes only the Commonwealth of Australia's mainland is at best POV. If you stand by your version, I think you should present the case for it on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> talk page. If your case is supported, then so be it, but imo it will create inconsistencies and confusion. <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewfinder_116d.html" title="User:Viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> 07:54, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Viewfinder. No offence taken over the edit summary. There are different definitions of <i>continent</i> and these are covered at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html#Definitions_and_application" title="Continent">Continent#Definitions_and_application</a>. Contiguity is part of one definition; the inclusion of islands on the continental shelf is part of another; the inclusion of oceanic islands beyond the shelf (like Iceland) is part of another. All this is mentioned and referenced in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> article. Your opinion that the first definition is a minority definition is not supported by the dictionaries listed at footnote 2 in that article, nor by Lewis &amp; Wigen (also cited there). Your opinion that the world's entire land surface has a continent is a view also recorded in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html#Extent_of_continents" title="Continent">Continent#Extent_of_continents</a>, although Lewis &amp; Wigen call Oceania a "quasi continent" (footnote 6). I totally agree there should be a distinction between the country Australia and the continent. I go further and say Wp should distinguish between the country, the contiguous continent and the broader continent of Australia-New Guinea - that gives greatest clarity and unambiguity. Your view that there are 8 continents is not one that gets a mention in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> article.</dd>

<dd>We are dealing with a difficult problem, which is why I have been patiently discussing it here for nearly 2 months (to the frustration of some others who seem less patient). While it is always instructive to look at parallels with other situations, this is a unique problem because it is the only case where the same name is used for a country and a continent, which raises real political issues. To say that the Republic of Ireland is part of the British Isles is controversial (per <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_naming_dispute_9e6a.html" title="British Isles naming dispute">British Isles naming dispute</a>); to say that the Republic of Ireland is part of Great Britain would be downright inflammatory (and incorrect), but that is similar to telling people in <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papua_%28Indonesian_province%29_07ff.html" title="Papua (Indonesian province)">Papuan Indonesia</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papua_New_Guinea_eb0d.html" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> that they are in Australia (albeit Australia, the continent). When you ask if we should list an alternative European continent on the continent page, do you mean the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> article or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EContinents_of_the_world_e6a9.html" title="Template:Continents of the world">Template:Continents_of_the_world</a>? The article does mention both <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Europe_11b3.html" title="Continental Europe">continental Europe</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> so I'm guessing you mean the template, in which case, no we don't need <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Europe_11b3.html" title="Continental Europe">continental Europe</a> there. However, because of the unique issues with Australia, I think we need both <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australia (continent)</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-New_Guinea_b540.html" title="Australia-New Guinea">Australia-New Guinea</a> there. I have drafted a new template at <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_Template%7EContinents_of_the_world_1c17.html" title="User:Nurg/Template:Continents of the world">User:Nurg/Template:Continents_of_the_world</a> which also solves the Kerguelen Plateau &amp; Zealandia problem which I raised at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Template_talk%7EContinents_of_the_world_7843.html" title="Template talk:Continents of the world">Template_talk:Continents_of_the_world</a>. There is one outstanding issue which is the need for a wee map of the Australian mainland - for the time being the draft template uses one for the country of Australia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I see no possible objection to having an article about the mainland of Australia, as well as one about the Australia-New Guinea continent, so it is really an issue over naming, is it not? I'm still of the opinion that "Australia (continent)" is the best name for a mainland article - this is not contradicted by the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> article which currently supports the mainland as <i>one</i> definition of the Australian continent - and I think the revised template would remove potential confusion. I think we are better to keep the discussion here and I see you've added a note to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Talk%7EContinent_905e.html" title="Talk:Continent">Talk:Continent</a> pointing people here, which is great, thanks.

<dd>When Australians talk about the Australian mainland, they say "the Australian mainland" or "mainland Australia". If this is to be an article on mainland Australia, I suggest that mainland Australia would be the most appropriate title; it is an informative, concise, unambiguous and inoffensive name in common usage.</dd>
<dd>I wonder if this standoff could be resolved by turning <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australia (continent)</a> into a disambiguation page along the lines of:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
There are various conceptions of the <b>continent of Australia</b>, including:
*<i>mainland Australia, the main Australian island;</i>
*<i>the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Australian_Plate_de43.html" title="Indo-Australian Plate">Indo-Australian Plate</a>, the continental plate upon which Australia sits;</i>
*<i><a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahul.html" title="Sahul">Sahul</a>, also known as Australia-New Guinea, the geological continent consisting of Australia and New Guinea</i>
*<i>...</i>

<dd>This way, Nurg could write his mainland Australia article; most of what Golden Wattle has written here would remain intact at the Sahul/Australia-New Guinea article; and those articles that want to link to an article on the Australian continent, without having to think about what they mean by "continent", could continue to link to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australia (continent)</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/s/User_talk%7EHesperian_5634.html" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> 11:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Hesperian. Taken in isolation, calling it mainland Australia (or Australia (mainland)) is perfectly reasonable. Unfortunately the article won't exist in isolation. Likewise, an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australia (continent)</a> disambiguation page as you suggest is perfectly reasonable - in isolation. The problem is setting up a situation for people to unthinkingly link to a disamb page - not the worst thing that could happen, but not desirable either. The crux of the problem is exemplified by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EContinents_of_the_world_e6a9.html" title="Template:Continents of the world">Template:Continents_of_the_world</a>. There is no dispute that the name that appears in the line of 7 standard continents should be "Australia". The issue is whether it should point to the shelf continent or the mainland continent, and what to do about the other. My proposed solution is to include both as per <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_Template%7EContinents_of_the_world_1c17.html" title="User:Nurg/Template:Continents of the world">User:Nurg/Template:Continents_of_the_world</a>.</dd>

<p>I'm reluctant to intrude more geological technicalities in your discussion, which I must say again is a remarkably calm one. But geological entities really have little to do with either continental shelves or land masses when we get precise, and I have to correct the perception above about Iceland. Half of Iceland belongs tectonically to the North American Plate, and half to the Eurasian Plate, just as important sections of New Zealand are on the Indo-Australian Plate and parts are on the Pacific Plate. The plates seem to me to be well covered in the tectonic articles; as an outsider, it just seems to me that you all have to decide what it is here that you want to talk about, and give it an agreeable name. I suppose you already knew that!! Cheers, <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeologyguy_0f3f.html" title="User:Geologyguy">Geologyguy</a> 15:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The above para was reverted but I restored it, even though it did challenge my comment above about Iceland. That comment was based on the fact that if the sea level were to fall by about 600m the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prominence.html" title="Prominence">prominence</a> parent of Iceland's highest point would be in North America, not Europe (albeit by a small amount), but OK, perhaps it was not correct. <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewfinder_116d.html" title="User:Viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> 17:37, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem with the first definition of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a>, based on land contiguity, is that it creates a myriad of implicit inconsistencies. See <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, "Scotland is a nation in Europe", and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, which clearly states that Europe is a continent. If we go by the continental shelf definition there are considerably fewer inconsistencies, but there are still some, at least if Geologyguy is correct, see <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceland.html" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>: "This article is about the country in Europe". (Politically, it is, and the Icelanders surely consider themselves to be European). I am surprised that Nurg is concerned about Papuans and the Australian continent, see <a href="../../../s/e/v/Talk%7ESeven_Summits_d7c9.html" title="Talk:Seven Summits">Talk: Seven Summits</a> which (I think) includes a major contribution from a Papuan. Do Latin Americans mind belonging to the American continent even though they are not Americans in the sense that they are not part of the USA? I am surprised that the Australian continent is considered by some to include only the Commonwealth of Australia mainland, but if that is so, then OK. But I agree with Hesperian's suggestion that there should be clear disambiguation, and that "Australia (continent)" should at least be neutral on this issue, and that any article about the CA mainland should be so named. I reaffirm my opposition to any article about the CA mainland being named "Australia (continent)". <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewfinder_116d.html" title="User:Viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> 17:37, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, there are many inconsistencies because the concept of continents largely has historical and cultural bases rather than a scientific basis. Ultimately Wp reports the definitions (multiple and inconsistent) that exist, it doesn't create them - that would be original work.

<dd>We need to get beyond opinion to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> info. Going back to the <a href="#Suggested_change_of_article_name" title="">start of this discussion</a> 2 mths ago, in the 3rd para I asserted that the first and most common meaning of the Australian continent is the Australian mainland. I based this on references to Price (1972), Scholes (1958), "Australia: the complete encyclopedia" (2001), Clarke (1877), Heathcote (1994), Flannery and Schouten (1993), Johnson (2004), the Sydney Morning Herald (popular rather than scholarly) and, less importantly, other <a href="#Once_again" title="">Wp articles cited by JackofOz</a>. No-one here has discredited these references or countered them with opposing references. The ensuing discussion did however persuade me that simply changing the name of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australia (continent)</a> (as I originally proposed) was less desirable than splitting off the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-New_Guinea_b540.html" title="Australia-New Guinea">Australia-New Guinea</a> continent and keeping the name "Australia (continent)" for the contiguous definition. In the absence of new info from verifiable, reputable sources, I stand by the main thrust of my changes to this article and the draft template for the continents. As to detail, I propose the addition of the disamb hatnotes and welcome other suggestions for the article and template. <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_7392.html" title="User:Nurg">Nurg</a> 03:44, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello again Nurg. I cited the Times Atlas Australasia, and Wikipedia's continental maps. Also, on the matter of linking, the radical change to the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australia (continent)</a> rendered my recent contributions to <a href="../../../s/e/v/Talk%7ESeven_Summits_d7c9.html" title="Talk:Seven Summits">Talk:Seven Summits</a>, where I had been citing this article, idiotic, which I was not at all pleased about!! Hence my entry into this debate. I can see that the Australian mainland has been considered too big to be an island and has therefore been called a continent for want of any other term, but like the term "European continent" as used in Britain, this term creates a contradiction with the wider definition and with Wikipedia's continental maps and templates. OK, you can change these maps but where does that leave New Guinea? That it's widely considered to be part of the continent that includes Australia, like Japan is part of the Asia continent, is verifiable and has stood the test of time on Wikipedia. The above discussion that you mention does not seem to me to be unanimous on the subject.</p>
<p>I think that you overestimate the disamb link problem, and underestimate the extent of the link and inconsistency problems I mentioned above caused by radically changing an article without changing its name. There are different definitions of the Australian continent, and imo anyone who links to "Australia (continent)" should be linking to a disamb page because the <i>term is ambiguous</i>, even if it does commonly refer to the mainland. The article about the Australian mainland should be called Australia (mainland), which is unambigous. This maintains a neutral stance, and avoids the problem of changing the information about the boundaries of the world's continents that we give out on Wp.</p>
<p>Therefore I reaffirm my vote for the compromise suggested by Hesperian. But whatever we do, if it is a major change, then the edit summary should include the words "see talk page discussion", making it immediately clear that the matter has been discussed. <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewfinder_116d.html" title="User:Viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> 08:03, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Point taken about the edit summary. I'll try to remember that. I'm sorry for throwing you a curve ball with the edit summary and the Seven Summits situation - it was of course unintentional.

I don't favour Hesperian's compromise overall, however it does not have any factual inaccuracy so I do not oppose it strenuously either. I would not want to take responsibility for implementing it but if someone else does, I will not revert it and we would see how it pans out.

<p>With all due respect to Nurg:</p>
<p>The two Wikipedia articles about the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Australia_f3c2.html" title="Commonwealth of Australia">Commonwealth of Australia</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_continent.html" title="Australian continent">Australian continent</a> are reasonable articles about the political State and about the geographic region. There is <b>no</b> reasonable basis to create 2, 3, or 50 sub-articles about the million different ways you may personally want to re-define the region.</p>
<p>For example, there is <b>NO</b> article about <i>contiguous continent of Asia</i> to exclude Japan from its continent; nor about <i>contiguous continent of Europe</i> to exclude Britain and the city of Venice from Europe because they are surrounded by water. Your concept of <i>contiguous continents</i> is not shared by the world community, English language community this edition is written for, nor by the geographic or any science community.</p>
<p>Also, trying to exclude Papua from the Mainland in a geographical article about the Australian continent is scientifically indefensible. The two land masses are only separated by transient high sea levels; the two masses share a common biosphere; both contain endemic species which are globally accepted as being 'Australian'. i.e. the long nose echidna and Wallace Wallaby are only found in New Guinea, yet the world accepts that echidna and kangaroos are only indigenous to 'Australia' - the region, not the State.58.107.15.245 14:55, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can you provide verifiable, reputable references for the assertion that "Australia" is the name for the region, or even for the single Pleistocene landmass. Ballard (1993)<sup id="_ref-ballard_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ballard" title="">[2]</a></sup> is, to my knowledge, the main work on the nomenclature of the Pleistocene landmass. He surveys the use of a number of names, past and current, including Australasia, Greater Australia, Sahul and Meganesia. Unless I have missed it, he never mentions the use of "Australia" for it - the nearest is Greater Australia. Regarding that term, he follows White and O'Connell (1982)<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup> in saying it tends "to subsume the whole into one part, Australia ..." and adds, "the implicit image of New Guinea as a northerly extension of the Australian landmass is open to the charge of cartographic imperialism" (Ballard, p. 20). More recently, Denoon (2005) said, "Scholars refuse to call this lost continent Greater Australia (or Greater New Guinea)"<sup id="_ref-Denoon_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Denoon" title="">[1]</a></sup> If these scholars reject "Greater Australia", they certainly won't be using "Australia". When it comes to the present-day lands, there are biologists who use names like Meganesia (eg Filewood (1984)<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup> and Flannery (1994)<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup>) and Australinea (Dawkins (2004)<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup>) and not "Australia". If, as you imply, "Australia" is the generally accepted term for the region, I have been missing a big part of the picture and would like to see reputable references. Let's work together to explore the literature and discern the full picture.

<dd>P.S. I suspect Nurg may have been motivated by a mistaken desire to justify New Zealand's separation from the Australian continent. He was correct that New Zealand is considered to be part of the Pacific and not part of the Australian continent; but for very good reasons. 1) New Zealand is approx. 1000 miles away from the Australian mainland, 2) the part of the Indo-Australian plate connecting the two is over 1km below sea level, 3) I may be wrong but my current understanding is that New Zealand is a geologically young country created by the Australian and Pacific plates colliding and has never directly shared its geology with the Australian mainland; and 4) New Zealand had been colonized by a Polynesian people ( Maori ) where as the whole of the Australian continent and its islands were Melanesian (the first French charts marked Australia as part of 'Melanesia' - but this seems to have become unpopular after federation and today most people think Melanesia only referred to the other islands).</dd>
<dd>Papua and Tasmania on the other hand are ancient parts of the original landmass, although Papua like New Zealand is being pushed upwards as the plate moves north.58.107.15.245 15:24, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello again - my only goal is to provide you with information in the geological and tectonic context. New Zealand is, for the most part, geologically young, although rocks as old as <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambrian.html" title="Cambrian">Cambrian</a> (540 million years) are known. Strata older than 100 million years do have affinities with both Australia and Antarctica <a href="http://data.gns.cri.nz/geoatlas/text.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://data.gns.cri.nz/geoatlas/text.jsp" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. So important parts of NZ are old, and continental; the volcanoes are indeed related to the collision between the Indo-Australian and Pacific plates, and are essentially relatively recent island arc rocks.

<p>I checked out two more atlases from my bookshelf, as well as several internet sites. The general pattern was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those authorities which supplied maps that divided the world up into continents, showed a continental area including Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand and the islands in between, as shown on the map at the top right corner of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a>. They called this "Australasia" or "Oceania" but not "Australia".</li>
<li>Those authorities that listed the continents but showed no map generally included "Australia". Further details ducked the questions of New Guinea and New Zealand, and it was not clear whether or not these authorities supported the inclusion of these islands within the continent they referred to as "Australia".</li>
</ul>
<p>It therefore seems that Nurg has a point when he suggests that the name "Australia" for any continent that goes beyond the CA is unverifiable. If we take his point then there will need to be changes. But the idea of overlapping continents does not make sense to me. If we uphold the concept of a continent "Australia" covering only the Australian mainland, how will we re-color the above mentioned <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> map without generating confusion or contradiction? It's easy for the sources that do not supply illustrative maps, but Wikipedia does this and rightly so. A solution might be to create an "Australia (mainland)" article on the lines of Nurg's Australia (continent) article, hope we can agree on a name for a continent covering both Australia and New Guinea, and exclude completely New Zealand and other islands that, tectonically, belong to none of the generally recognised seven continents. Maybe we could also still create a kind of disamb page, similar to the one suggested by Hesperian but without stating the Australia (continent) can have a wider meaning, to explain the situation.</p>

<dd>I don't think anything needs to be done with the first map at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">Continent</a>. The caption says "<i>regions</i> of the world <i>based</i> on the ... continents". The purple region is neither the Aust mainland nor the A-NG continental shelf - it's all of Oceania. So one can be thinking of any one of the multiple definitions of continent and the map and caption will remain correct. <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_7392.html" title="User:Nurg">Nurg</a> 09:18, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No-one has yet disputed that there is a considerable amount of 'political correctness' and/or other undue long term influence on the academic community; my concern of which would be greatly reduced if the world's largest mine and several of the world's most influential corporations such as Bechtel, Exxon, Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, and other bodies did not have a vital vested interest concerning New Guinea's continental status.</p>
<p>- I think it could be argued that "Continents" is a matter of human perception rather than actual scientific delimitation&#160;; however, I put forward the concept that the "Continents" are based on human perception of scientific delimitation of these major regions; which is natural because the human mind works by association or in other words by trying to catalogue things. On a map it may be easy to claim Japan is not part of Asia, but people familiar with its people or looking at its proximity to China find it difficult to say.</p>
<p>- New Guinea too shares biology, geology, and human habitation with the rest of Australia; even after the Europeans arrived these two land masses shared biology and indigenous Melanesian populations who were then claimed to be part of European colonies. The Europeans didn't care that they had not explored either territory and had no more idea what was over the Blue mountains than they had about what was 20 miles inland from New Guinea's coastline. The only fundamental difference from the mainland came about after 1960; the western half nearly got global recognition as a Melanesian State until with US help Indonesia was able to claim that half as part of 'Indonesia' -- which is the real problem, because Indonesia claims to be a 'Asian' nation. Which conflicts with the human concept of Continents being geological instead of political.58.107.15.245 00:33, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>These links, in multiple contradiction with each other, show a variety of definitions. The third (US government) includes New Zealand; the fourth includes New Guinea also, but they may be an adequate citation of the claim that Australia (continent) CAN be used to refer to a larger area than the mainland or mainland plus Tasmania.

<dd>I agree with Viewfinder. Just as "continent" has multiple meanings, "continent of Australia" (or variations of the phrase) has multiple meanings. The sites Chuq cites are of varying quality. For an encyclopedia we should use the more scholarly sources where possible. A weather forecast site, for example, doesn't really cut it for me on this topic. The key word in the continent article is "may" - in other words, this is one of multiple meanings. So I don't think it is incorrect. Interesting to hear though that the popular Tasmanian view is that you're on continental Australia (if that's what you're saying). <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_7392.html" title="User:Nurg">Nurg</a> 10:26, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The Tasmanian view is that the "rest of Australia" is known as "the mainland", not "the continent". I and most Australians are entirely familiar with the UK's use of the term "continent" to refer to the part of Europe which is France/Spain/Belgium/Netherlands/etc. But if you used the term "the continent" in Tasmania or anywhere else in Australia, to refer to Victoria/South Australia/New South Wales/etc in the same way, people would look at you with a blank expression. "The mainland" is the usual term that is understood by all. The external links I provided above were the first hits I found on google simply to demonstrate "common usage" which is what the specific paragraph is discussing - although, a couple of them are .gov.au domains which should imply some sense of being "official". -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 11:40, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, this discussion has had its fair share of points for and against what exactly constitutes the continent of Australia. How different it might have been then if New Zealand had been persuaded to join the federation and the original proposed name (<i>Commonwealth of Australasia</i>) kept. This may or may not have any bearings on the perpetual argument over whether or not New Guinea is considered to be a part of the continent, but one argument constantly being thrown about is that Australian school children are taught that their country is an island and a continent onto itself. I rather doubt that what is being taught to pre-schoolers and children just starting full school can be considered any more authoritative than the most basic principles of physics and chemistry. However, it would be interesting to know whether or not these same school children are taught about the federation process and if they are taught that it was actually a New Zealander delegate (Captain William Russell Russell) who proposed a change to the new nation's name, from the "Commonwealth of <i>Australasia</i>" to the "Commonwealth of <i>Australia</i>", indicating his preference for New Zealand to withdraw interest in the process <a href="http://www.geocities.com/nzstatehood/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/nzstatehood/index.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Had New Zealand joined there would have been no confusion over the name of the state/country and the name of the continent and unlike the case of the United States of America and the American continent or continents (depending on your points of view) there isn't a plethora of countries on the continent of Australia. Just one (Australia itself) according to what school children are taught, or three (Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia) if the geological/geographical view is taken. By contrast there are over 20 countries, other than the USA in North America alone and over 30 countries (other than the US) in the Americas as a whole. And those figures don't take into account dependent territories. I agree with the assessment that the island of New Guinea (as well as other nearby islands) are a part of the continent of Australia, based partly on the continental shelf. Some may disagree with this, but then that beggars the question as to why the British Isles are considered part of Europe (they lie on the same shelf) but New Guinea cannot be considered part of Australia. Also what of Greenland and North America (or the Americas)? Or Madagascar and Africa? Or the Japanese archipelago and Asia? Or the Falkland Islands and South America? And Iceland and Europe? Some of these islands (e.g. Iceland and Madagascar) don't lie on the same continental shelf but are still considered parts of the continent by association.72.27.175.32 00:41, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
