<p>I note that Darwin, Northern Territory, is being voted on for COTW. That page has just been moved (again) to Darwin. This completes the cycle, as it has previously gone from Darwin to Darwin, Australia, to Darwin, Northern Territory, and now back to Darwin, with an entry of Port Darwin on the side. This being the case, almost every link to the page is now a redirect. I had been going through the linked pages changing them all to Darwin, NT, as I thought that this may have been the final format for this page (avoiding the confusion with the other Darwins and that pesky Charles). Unfortunately, all my edits have now become the redirects that I had been eliminating. (I also believe that anyone changing a page should go through and edit the redirects, but that's another story).</p>
<p>Late last year we had a vote on place names, with the format City/Town, State being accepted, with the exception of capitals which were to be listed by their name only, subject to disambiguation. I dare say that the Darwin page will probably move again, when someone gets the urge.</p>
<p>Are we able to confirm our format as voted on, and have it listed on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28city_names%29_4643.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (city names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (city names)</a>.

<li>I agree with <i>bainer</i> that each rush has its own distinct history but I would be happy for the Victorian rush article to be merged and have its own section where appropriate. There are many features in common about the rushes including for example, Chinese miners and the attitude of other miners to Chinese, wealth created by gold manifested in impressive Victorian architecture, the lack of sustainability of the industry ... There is also a continuum as miners moved on - for example the presence of second generation Victorian gold miners in WA at the end of the nineteenth century and their influence on the outcome of the referendum for Federation --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 21:20, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree it would be useful if we made VfD-watching a permanent section of the AWNB. I would be happy to consider whether an article is worth keeping and expanding and where appropriate contribute to that expansion.</p>
<p>I would think that as a matter of good policy it would be wise for people who are nominating an article on Votes for Deletion that they advise the original author and, particularly where that author was anonymous, the relevant country's noticeboard. I did so recently in the case of an Irish article that looked to me like a hoax.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Category:Australia geography stubs</span></h2>
<p>There are nearly 1200 articles in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralia_geography_stubs_f71c.html" title="Category:Australia geography stubs">Category:Australia geography stubs</a></p>
<p>It seems like too many to tackle to try to bring the articles up to a sensible standard.</p>
<p>The questions for me (AYArktos) are - what should an Australian geography article include if it is no longer to be classified as a stub</p>
<p>A stub is <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_stub_article.html" title="Perfect stub article">defined</a> as a very short article, generally of one paragraph or less.</p>
<p>Some of the geography stubs we have are much longer - for example: <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batemans_Bay%2C_New_South_Wales_25ef.html" title="Batemans Bay, New South Wales">Batemans Bay, New South Wales</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braidwood.html" title="Braidwood">Braidwood</a>. The latter article does not mention population but the former article does. What information should be included so that they are no longer appropriately classified as Australian georgraphy stubs?</p>
<p>Possible suggestions for towns:</p>
<ul>
<li>location with reference to at least one large city or highway and significant landmarks nearby including rivers, mountains, sea</li>
<li>population</li>
<li>political information - eg local governemnt area</li>
<li>any reason for notability, including local industry</li>
<li>historical reference - eg settlement date/period</li>
</ul>
<p>What about for National Parks? I am not sure that much could be added to some of the National Parks articles.</p>
<p>Is there some useful categorisation for Australian place stubs below Australian geography which would allow Australian wikipedians to tackle articles and improve them with a view to removing their stub status - for example on a state by state basis?</p>
<p>I note there is a discussion page on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_72d7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting">stub sorting</a>.</p>

<dd>IMHO, they're both still stubs. I don't see a problem in having such a huge category - it just shows how much work there is to be done. We'll get there eventually.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 05:02, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My understanding is that stub articles are legitimate. The articles in question had enough information in them to justify their existence and in some cases even more. For example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tallangatta%2C_Victoria&amp;oldid=12491056|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tallangatta%2C_Victoria&amp;oldid=12491056|" rel="nofollow">the immediate past revision of Tallangatta</a> an article trashed by the redirect.</p>

<li>It appears that Helpful Dave hasn't been too helpful. Some of the stubs merged to that list (which is completely hideous to read through) are really lame, but some are pretty good, uselful, stubs, and others could be destubbed. There does't appear to be any concensus for this kind of merge on the stub sorting project page, and I haven't heard it discussed elsewhere. Let me know what you hear from Dave and I can use my Admin powers for good and rollback all the changes, it'd be faster that reverting them otherwise. It certainly hasn't been policy to merge the US geography articles made by rambot, I don't see any reason why it should be done with these--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 22:51, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think an article on Towns in Victoria should have information about what characterises such towns as opposed to towns elsewhere in Australia or elsewhere in the world.

The problem I see with continuing the article in the format at present will be that there are many more towns in Victoria than those currently included, does information about other towns not get included because they were written about later? Will some of the information presently there about the towns be edited out for consistency, thereby reducing the information content?</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Deleted articles about Victorian Towns but have not been on VfD</span></h3>
<p>Something very strange has happened. I was looking over my watchlist and noticed some red links: Drouin, Nyah West and Moe. Someone has just gone and deleted these articles. Fortunately I have 2 of those articles on my Towns in Victoria, Australia article, but since Moe was removed because it was quite long, it's all gone. I don't know who did it, and I don't know if the information can be retrieved as in deleting the article the history goes as well. I couldn't find any of these listed under VfD. I'm going to ask a couple of admins for help, but I don't know if anything can be done.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">criteria for destubbing geographic stubs</span></h3>
<p>Here's my suggeted criteria for destubbing, to destub the article should satisfy most of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Article is 250 words plus.</li>
<li>Article is correctly categorised</li>
<li>Article mentions which local government area it falls within and/or nearby towns/highways, longitude and latitude (?)</li>
<li>Article describes basic stats, like population at census 1996 or 2001</li>
<li>Article mentions historical information and/or activites in the town now that make it interesting.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Colonial politicians and succession boxes</span></h2>
<p>Two issues - firstly, should disambiguating titles for colonial-era politicians be, for example, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Douglas_%28Queensland_politician%29_ac10.html" title="John Douglas (Queensland politician)">John Douglas (Queensland politician)</a> or John Douglas (Australian politician)?</p>
<p>Secondly, on the question of succession boxes - I'm sure other editors are worried like me that massive, monstruous succession boxes (*cough* <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> *cough*) could potentially overwhelm some articles, particularly those with little text. For this reason, I propose to have as our policy that we have succession boxes for the following <b>federal cabinet ministries:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>PM/Deputy PM</li>
<li>Defence</li>
<li>Foreign/External Affairs</li>
<li>Treasurer</li>
<li>Attorney-General</li>
</ul>
<p>. . . but not for other federal ministries or for state ministries (other than Premier). Nor should we, in my view, succumb to the practice seen in American President articles of making sucession boxes for individual constituencies. Other boxes we should <i>not</i> create include one for Opposition Leader, for Shadow Ministers, or for any Party positions other than Leader.</p>
<p>The over-riding principle I think should be <b>common sense</b> - if an article is large and well-established, it's not as harmful to have a big succesion box as in cases where the box is more than half the text.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this? I don't want to inadvertantly annoy anyone with the use of the boxes. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 23:55, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the case of colonial politicians, I'd probably still go with Australian for consistency. It may also be a good idea to look at the Canadian example - they're generally ahead of us with this sort of thing. In terms of the succession boxes for federal ministries, I agree entirely - but I also think we should have succession boxes for corresponding state ministries. I've been trying to expand (and encourage others to do so as well) our articles on state politics, and I can't see too much harm in having Premier, Deputy Premier, Treasurer and Attorney-General (and maybe one or two other) boxes. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 11:00, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I like the suggestions relating to succession boxes, with the possible exception of a box for Opposition Leader, although in the modern two-party era this could be largely redundant. On the naming issue, I agree with <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a>, as long as the article points out that the person was a colonial polly, John Douglas (Australian politician) makes things more consistent. We can always have <a href="../../../q/u/e/Category%7EQueensland_politicians_5efe.html" title="Category:Queensland politicians">Category:Queensland politicians</a> etc if we need to split them up more. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> 12:57, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I also think it a good idea to use succession boxes for only the most important ministries. However, I think that the Opposition leader warrants a succession box as well, especially if the Deputy PM is to have one. Generally, I think succession boxes should only be used in the ministries exclusive to, and of significance to, the Commonwealth (save Treasurer and A-G), leaving open the possibility of using it for the immigration ministry. Ministers of health and education and so forth do not require it, unless it is standard to do so.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 15:25, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Politics coverage</span></h2>
<p>I've been working away over the last couple of weeks at expanding our lists of MPs, and it's starting to illustrate some of the large gaps we have, particularly at state level. We now have lists of members of all the federal parliaments going back to 1961, every current state and territory parliament in Australia, as well as every member of every parliament of the ACT and NT Legislative Assemblies. It'd be nice to see some of the larger holes starting to be filled there - most notably some of the ministers from the Menzies era, almost all of the major state-level ministers, and many of the recent (but not current) Premiers and Chief Ministers. I'm sure I'll get to them eventually, but it'd be really nice if some of you could get stuck into some of these gaps. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 14:23, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to pipe in. Only the US, Canada, Australia and Italy are opting for preferential disambiguation (US/Can due to use of census bots, Italy due to usual Italian custom).

<dd>I had noticed that, but as an author of articles that refer to towns quite a lot, I've found it's easier to expect to have to disambiguate than not. I've also taken to authoring disambiguation articles at times (<a href="../../../c/u/m/Cummins.html" title="Cummins">Cummins</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordertown.html" title="Bordertown">Bordertown</a>) and learned that even "obviously" unique names mean something else (<a href="../../../q/u/o/Quorn.html" title="Quorn">Quorn</a> - bet you don't guess right before clicking on the link!). The main annoyance has been the non-disambiguated [[List of Postcodes in ...]] pages. We have the advantage of clearly knowing what state any given town is in - the UK seem to have running battles about what version of county boundaries should apply. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 05:29, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Scott's right. So long as we always redirect to the state from the name, where there is no disambiguation issue and make a dab page where needed, because no user is going to look for "Dubbo, New South Wales".

<ol>
<li>The Canadian version wraps better than the current Aus draft when the window is made narrow.</li>
<li>There should be the same number of photos as names. If the name list has people twice, they should have two photos. Ideally, one taken each time they were PM, but that's probably impossible for the older ones.</li>
