<p>There are approximately 200 singers in the choir, ranging in age from 6 to 18, and comprised of six groups: Beginners, Melody, Harmony, Training, Reserve, and Senior Choristers. The young singers who comprise the senior performing ensemble of the Australian Children's Choir meet twice a week to rehearse outside school hours, and must demonstrate a high degree of musical ability, personal organization and concentration to become proud wearers of the ACC's distinctive green uniforms. In return, they receive many wonderful musical and social opportunities that they would not otherwise experience, and take on the role of fine young ambassadors for both the ACC and their country.</p>
