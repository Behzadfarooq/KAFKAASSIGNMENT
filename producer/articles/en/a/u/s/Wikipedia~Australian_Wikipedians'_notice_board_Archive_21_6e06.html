<p>I've started a set of subpages at <a href="../../../a/u/s/Portal%7EAustralia_Anniversaries_8680.html" title="Portal:Australia/Anniversaries">Portal:Australia/Anniversaries</a>, which has a subpage for every day of the year, so that notable events and anniversaries in Australian history can be considered. Hopefully, if approved by the community for inclusion on the portal page, it would not be hard to maintain, as a glance at the code of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Portal%7EGermany_cbdf.html" title="Portal:Germany">Portal:Germany</a>, shows that there is an automated device so that the reference to the relevant day's subpage will automatically update itself at 0:00 every day, rather than needing a user to switch the link every day. I've stuck a few random notable events in there just off the top of my head, etc. Regards, <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 02:33, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is this to populate some Australian-flavoured "On this day" column? I appreciate that you've made a lot of effort here, but just thinking about what this is really doing and it could be used in the future... Would a better way to go about this be to use a category like [[Category:Australian anniversary|1836-12-28 South Australia founded]] and add it to the South Australia article and any other relevant article as needed? Or [[Category:Australian notable date|2006-03-18 South Australian legislative election, 2006]] (which is perhaps closer to what you're doing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also note: the notable Australian births and deaths is really just going to be a subset (or perhaps the full set) of the intersection of Category:Australian people with each of the Category:xxxx births and Category:xxxx deaths categories. Because I can express it mathematically that should be able to be automated for our calendar. — <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 04:59, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's by calendar day, and I don't think that there is category for births by day, which would have been easier if someone just scrolled over with popups to see what the nationality was in the lead sentence. It hasn't taken much work yet, I simply cut and pasted the framework from <a href="../../../g/e/r/Portal%7EGermany_cbdf.html" title="Portal:Germany">Portal:Germany</a> and used "Find and Replace" to substitute Australia everywhere, so it only took about 20 minutes! <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 05:04, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My understanding is that there have been talks over the last day or two about a multinational deployment, but since the violence escalated today, Australia sent in troops in advance of the formal invitation/agreement as to the rules of engagement. Once the agreement is hammered out (probably overnight) then the other nations will deploy their forces. The talks have involved the local UN people so it may be another blue beret job. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 14:27, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

These articles are then fixed at a later date by an experienced editor who adjusts the link directly to the actual article. Why don't we just move the page?

<p>Agree that its better to write (Australia) than (Australian state) because its obvious that if its the Australian victoria than it means the state. Its seems unusual to say "Victoria, Australia" in Australia, so it looks better to have it as Victoria (Australia).

John came back and took the credit when it became successful.

<dd>Having started a wikipedia from scratch, it reminds of the lists one has when starting out, serving as a useful reminder of what needs to be written about etc., but invariably with time they become out of date when compared to the relevant categories and consequently become redundant. A relevant question: is a user of wikipedia as likely to look up Australian-related topics using this list as the myriad of Australian-related categories? If the answer is yes (and I really don't know one way or the other), then a case in favour might be arguable. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 07:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It could serve a useful purpose if set up properly - IIRC, the Irish one was a really good example, as a means of giving a good overview of major national topics. That said, it is a lot of work, and now that categories are so prominent I'm not sure about it. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 08:13, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It could probably complement the categories (and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Portal%7EAustralia_34a5.html" title="Portal:Australia">Portal:Australia</a>) nicely, if it were set up properly. A flat list can be organised in any way we see fit. For example, it could list a handful of the really important topics in each of the main categories (the ones that are listed at the top of the portal: culture, economy, geography, government, history, law, nature, people, politics, society) which basically correspond to the sections on the main article <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. It could also link to important subcategories. The one avdantage lists have over categories in this context is the possibilities for being able to point out which articles are really important. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 08:43, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It isn't intending to be a complete list, only a list of the most important topics, all of which we probably have articles on by now, so I don't know that it being out of date is an issue.

<li>Luke Bowell is not an Australian billionaire and a search of Australia and New Zealand media over the past few years comes up with no-one of this name. There are two references to a Matt Priest - one in relation to a New Zealand constable reporting the death of an Australian climber and the other about the drummer of English band <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodgy.html" title="Dodgy">Dodgy</a>. The second article was titled "Nothing Dodgy about these lads".

<p>Hello, I'm trying to collect about 10 FP or FP-like pictures suitable for bundling together as a themed "computer wallpaper pack". I want to get 10 Australian ones so I'm looking for suggestions here. Some requirements: made by a Wikimedian, no people (just to totally avoid any legal dramas), high res, landscape layout, suitable kinda desktop background feel (shouldn't be too busy, maybe, or too much contrast), good ID information (location/species) and of course they should be fairly evocative of Australia somehow. Because of the wallpaper thing I don't think panoramas work very well, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Something like these would be good...</p>

<p>Some more iconic animals would be good, there are a couple of featured koalas but they are not quite wallpaper material to my mind. A beach, the outback... it doesn't have to be like Uluru and the Great Ocean Road, we all know there are beautiful places everywhere that have an Australian feel even if they're not on so many postcards.</p>
<p>Let me know if you can think of any others. Remember they don't have to be featured! Just feature material. <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> <small>(<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pfctdayelise/Translations" class="extiw" title="commons:User:Pfctdayelise/Translations">translate?</a>)</small> 15:27, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello everybody. I have received a complaint about my repeated deletion of a reference to a local gang, which is referenced to the gang's website. I am unconvinced as to the gang's verifiability, as it is using its own website as a source, and also as to the encyclopedic content. The user filing this was User:Morgan Leigh. Many thanks, <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 03:14, 14 June 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p><br />
I asked two questions relating to this issue, neither of which have been answered. One is how <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> ascertained that the info was (or was not) posted by a gang member. The second is why it matters? To say that if a gang member references their gang website this somehow diminishes the veracity of the info is like saying that if I am in a given political party and I add a link to that party's web site then that info is not valid. BTW I am not affiliated with this gang.</p>
<p>Morgan Leigh 05:24, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You need to provide <b>independent</b> evidence that the gang exists and is notable. The gang website does not do so. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 05:27, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems a bit odd to me to say that someone's web site is not evidence of their existence. Sure, anyone can put up a website and then write a wikipedia page about it. This might be a bit of shameless self promotion, however it does not change the fact that the info is still accurate i.e. the website exists and the wikipedia page describes it. In this case the gang has a web site and this info has been added to the page. Self promotion does not (necessarily) equal bad info.</p>
<p>I note that no one has yet answered my two questions. I also note that when this info was first put up on the Narre Warren South page it was poorly composed and edited. However since I engaged with the poster on the talk page they have acted on my suggestions and added more info. Since various people have come in and simply removed or reverted info the user has stopped responding. I think that this is all a bit nit picky and is discouraging to a new user who is making an effort to learn about wikipedia.</p>

<dd>It seems a bit odd to me to say that someone's web site <b>is</b> evidence of their existence. I could create a website today claiming to be a leprechaun. Would you then hold that website up as indisputable proof that leprechaun's exist? I thought not. Then why do you think some website purporting to be the homepage of a gang constitutes proof that the gang exists and is notable? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 00:48, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did not say it is indisputable proof of anything. There are many pages on wikipedia that are about websites. If a web page exists one can logically deduce that someone made it. If that someone sticks up their hand and says 'this is my website and it proves I exist' then what's the bother there? Maybe these guys are not world shatteringly famous (ok maybe they are not famous at all) However I also don't see the harm in allowing what may well be a vanity paragraph in an otherwise dull page in the unfashionable western spiral arm of wikipedia, if it encourages someone to learn something. This is how how wikipedia works. We who use wikipedia are not here for a power trip. We are here to build wikipedia. I note that no one but my humble worthless self has actually engaged with these guys on the talk page. Everyone else has simply deleted their efforts and posted to user talk pages or wikipedian notice boards, either of which I would be prepared to put money on that these newbies don't even know exists. This is not about me thinking leprechauns exist. This is about power tripping new users instead of helping them.</dd>

<dd>In hindsight, Paul's suggestion on my user talk page that "Motor vehicle manufacturers" would have been a better name is probably right. "Car manufacturers" was debated when this came up on CFD and was roundly voted down, unfortunately. Perhaps this will be worth renominating for change to <a href="../../../m/o/t/Category%7EMotor_vehicle_manufacturers_of_Australia_2f30.html" title="Category:Motor vehicle manufacturers of Australia">category:Motor vehicle manufacturers of Australia</a> (along with the equivalent categories for New Zealand, South Africa and the UK, plus the UK subcategory "Defunct...", but not until the dust has settled on this one, which was a quite fiery cfd one way and another.

<p>I am involved with the Coolac project (but I am retiring on Friday). Guardedly I can confirm that there is nothing verifiable on the public record about the alleged massacre. The RTA is preparing a heritage report (under s87 and s90 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/npawa1974247" class="external text" title="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/npawa1974247" rel="nofollow">National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974</a>) to allow the Coolac bypass to go ahead, which no doubt will comment on this issue and which presumably it will put on the record (possibly at <a href="http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectsregional/southwest/coolac/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectsregional/southwest/coolac/index.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>) when it is finalised, but this is some time off. You will be able to judge then whether any new and verifiable evidence has come to light. Tenders for the Coolac Bypass closed on 11/5/05 and the contract has not been awarded; you might note <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/reps/dailys/dr240506.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/reps/dailys/dr240506.pdf" rel="nofollow">Hansard 24/5/06 pp50-51</a>.--<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahamec_491a.html" title="User:Grahamec">Grahamec</a> 13:11, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks for researching the Gundagai/Coolac issue. It is so hard when one finds nothing to cite the absence of sources. The Coolac bypass is relevant as I assume that is the area 9 miles from Gundagai. However, beyond the bypass issues, what does anyone think of the notion of symbolism and the Dog on the Tuckerbox? I couldn't find a picture of any earlier monument through <a href="http://www.pictureaustralia.org/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pictureaustralia.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">Picture Australia</a> or any reference to it via Google. Does anyone have the book <i>1932: A Hell Of A Year</i> by Gerald Stone? It may mention if there was a previous monument to the present one opened in 1932. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 00:12, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can confrim that 9 miles north of Gundagai would be on the banks of Muttama creek, the alleged site of the massacre. There is nothing in the wrtitten record to substantiate the claim (but then you could argue that this proves nothing).

<dd>I've only ever been a visitor to Sydney, but I'd suggest yes, it's a very notable landmark. I live 12 hours away by road and I'm aware of the cafe. It's actually a long standing pie caravan on the Wooloomoloo shore-line, which is (or was) regularly visited by a number of A-list Hollywood stars such as Kidman, Cruise, Crowe and the like. The caravan has some history which the walls of the caravan reveal by way of many newspaper clippings. I don't have any photographs handy however but it's not just your run of the mill local late night hamburger haunt. Tour guides at Centrepoint Tower in the city make a note of mentioning the cafe's notability, and pointing it out to tourists from the view up high. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 02:34, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Her website claims that she has won a couple of bronze medals as well see <a href="http://www.tanyaharding.com.au/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tanyaharding.com.au/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> There are over 100 hits on an Australia New Zealand media database for her. Tanya Harding has had more success as an athlete than Tonya Harding although Tonya is more famous. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 07:33, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A couple of suggestions re: MP articles</span></h2>
<p>After a couple of incidents in the last week with inaccurate, biased and potentially libelous statements in a couple of articles about MPs, it struck me that one of our lingering problems is that our articles about backbenchers aren't receiving much scrutiny. While vandalism and such to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> or <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Beazley_97c0.html" title="Kim Beazley">Kim Beazley</a> might get reverted within a couple of minutes, the same vandalism of an article on a backbencher might last for a couple of weeks or more if no one has it watchlisted. So I thought it might be a good idea to watchlist all the current members of the House and Senate - and in doing so, found four or five statements that need to be shot on sight. I've also been able to promptly revert a couple of statements that were added since. What would some of you think about watchlisting a few more of these MPs so we can keep a closer eye for vandalism and such in future?</p>
<p>Secondly, it also strikes me that a lot of our articles on members of the federal cabinet are, despite their prominence, not particularly good. Quite a few are near-stubs (Truss, Coonan, Minchin, Macfarlane), and a couple have quite major holes in them (Downer, Nelson). I wonder if it might be an idea to create an informal collaboration project (similar to the Canberra one that ran for a while) with the aim of getting these to the point where, if not featured, they at least no longer suck. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 14:09, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, a Google search for "West Australia Art Gallery" got 6 pages including an ABC page. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22West+Australia+Art+Gallery%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22West+Australia+Art+Gallery%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Presumably, it is now known as something else. Could any West Australians or people knowledgeable in art tell us what it is so we can fix the link. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 06:31, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, great performance, although it hurts because I believe that we would have had a super chance against Ukraine, who are weak imho. Hopefully the momentum isn't lost with a new coach and probably a few retirements as our squad drops off a lot after the first schoice XI. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 07:23, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Speaking about WP articles relating to the WC, most of the Australian team bios have been downgraded in quality recently due to POV screeds and commentary about various WC matters. I'll have to clear out the personal analysis from them, perhaps when it dies down a bit. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 07:23, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also notice the national football team's article being padded out with a lot of game details (the friendlies, group games, and the Italy game) - perhaps these could be shifted out to a 2005-06 in Australian football similar to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005-06_in_English_football_281f.html" title="2005-06 in English football">2005-06 in English football</a>, or Australia at the 2006 FIFA World Cup? -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 07:40, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeh I am looking to start working on seasons in Australian football (soccer) – similar to the English one once I've finished another thing. The whole 2006 WC campaign in the national team article can be cut down to at most two paragraphs - qualifying and the finals. – <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbinomonkey_5636.html" title="User:Albinomonkey">AlbinoMonkey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/l/b/User_talk%7EAlbinomonkey_dabe.html" title="User talk:Albinomonkey">Talk</a>)</sup> 08:46, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was about to say the same thing: nuke the "best beer" bit as inherently POV, and seek references for the state colours bit. Still, it makes an amusing counterpoint with the state and territory statistics immediately above, doesn't it?
