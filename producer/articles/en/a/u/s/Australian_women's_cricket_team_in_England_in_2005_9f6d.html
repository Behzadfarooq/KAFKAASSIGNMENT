<p>Three <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-day_Internationals_d223.html" title="One-day Internationals">ODIs</a> in Ireland were planned, but only one was actually played - the other two were rained off. However, in the match that was played on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_31.html" title="July 31">31 July</a>, Australia beat the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_women%27s_cricket_team.html" title="Irish women's cricket team">Irish women's cricket team</a> by 240 runs, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Rolton_3da1.html" title="Karen Rolton">Karen Rolton</a> and Lisa Sthalekar both making centuries as Australia made 295 for 3, and Cecelia Joyce top-scored for Ireland with a paltry 18 - Shelley Nitschke taking four for 15 as Ireland collapsed to 55 all out in 26 overs. <a href="http://live.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/OTHERS/AUS-WOMEN_IN_IRELAND/SCORECARDS/AUS-WOMEN_IRELAND-WOMEN_WODI2_31JUL2005.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://live.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/OTHERS/AUS-WOMEN_IN_IRELAND/SCORECARDS/AUS-WOMEN_IRELAND-WOMEN_WODI2_31JUL2005.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p><i><b>Match drawn</b></i></p>
<p><a href="../../../e/n/g/English_women%27s_cricket_team.html" title="English women's cricket team">England</a> got an excellent start to the first women's Test at <a href="../../../h/o/v/Hove.html" title="Hove">Hove</a>, where two debutants were to take centre stage; but the match petered out into a draw.</p>
<p>In one of the highlights of the first day of play, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belinda_Clark_1f6e.html" title="Belinda Clark">Belinda Clark</a> — arguably <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_women%27s_cricket_team.html" title="Australian women's cricket team">Australia's</a> best batter — had been bowled by <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenny_Gunn_6b29.html" title="Jenny Gunn">Jenny Gunn</a> for a two-ball duck. It was to be Gunn's only wicket of the day, but probably the most vital. All-rounder <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosalie_Birch_bc85.html" title="Rosalie Birch">Rosalie Birch</a> and 15-year-old debutante <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slow_left_arm.html" title="Slow left arm">spinner</a> <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holly_Colvin_7527.html" title="Holly Colvin">Holly Colvin</a> then took two wickets each as Australia crumbled to 115 for 7, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Rolton_3da1.html" title="Karen Rolton">Karen Rolton</a> being the only batter on top of the bowlers.</p>
<p>However, as the day wore on, England lost their stamina, and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_order_%28cricket%29.html" title="Batting order (cricket)">lower order</a> batters took over. No. 7 <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathryn_Fitzpatrick_117f.html" title="Cathryn Fitzpatrick">Cathryn Fitzpatrick</a>, No. 9 Julie Hayes and Test debutante No. 10 <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelley_Nitschke_bdec.html" title="Shelley Nitschke">Shelley Nitschke</a> all made fifties as Australia eked out 223 more runs before the end of the first day, losing only two more wickets, and Nitschke was 70 not out overnight. She finished on an unbeaten 81, as Australia added a further 27 before Clea Smith was <a href="../../../l/b/w/Lbw.html" title="Lbw">lbw</a> to <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katherine_Brunt_9bde.html" title="Katherine Brunt">Katherine Brunt</a>, to end with 355. England scored slowly after losing <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laura_Newton_e549.html" title="Laura Newton">Laura Newton</a> for 24, as they used 129 overs to make 273 — <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Edwards_75d7.html" title="Charlotte Edwards">Charlotte Edwards</a> top-scoring with 69, while <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arran_Brindle_15b0.html" title="Arran Brindle">Arran Brindle</a> made her second Test half-century with 54.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelley_Nitschke_bdec.html" title="Shelley Nitschke">Nitschke</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Sthalekar_5216.html" title="Lisa Sthalekar">Lisa Sthalekar</a> took three wickets each, but England fought back. <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenny_Gunn_6b29.html" title="Jenny Gunn">Gunn</a> took two more wickets, removing both openers for ducks, as <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belinda_Clark_1f6e.html" title="Belinda Clark">Belinda Clark</a> recorded a pair, but <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Rolton_3da1.html" title="Karen Rolton">Karen Rolton</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Sthalekar_5216.html" title="Lisa Sthalekar">Sthalekar</a> took the score beyond England's grasp. Rolton was finally run out for 97, but she had led the Australians to a 254-run lead at the end of day three. Australia added a further 51 to that on the fourth morning - <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slow_left_arm.html" title="Slow left arm">slow left arm</a> bowler <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clare_Connor_1155.html" title="Clare Connor">Clare Connor</a> taking four for 68 in a marathon bowling effort. England quickly determined 306 in 95 overs was too tough after they crumbled to 14 for 3, but <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arran_Brindle_15b0.html" title="Arran Brindle">Brindle</a> stood firm at the crease, taking four hours for a maiden Test <a href="../../../c/e/n/Century_%28cricket%29.html" title="Century (cricket)">century</a>, and England made it to the end of the scheduled time having only lost seven wickets. Thus, the second Test would now decide the series. <a href="http://live.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/OTHERS/AUS-WOMEN_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS-WOMEN_ENG-WOMEN_WT1_09-12AUG2005.html" class="external text" title="http://live.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/OTHERS/AUS-WOMEN_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS-WOMEN_ENG-WOMEN_WT1_09-12AUG2005.html" rel="nofollow">(Cricinfo scorecard)</a></p>

With only 25 runs left to hit for the last six wickets, it was there for the taking. But Fitzpatrick returned, having taken the wicket of <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laura_Newton_e549.html" title="Laura Newton">Laura Newton</a> earlier on, and she took three more wickets as the English lower order were strangled - and collapsed to 210 all out with five balls remaining in the innings. Fitzpatrick ended with figures of four for 19 from 10 overs, and Emma Liddell also took three for 29. <a href="http://live.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/OTHERS/AUS-WOMEN_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS-WOMEN_ENG-WOMEN_WODI1_15AUG2005.html" class="external text" title="http://live.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/OTHERS/AUS-WOMEN_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS-WOMEN_ENG-WOMEN_WODI1_15AUG2005.html" rel="nofollow">(Cricinfo scorecard)</a></p>

<p><i><b>England won by two runs</b></i></p>
<p><a href="../../../e/n/g/England_women%27s_cricket_team.html" title="England women's cricket team">England</a> needed a victory to keep the five-match <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_One-day_International_d6fe.html" title="Women's One-day International">One-day International</a> series alive, and with Australia needing six runs off the last <a href="../../../o/v/e/Over_%28cricket%29.html" title="Over (cricket)">over</a>, it looked like the Australians would secure the series with two matches to spare. However, <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katherine_Brunt_9bde.html" title="Katherine Brunt">Katherine Brunt</a> had the last say, as she first had <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathryn_Fitzpatrick_117f.html" title="Cathryn Fitzpatrick">Cathryn Fitzpatrick</a> <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stumped.html" title="Stumped">stumped</a> and then helped to <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_out.html" title="Run out">run out</a> Julie Hayes for a duck. Suddenly, Australia needed four from the last ball to win, and they could only get one, as England went into scenes of jubilation - having secured their first victory over the Australian women since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_English_cricket_season_b76b.html" title="1993 English cricket season">1993</a>. Earlier, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claire_Taylor_69e4.html" title="Claire Taylor">Claire Taylor</a> had lifted England to 200 for 7 with her 82, taking on <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathryn_Fitzpatrick_117f.html" title="Cathryn Fitzpatrick">Fitzpatrick</a> who conceded 61 runs in her 10 overs. All the six Australian bowlers got one wicket, however, with the seventh being a run out. Australia's opener <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belinda_Clark_1f6e.html" title="Belinda Clark">Belinda Clark</a> recorded another poor score with a six-ball duck, and Australia continued to lose wickets at regular intervals. Yet, at 195 for 5 with an over to spare, the wise money would normally have been on the tourists, but thanks to Brunt, it went England's way instead. <a href="http://live.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/OTHERS/AUS-WOMEN_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS-WOMEN_ENG-WOMEN_WODI3_21AUG2005.html" class="external text" title="http://live.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/OTHERS/AUS-WOMEN_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS-WOMEN_ENG-WOMEN_WODI3_21AUG2005.html" rel="nofollow">(Cricinfo scorecard)</a></p>

<p>Despite rain washing out parts of the first day at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Road%2C_Worcester_5ba4.html" title="New Road, Worcester">New Road</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_women%27s_cricket_team.html" title="English women's cricket team">England</a> took their first Test victory over <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_women%27s_cricket_team.html" title="Australian women's cricket team">Australia</a> since December <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, and their first Ashes series win since <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963_English_cricket_season_0f11.html" title="1963 English cricket season">1963</a>. Having won the toss, England captain <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clare_Connor_1155.html" title="Clare Connor">Clare Connor</a> opted to bowl, and after <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belinda_Clark_1f6e.html" title="Belinda Clark">Belinda Clark</a> had slashed 18 runs she was trapped <a href="../../../l/b/w/Lbw.html" title="Lbw">lbw</a> by pacer <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katherine_Brunt_9bde.html" title="Katherine Brunt">Katherine Brunt</a>. Wickets were shared out among the entire England team, no Australian passed 40, and by the end of the day they had crashed to 126 for 7. It took 33 <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delivery_%28cricket%29.html" title="Delivery (cricket)">deliveries</a> for Australia to be all out on the second morning - for 131, as the efforts from the last Test, when the last three wickets outscored the rest of the batting line-up, were not repeated. Brunt took care of that, having Nitschke and Price <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caught.html" title="Caught">caught</a> behind to complete her five-wicket-haul. Batting was clearly difficult, but <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenny_Gunn_6b29.html" title="Jenny Gunn">Jenny Gunn</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clare_Connor_1155.html" title="Clare Connor">Clare Connor</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claire_Taylor_69e4.html" title="Claire Taylor">Claire Taylor</a> all dug in to make scores above 30, before a vital <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partnership_%28cricket%29.html" title="Partnership (cricket)">partnership</a> between Taylor and <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_Morgan_c1d4.html" title="Beth Morgan">Beth Morgan</a> took England to a relatively comfortable lead, as they moved to 196 for 6 before Emma Liddell struck twice and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathryn_Fitzpatrick_117f.html" title="Cathryn Fitzpatrick">Cathryn Fitzpatrick</a> once to leave England at 222 for 9 at close of play of day two. Liddell and Fitzpatrick bowled 59 <a href="../../../o/v/e/Over_%28cricket%29.html" title="Over (cricket)">overs</a> between them on the second day, out of a total of 101, and although they shared seven <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicket.html" title="Wicket">wickets</a>, they failed to remove either of Brunt or <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isa_Guha_bb57.html" title="Isa Guha">Isa Guha</a>, and the last English pair added 18 before the end of day two.</p>
<p>On the third day, England powered on, Brunt staking her claim for Player of the Match with a vital, powerful 52 - her first Test fifty - as she eked out 83 runs with Guha for the tenth wicket, Guha making 31 <a href="../../../n/o/t/Not_out.html" title="Not out">not out</a>. Leading by 158 on first innings, England got a dream start by dismissing Lisa Keightley for a <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck_%28cricket%29.html" title="Duck (cricket)">duck</a>, and wickets just kept falling. Gunn and Brunt took two wickets each as the Australians faltered to 18 for 4, before the twin sisters Kate and Alex Blackwell fought back. However, Isa Guha removed Alex, another two wickets fell, and by tea Australia were 67 for 7. An attritional partnership for the seventh wicket between Kate Blackwell and Shelley Nitschke, which yielded 112 runs in four hours, carried Australia past 100, but still they were only 21 ahead with three wickets in hand at the close of day three. The last day started just like England wanted, Katherine Brunt dismissing Kate Blackwell and wicket-keeper <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julia_Price_ab3c.html" title="Julia Price">Julia Price</a> with successive deliveries, and all that was left was to take the last wicket. England toiled, but the Australians defended for nearly two hours and faced 35 overs, until number 11 Emma Liddell finally edged behind to <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Smit_d76f.html" title="Jane Smit">Jane Smit</a> and was out for 24. Shelley Nitschke made her second fifty in two Tests and was left stranded on 88 <a href="../../../n/o/t/Not_out.html" title="Not out">not out</a>, while <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slow_left_arm.html" title="Slow left arm">slow left arm</a> bowler Clare Connor ended with the <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowling_analysis.html" title="Bowling analysis">bowling analysis</a> of 26-20-25-1. Brunt finished with four wickets in the second innings, for a match total of nine for 111.</p>
<p>England were thus left to chase 75 for the Ashes, but Emma Liddell didn't want to be beaten, and her <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast_bowling.html" title="Fast bowling">pace</a> trapped <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laura_Newton_e549.html" title="Laura Newton">Laura Newton</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenny_Gunn_6b29.html" title="Jenny Gunn">Jenny Gunn</a> <a href="../../../l/b/w/Lbw.html" title="Lbw">lbw</a> in the second over as England lost their first two wickets for one run. However, Liddell couldn't get any further breakthroguhs, and even though England lost Connor and Edwards to Fitzpatrick - both lbw - <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arran_Brindle_15b0.html" title="Arran Brindle">Arran Brindle</a> batted out an hour for 24 <a href="../../../n/o/t/Not_out.html" title="Not out">not out</a> to see England to the target about three hours before the scheduled close. <a href="http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/OTHERS/AUS-WOMEN_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS-WOMEN_ENG-WOMEN_WT2_24-27AUG2005.html" class="external text" title="http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/OTHERS/AUS-WOMEN_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS-WOMEN_ENG-WOMEN_WT2_24-27AUG2005.html" rel="nofollow">(Cricinfo scorecard)</a></p>
