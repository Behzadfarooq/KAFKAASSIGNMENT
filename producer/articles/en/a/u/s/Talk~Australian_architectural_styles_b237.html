<dd>The article is more about the <b>styles</b> of Architecture in Australia. Australian Architecture and even residential australian architecture could be refering to the practice as well as the styles. It is surprising that there is no article for architectural styles in Australia. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_carson_2b91.html" title="User:Nick carson">Nick Carson</a> 10:53, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it's likely to be mistaken as referring to the <i>practice</i> - that's really quite unencyclopedic. All the other articles on this topic (such as <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_of_the_United_States_e012.html" title="Architecture of the United States">Architecture of the United States</a>) refer to styles, and I see no reason why this shouldn't be the same in Australia. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 12:11, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I agree with Nick on this one. An article about 'Architecture in Australia' could talk about early architects such as Francis Greenway, the early practice of plans being sent out from the UK, the establishment of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, the evolution of the profession and establishment of notable firms, university courses that teach architecture, perhaps schools of thought (I'm not familiar with it to that degree) and requirements for accreditation. I don't think that that would necessarily be unencyclopedic.</dd>
<dd>Congratulations of putting the article together Nick. Excellent work! I'm just as tad worried that the note at the end of <i>List of Architectural Styles in Australia by Year</i> makes it appear to look like <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. I understand the problem of no source coming up with the same list, but I think that a list above a note like that needs to come with some references/sources. Something to consider when you have time perhaps.

<dd>No worries, changes and corrections are what would make the article better than one person could make it as it would be collective information. The note is there because it's disputed and there are many differing opinions on the way in which Australian architectural styles should be categorised. The list has been compiled from a number of different sources and in it's present form is generally accepted as being the prefered model for categorising architectural styles in Australia. Any changes to that list are more than welcomed in the present day styles, as they could be discussed about to no end. I would suggest that <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_of_the_United_States_e012.html" title="Architecture of the United States">Architecture of the United States</a> should change the name of the article as it can be very confusing if you were searching for somthing described by <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> refering to american architecture, you would be confused as to why the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_of_the_United_States_e012.html" title="Architecture of the United States">Architecture of the United States</a> article actually refers to the <b>styles</b> of architecture of the united states. Somthing that could be greatly improoved upon in this article is the locations of styles in australian cities. I could speculate as to where styles would be located in most of Brisbane and Sydney, but it would be just that, speculation, so the list of where to find the styles in australian cities will remain incomplete until somone can provide adequate information ex: Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra. For example possibly <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> could compare buildings in suburbs in Canberra with photos in this article and if they find the majority of the buildings/houses in that suburb match, it would be sufficent to say that a particular style can be found in Mt. Stromolo, ACT, that is the type of thing that would make this article extreemly usefull. I will also add some external resources to provide some sources and other usefull information regaurding styles in Australia. Please note that some photos are yet to be added to place a visual reference to each style. -- <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_carson_2b91.html" title="User:Nick carson">Nick Carson</a> 12:39, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is terrific to see an effort to tackle this underrepresented subject. However, there are a couple of POV statements in the lead section, for example <i>"It is generally acepted within Architectural and Historical communities that Melbourne, Victoria contains the greatest depth of styles in Australia."</i> Can we please have citations for such assertions?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It is not clear to me why the article is named as it is and then immediately in the first sentence limits its scope to residential styles but then the first illustration is of a non-residential building, a cathedral?!?.</dd>
<dd>I doubt very much that there is such thing as "a complete list of each architectural style in Australia" that has been agreed upon. A useful authority however is: <cite class="book" style="font-style:normal" id="Reference-Apperly-1989">Apperly, Richard; Robert Irving, Peter Reynolds (1989). <i>A pictorial guide to identifying Australian architecture</i>, Paperback, 1994, Sydney,Australia: HarperCollins. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-207-18562-X</a>.</cite><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.btitle=A+pictorial+guide+to+identifying+Australian+architecture&amp;rft.title=A+pictorial+guide+to+identifying+Australian+architecture&amp;rft.aulast=Apperly&amp;rft.aufirst=Richard&amp;rft.date=1989&amp;rft.edition=Paperback%2C+1994&amp;rft.pub=HarperCollins&amp;rft.place=Sydney%2CAustralia">&#160;</span>.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 08:31, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The article does apear hold mainly to residential architectural styles, however, somthing very important must be considered first. Other types of buildings for example: industrial, commercial, civic, etc. are all designed for specific purpaces, for example a railway staation to fill the site and meet a particular need based on it's location, or a skyscraper designed to maximise it's site by increasing it's height etc. Whereas residential is designed primarily with variation in it's size to suit the need of it's inhabitants, and secondarily to a particular style that fits local overlays and council regulations of the time, as well as the public demand to build in acordance with the popular style at the time. This is why architectural style is somthing that needs to be defined (particularly in australia) by the residental sector, as each and every other sector is purely individual, pushing the boundaries of architecture most of the time, and suiting the needs it must fill. It is unarguable of course that these other sectors can be divided up into elaborate categorization of styles, however, they account for the minority of buildings in total in australia at least, and any annalysis of them wouldn't be clear cut as in residential housing. You can't make clear cut comparisons between one skyscraper and another, however, you can make clear cut comparisons from one house to the house just next door. The exceptions here would be the Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival periods in which mainly only Churches and Cathedrals bear difinative marks of the revivals in their styles, and thus, can be compared.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have no citations for the fact that Melbourne is regaurded throughout the world not only Australia as containing prime examples of Early, Mid and Late Victorian architecture, as well as Colonial, Georgian and Gothic Revival, and each style can be traced and seen in Melbourne, as opposed to say Darwin which had to compleatly re-build after Cyclone Tracy. Sydney would be an obvious haven for Colonial and Georgian style buildings surviving and alive today, however due to heavey evelopment in Sydney's central suburbs and CBD, much of it's past has been errased. This can be directly compared to Melbourne which has vast suburbs of entirely origional surviving buildings in it's CBD and surrounding suburbs extending up to 8 to 10km out in a radial pattern. Melbourne's abundance of surviving history is largly due to it's major over-the-top overlays such as herritage, cultural significance, and herritage listed buildings. There are many many suburbs in Melbourne that are themselves entirely herritage listed. Other cities in Australia boast excelent examples of architectural styles in australia, however, none as expansive and with such massive depth of that of Melbourne's. However, the statment: <i>"It is generally acepted within Architectural and Historical communities that Melbourne, Victoria contains the greatest depth of styles in Australia."</i> could certainly be edited out if it causes dispute.</p>
<p>There are no 2 books alike, and there are no 2 people whos views and interpretations are the same, and it must be remembered that books are writen by people. The list compiled in this article is complete, and while it certainly depicts mainly residential styles, it has been compiled and is agreed upon by many professionals lecuring, currently practising various occupations in the building industry and those undertaking both, as well as many texts and historial societies.</p>
<p>The below <b>Possible list of styles taken from Apperley, Irving and Reynolds</b> should deffinatly be used in the same article, as it outlines and elaboratly describes non-residential styles. I will edit the article soon and create new headings: <b>Residential Styles</b> and <b>Non-Resiential Styles</b> and insert the list of styles taken from Apperley, Irving and Reynolds under the non-residential styles heading.</p>
<p>I feel there is no need to confuse anyone by having an entirely seperate article for residential architectural styles in australia, just as it would be equally confusing to have a totally seperate article for commercial architectural styles in australia. I feel it would be best arranged the way I've mentioned above, and anyone seeking <b>further</b> depth into non-residential architectural styles can either explore the rest of the worlds abundance in styles, use an external link, or buy a copy of Apperley, Irving and Reynolds&#160;: ).</p>
<p>Of the people wishing to attain information about architectural styles in australia, the majority of them would be seeking residential styles in particular, and in most ways, it is the residential styles that dictate any <b>comparible</b> styles in non-residential architecture. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_carson_2b91.html" title="User:Nick carson">Nick carson</a> 11:54, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The term Architectural styles can be used to describe the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architectural_style.html" title="Architectural style">architectural style</a> of all buildings, but it is primarily used in conjunction with residential buildings, as they account for a greater percentage of buildings overall. Throughout this article a complete list of each <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architectural_style.html" title="Architectural style">architectural style</a> in Australia and summaries on the major styles can be found. It is generally acepted within Architectural and Historical communities that <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Victoria contains the greatest depth of styles in Australia.

<p>Removed this part from the intro - The article should be about styles of all types of buildings - here in Canberra plenty of non-residential buildings are thought of in terms of their style - Cameron offices is Brutalist, the National Library is classical, edmund barton is international etc. Also is it really accepted that Melbourne has the greatest depth of styles?

<dd>The introduction now contains the assertion <i>"<b>Australian architectural styles</b> are as diverse as the origins of the Australian people and the wide <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> they inhabit."</i> I don't think so, for example there was, and is, no indigenous style. Some of the rest of ny qualms perhaps relate to the prportion of representation, but still, Asian styles seem to be a pastiche (do I mean this word?) rather than relating to those ethnic groups' origins. I think we really need to watch the generalisations, cite sources for opinions, and preferaby stick to verifiable information--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 21:42, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indigenous structures are not an architectural style. The commonly understood scope of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architectural_style.html" title="Architectural style">Architectural style</a> does not encompass such structures. Even the term <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernacular_architecture.html" title="Vernacular architecture">Vernacular architecture</a> does not include such structures in scope. Because of their nature, I doubt whether any survive European settlement and the diversity of examples is much less today than was.

<li>I think the breakdown can really thought of by period first then perhaps use and that this would be generally held. For example people would look at a church, a railway station or a house and say that is from the Victorian era. Of course it is generally obvious whether the building is residential or otherwise.

<dd>That is an excellent book on Australian architecture, I added the list you put here to the article in a rough form, which can be expanded hopefully. Im not sure whether the definitions should be by period or by residential/non-residential.

<dd>I feel this residential and non-residential split is deffinatly required, and I don't feel there is any need to create seperate articles as it will most deffinatly further complicate things. However, if the ammount of information grows too big for one article then it can deffinatly be split into 2 seperate articles "Australian architectural styles - Residential" and "Australian architectural styles - Non-Residential", but for now I believe the one article is the best solution. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_carson_2b91.html" title="User:Nick carson">Nick carson</a> 00:31, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am confused by the term Waterfall for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_deco.html" title="Art deco">Art deco</a> is the term Waterfall common terminology in Australia for 1930s style architecture? The house illustrated as "Waterfall" is indeed Art deco - (or more accurately <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streamline_Moderne_2988.html" title="Streamline Moderne">Streamline Moderne</a>) the influence of which was often, among other things, the ocean going liners of the era - decks\terraces, large curved windows and balconies. Lloyd Wrights Falling water was iconic because of its dependence on a series of self-supporting cantilevers which do not appear to be at all evident in the photograph. If Waterfall is the term in Australia (I don't know, I've no reason to believe it is not except for a lack of confirmation on google) then I really don't see how Wright's building can be the influence. <a href="http://www.wam.umd.edu/~stwright/frank-lloyd-wright/fallingwater.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wam.umd.edu/~stwright/frank-lloyd-wright/fallingwater.html" rel="nofollow">Falling water site</a>. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 12:15, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The term waterfall is a common house type in Australia, it is a sub-type of austerity housing. Usually owner built, or non-architect built. I couldn't find the origin of the term but I cannot believe it is derived from Fallingwater.

<blockquote>
<p>"The ‘austerity’ house featured a modest porch with a flat concrete roof, a hipped main roof, narrow eaves and a small frontage. Steel frame casement windows were common. They often had a rear lean-to but this typical Australian addition disappeared after the austerity era. The ‘Waterfall Austerity’ was a striking variation, usually owner-built of sawn or random stone, cinder block or home-made cement bricks with a rendered finish. Its main features were rounded corners with curved windows, a cast concrete canopy over porches and ‘porthole’ windows. The style was popular in 1945–55 until better materials became available and tastes changed."</p>

<li>Peter Cuffley's book, <i>Australian Houses of the Forties &amp; Fifities</i>, refers (page 118) to fashionable modern houses of the thirties which were sometimes described as being like ocean liners, with walls, windows and balconies all sweeping around corners. By the 1940s these details were entrenched into suburban designs. He states that the name 'Waterfall' or 'Waterfall Front' style came to be known as such from the use of descending curves in chimneys, fence pillars and other verticla elements. Robin Boyd noted that threewas 'the key to decorative smartness'; three steps usually being used for the waterfall effect and featured parallel lines were often in threes.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 21:18, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>"Australian architectural styles have been basically exotic and derivative. Until recent times building styles were only slightly modified by climate, materials and skills."</i></p>
<p>I don't like this intro. It's negative. I think that it is true, in that almost ALL architecture of most countries during the period has been derivative. I think that the word "exotic" is misplaced here, because it is not clear to your-average-reader what is meant by this at all. Could it mean minarettes and onion shaped domes? While your-average-gardener might understand, your-average HSC student won't.</p>
<p>Moreover, while derivative in <i>style</i>, Australian domestic architecture has not been so derivative in <i>form</i>.</p>
<p>While it is true that the Brits imported half-timbering and the Dutch brought Dutch-gables and the Greeks brought a love of cast cement columns, Australian Architecture has been <i>of necessity</i> adaptive towards the climate, materials available and skills.</p>
<p>In Sydney, to use a very common example, terrace houses with balconies which provied protection from the summer sun and give somewhere sunny to sit in the winter are the rule. Those without balconies are very rare and date from pre 1840. On the other hand, substantial balconies that can be sat upon (rather than a decorative trim) are rare on English terraces. One could of course say that they are derived from New Orleans, or one could see them as a natural response to the climate. I think that the intro needs to make a decidedly more positive statement. I'll work on it.</p>

There are some distinctively Australian styles, particularly the residential ones. The true Federation Style was hailed as a "style of our own" in early home magazines. The Filligree styles of terraces are also distinctively Australian (although similar styles sprang up in areas like New Orleans). The "Queenslander" is yet another example of an Australian style. Due to the nature of architecture, however, what isn't derivative. Almost all European architecture was either based on the classical orders of ancient Greece or ancient gothic styles, and you can't get much more derivative than that&#160;! --<a href="../../../b/i/a/User%7EBiatch_2130.html" title="User:Biatch">Biatch</a> 02:03, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could an example of South Australian architecture be included in picture? I'm not usually parochial, but we do have some stunning public buildings and churches - in Adelaide as well as many country towns. Each state is distinctive because of the types of local materials that were available to the early settlers.

<dd>Yes. At least according to Apperley, Irving and Reynolds. Essentially it is essentially a branch off both the organic and functionalist styles. It differs in a couple of key ways 1) Organic does not necessarily mean low environmental impact, Does not try to integrate with the earth, and; 2) Sustainable is differentiated through use sustainable technologies such as solar power and water recycling which organic does not. 3) The term 'sustainable' is now commonly accepted in architectural circles, whereas 'organic' is now seldom used. --<a href="../../../b/i/a/User%7EBiatch_2130.html" title="User:Biatch">Biatch</a> 00:39, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While Apperly Irving and Reynolds wrote a fine book, they are not necessarily definitive. The Federation period has been defined by some others as 1890 to 1918 - the end of WW1 rather than the beginning, making the Inter War period more genuinely Inter War ( ie not including WWI in the period)</p>
<p>I note the division of WW2 at 1940.</p>
<p>As there is generally no such thing as wartime architecture, (or its not recognised in architecture books) the wars seem to be arbitrarily split by authors according to their own interpretation, or at least, thats the impression I have from my own interest in timber framed Victorian and Federation (Edwardian with distinguishable Australian decorative motifs) buildings. Does anyone else have any information on the variability or definitiveness of these dates? <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 15:05, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>No problem with an alternative source, but that book is as far as I know the only nearly current authority on classifying architectural styles in Australia. If you want to revise please cite a reliable source as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Given the lead times for building and the timing of adoption of new trends, I presume that may account for the dating split ( Federation period c. 1890 - c. 1915; Inter-War Period c. 1915 - c. 1940; Post-War Period c. 1940 - 1960). I haven't gone back to check their examples but I assume they picked the dates with references actual buildings in distinguishable styles. Is there a particular example that you feel moves the dates significantly, more than that which is justified by the use of circa? ---<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 19:59, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>No, nothing moves the dates significantly. Just saying the building styles did not change on New Year's Eve of any year, but were adopted over a time. Some Federation style buildings were built in the early Inter War period, out of a preference for the older style perhaps. The start of one can overlap with the predecessor for awhile. First instance would be hard to date or cite for many of these classifications. Just as valid: Federation period c. 1890 - World War I; Inter-War Period c. World War I - World War II; Post-War Period c. World War II - 1960. The dates given are a tidy academic convenience that are as close to the mark as anyone's likely to get. Apperly Irving and Reynolds seem to go for the nearest 10, as in 1950,1960, 1970, but needed the nearest 5 for wwI. In "The Federation House" by H. Fraser &amp; R. Joyce, they cite the beginning of Federation architecture as the 1888 terracotta sculpture of a lyre bird by Lucien Henry, built into a wall of a Queen Anne (?) building for the Centennial. It is the use of Australian motifs that distinguish a Federation structure from an Edwardian one. They also cite the end of Federation architecture as 1918. (first published 1986) compared to Apperly Irving and Reynolds (first published 1989) In "Getting the Details Right", published by Flannel Flower Press for the NSW Department of Planning,(1989) the Federation period is described as "1890s~1920s". Other books on particular styles (like Federation) have small variants, but I haven't come across another complete classification attempt.</p>
<p>How can .c dates for architectural periods can be described as "authoritative"?</p>
<p>It is merely worth noting that authorities do vary. The c for circa may be considered adequate, but many miss its meaning.</p>
<p>I note "Californian Bungalow" (<i>Federation Bungalow</i> to Apperly Irving and Reynolds) is not in the Federation styles, but examples of that style can be more readily found than for Queen Anne... it was very popular, and continued as Inter War Bungalow.</p>
<p>Great to see a section on Australian Architecture anyway.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 15:00, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just looked through the main page again. Looks good.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 11:16, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
