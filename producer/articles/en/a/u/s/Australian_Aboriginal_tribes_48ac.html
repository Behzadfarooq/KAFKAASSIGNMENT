The original population, estimated at 8,000 people was reduced to a population of around 300 between 1802 and 1833 mainly due to the actions of white settlers who came to Australia from the United Kingdom, combined with disease and cultural disruption.

The population of the Noongar at the time of European arrival was estimated between 6000 and 10000. The population in the 2001 census was 21000. <a href="../../../y/a/g/Yagan.html" title="Yagan">Yagan</a> was the head of the Beeliar group of Nyungar people when English settlers first arrived in and established the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swan_River_Colony_af7f.html" title="Swan River Colony">Swan River Colony</a> in 1829. Captain <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Stirling_%28Australian_governor%29_0bf1.html" title="James Stirling (Australian governor)">James Stirling</a> declared that the local tribes were British subjects. Although the Nyungar at first traded amicably with the settlers, as time wore on, rifts and misunderstandings developed, and attacks and reprisal attacks grew. Yagan was eventually <a href="../../../b/e/h/Beheaded.html" title="Beheaded">beheaded</a> and is now seen by many as one of the first Indigenous resistance fighters.
