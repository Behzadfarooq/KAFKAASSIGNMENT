<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Maestro_4ade.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>BL had been created in 1975 when the bankrupt <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Leyland_Motor_Corporation_f72e.html" title="British Leyland Motor Corporation">British Leyland Motor Corporation</a> was <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalised.html" title="Nationalised">nationalised</a>. In 1977 the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South African</a>-born corporate troubleshooter <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Michael_Edwardes_a6a2.html" title="Sir Michael Edwardes">Sir Michael Edwardes</a> was employed as Chairman to sort out the troubled firm. Part of Edwardes' plan was to introduce a completely new range of mass-market models to replace the current offerings, and which would be designed and built using state-of-the-art technology. The new range eventually decided upon would consist of a new vehicle for each of the small, lower-medium and upper-medium market segments.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Design_and_development" id="Design_and_development"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Maestro_4ade.html" title="Edit section: Design and development">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Design and development</span></h2>
<p>The new cars for the lower and upper medium segments were to share a platform, with various trim and styling differences to distinguish the two different models. This would give the cost benefits of production automation and flexibility. This common platform was given the project name <i>LC10</i>, using the <i>Leyland Cars</i> project sequence (LC8 became the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Mini_Metro_c2a4.html" title="Austin Mini Metro">Austin Mini Metro</a>, LC9 became the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triumph_Acclaim_9036.html" title="Triumph Acclaim">Triumph Acclaim</a>). Preliminary design work for LC10 began in 1977.</p>
<p>LC10 was styled by BL's ace design guru <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bache_0e53.html" title="David Bache">David Bache</a> with two main body variations being provided: a five-door <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatchback.html" title="Hatchback">hatchback</a> and a four-door <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notchback.html" title="Notchback">notchback</a>. It was a departure from previous front-wheel drive cars from the company in that it dispensed with the famous <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alec_Issigonis_050b.html" title="Alec Issigonis">Issigonis</a> transmission-in-sump powertrain that had been pioneered in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini.html" title="Mini">Mini</a>. Coupled to the <a href="../../../b/m/c/BMC_A-Series_engine_3a45.html" title="BMC A-Series engine">A-Series</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/_/BL_R-Series_engine_2c88.html" title="BL R-Series engine">R-Series</a> powerplants was a conventional end-on transmission purchased from <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkswagen.html" title="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a>. The sophisticated <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydragas.html" title="Hydragas">Hydragas</a> suspension system used on previous BL models was sacrificed on cost grounds, with a conventional <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacPherson_strut_5502.html" title="MacPherson strut">MacPherson strut</a> system at the front and a <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkswagen_Golf_4ad1.html" title="Volkswagen Golf">Volkswagen Golf</a> style <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torsion_beam.html" title="Torsion beam">torsion beam</a> at the rear being used instead, despite the cost in terms of lost load space. Prototypes were even tested with actual Golf suspension components.</p>
<p>It was decided that the five-door hatchback version would be engineered first and it was given its own project designation <i>LM10</i>, this version was to be launched as the <b>Austin Maestro</b>. The <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_boot.html" title="Car boot">booted</a> notchback version was to follow and it was designated as <i>LM11</i>, although its development was to diverge from the original path, it was later launched as the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Montego_2056.html" title="Austin Montego">Austin Montego</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Maestro</i> incorporated many novel and pioneering features for its class. It had a bonded <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windscreen.html" title="Windscreen">laminated windscreen</a>, body-coloured <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumper.html" title="Bumper">plastic bumpers</a>, an <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engine_management_system.html" title="Engine management system">electronic engine management system</a>, a five-speed gearbox, adjustable front seat belt upper anchorage positions, an asymmetrically split rear seat, and a 12,000 mile service interval. The MG and Vanden Plas versions had solid-state instrumentation with digital speedometer and <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuum_fluorescent_display.html" title="Vacuum fluorescent display">vacuum fluorescent</a> analogue displays for tachometer, fuel and temperature gauges, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trip_computer.html" title="Trip computer">trip computer</a> and a voice synthesis warning and information system.</p>

<p>The <i>Maestro</i> was launched in March 1983. In its summing up of the new car the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumers%27_Association_a758.html" title="Consumers' Association">Consumers' Association</a>, in the June edition of its <i>Which?</i> journal,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> described it as roomy, comfortable, and nice to drive, and said "If you are considering buying one now, our advice, based on our first impressions, is to go ahead." In January 1984, after testing the car they concluded "In comparison with opposition of a similar price and body size, the Maestro has a clear advantage on room for passengers, with few cars equalling it for comfort either in the front or back". They also considered it to be a serious rival to the higher segment <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vauxhall_Cavalier_0ae3.html" title="Vauxhall Cavalier">Vauxhall Cavalier</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Sierra_c50f.html" title="Ford Sierra">Ford Sierra</a>, apart from its smaller boot space.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Maestro_4ade.html" title="Edit section: Later developments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later developments</span></h2>
<p>The car was a reasonable success, but not as much as beleaguered BL had hoped. After the "boom" years of 1986 and 1987, Maestro sales had gone into terminal decline. An early reputation for poor build quality and unreliability did not help. The biggest problems centred around the 1.6 L R-Series engine, which had been hurriedly transplanted from the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Maxi_9ffa.html" title="Austin Maxi">Austin Maxi</a> as the under-development <a href="../../../b/l/_/BL_S-Series_engine_d098.html" title="BL S-Series engine">S-Series</a> unit was not yet ready for production. R-Series units suffered from hot starting problems and premature crankshaft failure.</p>
<p>The new S-Series engine eventually appeared in July 1984, and was fitted to all existing 1.6-litre Maestros. The new S-Series engine also came fitted with electronic ignition. At the same time, some minor equipment upgrades were made across the range. The 1.3 base model gained head restraints, a passenger door mirror and a radio. The 1.3 L, 1.3 HLE, 1.6 L, 1.6 Automatic and 1.6 HLS all gained a radio/cassette player.</p>
<p>In October 1984, there were more equipment upgrades made across the range. The 1.3 base model gained reclining front seats, door bins, locking fuel filler cap and a clock. The L models gained cloth door trim, upgraded upholstery, and a remote-adjustable driver's side door mirror; the 1.6 L gained a 5-speed gearbox. The 1.3 HLE gained a 5-speed '4+E' gearbox with overdrive 5th gear ratio, side mouldings, cloth upholstery, tweed upholstery and a remote-adjustable passengers' side door mirror. The HLS and 1.6 Automatic gained tinted glass, central locking, electric front windows, velour upholstery and an upgraded radio/cassette player. The <a href="../../../m/g/_/MG_ba2a.html" title="MG">MG</a> Maestro gained an electronic fuel-injected 115bhp version of the 2-litre O-Series engine, uprated suspension and ventilated front disc brakes, colour-keyed exterior trim, tinted glass, central locking and a leather-trimmed steering wheel.</p>
<p>Also in October 1984, the existing Maestro lineup was joined by the <b>1.3 HL</b> and <b>1.6 HL</b>. These models fitted between the L and HLE models.</p>
<p>August 1985 saw the arrival of the <b>1.3 City</b> and <b>1.3 City X</b>. The 1.3 City was similar to the previous 1.3 base model. The 1.3 City X added full carpeting, cloth upholstery, head restraints, a rear parcel shelf, a radio and a manually-operated choke.</p>
<p>The original dashboard was of a multi-piece construction, and gained a reputation for being flimsy and prone to squeaks and rattles, so, in February 1986, this was replaced with the more conventional dashboard from the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montego.html" title="Montego">Montego</a>. At the same time, yet even more minor equipment upgrades were made across the range. The City X gained door bins and rear wash/wipe. The L and LE gained tweed trim. The HL and Automatic gained velour trim and additional brightwork. The Vanden Plas gained part leather trim and uprated electronic stereo system.</p>
<p>Following BL's sale to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Aerospace_0993.html" title="British Aerospace">British Aerospace</a> in 1986 Austin badges were dropped in 1987 for the 1988 model year, and the range was sustained by an Economical <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perkins.html" title="Perkins">Perkins</a> <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel.html" title="Diesel">diesel</a> Unit engine launched the preceding year.</p>
<p>In 1993 <a href="../../../w/h/a/What_Car__30a5.html" title="What Car?">What Car?</a> buyers' guide section said 'Yes, its old, but nowadays it's also very cheap. Popularity of noisy but economical and surprisingly rapid turbodiesel is what keeps this roomy car going.'</p>
<p>Also in 1993, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Automobile_Association_d68f.html" title="The Automobile Association">The Automobile Association</a> road tested the Turbo Diesel. Their Verdict: 'You're hardly likely to buy a Maestro diesel to improve your street cred! For turning heads, the 218/418 is a much better proposition. However, disinterested passengers love the back seat, while the driver can relish the model's marked reluctance to visit filling stations. Here's a hatchback for buyers who are really serious about the substance rather than the image - and with a price tag that's thousands of pounds lower than most of its rivals (shown in our comparison chart), you start saving even before your first forecourt stop. Unless you're averse to gearchanging, this unpretentious Maestro turbo-diesel, at its competetive price, can't seriously be faulted.'</p>

<p>The arrival of the <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rover_600.html" title="Rover 600">Rover 600</a> in 1993 saw the closure of the Maestro/Montego assembly line, but small-scale production in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complete_knock_down.html" title="Complete knock down">Complete knock down</a> (CKD) form continued until 1994, when <a href="../../../b/m/w/BMW_bcb4.html" title="BMW">BMW</a>'s takeover of <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rover_%28car%29.html" title="Rover (car)">Rover</a> saw the plug finally being pulled on production almost immediately.</p>
<p>An abortive attempt to sell the Maestro production tooling to a <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgarian</a> company in the mid-1990s left hundreds of Maestros in CKD kit form. By the turn of the millennium it was still possible to buy a brand new Maestro, although only in <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_hand_drive.html" title="Left hand drive">left hand drive</a> form, since <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=zh_en&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsongauto.com" class="external text" title="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=zh_en&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsongauto.com" rel="nofollow">Etsong</a>, a <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> tobacco company, bought the rights to the Maestro and Montego, and started production in 2000 in <a href="../../../q/i/n/Qingdao.html" title="Qingdao">Qingdao</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>.

<p>The rear lighting units of the van version lived on until 1998 in the Series I <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_Rover_Discovery_3798.html" title="Land Rover Discovery">Land Rover Discovery</a>.</p>
<p>The Maestro was replaced by the <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rover_200.html" title="Rover 200">Rover 200</a>. 605,410 Austin Maestros were produced and 5,740 MG Maestros were produced.</p>
<p>The Maestro was maligned throughout its production life for suspect build quality, questionable reliability, and a general lack of design flair compared to some rivals. Despite this, it still managed to achieve 440,000 sales in Britain alone thanks to a spacious interior, competitive asking price and low running costs, although it failed to match the success of the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Escort_a176.html" title="Ford Escort">Ford Escort</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vauxhall_Astra_6ff5.html" title="Vauxhall Astra">Vauxhall Astra</a>. This was less of a problem, considering that the company's similar-sized <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rover_200.html" title="Rover 200">Rover 200</a> range was one of Britain's strongest sellers during this period.</p>
<p>A survey by <a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto_Express_8fc6.html" title="Auto Express">Auto Express</a> magazine, conducted in 2006, revealed that the Maestro was Britain's ninth most scrapped car, with just 11,574 examples still in working order in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Many Maestros were claimed by rust, corrosion and mechanical problems, but a large number were also finished off by joyriders who preyed on the car's inadequate security features. Like most pre-1989 BL cars, the Maestro cannot be easily converted to run on unleaded <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrol.html" title="Petrol">petrol</a> without re-machining the <a href="../../../c/y/l/Cylinder_head.html" title="Cylinder head">cylinder head</a>, which is why very few 1980s examples are still in existence. Sadly, many people are unaware that there are available, FHBVC (Federation of Historic British Vehicle Clubs), tested and approved lead replacement fuel additives, that work out at only a couple of pence a litre.</p>
<p><br />
The Maestro benefits from enthusiast clubs in the UK, offering support to those trying to maintain examples of the car.</p>
