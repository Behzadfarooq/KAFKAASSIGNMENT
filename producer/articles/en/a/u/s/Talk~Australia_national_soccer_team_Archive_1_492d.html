<p>RE: "communist" Cambodia</p>
<p>I am sorry to be pedantic but.</p>
<p>Cambodia was not a "communist" state in 1965. It was a monarchy under Shi It <i>tilted</i> towards [north] Vietnam as the USA was bombing the **** out of it. So I edited the offending comment out.</p>
<p>On an even more pedantic note, the "communist" [i.e. extreme Khmer nationalist] Khmer Rouge did not seize power until 1975, where they went on to kill almost as many Cambodians as the USA did.</p>
<p>On an even more pedantic note, the Khmer Rouge were supported by Western powers, including Australia, after Vietnam booted them out in 1978-9, as a three party armed opposition coalition. This included military support.</p>
<p>Oh, no I have just seen the Khmer rouge controversy on this site so I am going home now.</p>

<p>Tancred, football in Australia almost always means either <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a> or <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a>. The belated attempts by the soccer authorities to change this fly in the face of more than 130 years of "football" meaning other codes. If you are unaware of what I'm saying, see <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28word%29.html" title="Football (word)">football (word)</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29_names.html" title="Football (soccer) names">football (soccer) names</a> for more details. There are national teams in both Australian rules (see <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_rules_football.html" title="International rules football">International rules football</a>) and rugby league (<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_rugby_league_team.html" title="Australia national rugby league team">Australia national rugby league team</a>) and since neither of them has the arrogance to refer to themselves as the "Australian football team", neither should the Socceroos.</p>
<p>If you think there is an issue of consistency/style, see <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_men%27s_national_soccer_team_7e9f.html" title="United States men's national soccer team">United States men's national soccer team</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_men%27s_national_soccer_team.html" title="Canada men's national soccer team">Canada men's national soccer team</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_national_soccer_team_1d19.html" title="New Zealand national soccer team">New Zealand national soccer team</a>.

<dd>I second Grant's comment. Also, for the sake of consistency, the page title should be <b>Australia national soccer team</b> or <b>Australia men's national soccer team</b>. Of the two, I strongly prefer <b>Australia national soccer team</b>. The reason why the USA and Canada team pages contain "men's" is because in both countries, the women's team has historically been much more successful than the men's team (although this is starting to change in the USA).

<p>I disagree. Its Football. For many people its always been football. And as for the "At least discuss the matter before you move the page again", I did not see you do that last week Grant65. And as for the common name? Well today I read the paper and it was called football. Last night the TV news called it football and today I shall be going to see Sydney *FC* play in the A-league run by *Football* Australia. - Tancred</p>
<dl>
<dd>In Australia, no-one refers to soccer as football. (except maybe very few people who are not native to Australia) If you ask an Australian what is football? they will tell you AFL in Melbourne and NRL in Sydney, but no-where will they tell you it is soccer.

<dd>Really? I would have to say this is one of the most incorrect comments I have ever read on wikipedia. My grandparents were born here and I call it football. The people I spoke with in the cove yesterday at the Sydney FC heom game call it football and most of them seemed to be born here. You may have heard of Johnny Warren, he called it football and was born here. Today there is a poll in TheAge, a *Melbourne* newspaper and as I write this 50% of the respondents say the game is football.--<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancred_11fe.html" title="User:Tancred">Tancred</a> 01:13, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For my two cents, soccer is by far the most common term. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort by the sport's authorities to promote "soccer" as "football" and the latter is gaining currency. It is still far from common, however. I suggest <b>Australian national soccer team</b>. Hell, why not even <b>Socceroos</b>? --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 02:36, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "socceroos" is a nickname, and an embarrassing one at that. The FA have already stopped using it, apart from the requirments in the QANTAS deal, and when than ends, the usage will cease by the FA. The name most fans what the team to be called is "Australia", and Australia national football team fits the wikipedia format.--<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancred_11fe.html" title="User:Tancred">Tancred</a> 01:16, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I accept that I should have discussed the move first, but the matter seemed obvious to me. What Tancred calls the sport or FFA, Sydney FC or SBS calls it is not common usage in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>. I can guarantee that if you asked 100 people at random in the <s>center</s> centre of any Australian city which football team they support or who their favorite football player is, almost none would name a soccer team or a soccer player. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a>

<dd>Speaking of AusE, you're aware we spell it "centre", right?&#160;;-) Cheekiness aside, it appears there is consensus that "soccer" is the common term. We now need to determine the preferred title. I put it again: is there any reason why the article shouldn't be entitled <b>Socceroos</b>?

<p>Cyberjunkie, Why did you move this page? The "socceroos" is a *nickname*.

<dd>Nickname or no, it is the common term by which the team is known. How other national teams are titled is irrelevant if there is a dispute as to the title of this one. <i>Socceroos</i> was the only name against which no opposition was expressed.

<p>The team is called Socceroos, but the game is called football. Keep it under the football listing. - bato 5/12/05</p>
<dl>
<dd>In Australia, the game is known as soccer. Admittedly, on the back of a push by soccer authorities, "football" or "association football" is being used more prominently, but no-one could deny "soccer" as the common term.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 02:06, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Soccer is no longer the common term. In fact I haven't heard anyone call it soccer for at least 6 months. This is even just people in the streets talking about going to see "that new football league". The game is run by the FOOTBALL federation of Australia, my local team is the Sydney FOOTBALL club and we are playing in the FOOTBALL World Cup...why on Earth would we class this under some mediocre, out-dated name that is only ever raised by people who try to put the game down? To me soccer is what the game used to be in this country...now, we play football. -Super Dulberf Carney-</p>
<p>The name of the game has been corrected back to Football, to align with the 7 billion people of the word who refer to it as Football. Us Australians will learn that Rugby refers to Rugby Union, League refers to Rugby League, and AFL is just that. Football is now called Football, as it should always have been. - ozzieshane 5/12/05</p>

<dd>Obviously (as shown by the fact this debate is even occurring), Australians have differing views on whether it's "soccer" or "football" (see also <a href="http://theage.com.au/polls/sport/results.html" class="external text" title="http://theage.com.au/polls/sport/results.html" rel="nofollow">this poll</a>), so I don't think you can define what it is definitely called in "Australian English". In this case, we should then defer to consistency with the rest of Wikipedia whereby the sport the team plays is given by the name of the national federation. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbinomonkey_5636.html" title="User:Albinomonkey">AlbinoMonkey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/l/b/User_talk%7EAlbinomonkey_dabe.html" title="User talk:Albinomonkey">Talk</a>)</sup> 07:53, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems quite simple to me. the A-League is "Football but not as you know it", the Australian governing body is the Football Federation Australia, the teams are Sydney Football Club, Melbourne Victory Football Club etc..., with the few exceptions noted above (US Canada New Zealand etc) its Football. Even the most staunch hold out of the name soccer, namely the Australian Media has acknowledged its proper name, every news paper has results and news under the football heading, Rugby Union under the Rugby heading, Rugby League under the League heading and AFL under the AFL heading.

<p>I'm an uninvolved admin. I see that it's been proposed that Australian national football team be made a disam page that links to Socceroos, the national rugby league team and also Australian rules football. If you guys have a consensus on that, I'd be glad to create the disam page. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 06:42, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Disagree. Google "Australian National Football Team" and tell me how many pages you have to go back before you find a link which refers to a Union or League or AFL side as the "Australian National Football Team".

<li>The main use for a disam page is for searching. That's why we already have a disam page for <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_football.html" title="Australian football">Australian_football</a>. The thing is, what you consider "real" football isn't the point since someone else will think that ARF is "real football". I can easily see both Australian rules football fans and rugby league fans typing in "Australian national football team" in the search box. They should see a disam page that shows the various uses of the term. After all, we have a <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_national_rugby_league_team.html" title="Australian national rugby league team">Australian_national_rugby_league_team</a> page and we also have a full page on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a> (both of which are on the Australian football disam page). And as for the google search, when I typed in Australian National Football Team, the 5th link down was for the national Australian rules football team (the AFL). To me, that's good enough for a disam page. Disam pages are for searching. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 08:40, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Disagree. Up until 3 days ago there was no problem with this article being called "Australia National Football Team", Rugby League and Aussie Rules were in Wikipedia and noone seemed to have problems finding them. As pointed out above, the handful of "soccer national team" pages are run by "soccer" federations. Australia has Football Federation Australia so this page should be moved back. Even in melbourne over 55% of people according to an age poll feel this game should be called "football" - Tancred</p>

<p>How is moving it back to the socceroos going with the consensus? Not everyone wants this, and looking at the history of the page and who makes edits and moves the page, the people who contribute the most to the article want it to remain at "Australia national football team" Given that this is the official name of the game in Australia, that many people want it to stay there and that it follows the wikipedia style for these sort of articles, I would ask that it be moved back there. - Tancred</p>
<dl>
<dd>And I would ask that it stay here as a reflection of common usage in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>. What soccer fans, FFA, SBS or the Sydney Morning Herald want to call it are not representative of Australian popular culture and are therefore neither here nor there. There never is a 100% consensus with large groups, but <i>for the vast majority of Australian English speakers, "football" means a code other than soccer, or the word is ambiguous</i>. (That's why people in regions where more than one code is popular, do not tend to use the word "football" and instead refer to them to "AFL", "league", "union" or "soccer".) The mere fact of ambiguity is enough to prevent the article being called "Australian national football team". <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 23:21, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> government, the "official" English name for the capital city of the country is <a href="../../../k/y/i/Kyiv.html" title="Kyiv">Kyiv</a>; here, it redirects to <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>, because that's the word most people actually <i>use</i> in English. "Official" names don't count for much on Wikipedia; the real question here is <i>which</i> people's usage counts. Much of the soccer (a term I use here for clarity's sake) establishment in Australia, not to say many of the game's players and fans — most of the people who'll be writing about it on Wikipedia, in other words — like it to be called football. Most people <i>in general</i> in Australia call it "soccer", because there's half a dozen or so different codes of football (and of course the only <i>real</i> one is whichever one they follow &lt;/sarcasm&gt;) — and, thanks to the national team's recent success, it's only now that people in this category are getting interested in this article. Worldwide, soccer happens to be the most common code of football, but most people playing it, I venture, don't speak English, at least not as a native language. As for what a <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plurality.html" title="Plurality">plurality</a> of native English speakers <i>worldwide</i> think of when you say football, I'm terrified it might be 300 million Americans thinking of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">this</a>... Frankly, I think it would be better to sidestep the whole issue and go for what's clearest. Regardless of whether the game's players and followers like the word, there's no way you can mistake the word "soccer" to refer to any other sport. The word "football" has that problem in Australia, and it's not going away anytime soon. ～<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_c0d4.html" title="User:Jiminy Krikkitt"><b>J</b></a>.<b><a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_f78f.html" title="User talk:Jiminy Krikkitt">K</a></b>. 23:48, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Is there any room for formalising the name of the article? I think Socceroos is actually a nickname and therefore should NOT be the formal name of the article.

<dd>Unfortunately, I don't think a poll is feasible. Only those actively involved in this thread would find this page and contribute. Could "<b>Australian National Football (Soccer) Team</b>" be a compromise? I think "National" should be retained on the basis that there is potential for confusion. For instance, a "New Zealand" team exists in the A-League, but it is not their National team (and hardly has any New Zealanders in it). Also, there are subnational teams (e.g. state representative teams), and other non-national representative teams (the Australian Institute of Sport team, etc) which when competing overseas (e.g. the annual Singapore U-19 Cup) could end up "representing" Australia. By the way, if you look at the history, I tried adding a disambiguation bit to the intro of the article with Rugby Union/AFL/League some time ago, but it was promptly edited out. <a href="../../../v/i/x/User%7EViXx_fff5.html" title="User:ViXx">ViXx</a> 15:10, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

As it stands today, the title of this page is not the official name of "Australian national football team", but an unofficial nickname "socceroos" - very encyclopedic. The calls for a disam page seem rather pointless to me. Rugby fans dont call their sport football, and League fans seem to use the term Rugby League.

<dd>Ah denial, more than a river. "Football" in New South Wales and Queensland is rugby league. You can assert otherwise, but you are wrong.

<dd>Really? I don't think so. In any case the clincher is that that the word "football" is highly ambiguous in Australia, i.e. it can mean at least three different codes. So it's not suitable for use in the name of a soccer-related article.</dd>

<p>Okay, let's make this the last attempt to reach consensus without a strawpoll.

<dd>The cases for these options have already been made variously on this page. Perhaps I should set up a straw poll on these options. Personally, I'm happy for the article to be moved to "national soccer team" as a compromise to all options (it grates least nerves).

<p>Coming in late here, so I'm sorry if I rehash old stuff. First off, "[Countryname] national football team" is the standard naming format for <i>all</i> countries (yes, I know about United States of America and New Zealand, and they're a pain in the arse). We should at least consider the football POV for an article on the Socceroos as well as the apparent Australian POV (I'm pretty sure Grant didn't do that, but it's not worth jumping up and down about, he was just being <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>). Secondly, as has been noted above, "Socceroos" is not a good name for the article (Italia is at <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy_national_football_team.html" title="Italy national football team">Italy national football team</a>, not at Azzuri). I would prefer moving it back to "Australia national football team", to fit with the vast majority of football teams, but e'en as I disagree I understand the potential for confusion with our national rugby or league teams. "Australia national soccer team" would be an acceptable compromise. "Football (soccer)" is unnecessary – it's just a way to shoehorn "football" in there, but still breaks the convention of football-related articles. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 16:13, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, <i>"[Countryname] national football team"</i> is standard format for those teams whose countries understand soccer predominately as football. For those countries in which other codes of football predominate (ie, Anglophones outside the UK), the article title deviates. As much as some fans of the sport might try to deny, soccer is what the sport is known as in Australia. The article title should concur. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_team.html" title="Australia national football team">Australia national football team</a> should be replaced by a disambig (as suggested by an outsider) because no one code has a monopoly on the term "football".--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 17:13, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Like I said, I can live with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_soccer_team.html" title="Australia national soccer team">Australia national soccer team</a>. Some people on this talkpage seem genuinely concerned with the potential for confusion of "football" (rather than simply being on a "I'm Aussie! It's 'soccer', damnit!" tear), and with such apparent confusion we should surely have a disambig at football rather than simply redirecting to soccer. Re: countries that deviate, I know about the USA and NZ, and they're a pain — and what about countries that don't call it football? Italia calls it "calcio", apparently for reasons of national pride; many Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking countries say "futebol"; Germany has fußball or something like that. Hmm, I think I'm just being contrary at this point. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 01:28, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Final debate</span></h3>
<p>Sorry for long entry, but I am also tired of this debate.</p>
<p>TO END THIS; the debate should now solely consider: Is it confusing or difficult for an average Australian who encounters Wikipedia to find their chosen football code based on the wording of the title?</p>
<p>I would have thought that incorporating both names i.e. "Australia national football (soccer) team" (as per my initial example) would cause the least problems. It is NOT an attempt to incorporate "Football" in the title - there are MANY articles with "Football(Soccer)" in them - in fact there is a whole category. It is a form of intrinsic disambiguation. THERE IS NO need for disambiguation with other codes, as the other team pages could retain their existing headings (Australian national rugby union team and Australia national rugby league team). I think you should consider... would anybody looking for the Wallabies page ever enter "Australia national football team" in Wikipedia search? Try it out on your non-Wikipedia using friends. In my office poll, zero out of four entered "football" as a search term. I have to admit that for the Socceroos, only one entered "football".</p>
<p>Therefore, I agree that some visitors might enter "Australia national soccer team" and be annoyed if it led to a dead end (easily fixed with redirection); but I think (despite the debate), no Australian who has sufficient IQ to use the internet would be totally lost in trying to find whichever football code they were looking for. Certainly, nobody who contributes to this page would ever accidentally end up at the Socceroos page if they were looking for the Kangaroos or Wallabies...</p>
<p>I conclude that, at the end of the day, any formal title incorporating either Football or Soccer (or both) would be easily found by any person searching for that article. Please also note that some people have not heard of "socceroos" (esp. foreigners) and therefore would not enter that as a search term. If there were no redirections, this would be a disaster of a name to pick as a title. ViXx 16:26, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We should not <i>solely</i> consider the views of the Average Aussie looking for info on the Socceroos.

<dd>I don't think it would be wise to pigeon-hole the "soccer" viewpoint as a solely nimby-ist/parochial kind of POV. Surely the average reader can understand that soccer means football, and football can mead soccer. Both terms are used relatively equally (numerically) to refer to this particular code, but neither is universal. There's no reason why Wikipedia shouldn't also alternate where appropriate. Hmm...

<dd>That wasn't my intent, and I apologise if I was unclear (it's bad enough to be biting, without biting haphazardly as well!).

<dd>As I see it: If we follow convention on Wikipedia, the article should be title <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_team.html" title="Australia national football team">Australia national football team</a>. The reasons given that it should be called <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_soccer_team.html" title="Australia national soccer team">Australia national soccer team</a> (or otherwise, including the word soccer) are that (1) more Australians call the game soccer and (2) the word football in Australia is used to describe up to 4 different codes. However, the codes in question are called <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a>, not <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a>, and I don't think anyone who supports those codes will argue with that. As mentioned above, anyone looking for information on the national teams in other codes will usually search for the "national rugby league/union team", and on the chance they look for football and find soccer, it is pretty simple to click the link at the top of the page to go to the disambig page. Anyone looking for the Socceroos will most likely search for "football" if they call it football or "soccer" if they call it soccer. A recent poll in the Age found 55% would prefer for "soccer" to be called football instead of Australian rules. So, I think putting the page at <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_team.html" title="Australia national football team">Australia national football team</a> will (a) cause no confusion for people searching for other sports (although some might get annoyed if they think the "name" of their sport is being taken) and (b) conform with the convention on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbinomonkey_5636.html" title="User:Albinomonkey">AlbinoMonkey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/l/b/User_talk%7EAlbinomonkey_dabe.html" title="User talk:Albinomonkey">Talk</a>)</sup> 01:48, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The thing is, in everyday speech, AFL and at least some rugby fans <i>do</i> call their sports football, and only disambiguate when necessary for dealing with those heathens &lt;/tongue-in-cheek&gt; for whom the word refers to a different game. I'm in favour of moving the page to Australia men's national soccer team -- because that is what more people here call the game, and the Matildas deserve note, too -- and leaving a redirect at <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_team.html" title="Australia national football team">Australia national football team</a>. (As for precedent, this is presently the case for Canada; the U.S. one redirects to a disambiguation page between the men's and women's teams because the latter is at least as well known as the blokes and, until recently, considerably more successful.) ～<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_c0d4.html" title="User:Jiminy Krikkitt"><b>J</b></a>.<b><a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_f78f.html" title="User talk:Jiminy Krikkitt">K</a></b>. 02:42, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But when these fans are looking up their sport in an encyclopedia, would they look for "football" or "rugby league"/"rugby union"/"Australian rules"? In cases like this, usually the article is at the actual name, and at the top there is a little note directing users to the correct pages for things that may use that name in "everyday speech". I don't see the harm in this, and I can't see any reason to do otherwise - football is the name of the sport in this country (see my note somewhere up the page re Football Federation Australia), so why shouldn't the page be named football? When you say that "AFL and rugby fans" call it football, you are referring to a specific demographic, For example, (the easiest i can think of), a certain group of people might call <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> "horse". And, set in their ways, they might come on Wikipedia and look up the word "horse". Obviously, they're going to be taken to the page describing the animal, as most people would expect. But at the top of the page, there is a little note saying that the word "horse" may refer to other things, and takes them to a page which lists them. "Horse" is the name of the animal, but can refer to other things when used by different people. "Football" is the name of the sport (see note again), but also can refer to different sports when used by other people (ie "AFL and rugby fans"). If people decide to search for football referring to another sport, they can quickly be directed to the page they are looking for. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbinomonkey_5636.html" title="User:Albinomonkey">AlbinoMonkey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/l/b/User_talk%7EAlbinomonkey_dabe.html" title="User talk:Albinomonkey">Talk</a>)</sup> 03:36, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, yes, but soccer players and fans, Australian or otherwise, who prefer to call the sport "football" (most do, but not all) are a demographic as well. When Wikipedia consensus works, all of the relevant demographics are, if not totally satisfied, then at least not <i>too</i> pissed off.&#160;;o) Soccer is actually unusual among the games called football in having a widely-used name that refers exclusively to itself, and not other games called football, which isn't derived the region in which it was originally played. None of these sports were called anything but "football" until rules started being written down and disambiguation from other codes was needed.</dd>
<dd>So, an attempt at not pissing anyone off <i>too</i> much: The word "soccer" has the advantage of being both specific and succinct. Again, to be specific, I think we should specify that this article is about the men's team, and not the women's, which is just as national as the Socceroos. The article can be at Australia men's national soccer team, with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_team.html" title="Australia national football team">Australia national football team</a> <b>redirecting straight there</b>, and the disambiguation page separate — apart from anything else, people working on distant articles are going to be casually linking to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_team.html" title="Australia national football team">Australia national football team</a> all the time. The disambig page can be linked at the top in the usual way, with text along the lines of "<i>For other codes of football, see...</i>" ～<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_c0d4.html" title="User:Jiminy Krikkitt"><b>J</b></a>.<b><a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_f78f.html" title="User talk:Jiminy Krikkitt">K</a></b>. 05:48, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Again well-expressed, Jiminy. I largely agree, but I'm still not convinced about a primary topic disambiguation. Albino Monkey, it's odd you still claim that <i>"football is the name of the sport in this country"</i> based on it's peak organisation. How can a name change of the sport's (detached) establishment less than twelve months ago possibly cement "football" over "soccer"? In <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>, soccer is the sport's name. Therefore, if we defer to the MoS, this article should be at Australia national men's soccer team because a) the article is about an Australian subject, and b) it should conform to the predominate form of English already used in the article (ie, AusE). It should not be "football" because common usage (ie, AusE) trumps official usage. It seems, to me, the only thing left to decide is how to disambiguate.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> <a href="../../../a/u/_/P%7EAU_c5ee.html" title="P:AU">|</a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 07:51, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Albinomonkey, there is a national team comprised of Australian rules <i>football</i>ers, which plays International rules <i>football</i>. To address your earlier remarks, the governing body is simply not following common usage in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>, it is attempting to <i>change</i> conventions of Australian English. There appears to be little chance that they will be successful. And a random, unscientific survey of <i>Age</i> readers does not constitute any evidence evidence whatsover of a change in common usage, which was established more than 130 years ago, of "football" meaning Australian rules or rugby football. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 14:38, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But your argument was that the page should be called "soccer" as that is correct Australian English. The page is called soccer, so as to cater for Australians as per your request (although this POV was disputed somewhere further up the page). Most people (esp those outside Australia) will look for football (as evidenced by the backlinks), and the redirect ensures they end up at the "correct" page. The few who are looking for rugby or AFL should have no problems realising they are not at a page concerning rugby or AFL and can click the disambig link. Causing EVERYONE who searches for football to go through the disambig is just wasting their time when we know what the highest proportion is actually looking for. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbinomonkey_5636.html" title="User:Albinomonkey">AlbinoMonkey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/l/b/User_talk%7EAlbinomonkey_dabe.html" title="User talk:Albinomonkey">Talk</a>)</sup> 12:59, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see the logic in having a dead end disambig page, when part of the point of disambigs is <i>education</i>. "Causing EVERYONE who searches for football to go through the disambig is just wasting their time..." Jeez, only if they are too lazy to click one more time. It has an educational effect for the "there is only one kind of football"-type people&#160;;-) I'm only trying to be logical and consistent; that's why I started the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_football.html" title="Australian football">Australian football</a> disambig page many months ago. Perhaps that should simply redirect to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a> (?) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 23:27, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, yes, but part of the point of wikilinks is not to surprise the reader too much. A lot of soccer-fan editors overseas are in the habit of creating country links in the format [[Country xxx national football team|Country xxx]] without checking them. Having the redirect straight here ensures that readers go straight to where they were expecting to, and once they're here the disambig link is right at the top of this page to pique their curiosity about other codes. Oh, and I agree with you about the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_football.html" title="Australian football">Australian football</a> redirect; the disambig can be moved to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_in_Australia_2105.html" title="Football in Australia">football in Australia</a>. ～<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_c0d4.html" title="User:Jiminy Krikkitt"><b>J</b></a>.<b><a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_f78f.html" title="User talk:Jiminy Krikkitt">K</a></b>. 01:54, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Confuse? Isn't the point of disambig pages to reduce confusion? If so a disambig should be at the spot where confusion is most likely to occur. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 04:36, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>And I don't think <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_football.html" title="Australian football">Australian football</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 04:37, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But it doesn't? It's a disambig. Though it does say that "Australian football" means "Australian rules football" whereas to me an "Australian football" is a <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherrin.html" title="Sherrin">Sherrin</a>.

<dd>I was responding to a suggested merger and I also disagree with your suggestion. I think the only good case for mergers is when the content of two pages is almost identical. In this case one disambig is about national teams and the other is about whole codes of football.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 10:27, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps this is an unusual case where the content is different, but the structure is so almost exactly the same that one disambig page could handle both jobs. 'we have four codes of football: rugby union, which has a national team; rugby league, which has a national team; soccer, which has a national team; australian rules, which does not have a national team because the rest of the world are wusses.'

<dd>Oh, I for one want the article moved. But it's clearly unwise for anyone to do so just yet, until we can agree on <i>where</i> to move it.

<dd>This discussion now is close to exceeding the length of the original article. It is obvious that resolution is unlikely to be achieved as the group has become polarised. This article lived under its former name for a very long time, and although there was some debate, it did not threaten the article itself nor result in multiple name changes. To me, it seems that the only way to have a solution is to have one imposed by someone external to this debate. At the end of the day, I hope that a good name is chosen out of respect for our national representative team. I will certainly be cheering the Socceroos/Australia National Football Team/Australia National Soccer Team from the stands in Berlin on July 9... <a href="../../../v/i/x/User%7EViXx_fff5.html" title="User:ViXx">ViXx</a> 11:53, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
