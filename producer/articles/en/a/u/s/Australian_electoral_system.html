<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_electoral_system.html" title="Edit section: Compulsory voting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Compulsory voting</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> enforces <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compulsory_voting.html" title="Compulsory voting">compulsory voting</a>, including compulsory enrollment (registration) to vote. Compulsory voting was introduced in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a> <a href="http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa060100a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa060100a.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It was felt that since 60,000 Australians (about 1.3% of the national population) had died in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> defending freedom, Australians had a duty to use the freedoms so dearly bought. The immediate impetus for compulsory voting at federal level was the low voter turnout (59.38%) <a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/What/voting/turnout/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/What/voting/turnout/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> in the federal elections of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>. Voting is compulsory both at federal elections and at elections for the state and territory legislatures. In some states voting at municipal elections is also compulsory. Although about 5% of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_register.html" title="Electoral register">enrolled voters</a> fail to vote at most elections, prosecutions for failure to vote are rare and the fine is nominal.</p>
<p>It is commonly but wrongly claimed <a href="http://www.cis.org.au/Exechigh/Eh2006/EH32906.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cis.org.au/Exechigh/Eh2006/EH32906.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> that it is only compulsory to attend a polling place and have one's name checked against the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_register.html" title="Electoral register">electoral roll</a>. In fact, Section 245 of the Electoral Act <a href="http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/html/pasteact/0/57/0/PA003170.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/html/pasteact/0/57/0/PA003170.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> says that "It shall be the duty of every elector to vote at each election... The Electoral Commissioner must, after polling day at each election, prepare for each Division a list of the names and addresses of the electors who appear to have failed to vote at the election." A voter who has their name crossed off but then refuses a ballot paper or is seen not to put the ballot in the ballot box will be recorded as having not voted.</p>
<p>Enrolled electors who fail to vote will be sent a letter and required to offer an acceptable explanation (for example, illness or religious prohibition), or pay a fine of at least <a href="../../../%24/a/u/%24AUD_f1dc.html" title="$AUD">$AUD</a>20.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Those who do not wish to vote for any of the available candidates sometimes resort to <i>informal voting</i> - placing a blank or incompletely filled out ballot in the ballot box - and the secrecy of the ballot makes it impractical to identify or penalise those who do so. The number of informal votes is recorded, but they are not counted as part of the total number of votes cast. Over 95% of eligible Australians attend polling, and in both 2001 and 2004 only around 5% of Representatives votes were informal <a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/What/voting/informal/summary.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/What/voting/informal/summary.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>Some political scientists believe that compulsory voting benefits the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a>, while others dispute this. It is argued that most of the social groups who would tend not to vote if voting were voluntary are more inclined to vote Labor (people from the ethnic and immigrant communities, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Aborigine_5939.html" title="Australian Aborigine">indigenous Australians</a>, and people with lower levels of education). Occasionally conservative politicians or <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> intellectuals argue for the abolition of compulsory voting on philosophical grounds, but no government has ever attempted to abolish it.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_legislative_election%2C_2004.html" title="Australian legislative election, 2004">2004 federal elections</a>, at which the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal</a>-<a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_of_Australia_5507.html" title="National Party of Australia">National</a> coalition government won a majority in both Houses, a senior minister, Senator <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Minchin_c237.html" title="Nick Minchin">Nick Minchin</a>, said that he favoured the abolition of compulsory voting. The government has given no indication, however, that it would legislate to this effect. Some prominent Liberals, such as <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petro_Georgiou_e8bd.html" title="Petro Georgiou">Petro Georgiou</a>, former chair of the Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, have spoken in favour of compulsory voting.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_electoral_system.html" title="Edit section: Preferential voting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Preferential voting</span></h2>
<p>Australia uses various forms of <i><a href="../../../p/r/e/Preferential_voting.html" title="Preferential voting">preferential voting</a></i> for almost all elections. Under this system, voters number the candidates on the ballot paper in the order of their preference. The preferential system was introduced in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, in response to the rise of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_of_Australia_5507.html" title="National Party of Australia">Country Party</a>, a party representing small farmers. The Country Party split the anti-Labor vote in conservative country areas, allowing Labor candidates to win on a minority vote. The conservative government of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Hughes_3492.html" title="Billy Hughes">Billy Hughes</a> introduced preferential voting as a means of allowing competition between the two conservative parties without putting seats at risk. It was first used at the <a href="http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1917/1918-corangamite-by.txt" class="external text" title="http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1917/1918-corangamite-by.txt" rel="nofollow">Corangamite by-election on 14 December 1918</a><a href="http://www.australianpolitics.com/voting/history/voting-methods.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.australianpolitics.com/voting/history/voting-methods.shtml" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. It had previously been introduced as a result of the work of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Hare_561f.html" title="Thomas Hare">Thomas Hare</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Inglis_Clark_0bd5.html" title="Andrew Inglis Clark">Andrew Inglis Clark</a> in the <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmanian_House_of_Assembly_ef55.html" title="Tasmanian House of Assembly">Tasmanian House of Assembly</a>.</p>
<p>Preferential voting has gradually extended to both upper and lower houses, in the federal, state and territory legislatures, and is also used in municipal elections, and most other kinds of elections as well, such as internal political party elections, trade union elections, church elections, elections to company boards and elections in voluntary bodies such as football clubs.</p>
<p>With the exception of an experiment with voting machines in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Capital_Territory_7188.html" title="Australian Capital Territory">Australian Capital Territory</a><a href="http://www.elections.act.gov.au/Elecvote.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elections.act.gov.au/Elecvote.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, all Australian elections are carried out using paper ballots.</p>

<p>Australian history has seen very little <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerrymander.html" title="Gerrymander">gerrymandering</a> of electoral boundaries, which have nearly always been drawn up by civil servants or independent boundary commissioners. But Australia has seen systematic malapportionment of electorates (the allocation of more or fewer electoral districts to one part of a country or state than its population would merit), and indeed until fairly recently this was considered a perfectly natural and defensible practice in some states.</p>
<p>All the colonial legislatures before <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation.html" title="Federation">Federation</a>, and the federal parliament after it, saw country districts allocated more representation than their populations merited. This was justified on several grounds: that country people had to contend with greater distances and hardships and thus deserved greater representation; that country people (and specifically farmers) produced most of the nation's real wealth, and thus deserved greater representation; and that greater country representation was necessary to balance the radical tendencies of the urban population.</p>
<p>In the 19th century these assertions usually reflected genuinely held beliefs. By the 20th century, and especially after the rise of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor Party</a>, they became increasingly self-serving rationalisations by politicians (usually conservatives) who benefitted from the malapportionment. In the later 20th century these arguments were increasingly and usually successfully challenged, and the malapportionment was reduced and finally abolished in all states.</p>
<p>The most conspicuous examples of malapportionment were <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Australia_b9ad.html" title="South Australia">South Australia</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Australia_84d0.html" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a>.</p>
<p>In South Australia the <a href="../../../1/8/5/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a> Constitution stipulated that there must be two rural constituencies for every urban constituency, and this remained in force until <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, by which time the urban-rural voter ratio was almost exactly reversed: that is, there were two urban voters for every rural voter. As a result, rural seats had on average one-quarter the number of voters that urban seats had. This gross distortion enabled <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Playford_IV_5367.html" title="Thomas Playford IV">Sir Thomas Playford</a> to hold office as <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_and_Country_League_3d98.html" title="Liberal and Country League">Liberal and Country League</a> premier of South Australia from <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, despite losing several elections by wide margins in terms of votes. This arrangement was popularly called "the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playmander.html" title="Playmander">Playmander</a>," although it was not strictly speaking a gerrymander.</p>
<p>In Queensland the malapportionment initially benefitted the Labor Party, since many small rural constituencies were dominated by rural workers organised into the powerful <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Workers_Union_860a.html" title="Australian Workers Union">Australian Workers Union</a>. But after <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_of_Australia_5507.html" title="National Party of Australia">Country Party / National Party</a> governments of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Nicklin_41de.html" title="Frank Nicklin">Sir Frank Nicklin</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Joh_Bjelke-Petersen_7c59.html" title="Joh Bjelke-Petersen">Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen</a> were able to manipulate the electoral system so that the National Party could win elections with only a quarter of the first preference votes (although a significantly higher proportion after distribution of preferences). This "<a href="../../../b/j/e/Bjelkemander.html" title="Bjelkemander">Bjelkemander</a>" was not overcome until the final defeat of the Nationals in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Australia_84d0.html" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a> retained a significant malapportionment until <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">20 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> the state Parliament passed new electoral laws, removing the malapportionment. Under the previous system, votes in the country were worth up to four times the value of votes in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_Western_Australia_3c92.html" title="Perth, Western Australia">Perth</a>, the state's capital city. Under the new laws, electorates must have a population of 21,343, with a permitted variation of 10%. Electorates with a land area of more than 100,000km² (40,000 mi²) are permitted to have a variation of 20%, in recognition of the difficulty of representing the sparsely populated north and east of the state. <a href="http://www.findlaw.com.au/news/default.asp?task=read&amp;id=23585&amp;site=LE" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findlaw.com.au/news/default.asp?task=read&amp;id=23585&amp;site=LE" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>

<p>The <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Australia_68dd.html" title="Parliament of Australia">Parliament of Australia</a> is a bicameral (two-house) Parliament. It combines some of the features of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom_dcaf.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> with some features of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a>. This is because the authors of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Constitution_1fdd.html" title="Australian Constitution">Australian Constitution</a> had two objectives: to reproduce as faithfully as possible the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_system.html" title="Westminster system">Westminster system</a> of parliamentary government, while creating a federation in which there would be a division of powers between the national government and the states, regulated by a written Constitution.</p>
<p>In <i>structure</i>, the Australian Parliament resembles the United States Congress. There is a House of Representatives elected from single-member constituencies of approximately equal population, and there is a Senate consisting of an equal number of Senators from each state, regardless of population (there are also Senators representing the territories).</p>
<p>But in <i>function</i>, the Australian Parliament follows the Westminster system. The Prime Minister holds office because he can command the support of the majority of the House of Representatives, and must resign if the House passes a vote of no confidence in his administration. All ministers are members of Parliament (although the Constitution permits a person who is not currently a member of parliament to hold a ministerial portfolio for a limited period).</p>

</div>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_House_of_Representatives_e683.html" title="Australian House of Representatives">Australian House of Representatives</a> has 150 members elected from single-member constituencies (usually called <i>seats</i> or <i>electorates</i> in Australia; see <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_electorates.html" title="Australian electorates">Australian electorates</a>) for three-year terms. Voters must fill out the ballot paper by numbering all the candidates in order of their preference. Failure to number all the candidates, or an error in numbering, renders the ballot <i>informal</i> (invalid) <a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/What/voting/voting-hor.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/What/voting/voting-hor.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. The average number of candidates has tended to increase in recent years: there are frequently 10 or 12 candidates in a seat, and at the <a href="http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1990/1992-wills-by.txt" class="external text" title="http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1990/1992-wills-by.txt" rel="nofollow">Wills by-election</a> in April <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> there were 22 candidates.

A "how-to-vote" card from the Australian federal election of 2004, showing voters how to fill in the squares on the ballot paper if they wish to vote for the Liberal Party of Australia. Voters must number every square in the order of their preference to cast a valid vote.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is because of what is known as the <i>How-to-Vote Card</i>. On election day, volunteers from political parties stand outside polling places in the country, handing voters a card which advises them how to cast their vote for their respective party. Thus, if a voter wishes to vote for the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal Party</a>, they may take the Liberal How-to-Vote Card and follow its instructions. While they can lodge their vote according to their own preferences, Australian voters show a high degree of party loyalty in following their chosen party's card. It is common for voters to take How-to-Vote cards from several parties so as to not give away how they intend to vote. In recent elections parties have taken the How-to-Vote card back from the voter as they exit the polling place or have placed a container in which to leave the cards. The same card can then be handed out to further voters. How-to-Vote cards are commonly recycled following the election.</p>
<p>The challenge of numbering the ballot paper leads a certain number of voters to simply number the candidates from 1 to 10 (or whatever) straight down the ballot paper. This is called the <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_vote.html" title="Donkey vote">donkey vote</a>.</i> It gives some advantage (perhaps 1 or 2%) to the candidate at the top of the ballot paper. Before <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, candidates appeared in alphabetical order, which led to a profusion of Aaronses and Abbotts contesting elections. (The most famous example of this was the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> election, in which the Labor Senate ticket in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> consisted of candidates named Armour, <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashley.html" title="Ashley">Ashley</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Armstrong_%28Australian_politician%29_3e53.html" title="John Armstrong (Australian politician)">Armstrong</a> and Arthur: all were elected.) Since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> ballot paper order has been decided by lot.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_electoral_system.html" title="Edit section: The House Count">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The House Count</span></h3>
<p>The form of preferential voting used in the House of Representatives is known in other countries such as the USA as <i><a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant_runoff_voting.html" title="Instant runoff voting">instant runoff voting</a></i>, <i>IRV</i> or the <i>alternative ballot</i>. These terms are not used in Australia.</p>
<p>When the polls close at 6pm on election day, the votes are counted. The count is conducted by officers of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Electoral_Commission_268c.html" title="Australian Electoral Commission">Australian Electoral Commission</a>, watched by nominated volunteer observers from the political parties, called <i>scrutineers</i>. If one of the candidates has more than 50% of the vote, then she or he is declared elected. Australian politics are influenced by social and economic demographics, though the correlation between "class" and voting is not always simple <a href="http://elecpress.monash.edu.au/pnp/free/pnpv4n4/bettcl.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://elecpress.monash.edu.au/pnp/free/pnpv4n4/bettcl.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Typically, the Labor Party will poll higher in strongly working-class seats, the Liberal party in middle-class seats, and the National Party in rural seats. In a strong seat, the elected party might win up to 80% of the two-party preferred vote. In the 2004 Federal Election, the highest winning margin in a seat was 25.1% <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/results/latest.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/results/latest.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, with most seats marginal by less than 10%.</p>
<p>In the remaining seats, no single candidate will have a majority of the <i>primary votes</i> (or <i>first-preference votes</i>). A hypothetical result might look like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<table cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td>White (Democrat)</td>
<td>6,000</td>
<td>06.0%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Smith (Labor)</td>
<td>45,000</td>
<td>45.0%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jones (Liberal)</td>
<td>35,000</td>
<td>35.0%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Johnson (Green)</td>
<td>10,000</td>
<td>10.0%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Davies (Ind)</td>
<td>4,000</td>
<td>04.0%</td>
</tr>
</table>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this case, the candidate with the smallest vote, Davies, will be eliminated, and his or her <i>preferences</i> will be distributed: that is, his or her 4,000 votes will be allocated to the remaining candidates according to which candidate received the number 2 vote on their ballot papers. Suppose Davies's preferences split 50/50 between Smith and Jones. Smith would then have 47% and Jones 37%. White would then be eliminated. Suppose all of White's preferences went to Smith. Smith would then have 53% and would be declared elected. Johnson's votes would not need to be distributed.</p>
<p>Here is a real example of the operation of preferential voting in Australia, from the federal election of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>: <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Blunt_be0b.html" title="Charles Blunt">Charles Blunt</a> was the leader of the conservative <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_of_Australia_5507.html" title="National Party of Australia">National Party of Australia</a>, representing Richmond, a traditional National Party seat in northern <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a>. The intervention of the anti-nuclear campaigner, Dr <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Caldicott_af0c.html" title="Helen Caldicott">Helen Caldicott</a>, allowed the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor</a> candidate, <a href="../../../n/e/v/Neville_Newell_966c.html" title="Neville Newell">Neville Newell</a>, to win the seat despite polling only 27% of the primary vote. Note that Caldicott also had a good chance of winning the seat - if all of Gibbs' preferences had gone to her as directed on the How-to-Vote card, she would have drawn ahead of Newell and won on his preferences.</p>

<p>The <i>exhausted</i> counts correspond to votes that ought to be informal, if strictly following the rules above, but were deemed to have expressed some valid preferences. The Electoral Act has since been amended to almost eliminate exhausted votes.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_electoral_system.html" title="Edit section: Two-party majorities, swings and pendulums">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Two-party majorities, swings and pendulums</span></h3>
<p>Since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> the preferences of all candidates in House of Representatives seats have been distributed, even if this is not necessary to determine the winner of the seat. This is done to determine the percentage of the votes obtained by the winning candidate after the distribution of all preferences. This is called the <i>two-party preferred vote</i>. For example, if (in the example given above), Smith finished with 58% of the vote after the distribution of Johnson's preferences, Smith's two-party vote would be 58% and the seat would be said to have a <i>two-party majority</i> of 8%. It would therefore need a <i>two-party swing</i> of 8% to be lost to the other side of politics at the next election.</p>
<p>Once the two-party majorities in all seats are known, they can then be arranged in a table to show the order in which they would be lost in the event of an adverse swing at the next election. Such tables frequently appear in the Australian media and are called <i>election pendulums</i> or sometimes <i>Mackerras pendulums</i> after the political scientist <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Mackerras_e663.html" title="Malcolm Mackerras">Malcolm Mackerras</a>, who popularised the idea of the two-party vote in his <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> book <i>Australian General Elections</i>.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of the federal election pendulum from the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_legislative_election%2C_2001.html" title="Australian legislative election, 2001">2001 election</a>, showing some of the seats held by the Liberal-National Party coalition government, in order of their two-party majority. A seat with a small two-party majority is said to be a <i>marginal seat</i> or a <i>swinging seat</i>. A seat with a large two-party majority is said to be a <i>safe seat</i>, although "safe" seats have been known to change hands in the event of a large swing.</p>

<p>The boundaries of Australian electoral constituencies are drawn up by the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Electoral_Commission_268c.html" title="Australian Electoral Commission">Australian Electoral Commission</a>, an independent statutory authority, completely independent of political considerations. Members of Parliament and political parties may make submissions to the Commission on proposed new boundaries, but any interference with the Commission's deliberations would be a serious offence.</p>
<p>The Electoral Act requires that all seats have approximately equal numbers of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_register.html" title="Electoral register">enrolled voters</a>. When the Commission determines that population shifts within a state have caused some seats to have too many or too few voters, new boundaries are drawn up. This is called a <i>redistribution</i>. Redistributions are also held when the Commission determines (following a formula laid down in the Act) that the distribution of seats among the states and territories must be changed because some states are growing faster than others.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, for example, redistributions were held in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. South Australia lost one seat, while Queensland gained a seat. Victoria kept the same number of seats, but one seat was abolished and one new seat created.</p>

A sample ballot paper for the Senate.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Senate_6fa9.html" title="Australian Senate">Australian Senate</a> has 76 members: each of the six <a href="../../../s/t/a/States_and_territories_of_Australia_07c2.html" title="States and territories of Australia">states</a> elects 12 Senators, and the Northern Territory (NT) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) each elect two Senators. The several other Australian Territories have very small populations and are represented by Northern Territory and ACT Senators (for example, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Island_0f78.html" title="Christmas Island">Christmas Island</a> residents are represented by NT Senators, while <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jervis_Bay_Territory_c7ac.html" title="Jervis Bay Territory">Jervis Bay Territory</a> residents are represented by ACT Senators).</p>
<p>Senators for the states serve six-year terms, with half the Senators from each state being elected at each federal election. The terms of the territory Senators coincide with the duration of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The Senate is elected both proportionately and preferentially, except that each state has an equal number of seats so that the distribution of seats to states is non-proportional to the total Australian population. Thus, although within each state the seats proportionally represent the vote for that state, overall the smaller states are proportionally stronger in representation for their population compared to larger states.</p>
<p>In each state, political parties which are registered with the Electoral Commission present lists of candidates, which appear as a group on the Senate ballot paper. Independents and members of unregistered parties can also nominate, but they cannot appear on ballot paper as a group.</p>
<p>Voters can vote for the Senate in one of two ways. They can number all the candidates, as they would with a House of Representatives ballot: but since there may be 50 or 60 candidates on the ballot paper, few voters do this. This is called <i>below the line voting</i>. Or they can simply write "1" in a box indicating which party list for which they wish to vote. This is called <i>above the line voting</i>. Over 95% of voters cast their votes above the line.</p>

<p>The form of preferential voting used in the Senate is technically known as the <i><a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_transferable_vote.html" title="Single transferable vote">single transferable vote</a></i> or <i>STV</i>. This term is not used in Australia.</p>
<p>The system for counting Senate votes is very complicated, and a final result is sometimes not known for several weeks. When the Senate vote is counted, a <i>quota</i> for election is determined. This is the number of valid votes cast, divided by the number of Senators to be elected plus one.</p>
<p>For example, here is the Senate result for the state of New South Wales from the 1998 federal election. For greater clarity the votes cast for 50 minor party and independent candidates have been excluded.</p>
<p>The quota for election was 3,755,725 divided by seven, or 536,533.</p>

<p>In this table, the Group number allocated to each list is shown at right. Below that is the number of quotas polled by each list. Thus, "Q:2.7073" next to the Labor Party list indicates that the Labor candidates between them polled 2.7073 quotas.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the leading Labor and Liberal candidates, Hutchins and Heffernan, polled more than the quota. They were therefore elected on the first count. Their <i>surplus votes</i> were then distributed. The surplus is the candidate's vote minus the quota. Hutchins's surplus was thus 1,446,231 minus 536,533, or 909,698. These votes were distributed to whichever candidates received the no 2 votes on Hutchins's ballots.</p>

<p>It will be seen that virtually all of Hutchins's surplus votes went to Faulkner, the second candidate on the Labor ticket, and he was then elected. This is because all those voters who voted for the Labor party "above the line" had their second preferences <i>automatically allocated</i> to the second Labor candidate. All parties lodge a copy of their How-to-Vote Card with the Electoral Commission, and the Commission follows this card in allocating the preferences of those who vote "above the line." If a voter wished to vote, for example, Hutchins 1 and Heffernan 2, they would need to vote "below the line" by numbering each of the 69 candidates.</p>
<p>In the third count, Heffernan's surplus was distributed and these votes elected Tierney. Faulkner's surplus was then distributed, but these were insufficient to elect Forshaw. Likewise, Tierney's surplus was insufficient to elect McDonald.</p>
<p>After this stage of the count, the remaining candidates in contention (that is, the leading candidates in the major party tickets) were in the following position:</p>

<p>Sutton was then eliminated. 80% of Sutton's preferences went to Ridgeway, giving Ridgeway more votes than McDonald. McDonald was then eliminated, and 93% of his preferences went to Ridgeway, thus giving him a quota and the fifth Senate seat. Ridgeway's surplus was then distributed, and 96% of his votes went to Forshaw, thus giving him a quota and the sixth seat. Oldfield was the last remaining unsuccessful candidate.</p>
<p>A final point needs to be explained. It was noted above that when a candidate polls more votes than the quota, their suplus vote is distributed to other candidates. Thus, in the example given above, Hutchins's surplus was 909,698, or 1,446,231 (his primary vote) minus 536,533 (the quota). It may be asked: <i>which</i> 909,698 of Hutchins's 1,446,231 primary votes are distributed? Are they chosen at random from among his votes? In fact they are all distributed, but at less than their full value. Since 909,698 is 62.9% of 1,446,231, each of Hutchins's votes is transferred to other candidates as 62.9% of a vote: each vote is said to have a <i>transfer value</i> of 0.629. This avoids any possibility of an unrepresentative sample of his votes being transferred. After each count the candidate's <i>progressive total</i> is rounded down to the nearest whole number. This means that a small number of votes are <i>lost by fractionation</i> in the final count.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_electoral_system.html" title="Edit section: Double Dissolutions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Double Dissolutions</span></h2>
<p>Under the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Constitution_1fdd.html" title="Australian Constitution">Australian Constitution</a>, the House of Representatives and the Senate have equal legislative powers, except that appropriations (money) bills must originate in the House of Representatives. This means that a government can be seriously frustrated by a Senate majority determined to reject its legislation.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, section 57 of the Constitution allows the government to call a <i>double dissolution</i> election: an election in which the whole House of Representatives and the whole Senate are re-elected.</p>
<p>Section 57 provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>If the House of Representatives passes any proposed law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, and if after an interval of three months the House of Representatives, in the same or the next session, again passes the proposed law with or without any amendments which have been made, suggested, or agreed to by the Senate, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, the Governor-General may dissolve the Senate and the House of Representatives simultaneously.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 57 also provides that if after a double dissolution, the Senate again rejects the bill or bills which were the subject of the dissolution, the government may convene a <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint_Sitting%2C_Australian_parliament%2C_1974_dfcc.html" title="Joint Sitting, Australian parliament, 1974">joint sitting</a> of the two Houses to consider the bill or bills.</p>
<p>There were double dissolution elections in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>. Only after the 1974 double dissolution was a <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint_Sitting%2C_Australian_parliament%2C_1974_dfcc.html" title="Joint Sitting, Australian parliament, 1974">joint sitting</a> held. In one other case (the 1987 <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hawke_e803.html" title="Bob Hawke">Hawke</a> government) the government was returned without a Senate majority, but Hawke decided not to proceed with the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_Card_f3f5.html" title="Australia Card">Australia Card</a> bill which had been the trigger for the double dissolution and election. The 1951 <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Menzies_62a5.html" title="Robert Menzies">Menzies</a> government won a majority in both Houses, making a joint sitting unnecessary; while in the other three cases (the 1914 <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Cook_cc97.html" title="Joseph Cook">Cook</a> government, the 1975 <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gough_Whitlam_3876.html" title="Gough Whitlam">Whitlam</a> government and the 1983 <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Fraser_2bbe.html" title="Malcolm Fraser">Fraser</a> government) the government was defeated at the election.</p>
<p>To preserve the balance of power between the two Houses in a joint sitting, Section 24 of the Constitution provides that the number of members of House of Representatives shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of Senators. This is known as the "nexus clause." An attempt to remove it from the Constitution was defeated at a <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_referendum%2C_1967_%28Parliament%29_f578.html" title="Australian referendum, 1967 (Parliament)">referendum in 1967</a>.</p>

<p>Candidates for either House must formally nominate with the Electoral Commission. The signature of the Registered Officer of a party registered under the Electoral Act is required for a party-endorsed candidate. A registered party must have at least 500 members. Fifty signatures of eligible voters are required for an independent candidate. A deposit of $350 is required for a candidate for the House, and $700 for a candidate for the Senate; this deposit is refunded if the candidate or group gains 4% of the first preference votes. To receive public funding, a party or candidate must receive at least 4% of the vote. <a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/how/political_disclosures/handbooks/political_parties/page04.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/how/political_disclosures/handbooks/political_parties/page04.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
