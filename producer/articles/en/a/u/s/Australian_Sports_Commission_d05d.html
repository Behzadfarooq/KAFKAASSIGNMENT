<p>Although it is commonly believed that the Australian Government's initial involvement in sport was prompted by the country's poor performance at the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_Summer_Olympics_81ce.html" title="1976 Summer Olympics">1976 Montreal Olympic Games</a> in which Australia failed to win a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_medal.html" title="Gold medal">gold medal</a> (regarded as a severe national embarrassment in Australia), the Government actually began initial investigations into its potential role in sport in 1973. It was at this time that the Government commissioned Professor John Bloomfield to prepare a sports plan for the country. His report, "The Role, Scope and Development of Recreation in Australia", was based on studies of sports institutes in Europe and their success in developing elite athletes. Bloomfield suggested to the Government that it should establish a national institute of sport similar to those operating in European countries.</p>
<p>Following receipt of the report, the Minister for Tourism and Recreation, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Stewart_5cd5.html" title="Frank Stewart">Frank Stewart</a>, appointed a study group (chaired by Dr Allan Coles to report on the feasibility of establishing a sports institute in Australia. The Coles Report was released in 1975 and recommended the establishment of the institute.</p>
<p>Although the recommendation to establish the institute was made in 1975, it was not until 1981 that the institute was established. The delay in establishing the institute is commonly considered to be a combination of poor support for Australian sport following the 1976 Montreal Olympics and the uneasiness between the Australian Olympic Federation (now the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Olympic_Committee_7cf4.html" title="Australian Olympic Committee">Australian Olympic Committee</a>) and the Government. This uneasiness was caused over the Federation ignoring the Government's request to boycott the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_Summer_Olympics_f7d0.html" title="1980 Summer Olympics">1980 Moscow Olympic Games</a> because of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia's</a> invasion of <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>.</p>
<p>The Bloomfield and Coles reports, however, were not lost on Bob Ellicott, the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. Buoyed by the concept of a national sports institute during a trip to <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and keen to bridge the gap between government and sport, in 1980 Ellicott and his staff offered the Coles Report as a model plan for Australia. The plan would allow athletes to train and develop in Australia rather than be forced overseas. Ellicott's vision was well received and on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_Day_1503.html" title="Australia Day">Australia Day</a>, 26 January 1981, the AIS was officially opened by Prime Minister <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Fraser_2bbe.html" title="Malcolm Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a>. Renowned swim coach, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Talbot_0004.html" title="Don Talbot">Don Talbot</a> was appointed as the Institute's first Director.</p>

<p>With the Institute established, the Commonwealth Government had begun its involvement in Australian sport.</p>
<p>In August 1987 the government formalised their decision to rationalise federal assistance to Australian sport and the AIS merged with the Australian Sports Commission, which was to be the agency responsible for general sports participation as well as high performance sport.</p>
