<dd>Excellent idea! That is, both the recent anti-smoking laws and the idea of plugging them into an article are excellent ideas! (POV warning! POV warning!) I'm assuming that there's nothing beyond the "Legal issues" section of <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco_smoking.html" title="Tobacco smoking">Tobacco smoking</a> in Wikipedia at the moment? I guess it just needs a good name (I would suggest making it smoking specific, if we get a Health in Australia article up then smoking can get a paragraph and a link in that), then a link added to <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco_smoking.html" title="Tobacco smoking">Tobacco smoking</a>. —<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 04:15, Oct 12, 2004 (UTC)

<p>Now that Adam's set up lists for the new lower and upper house, we now have (IMO sensible) naming conventions for them.

<dl>
<dd>Maybe list the first elected, and mention the second one to the right. Or list them both in the same row of the table. (What I'm getting at, is don't have both of them in the table at separate locations - otherwise someone scanning down the list for a certain electorate will find one of them, but may not go on looking for the other)! -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 00:02, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<p>Sportspeople this time. Once again, thought I'd put this up here. I'll leave it here for a few days in case anyone's interested, and then sort it into one of the subpages. Some of these may have articles; some may need to be disambiguated, and as they're sports articles, there's every chance that if they do exist, they're lousy. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 12:41, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Just a quick update on my <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipality_of_Strathfield_edd3.html" title="Municipality of Strathfield">Municipality of Strathfield</a> article I've been working on: I'd say it's about 25% done. I've got lots more history, I've added a state electoral boundaries map and included information about the geography of the municipality. I've yet to get a map that shows the area that the LGA itself covers, however I should do this soon. I've also added one table from the Census on breakdown of religion in the LGA. I'll be adding more tables soon. After this I'm going to create a Strathfield, New South Wales (suburb) article that details local landmarks (need to get some pictures!) and give information about the local schools, etc.</p>
<p>Any comments for the main LGA article however?</p>

<dd>Just added nominies and a bit more information on the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Recording_Industry_Association_Music_Awards_of_2004_8cea.html" title="Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards of 2004">Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards of 2004</a>, and am planning to use same format to add previous years. But I agree with Chuq - it certainly would make more sense, to just have them as say 'ARIA Music Awards of 2004' at most. To be honest, although I knew ARIA should for something - I had no idea it was 'Australian Recording Industry Association', and I don't think many others will know or even really care that this is the full name. Instead of having to have alot of redirects, I don't see why we just cant have 'ARIA Music Awards of 2004', 'ARIA Music Awards of 2003', etc, etc - <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimm_dodd_8f23.html" title="User:Jimm dodd">Jimm dodd</a> 02:39, Oct 28, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I agree too. Normally, I'd suggest using the full name, but it's so long and no one ever uses it, so in this case, I think it makes sense to just use "ARIA Music Awards of ****".

<p>I promise to write a brief (based on their official website) for one ACTU union per day. My only condition: some other wikipedian needs to find me five non-ACTU affiliated unions, five unregistered unions, and a list of unions which are and aren't ALP affiliated.<a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 05:14, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Update: One union a day is going okay. However, I've just come across an excellent resource www.atua.org.au, the trade unions archive reference list, which has an excellent list of Employer and Employee associations which have been parties to awards (ie registered industrial organisations). Basically, this means that there are alot more entries about unions to enter than we previously thought. The official union sites give a good (but mixed, and untrustworthy as <a href="../../../a/p/e/APESMA_c08d.html" title="APESMA">APESMA</a> shows) background. ATUA ought to provide historical and ancestral info. But all in all, need more resources. One union a day ought to get it all bulked up though. Add to this the fact that ATUA will let us make employer group stubs. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 03:58, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>And, just so we don't give the inadvertent impression that the Australian part of the Wikipedia is an exclusively lefty denizen (we're not. really. we promise...), we should also have an article for Australia's most prominent companies.

<p>Geez, what an exciting, dynamic group of companies. A bunch of domestic-market banks. A couple of merchant banks. Two ex-government telcos. Two big retailers, both of which are too fat and lazy to be globally competitive. A bunch of property developers. A media proprietor/casino operator who got rich on the government teat and has done nothing since. A few miners. A few building products manufacturers, one of whom fled the country to avoid obligations to its workers. One genuinely global media company that has rather revolting political behaviour and is anyway trying to leave as fast as it can. One genuine high-tech manufacturer - CSL. That's it.

<p>When I live in a House, I get one or two (very hopeful, very young) packs of kiddies asking for a cough up. When I live in a flat, nada. Good side: the kids are walking around (with parental supervision) asking for a free hand-out. Better side: there's only one set a night, and they don't <i>expect</i> anything. This is for both suburban Newcastle, and inner-city Sydney. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 04:46, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Its freakin taking off like nothing else in my neck of the woods (<a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurstville.html" title="Hurstville">Hurstville</a>) before two years ago id never seen it, now suddenly EVERYONE is doing it. I was at a party last night (just a random piss-up, rather than a halloween party), and when some brats turned up trick or treating we just stared at them till they left. Damned american traditions, oh well that is what comes of living in the 52nd state. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_bellman_55cf.html" title="User:The bellman">The bellman</a> 01:43, 2004 Nov 1 (UTC)</p>
<p>Trick or Treating doesn't seem to have taken off – but what self-respecting Aussie wouldn't take on another excuse to get pissed in a field in the middle of the night with bonfires and half-dressed females? Halloween <i>per se</i> hasn't really been big in Australia except as the occasioanal commercial gimmick for costumes, candy and US TV specials. Perhaps conservative Christian origins of Australia, that weren't ousted by a freedom embracing consitution, is the main reason behind this?--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 01:58, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, the US is an awful lot more conservative and Christian by nature than Oz (remember which was founded by convicts, and which was founded by Puritans?) I think that halloween is starting to get a bit more penetration here thanks to the influx of American culture - we've been trick-or-treated over the last two years, which has never happened previously. It's fair to say that it's not a generally celebrated thing, though. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 09:48, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Members of State Parliament</span></h2>
<p>I've been making an attempt to write seperate articles on a few more seperate parliaments over the last couple of days, so we now have <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Legislative_Council_c522.html" title="Victorian Legislative Council">Victorian Legislative Council</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Legislative_Assembly_3aa3.html" title="New South Wales Legislative Assembly">New South Wales Legislative Assembly</a>, on top of my earlier <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Legislative_Assembly_90e6.html" title="Victorian Legislative Assembly">Victorian Legislative Assembly</a> and Chuq's <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmanian_House_of_Assembly_ef55.html" title="Tasmanian House of Assembly">Tasmanian House of Assembly</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmanian_Legislative_Council_a632.html" title="Tasmanian Legislative Council">Tasmanian Legislative Council</a>. All of them have matching lists of MPs - and this is where some assistance would really come in handy (although if anyone wants to write parliament articles and member lists for other states, I'll be eternally grateful).</p>
<p>We have articles on four members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, two members of the Victorian Legislative Council, two members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, two members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, and one member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council. We don't even have articles on the NSW Opposition Leader, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Brogden_aeac.html" title="John Brogden">John Brogden</a>, or the Tasmanian Opposition Leader, <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rene_Hidding_9e4e.html" title="Rene Hidding">Rene Hidding</a>. It'd be really nice to see some of these people getting articles. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:13, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
