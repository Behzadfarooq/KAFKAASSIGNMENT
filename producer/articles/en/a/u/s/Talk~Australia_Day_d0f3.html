<p>I've added links to the federal and State Australia Day pages. (Note that the States and Territories are listed in the conventional order, rather than alphabetically.)</p>
<p>I looked for some decent critical links. The one I've put here could be better (it's from Indymedia so it's just a little strident), but does address most of the usual criticisms. Might also be material for expanding the critical section. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 10:30, Jan 30, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>There still doesn't seem to be enough history of Australia Day in the article. There is a lot more history regarding the change of date, the reason for January 26, and the recent changes to make all states and territories celebrate it on the same day. I also disagree with the 'Criticisms' section - I think that more and more Australians are realizing the importance of Australia Day and this can be seen in the number of celebrations held around the country. I think the important part of Australia Day is that Australians celebrate <i>being</i> Australian by <i>doing</i> Australian things - what they believe is Australian, and celebrating the Australian way of life. I think we can make this article more informative if there are more facts and truths about the day.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I agree that the history of Australia Day could be expanded upon. It is the oldest public holiday in Australia, even if it wasn't celebrated in every state on the one day until 1994. The article dosen't even mention the fact the holiday used to be called 'foundation' day.</p>
<p>I must say this - the debate about changing the date of Australia Day does seem to be a minority preoccupation. I've seen more than one opinion poll on this subject - one a few years ago showed fully 77% of people preferred no change.</p>
<p>It is probably fair to say that the Australian public dosen't embrace their 'national' day like the people of other nations do theirs. However I don't think the date or the time of year has much to do with that. True patriotism is just in shorter supply in Australia. Compare the behaviour of the crowds attending the last Davis Cup finals in Spain and Australia and you will discover what I mean. (The central chair umpire had to tell the Spanish crowd to shut up after nearly every point their country won.)</p>
<p>Be that as it may, since the massive bicentenary celebrations in 1988 (which included a reenactment of the voyage from England to Australia by the First Fleet) public particpiation in Australia Day events has grown in each succesive year. Six million Australians turn out on Australia Day annually.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that it is most unlikely agreement will be ever be reached on a alternative date.</p>
<hr />
<p>If we are going to have that shit about invasion day on this page why don't we include an image of some tall ships from the massive Australia Day celebration in 1988? Why exactly is it that we can have an Australia Day page that discusses a walk over Sydney Harbour Bridge yet I can't even learn about the reenactmment of the First Fleet's voyage in '87-'88.</p>
<p>This article is well below wikipedia's standard. Australia Day has a past as well as a present - Australia Day is criticised by somme at the mmoment but these elites will move on to another topic in time. Australia's oldest public holiday will weather the storm. If you read this page as it is you might get the misleading idea that Australia Day is in immentent danger of being moved from January 26th.</p>
<p>In fact what is stated above is true - six million Australians do turn up to Australia Day celebrations annually. A tiny number go to aboriginal demostrations and this apparently makes them feel better so good luck to them, but really, this dissent gets more air time then it is worth.</p>
<p>p.s. I've heard the NSW police estimated that only 100,000 people walked over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. We might want to check that figure out. But what does it really matter anyway?</p>
<p>Not long ago in Australia a governmment agency - the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Comisssion (ATSIC) - was abolished. Separate elected representation for 'Indigenous' people also went down the gurgler with it and it is very difficult to see a future Prime Minister wanting to bring it back. Some radical black activists used to call ATSIC 'our governmment' and had the idea in their heads that it was the first step towards a separate black parliamment and and an aboriginal state like native Canadians have. How wrong these radical activists were!</p>
<p>Political correctness is clearly comming to a thudding halt in Australia. Aboriginies are just going to have to accept the fact that they are just an ethnic minority within the Australian state. Those people who walked over the bridge are just going to have to accept this fact too.</p>
<p>Six out of ten aboriginies are in a relationship with a non-aboriginie so an awful lot of blacks are signalling their approval of the arrival of Europeans into Australia. That's an extraordinary rate of 'marrying out'.</p>
<hr />
<p>Note for non Australians reading the above; Australia is probably the world's only country where elite is a term of abuse - it implies that the target hold's opinions at variance with the prime minister. Shame.</p>
<p>That said, I do agree with the above author in one respect - the history wars/black armband/white blindfold/invasion day discussion is not the central theme of Australia day for most Australians.</p>
<p>Perhaps it deserves its own page, referenced from this one?</p>
<hr />
<p>"Australian day is the best, and everyone should love it!" I think this comment is non-neutral, highly opinionated, and should be removed. It probably does not follow Wikipedia's standards either.</p>
<p>I would also like to respond to the comments posted two posts before mine (as of the time I am posting). I think it is silly to presume that just because an aboriginal marries/cohabits with a white person that it means that he is willing to accept historical oppression.</p>
<p>You said: "Political correctness is clearly comming [stet] to a thudding halt in Australia. Aboriginies [stet] are just going to have to accept the fact that they are just an ethnic minority within the Australian state."</p>
<p>Sounds eerily similar to the attitude of many white Americans prior to the Civil Rights Era here in the States (and still today, though usually through more covert measures). By your reasoning, your group should have more rights simply because your group is bigger. Anybody who does not like it should just shut up. Then you brush off the opposing view by saying they are trying to be "politically correct." Let's not forget that various totalitarian regimes have used this same kind of thinking to manipulate millions of otherwise clear-headed people into slaughtering many innocents. Thank God for freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Ideally, "politically correct" should have a positive meaning, as it reflects a society that keeps altruism and respect of fellow man high on the list of its priorities. Case in point: I'll take a politically correct Australia or America of today over a politically correct Nazi Germany of a few decades ago.</p>

Please add my name as an Australian who is vaguely embarrassed at most of the views above. While yes, most Australian don't care about Australia Day one way or another, except as a public holiday, there are a sizeable portion of Australians who understand that we as a nation should be ashamed of the way we destroyed a culture and took their land. I would ask the editors who frequent this page to keep an eye out for those who want to remove all statements about the awareness that some Australians at least have for the harm we inflicted. <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESad_mouse_6053.html" title="User:Sad mouse">Sad mouse</a> 03:14, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The point that some people often seem to overlook is that when they say things like <i>"we as a nation did bad things to the indigenous population"</i>, they exclude the indigenous people from the nation. The indigenous people are just as much part of the nation as everybody else. If they're talking about the British colonists and their descendants who did the bad stuff, that's no better since they're really saying the nation is what the British made it and the indigenous people were just bystanders and victims. It's time to stop this guilt-laden and divisive "we did this to them" stuff, and start using language that includes ALL Australians in "the Australian nation". There is no "us" and them" in a unified nation. We're all "US". <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 07:37, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does the "Australia Day Eve celebraton" image REALLY need to be in this article?

<li>PS The current reference to an Aboriginal Sign being stolen on Australia Day is <i>non sequitur</i> with regards barbeques and pool parties being an outpouring of national sentiment which is considered racist by some critics ...

<dd>I would say that nationalist sentiment would be an accurate description about the feelings that Australia Day brings about in people.

<p>My problem with the statement is that I don't see how nationalistic sentiment can be directly linked with racism. Nationalism and patriotism mean love for ones country, not ones ethnic or racial group. 58.84.208.31 12:24, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Daniel, I am not saying that the controversy-causing flag-flying is not "nationalist", I am questioning whether there really is a "great outpouring" of this sentiment, especially when as you say a lot of it was in reaction to the reported ban, not simply a response to Australia Day. On top of that, even if this really is as big as you suggest recently, it hasn't been going on long enough to say it "usually" happens!</dd>
<dd>As for the anon's comments, I think the point is that much of the "nationalist sentiment" that Daniel refers to has been associated (fairly or unfairly) with racism by critics. This doesn't mean that nationalism is being <i>directly</i> linked with racism, but even if it were, that wouldn't be the issue for us. We can report on any notable criticism made, even if we think the links made are invalid. The main problem is still the fact that it is unverified and weaselly. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 17:40, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ever since I began editing this page I have been met with criticism and rebuke for my attempts to offer a balanced argument on the topic of criticisms of Australia Day. While the original wording of the section was not mine, I attempted to work with what was there. Every time I made a change to either back something up or to make things appear either more truthful and not so one-sided, I have been refused. The fact that the reference to a research paper concerned with Genocide in Australia was deemed not relevant to the reasons why Aborigines and their supporters deem Australia Day as worthy of criticism seems to prove that Australia is in a state of denial over historic facts, and the citizens of this country are willing to accept the glossed over fairy tale that right-wing politicians believe we should all swallow without question. Since this page appears to accept only a one-sided point of view, I will not attempt to edit this page in the future, due to the narrow-mindedness of those that would ignore history over arrogant pride. <a href="../../../z/i/m/User%7EZimirk_f5c9.html" title="User:Zimirk">Daniel Zimirk</a> 12:10, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think this has anythign to do with denying historic fact, it is about using this page for soapboxing. The issue of genocide in Australia is indeed an important issue (although it is important to write about it from a neutral point of view), but the paper you linked to does not mention Australia Day at all and is only tangentially relevant, and not a source for anything contained in the article, particularly once the reference to genocide had been removed. Similarly, a report about "Invasion Day" and people stealing a protest sign about Australia day is not a source for criticism of general nationalist sentiment as racist. The problem seems to be that your links don't seem to actually be connected to the text. The next question is whether the word genocide is included. I tend to think that the issues could be presented openly without having to have the inevitable arguments over that word. These issues should be covered in other articles on Wikipedia, but for this one it would be better to focus on the facts concerning Australian Day in particular, giving links to the articles where the historical issues are covered. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 12:43, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Indeed although some of your references have been nonsensical in terms of the connection to Australia Day almost everyone has been nice in terms of pointing that out. These have not been attacks but requests to write encyclopedically towards the article on Australia Day. This is <b>(the same request that is generally or overtly made for every article on Wiki)</b> - which judging by your profile and other outputs you are otherwise able to do.

<p>It does not communicate what it means to be an Australian on Australia day at all well. Needs to be simplified for one. Sorry day stuff is most certainly not 1/4 of what Australia day is about. A single point and a link to a seperate entry, please. What about the concept of mateship and of giving everyone a fair go? What about the outback and country australia. What about the national anthem and the alternative national anthem (Aussies know what I mean). There needs to be some attempt to convey to an outsider what it means to be australian - an attempt to convey australian culture, and this includes aboriginal culture. The article needs to be more positive, it is a celebration day afterall.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, this article should be neutral, whether the day is a celebration or not. More importantly, it is an article about the day and it's celebrations, not about "what it means to be Australian" in general. Including more info on celebrations would be good, but the fact is that for better or worse, Australians haven't historically made a big deal out of Australia Day. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 16:07, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Australia Day is not just about the big celebrations on the day. It also about what individuals get up to on the day and what the day means to australians. If it means very little then that needs mentioning also with references. I have a vague idea that historically it has not been celebrated with gusto but I would like to see some proof. With 500,000 at the Perth celebrations last year I'd say it means something to most people at the moment.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Yes the article should be neutral, but not at the expense of distorting reality. This article sacrifices truth in the name of polititical correctness. Someone reading this entry in its current form 100yrs from now would get the impression that the aboriginal protest celebration Invasion Day was a big part of the identity of the day. This is not the reality and this article has been hi-jacked by a protest entry. It should be under a heading of "Recent Developments" perhaps, because that is what it is, and have a link to a separate page dedicated to it, because it is a separate issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I'm also not sure mentioning the Big Day Out is neutral. That's a youth event ie specific to a certain group of australians. Should we be mentioning it and ommitting the RSL Bingo Australia Day Extravaganza? To me it is an indication very few older people contribute to Wikipedia because they're not net savvy. A weakness of the concept of Wikipedia perhaps. User:b1_ March 7, 2007</li>

<dd>You're right that it's not just about big celebrations, but obviously they are the ones that have the most written about them, and so they get written about first. It's not anything to do with political correctness. The fact is that the day has been a day of protest for some groups since the 1930s at least. It's not a recent development, and it doesn't belong on a separate page, because it really is about the nature of the day. To say it is a separate issue is to completely misunderstand not only the protests, but history as well (after all, you mixed it up with Sorry Day). I don't think the article suggests the protest events are a huge part of the day in general, but if it does distort anything, it is only because the information on celebrations is so short, and the answer is to expand that. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 11:02, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The Big Day Out is in some ways similar to the protest events in that it is important to certain groups. In fact, most of Australia Day events are like this to some extent. The neutral approach is describe all the ones that invovle significant numbers of people. If you have <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">sources</a> for the Bingo event (is this a national thing, just in Ballina, or...?), then add it. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 11:02, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>
<ul>
<li>I think there is a misunderstanding here. For me the average Australian is not celebrating the landing of the British Fleet (Australian don't like the British - Australians are decended from the convicts locked up in the hull of the ships that followed the first fleet), nor are we celebrating, indirectly, Federation and the gaining of the independence from the British like the Americans might celebrate Independence Day because there was no war preceding it and hence little associated feeling is attached to it. What the average Australian is celebrating is being Australian, and reflecting on what that means. There is a communal sense of pride, general flag waving and acknowledgement of how lucky we are to be living in a wealthy, tolerant, free, generous, safe land of plenty. We give thanks for how lucky we are and are encouraged to get out among fellow Australians to celebrate our good fortune. This is far removed from Invasion Day and the message it is trying to put out, that Aborigines were almost wiped out by the British, and have been oppressed ever since by Australians. The two are linked by its historical context but that's as far as it goes with regard the meaning of the day for most Australians. Hence why I say they are separate, meaning it deserves a mention and a link but not a paragraph. The protestors of course want it to be one and the same issue. That rather than feel pride and community on the day, Australians should feel shame and guilt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The article just comes across as a little amateurish to me when comparing it to, say, the Wikipedia entry on "Australia" or the one on "Independence Day" which seem more polished. To be fair it's most likely just a case of 'not finished yet' though, which is why we're here.</li>

<dd>The day originates as anniversary, and so celebrates that anniversary. Different people and groups throughout history have attached different messages to this anniversary. The fact that they can be quite different does not mean that they are separate issues. Of course it is natural that the day develops into a general celebration of Australia as a country and it's institutions which in many ways trace their history back to that day. However, I think you will find that the Australia Day as "being Australia, and reflecting on what that means" view, together with the "general flag waving" and so on, without reference to the anniversary, is a much more recent development than the Aboriginal protests. Remember that this article is not only about how Australia Day is celebrated now, but also about its history. It is also not about what you think the average Australian is celebrating ("For me, the average Australian..."). There isn't any "average Australian", and the article isn't even about only what "most Australians" think. Minority views are separate views on the same issue (including what it means to be Australian, and whether some actually are lucky to be so), whether they are saying that there isn't much to celebrate or that it isn't a good day to celebrate it. A good article puts all the views together, in context. You are right that this isn't a very good article, but I don't think that removing any material is the way to make it better. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 13:04, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Have there really been organised rallys by aboriginals, on Australia Day, between 1938 and 1988? I can't say I have heard of them. Have we got any links for reference? I referred to Invasion Day as a recent development because I had only first heard of it in 2005. I was aware of various protests back to 1988. As far as I know the title "Invasion Day" is recent. I have no doubt aborigines have felt disenfranchised every year since 1788 but have aboriginal Australia Day protests been ongoing back to the 1930s?</li>

<li>The problem with the article is that it is not conveying the majority view - what Australia Day means to most people in Australia today. It's fine to include minority views but where's the majority view (and for that matter, where's the other minority views of, for example, ethnic Australians and how they celebrate the day)? Here's a detailed and fully referenced article on the day that communicates well where we're at: <a href="http://www.australiaday.com.au/studentresources/history.aspx" class="external free" title="http://www.australiaday.com.au/studentresources/history.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.australiaday.com.au/studentresources/history.aspx</a> The last paragraph before chronology sums it up pretty well. I thought the article was an interesting read. A nice summary of the evolution of the meaning of the day to Australians through the centuries.</li>

<dd>I'm not really sure what difference it makes whether protest were called "Invasion Day" or "Day of Mourning" or whatever else. They aren't a recent development, whether the names are or not. I don't know much about the years between 1938 and 1988, as they didn't attract as much attention, but the tent embassy in Canberra started on Australia Day 1972. An Aboriginal boycott is recorded even earlier in 1888.</dd>
<dd>As you say, the problems with the article are mainly missing information. The solution is to add the information. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">Be bold</a> and do it yourself (but log in first!) The article you give is quite a good source, as you say, although as a publication of the Australia Day Council, it is worth toning down the promotional side of it in some places. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 17:51, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
