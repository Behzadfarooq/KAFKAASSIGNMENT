<p>There are many major problems with this article. Is a "sound bite" delivered to the media by a polititian a firm basis for a wikipedia article about an item of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_cuisine.html" title="Australian cuisine">Australian cuisine</a>?</p>
<p>Furthermore the article seems to be a collection of minor commercial trivia about culinary history and contemporary food manufacturers.</p>
<p>Perhaps worse of all there's the statistic that "Australians have the world's largest consumption with an average of 12 meat pies per year". Now, 12 meat pies a year is very few pies. The consumption of sushi is probably higher than that.</p>
<p>And it seems likely that if such a thing as <i>Australian Meat Pies</i> can be meaningfully delineated in a world where pies are routinely consumed in a number of countries, well then <i>Australians</i> will surely have the highest consumption of them. I guess I am trying to say that there's a problem with the title. <i>Australian Meat Pies</i> are simply <i>Meat Pies</i> and nothing more. Overall the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pie.html" title="Pie">Pie</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pot_pie.html" title="Pot pie">Pot pie</a> articles seem to cover the essense of what this article is trying to say. There is also a separate <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four%27N_Twenty_Pie_8388.html" title="Four'N Twenty Pie">Four'N Twenty Pie</a> article so I believe something needs to be merged.</p>
<p>I agree that - perhaps less so today than in the past - commercially bought meat pies are common takeaway food in Australia and at the football and there is a cultural significance attached to that, however this muddled article does not make the point well, and this is already described in the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pie.html" title="Pie">Pie</a> article. It is almost like having an article named <i>Australian Tennis Rackets</i>. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinorEdit_0301.html" title="User:MinorEdit">MinorEdit</a> 23:50, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I disagree with you, the "Australian meat pie" is like the English Pork Pie, the American Hamburger - It does not imply that the Meat Pie is not eaten else where nor have a history in other parts of the world at various times in history. What is suggests is that in Australia the Meat Pie has a certain cultural significance – similar to the American Hamburger/English Pork Pie for example.</p>
<p>For instance, an article titled the American Hamburger would be feasible, however hamburgers originate in Europe and McDaonalds and Burger King ensure the global distribution to millions daily. However, there is still an undeniable cultural relationship between American Culture and Hamburgers. The same can be said to apply for the Meat Pie, while it is eaten in New Zealand Ireland and offcourse Britain it does not have the same cultural relationship as it does with Australian culture. Foe example, Australian Rules Football and Australian Rugby League sports venues are sponsored by and advertise For-n-Twenty Pies all over the stadiums – such is not the case in venues of British Sporting grounds. There is a question of cultural relativity here.</p>
<p>Harry De Wheeles (which I am surprised is not listed) is very famous with international visitors, particularly Americans and many consider it to be the most renowned individual Meat Pie store in the world. For example, since the Second World War no US GI or Sailor visits Sydney without a trip to Woolloomooloo for one of Harry’s Pies.</p>
<p>IMHO: I agree the page is a little messy in some areas, however, I strongly disagree that there is not a need for an individual Australian Meat Pie page.</p>
<p><br />
- I think the article needs a cleanup, but I don't think it should be removed. The 'early history of the pie' section could be erased altogether, or changed to a history of pies <i>in Australia</i>, seeing as the article itself is supposed to be about Australian pies, not just pies, for which there is already a separate article.</p>

<p>Why does this have an entry? Australian meat pies aren't any different from those found in similar Anglo countries like the UK and NZ.

<dd>I agree with above. The page seems mainly a small collection of trivia, none of which seems especially relevant. Given that there is also the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four%27N_Twenty_Pie_8388.html" title="Four'N Twenty Pie">Four'N Twenty Pie</a> page, this one seems especially redundant. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinorEdit_0301.html" title="User:MinorEdit">MinorEdit</a> June 28, 2005 09:20 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Naturally my following comments need to be judged in view of the fact that I created this article. I concede the following points: 1) Having both this article and the Four'N Twenty page is not justifiable. 2) The Australian meat pie is probably not substantially physically different to meat pies from other countries. 3) The article could be improved.</dd>

<dd>However, I believe that the Australian meat pie is special in the iconic status that it has within the Australian culture and history and therefore think it does deserve its own page as it is not really about the physical meat pie in of itself, these comments show that I have clearly failed to convey this in the article&#160;:) --<a href="../../../p/f/l/User%7EPflodo_cd2c.html" title="User:Pflodo">pflodo</a> June 28, 2005 14:01 (UTC)</dd>

I disagree, the meat pie has become known as Australia's national dish, thus the Australian Meat Pie is culturaly specific to Australia. I think it is good that there exists a wiki page on the Aussie Pie!</p>

<p>12 meat pies per year doesn't sound like that amazing of a rate of consumption to me. That's around one meat pie a month. If they love it so much, wouldn't they eat one at least every week or so? Or perhaps there are some Australians who adore meat pies and eat them all the time, and others who hate them, and the statistics are deceiving as a result...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Far as I know, the meat pie is to sport in [Australia] what the hotdog is to sport in the USA. Also the average corner shop/cafe/milk bar/cafeteria/tuck shop in [Australia] will have meat pies, pasties and sausage rolls for sale <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRudat_a0e0.html" title="User:MartinRudat">Martin Rudat</a>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinRudat_8151.html" title="User talk:MartinRudat">T</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_MartinRudat_16e4.html" title="Special:Emailuser/MartinRudat">@</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MartinRudat_e8c0.html" title="Special:Contributions/MartinRudat">C</a>) 15:13, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This statistic struck me as odd also. I don't see how it could be an accurate statistic if the rest of the article is correct. The number should be much higher for this food to be considered "iconic". Statistics of American hot dog consumption typically range from 60-70 hot dogs per year. Other statistics claim about 50 slices of pizza yearly. The only explanation I can think of, other than meat pies being less popular than implied, is that they're typically consumed only during certain months of the year. But this isn't mentioned in the article. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChachilongbow_fb9f.html" title="User:Chachilongbow">Chachilongbow</a> 01:19, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This cannot be applied to all Aussie meat pies and thus should be altered to Nutritional Value - the word Low. The study involved a select group of frozen pies and thus not all fresh meat pies can be accounted for. For example, Harry De Wheels Pies are one of the best known Aussie Pie makers and I m sure their pies cannot be assumed to be of Low Nutritional Value.</p>
<p>Just because it's a well known pie maker and the pies are of good quality and taste good doesn't mean the nutritional value is high. Pie crusts are generally made from refined white flour (lacking in fibre) and contain a large amount of saturated fat. I doubt Harry's are any different, even if the cuts of meat used are good ones. Pies, just like most other forms of fast food, are of fairly low nutritional value. I think it is a fair generalisation to make, unless you can provide specific evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>I think a cleanup of both articles is a better idea, considering that the [[<a href="../../../f/o/u/Four%27N_Twenty_Pie_8388.html" title="Four'N Twenty Pie">Four'N Twenty Pie</a> |Four'N Twenty]] company is an iconic Autsrlalian brandname, even outside Victoria. As someone points out elsewhere in this discussion, the Meat Pie is <b>the</b> Australian food, and the major brands producing it are, on our own little island as important as the Cola and Hamburger brands are in the US. Should we merge Pepsi and Coca-Cola into the Cola article?</p>
<p>As for the idea of merging the article with <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pot_pie.html" title="Pot pie">Pot pie</a>, the food described bears little or no reselmblance to an Australian meat pie, which has a flakey top but a shortcrust or flatbread style dough used to form the body of the pie. Also the traditional Australian Pie has a filling of meat and gravy, rather than a stew. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Law_9021.html" title="User:Alex Law">Alex Law</a> 05:04, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bleeding 'eck! OK, this is getting silly. The ie Floater is not an Australian food, it is eaten by those funny people in South Australia (that being wit, or something halfway like it). Australia is a big place, and Pie Floaters are a regional food, enjoyed almost exclusively by the million or so people of <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide%2C_Australia_43e8.html" title="Adelaide, Australia">Adelaide</a> (and they are most welcome to them, ICK!). It doesn't belong in the main article.

<dd>Hmm, even with <i>The Age</i> reference, 12 still seems to be an awfully low number.

<dd>If the phrase is "<i>Australians</i> eat...", then you'd think it would have been a survey of all Australians, of whom there would be a proportion who do not eat meat pies at all or only rarely, bringing the number down. It isn't a high number but check out any large food court at lunchtime, or scan of a strip of takeaway stores and clearly pies are in for a lot of competition. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 19:58, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are <b>huge</b> cultural areas within Australia who would <b>never</b> eat a meat pie. Try finding a Halal meat pie. Try finding one in Chinatown in any of our capital cities. IMHO, Sushi and Kebabs are becoming more common-place fast food (hey, if you order right - they are even healthy). I think that is why the average is <b>only</b> 12 pies per year, many WASP-type "ocker-ozzies" (can you say "<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_terms_for_clothing_d57e.html#General" title="Australian English terms for clothing">flanny-wearing</a> <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogan.html" title="Bogan">bogan</a>?) probably eat one a day, monday-friday, for six months of the year. 11:08, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>This page contradicts the info in the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pot_pie.html" title="Pot pie">pot pie</a> article, which says that a pot pie is 'in contrast' to an Australian meat pie. If a pot pie is one baked in a foil pie 'pot' then most Australian meat pies do not match this description as they are baked in metal pie trays and then turned out when done, not served in a foil 'pot'.</p>
