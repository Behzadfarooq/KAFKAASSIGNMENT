<p>I think we should read up on the Flags act, perhaps there is a provision there we can use, but after that... I think we need to write and ask... and I think the odds of agreement will be low.</p>

<p>The book <i>Australian Flags</i> produced by the Awards and Symbols branch of the Dept of Prime Minister and Cabinet (2nd edn 1998) is explicit that the flag is copyright and may only be reproduced with the permission of Mr Thomas. I believe that means no legislation would override. I will try to take a picture of the flag flying. In the meantime, I believe this image should be deleted. We can use a current picture of the tent embassy.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 22:12, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This flag was proclaimed as a flag of Australia.

<p>As mentioned above, an Australian government publication says the flag is copyrighted to an individual and may only be reproduced within the provisions of the <i>Copyright Act</i> or with the permission of Mr Thomas. On what basis are you proposing to violate that individual's ownership and breach copyright when it has been explicitly stated to be copyright? Your interpretation of the flag as an "other" flag of Australia would give many people apoplexy and would not please the Aboriginal land rights movement either who are unlikely to want their symbols appropriated. There is only one national flag and that flag is defined in the Flags Act. Other flags are recognised by the act. Note that Thomas took the issue to court to assert his copyright in <i>Thomas v Brown and Another</i> - see <a href="http://www.copyright.org.au/pdf/acc/articles/A97n07.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.copyright.org.au/pdf/acc/articles/A97n07.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.copyright.org.au/pdf/acc/articles/A97n07.pdf</a> . It has been suggested that "You may not need direct permission to reproduce the flag if reporting news. Such use would come under the fair use provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth)." <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/message/proper/images.htm#16" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/message/proper/images.htm#16" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 00:46, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>As I have said many times before, Wikipedia is subject to <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._copyright_law_a8a6.html" title="U.S. copyright law">U.S. copyright law</a>, not <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_copyright_law.html" title="Australian copyright law">Australian copyright law</a>. U.S. copyright law has much more permissive <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> provisions than Australia does. Under U.S. fair use provisions, it would be entirely appropriate for Wikipedia to use this image to illustrate the article <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Aboriginal_flag_6c73.html" title="Australian Aboriginal flag">Australian Aboriginal flag</a>, because the article is about the flag itself. Similarly, it would be fair use to use the image in an article about <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Thomas_f3d8.html" title="Harold Thomas">Harold Thomas</a>, for the purpose of illustrating an example of his work. In general, it would not be fair use to use it anywhere else. I will update the image page. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnottygobble_bf70.html" title="User:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> | <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Talk</a> 02:58, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The signing of the free trade agreement covers the harmonisation of US and Australian copyright law. See <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/us_fta/outcomes/08_intellectual_property.html" class="external free" title="http://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/us_fta/outcomes/08_intellectual_property.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/us_fta/outcomes/08_intellectual_property.html</a> which states that the advantages of the FTA include "<i>An expeditious process that allows for copyright owners to engage with Internet Service Providers and subscribers to deal with allegedly infringing copyright material on the Internet.</i>" The suggestion therefore that the US Copyright law might have more extensive fair use provisions than Australian law seems to be a furphy. However, as I already noted above, it is believed that fair use may apply to news reporting and by extension to a wikipdia article on the flag, or as suggested by Snottygobble, on an article about Harold Thomas. It does not extend to use beyond that. At the moment it appears in 30 articles, partly because of its use in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Template%7EAustralian_Flags_8e67.html" title="Template:Australian Flags">Template:Australian Flags</a>. It probably needs to be removed from the template and any other articles. The image certainly needs to be removed from Commons which does not include fair use images.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 08:23, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for removing the flag from <a href="../../../n/o/o/Noongar.html" title="Noongar">Noongar</a>; I agree that it's use there was not fair. I didn't follow the logic of your argument re: US "fair use" v Australian "fair dealing", but I guess there's no point pursuing it since (a) we seem to generally agree on what constitutes fair use; and (b) there are comprehensive guidelines at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnottygobble_bf70.html" title="User:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> | <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Talk</a> 11:54, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

It is an Australian flag. However, the guidelines at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> are quite explicit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The material should only be used in the article namespace. They should never be used on templates (including stub templates and navigation boxes) or on user pages. They should be linked, not inlined, from talk pages when they are the topic of discussion. Because "fair use" material is not copyright infringement on Wikipedia only when used for strictly encyclopedic reasons, their use in other contexts is likely copyright infringement.</p>

<p>Ok, here is my argument for keeping this flag for fair use:</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Images" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair_use#Images</a>: <i>There are a few blanket categories of copyrighted images whose use on Wikipedia has been generally approved as likely being fair use when done in good faith.</i> The flag could be placed in either of these catagories:</p>
<p>As a <i>"Paintings and other works of visual art. For critical commentary, including images illustrative of a particular technique or school."</i> because it was originally used as "artwork" at the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aboriginal_Tent_Embassy_9810.html" title="Aboriginal Tent Embassy">Aboriginal Tent Embassy</a> (It was not an official flag then).</p>
<p>Or as a <i>"Team and corporate logos. For identification"</i> Although the Flag does not specifically represent a "Team or Corporation" it is a copyrighted work that represents a group, so I believe it is covered by this "blanket" as well. Specifically: <i>"The encyclopedic rationale for including a logo is similar to the rationale for including portraits.... The logo should be regarded as the corporate portrait. However, unlike people, where it is often possible to take a free photograph of that person, corporate logos are typically always protected by copyright and/or trademark"</i> - From <a href="../../../l/o/g/Wikipedia%7ELogos_2117.html" title="Wikipedia:Logos">Wikipedia:Logos</a> <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFosnez_378c.html" title="User:Fosnez">Fosnez</a> 13:27, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is already sufficient explanation on the image description page. The use of {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>}}, combined with Image:Australian_aboriginal_flag.png#Fair use for Australian_Aboriginal_flag, is enough. Not to mention, a flag is obviously not a work of art or a logo - I mean you could consider it a work of art, but above all, it's a flag. To mark it as a work of art would be misleading. <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 13:57, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not support the comments above by User:Fosnez. If we want to refer to emblem rather than flag, and it is the emblem that is the copyrighted image, it is by the same token the emblem that is the subject of this image on wikipedia. The addition of this image to various articles (now back on <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> is beyond the fair use guidleines. This design was the subject of a court case, we are not talking arbitrary thinking on copyright. If you want to challenge the guidelines, don't do it here but at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> . The guidelines are explicit also that the use must be justified on the image page, not the talk page. Given the lack of fair use justification on the image page for other than <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Aboriginal_Flag_64d7.html" title="Australian Aboriginal Flag">Australian Aboriginal Flag</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Australia_03ae.html" title="Flag of Australia">Flag of Australia</a>, I will remove images used elsewhere, including on the Indigenous Australians article.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 22:05, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
