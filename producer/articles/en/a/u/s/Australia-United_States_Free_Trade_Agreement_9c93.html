<p>The US first proposed a free trade agreement with Australia as far back as <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>. In more recent times, the prospect of a US-Australia FTA was raised in the 1980s by the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hawke_e803.html" title="Bob Hawke">Hawke</a> Government, and in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> US president <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> offered to begin FTA negotiations with Australia, but was turned down by <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">ALP</a> Prime Minister <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Keating_03a3.html" title="Paul Keating">Paul Keating</a> <a href="http://www.cepr.net/err/nytimesarticles/free_trade_australia.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cepr.net/err/nytimesarticles/free_trade_australia.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>It was not until early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, after the election of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> in the US and with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> in power in Australia, that a US-Australia FTA finally began to take shape. In April 2001, President Bush signalled his interest in pursuing an FTA with Australia provided “everything is on the table”. Following this, the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade_b3fc.html" title="Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade">Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</a> commissioned a private consultancy – the Centre for International Economics (CIE) – to model the economic impacts of such an agreement. Negotiations for the FTA began in April 2003 and after five rounds of negotiations held in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a>, the text was finally agreed to in February <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, and signed off on by Australian Trade Minister <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Vaile_a5c8.html" title="Mark Vaile">Mark Vaile</a> and US Trade Representative <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Zoellick_4b0a.html" title="Robert Zoellick">Robert Zoellick</a> in Washington in May 2004.</p>
<p>The FTA was ratified by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a> with the passage of the <i>United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act</i> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_3.html" title="August 3">August 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. In Australia, the agreement's implementing legislation was reluctantly passed, with amendments, by the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Senate_6fa9.html" title="Australian Senate">Senate</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">August 13</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. After some delay, the US Administration accepted the amended Australian legislation as being consistent with implementation of the agreement.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement_9c93.html" title="Edit section: Provisions of the FTA">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Provisions of the FTA</span></h2>
<p>The text of the Free Trade Agreement is divided into twenty-three sections, listed and summarized as follows:</p>
<p><a name="Establishment_of_the_Free_Trade_Area_and_Definitions" id="Establishment_of_the_Free_Trade_Area_and_Definitions"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement_9c93.html" title="Edit section: Establishment of the Free Trade Area and Definitions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Establishment of the Free Trade Area and Definitions</span></h3>
<p>This chapter lays the framework for the FTA. It states that the provisions are consistent with the relevant sections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade_3d48.html" title="General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</a> (GATT) 1994 and the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Agreement_on_Trade_in_Services_22bb.html" title="General Agreement on Trade in Services">General Agreement on Trade in Services</a> (GATS). Both GATT and GATS are documents created by <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Organization_3f67.html" title="World Trade Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO) agreements and they lay the boundaries for subsequent bilateral agreements such as the Australia-U.S. FTA.</p>
<p>The chapter also sets definitions to be used throughout the agreement in order to assure uniformity.</p>
<p><a name="National_Treatment_and_Market_Access_for_Goods" id="National_Treatment_and_Market_Access_for_Goods"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement_9c93.html" title="Edit section: National Treatment and Market Access for Goods">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">National Treatment and Market Access for Goods</span></h3>
<p>Chapter three of the FTA lays out conditions for what types of goods are subject to non-discriminatory treatment. Certain types of goods are fully applicable to the agreement immediately and some are phased in over a period of years or temporarily applicable.</p>
<p>The chapter also reminds the two countries that they must abide by the WTO rules applying what is called national treatment. <b>National treatment</b> means that each country will provide the same treatment to imported goods from the other country as if they were domestically produced goods.</p>
<p>Finally, the chapter established a <b>Committee on Trade in Goods</b> with the purpose of providing arbitration for each country to "raise issues of concern in relation to tariffs, non-tariff measures, rules of origin and customs administration."</p>
<p><a name="Agriculture" id="Agriculture"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement_9c93.html" title="Edit section: Agriculture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">Agriculture</a></span></h3>
<p>The agriculture section of the agreement outlines the system for eliminating most tariffs for agriculture products being traded between the two countries. It also agrees to eliminate <a href="../../../e/x/p/Export_subsidies.html" title="Export subsidies">export subsidies</a> when the good in question is being exported to one of the two party countries.</p>
<p>Special tariff rate quotas are part of the agreement. These quotas allow Australian producers to export increasing amounts of these products free of duty to the United States during the tariff elimination period. The following agricultural products are designated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Beef</li>
<li>Dairy</li>
<li>Tobacco</li>
<li>Cotton</li>
<li>Peanuts</li>
<li>Avocadoes</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The quota systems vary for the different products and are outlined, in detail, in this section.</p>
<p>The section also sets up a <b>Committee on Agriculture</b> with the purpose of providing "a formal opportunity for Australia and the United States to discuss a wide range of agricultural issues relevant to the Agreement, including trade promotion activities; barriers to trade; and consultation on the range of export competition issues."</p>
<p>Finally, the two countries have committed to working with the WTO on a multilateral scale to eliminate export subsidies to other WTO member countries.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement_9c93.html" title="Edit section: Textiles and Apparel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../t/e/x/Textiles.html" title="Textiles">Textiles</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apparel.html" title="Apparel">Apparel</a></span></h3>
<p>Chapter four deals with the trade of texiles and apparel between the two party countries. The bulk of this section outlines the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S.-Australia_Free_Trade_Agreement_3865.html#Rules_of_Origin" title="U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement">rules of origin</a> provisions with regard to textile goods and safeguarding the domestic markets of the two countries. The agreement provides a mechanism to institute emergency action should the sudden increase in imports due to the reduction of tariffs lead to detrimental effects on the domestic industry of the importing country.</p>
<p>In addition, this section details the cooperation of <a href="../../../c/u/s/Customs_%28tax%29.html" title="Customs (tax)">Customs</a> authorities for ensuring that the rules of the agreement are carried out and outlines possible actions which can be taken if the exporting country appears to be acting in bad faith.</p>
<p><a name="Rules_of_Origin" id="Rules_of_Origin"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement_9c93.html" title="Edit section: Rules of Origin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rules of Origin</span></h3>
<p>The <b>rules of origin</b> section outlines the rules for determining the origin of the goods being traded in order to establish elegibility and also the method to determine the value of the goods traded.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the FTA, this section defines an originating good as those that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>are wholly obtained or produced entirely in the country, such as minerals extracted there, vegetable goods harvested there, and live animals born and raised there;</li>
<li>are produced in the country wholly from originating materials; or</li>
<li>are produced in the country partly from non-originating materials.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The section also outlines supporting documentation and verifications that the goods being traded are, indeed, originating in the exporting country, as defined by the agreement. The responsibility for verification of the applicable conditions is given to the importer. Denial of preferential treatment and penalties may apply if proper verification is not provided by the importer upon request made by the importing country.</p>

<p>This section outlines the requirements of the customs authorities to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>promptly publish law, regulations, guidelines and administrative rulings,</li>
<li>administer customs laws in a uniform, impartial and reasonable manner,</li>
<li>provide advance rulings on tariff classifications and rules of origin within a given period of time,</li>
<li>provide some sort of administrative body to review customs determinations,</li>
<li>cooperate with each other on all reasonable matters, especially those involving suspicion of illegal activity,</li>
<li>protect the confidentiality of information provided in cooperation with other customs authorities,</li>
<li>impose their respective penalties for violations of customs laws and regulations,</li>
<li>promptly release goods consistent with ensuring compliance with customs laws,</li>
<li>apply risk management systems to concentrate on high-risk areas and facilitate low-risk areas, and,</li>
<li>maintain expedited procedures with respect to express shipments.</li>
</ol>

<p>This section acknowledges the rights and obligations or Australia and the United States to each other with respect to combating barriers to trade. These rights and obligations were laid out by the WTO <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agreement_on_Technical_Barriers_to_Trade_c6a1.html" title="Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade">Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade</a>, which deals with standards, regulations, and conformity assessments, among other things.</p>

<p>The goal of the <b>safeguards</b> section of the agreement is to lay out an agreed upon structure to guard against severe adverse effects to each countries domestic industries during the transition period after lifting tariffs. The countries also agree to consider the exclusion from the application of global WTO safeguards imports from the other country where those imports are not a substantial cause of the injury to the domestic industry.</p>

<p>Section 10 of the FTA gives clear meaning to the phrase <b>cross-border trade in services</b> and provides suppliers with an open environment in which to conduct their business.

<p>The <b>investment</b> chapter of the FTA provides clear definitions as to what investments are covered and gives cross-border investors assurances in order to make it as safe as if they were investing in their own country. Among other things, the section prohibits each country from imposing or enforcing any of the following requirements in relation to an investment in its territory:</p>

<p>After the FTA was signed, there were initially concerns that the American <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agricultural.html" title="Agricultural">agricultural</a> sector would lobby against the agreement, due to a fear that it could interfere with the government's farm subsidies program. However, the agreement, with time limits on importation of Australian agricultural products such as <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beef.html" title="Beef">beef</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar_cane.html" title="Sugar cane">sugar cane</a> managed to allay the concerns of the American agricultural market (while greatly frustrating many Australian producers).</p>
<p>A coalition of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade unions</a> and other groups did speak out against the agreement on the basis that it would cause similar problems to those experienced by NAFTA.</p>
<p>More substantial <a href="../../../l/o/b/Lobbying.html" title="Lobbying">lobbying</a> was undertaken by American <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmaceutical.html" title="Pharmaceutical">Pharmaceutical</a> companies, who were concerned about the Australian <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme_f0e3.html" title="Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme">Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</a>.

<p>Economic theory suggests that bilateral agreements like the FTA will lead to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_creation.html" title="Trade creation">trade creation</a> between the parties directly involved, but will also cause <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_diversion.html" title="Trade diversion">trade diversion</a> from third countries, offsetting any benefits.

Partly as a result of these factors, the estimates of benefits produced by the CIE and relied on by the government were disputed by most economists who made submissions to the Senate Committees inquiring into the topic, some of whom concluded that the agreement would reduce Australia's economic welfare</p>

<p>The provisions of the FTA required Australia to offer stronger protection to American <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectual_property.html" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a>. In particular, the minimum term of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> was extended to 70 years after the author's death.

<p>Australia as a whole is heavily reliant on <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_industry.html" title="Primary industry">primary industry</a> and the main benefits of a FTA between the two countries were seen to be increased access to the large, but heavily subsidised and protected, American market by Australian producers. In particular, the rural and regional-based <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_of_Australia_5507.html" title="National Party of Australia">National Party</a> lobbied hard to have the agreement extend to the export of sugar. The eventual provisions of the agreement did not go as far as had been hoped, and as a result, some lobbyists for the sugar industry, notably independent senator <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Katter_c58a.html" title="Bob Katter">Bob Katter</a>, urged rejection of the FTA. However, many, such as <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premier_of_Queensland_a404.html" title="Premier of Queensland">Premier of Queensland</a> <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Beattie_96de.html" title="Peter Beattie">Peter Beattie</a>, still felt that the agreement was a net gain for Australian agriculture and supported ratification on that basis.</p>
<p>The Australian manufacturing sector was another problematic area. Australian labour, wage and <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_protection.html" title="Environmental protection">environmental protection</a> standards are significantly higher than those of America. The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Manufacturing_Workers_Union_4ae3.html" title="Australian Manufacturing Workers Union">Australian Manufacturing Workers Union</a> ran a high-profile campaign against the FTA on the basis that it would lead to manufacturing jobs being <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outsourcing.html" title="Outsourcing">outsourced</a> overseas.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement_9c93.html" title="Edit section: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme_f0e3.html" title="Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme">Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</a> (PBS) is a central component of the Australian <a href="../../../h/e/a/Healthcare.html" title="Healthcare">healthcare</a> system. The scheme provides reimbursement to community pharmacy for the costs of dispensing prescription medicines prescribed in accordance with the PBS Schedule, a comprehensive but closed formulary. Drugs are added to the formulary on the basis of an assessment of comaprative effectiveness and cost effectiveness compared to the therapy most likely to be replaced in practice. The result is that where there is no evidence of incremental benefit, a drug may not be lsited at a higher price than the comparator with the result that for many (but by no means all) drugs the prices for subsidy purposes are a great deal cheaper than in many other major markets.</p>
<p>While the scheme is very effective at keeping many drug prices low, pharmaceutical corporations in both the US and Australia are wary of the operation of the scheme, since they argue that higher drug prices are necessary to fund the costs of <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research_and_development.html" title="Research and development">research and development</a>. The American pharmaceutical companies claim that in enjoying low-cost medicines, Australians are essentially "freeriding" on the costs of research performed in the US <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1167518.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1167518.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>While companies have in particular criticised the process by which drugs are listed on the PBS, claiming that it lacks transparancy, public health advocates have claimed that calls for transparency are merely an effort by drug companies to gain greater control over the process of listing. To a large degree the existing limitations on the transparency of the process are those that have been imposed by the industry itself.</p>
<p>Disquiet about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme led to speculation that the American side would lobby heavily for its abrogation as an integral component of a free trade agreement. The Government has been criticised, particularly by the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Democrats_2114.html" title="Australian Democrats">Australian Democrats</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Greens_3689.html" title="Australian Greens">Greens</a> parties, for not doing enough to safeguard the operations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which the Government has strenuously denied.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia-United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement_9c93.html" title="Edit section: Ratification of the FTA">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ratification of the FTA</span></h3>
<p>The Australian Government did not hold a majority in the Senate, and thus required the support of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_Opposition_5f85.html" title="Parliamentary Opposition">opposition</a> <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor</a> party, the Greens, Democrats, or independent senators in order to secure ratification. The Government put heavy pressure on Labor Party leader <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Latham_1e63.html" title="Mark Latham">Mark Latham</a> to secure his party's support of the agreement, knowing that Latham, as well as many members of his party, viewed the FTA as beneficial. The issue had divided the party, with some members, particularly of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Left_97d6.html" title="Socialist Left">Left</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_faction.html" title="Political faction">faction</a>, arguing that Labor should reject the agreement.</p>
<p>Latham responded unexpectedly by making Labor's support of the FTA conditional on the addition of an amendment in enabling that would allegedly safeguard the PBS <a href="http://www.alp.org.au/media/0804/20008138.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alp.org.au/media/0804/20008138.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. This effectively turned the tables on Howard: if the Government refused the amendment as unnecessary, it opened itself to claims it was not safeguarding Australian interests; if it supported the amendment, it then tacitly admitted that the original terms of the agreement were inadequate. The bill was eventually passed with both amendments.</p>
<p>Latham's amendment proposals were supported by the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Medical_Association_5fa4.html" title="Australian Medical Association">Australian Medical Association</a> but dismissed as ineffective by the Greens and Democrats, who still argued for rejection of the agreement.</p>
<p>In January 2006, it was reported that the government was considering repealing the amendments, as a result of pressure from the US pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>In the year following the agreement, Australian exports to the U.S. declined, while U.S. exports to Australia increased. This followed the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Monetary_Fund_2655.html" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>'s prediction that the Australia-United States FTA would shrink the Australian economy marginally because of the loss of trade with other countries. The IMF estimated $US5.25 billion of extra U.S. imports entering into Australia per year under the FTA, but only $US2.97 billion of extra Australian exports to the U.S. per year.<a href="http://www.tradewatchoz.org/AUSFTA/Article22.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tradewatchoz.org/AUSFTA/Article22.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> However, it remains unclear whether or not Australia's worsening trade deficit with the United States can be solely attributed to the FTA. It may have been a lagged effect of an appreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar between 2000 and 2003.</p>
<p>The FTA improved the overall U.S. trade deficit situation with Australia creating a trade surplus with Australia which rose 31.7% in the first quarter of 2005, compared to the same timeframe in 2004. U.S. exports to Australia increased 11.7% in the first quarter of 2005 to nearly $3.7 billion for the quarter. Agriculture exports to Australia were up 20%.</p>
