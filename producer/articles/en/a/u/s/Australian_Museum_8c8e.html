<p>The museum was founded on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_30.html" title="March 30">March 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/2/1827.html" title="1827">1827</a>, by <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Bathurst_3d43.html" title="Earl Bathurst">Earl Bathurst</a>, then the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies_b265.html" title="Secretary of State for the Colonies">Secretary of State for the Colonies</a>, who wrote to the Governor of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> of his intent to found a public museum, and provisions to provide £200 yearly towards its upkeep.</p>
<p>The establishment of a museum had been planned in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1821.html" title="1821">1821</a> by the Philosophical Society of Australasia, and although specimens were collected, the Society folded in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1822.html" title="1822">1822</a>. In <a href="../../../1/8/2/1826.html" title="1826">1826</a>, however, upon the arrival of <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entomologist.html" title="Entomologist">entomologist</a> and Fellow of the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linnean_Society_of_London_38e7.html" title="Linnean Society of London">Linnean Society of London</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Macleay_629b.html" title="Alexander Macleay">Alexander Macleay</a>, who, after being appointed New South Wales <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_Secretary_4106.html" title="Colonial Secretary">Colonial Secretary</a>, began lobbying for a museum.</p>

The Australian Museum, College Street,<a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first location of the museum was likely a room in the offices of the Colonial Secretary, although for the next 30 years it moved to several other locations in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney%2C_Australia_bedd.html" title="Sydney, Australia">Sydney</a>, until moving into its current location in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1849.html" title="1849">1849</a>. This handsome <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandstone.html" title="Sandstone">sandstone</a> building on the corner of College and Park Streets, opposite <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyde_Park%2C_Sydney_1d0e.html" title="Hyde Park, Sydney">Hyde Park</a>, was first opened to the public in May <a href="../../../1/8/5/1857.html" title="1857">1857</a>. It was designed by the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Government_Architect_7c1c.html" title="New South Wales Government Architect">New South Wales Colonial Architect</a> <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Barnet_2388.html" title="James Barnet">James Barnet</a>. The first chairman of the museum was William Holmes, who was appointed on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_16.html" title="June 16">June 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/2/1829.html" title="1829">1829</a>. He was accidentally shot while at <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moreton_Bay_2565.html" title="Moreton Bay">Moreton Bay</a> on assignment, in August <a href="../../../1/8/3/1831.html" title="1831">1831</a>.</p>
<p>The Museum was administered directly by the colonial government until June <a href="../../../1/8/3/1836.html" title="1836">1836</a>, until the establishment of a Committee of Superintendence of the Australian Museum and Botanical Garden. Sub-committees were established for each institution. Members of these committees were generally the ruling members of the political and scientific elite of Sydney; and scions of the Macleay served until <a href="../../../1/8/5/1853.html" title="1853">1853</a>, at which point the Committee was abolished. In that year, the government drafted the Australian Museum Act, thereby <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incorporation_%28business%29.html" title="Incorporation (business)">incorporating</a> it and establishing a <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_trustees.html" title="Board of trustees">Board of Trustees</a> consisting of 24 members. William Sharp Macleay, the former Committee chairman, continued to serve as the Chairman of this committee.</p>
<p>The first curator of the Australian Museum was well-known <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_history.html" title="Natural history">naturalist</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bennett_521d.html" title="George Bennett">George Bennett</a>, appointed in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1835.html" title="1835">1835</a>, who was the first to catalogue the Museum's collections. After his <a href="../../../1/8/4/1841.html" title="1841">1841</a> resignation, he was succeeded by Rev. W.B. Clarke until <a href="../../../1/8/4/1843.html" title="1843">1843</a>, and then by William Sheridan Wall, a longtime collector with the Museum.In these early years, collecting was the main priority of the Museum. Specimens were commonly traded with English and European institutions.</p>
<p>The scientific stature of the Museum was established under the curatorship of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerard_Krefft_9ce2.html" title="Gerard Krefft">Gerard Krefft</a>, who served until <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>, himself a well-published scientist. His successor, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Pierson_Ramsay_e096.html" title="Edward Pierson Ramsay">Edward Pierson Ramsay</a>, who served until <a href="../../../1/8/9/1894.html" title="1894">1894</a>, greatly increased the recruitment of scientific staff within the institution. The museum catalogues, first documented by Bennett, were the first scientific publications by the Museum, but with the addition of science staff, and thereby, research output, in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a> Ramsay started the <i>Records of the Australian Museum</i> a publication which continues to this day.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, the position of <i>Curator</i> was renamed <i>Director and Curator</i>, and from <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>, <i>Director</i>. In 1948, the <i>Scientific Assistants</i> (the scientific staff) were redesignated <i>Curators</i> and <i>Assistant Curators</i>. In 1983, during a period of reorganisation, the position of <i>Curator</i> was changed, becoming <i>Collection Manager</i>.</p>
<p>During the 19th century, galleries mainly included large display cases overly filled with specimins and artifacts. Displays grew to include <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diorama.html" title="Diorama">dioramas</a> showing habitat groups beginning in the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>, but otherwise, the Museum was largely unchanged during the timespan beginning with the curatorship of Robert Etheridge Jr (1895-1919), until <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, with the appointment of John Evans. Under his direction, additional buildings were built, several galleries were entirely overhauled, and a new Exhibitions department was created. The size of the education staff was also radically increased. By the end of the 1950s, all of the galleries had been completely overhauled.</p>
<p>The Museum's growth in the field of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_research.html" title="Scientific research">scientific research</a> continued with Frank Talbot, who succeeded Evans in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, and a new department of <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_science.html" title="Environmental science">Environmental Studies</a> was created in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>. The museum support society TAMS (<i>The Australian Museum Society</i>) was formed in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> the Lizard Island Research Station (LIMS), was established near <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairns%2C_Queensland_be34.html" title="Cairns, Queensland">Cairns</a>.</p>
<p>Director Des Griffin, the successor to Talbot, oversaw extensions to the original Musum building, which were completed in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. His direction saw increased cooperation with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Aborigine_5939.html" title="Australian Aborigine">Aborigines</a>, leading to new exhibitions and policies, as well as repatriations of artefacts.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, the museum established new research centres in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservation_ecology.html" title="Conservation ecology">Conservation</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiversity.html" title="Biodiversity">Biodiversity</a>, <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolutionary Research</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geodiversity.html" title="Geodiversity">Geodiversity</a>, and People and Places. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, the djamu gallery opened at <a href="../../../c/u/s/Customs_House%2C_Sydney_6aa7.html" title="Customs House, Sydney">Customs House</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_Quay_fbed.html" title="Circular Quay">Circular Quay</a>, the first major new venue for the Museum beyond College Street site. A series of exhibitions on Indigenous culture were displayed until the gallery closed at the end of 2000.</p>
<p>The current director is <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Howarth_20ce.html" title="Frank Howarth">Frank Howarth</a>.</p>
