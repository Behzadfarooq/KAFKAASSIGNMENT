<dd>Assuming the expanded name is the only use of that acronym (on wikipedia, at least), I don't think it matters which is the article and which is the redirect.

<dd>One problem is that some of these unions were really cursory "merger era" constellations, just waiting for the next deal to line up the next manufacturing industry merger. Some however, like the Amalgamated Engineering Union, were "in their own right" institutuions: problem is that these ones are the "direct" predecessors of the AMWU. I'll keep plodding with the AMWU history. When it becomes too big we can stub the history into its major sections, and spawn articles on the defunct unions.<a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 00:02, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Setting targets for ourselves</span></h2>
<p>What would you all think of setting an article target for ourselves - something like getting fifty new, non-stub articles by the end of the month? There's so many of us here now that it'd be quite achievable.</p>
<p>It'd be nice, regardless, to keep a bit of a log of new Australian-related articles. I just discovered (after I had the idea, mind you) the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_articles_%28Australia_and_New_Zealand%29_ff9a.html" title="Wikipedia:New articles (Australia and New Zealand)">Wikipedia:New articles (Australia and New Zealand)</a> page. That's been rarely updated - I think it'd be nice to ditch New Zealand, and start from scratch on our own. There's a decent example of such a list at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_articles_%28Battles%29_dde5.html" title="Wikipedia:New articles (Battles)">Wikipedia:New articles (Battles)</a>. I for one like to see what other people are writing - preferably without having to dig through edit histories in the process. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 08:46, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Or you can just write here and say you're taking it on. Everyone knows I'm doing the unions. And everyone has been really good at wikify-edits, copy-edits, style-edits and real editorial stuff. (I still hold that everyone in the TU movement knows APESMA is a <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_dog_contract.html" title="Yellow dog contract">yellow-dog union</a> but I agree that I might be NPOV on that). <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 10:23, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

Some newbe kiwi who was hovering on the sidelines of wikipedia isnt likely to join the fold for an australian notice board/CotW. Did that make any sense or am i just rambling?

<p>Opuntia stricta – imported into Australia in the 1920s for use as a natural agricultural fence and quickly became a widespread weed, rendering 40,000 km² of farming land unproductive. The Cactoblastis moth, a South American moth whose larvae eat prickly pear, was introduced in 1925 and quickly almost wiped out the infestation. This case is often cited as a "textbook" example of successful biological pest control. The same moth, introduced accidentally further north of its native range into southern North America, is causing serious damage to some native species in that area</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AFL works-in-progress</span></h2>
<p>I'm about to start adding articles for each season of the AFL/VFL competition, along the lines of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_season_2004_7af0.html" title="Australian Football League season 2004">Australian Football League season 2004</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_season_2003_2cb9.html" title="Australian Football League season 2003">Australian Football League season 2003</a>, etc. The design I'm using is here: <a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_Drafts_Australian_Football_League_season_2004_a982.html" title="User:TPK/Drafts/Australian Football League season 2004">User:TPK/Drafts/Australian Football League season 2004</a>. What I'm up in the air about at the moment is where to put the parent list of seasons. I was thinking of moving <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_Football_League_premiers_4c34.html" title="List of Australian Football League premiers">List of Australian Football League premiers</a> to List of Australian Football League seasons, keeping the premier list as is, but adding a Full season details or similar link besides each one, linking to the appropriate season article. Does that sound like a good idea?</p>
<p>Also, please check my draft: I'm considering whether to add information for each round, as well as the final scores at the end of the season that I already have. Of course, that's a hell of a lot of information (though I have all of it handy, so that's no problem); I'm just worried that it might be overkill. Either way, the final ladder, medal winners, attendances, etc are all there.</p>
<p>Lastly, I've created <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_rules_football_leagues_in_Australia_48c1.html" title="List of Australian rules football leagues in Australia">List of Australian rules football leagues in Australia</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_rules_football_leagues_outside_Australia_dc37.html" title="List of Australian rules football leagues outside Australia">List of Australian rules football leagues outside Australia</a>. I think of them as like the lists of suburbs and railway stations - some are totally local affairs, like a lot of the suburbs around, but I hope they can eventually be filled out. My other plan along these lines is to create Internationality of Australian rules football, expanding on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Rules_football_3e0a.html#Australian_rules_internationally" title="Australian Rules football">this section of the AFL article</a> - there is a hell of a lot more going on with the sport outside this country than most people realize, methinks.</p>

<dd>I was planning on doing something similar. I was keen to add round by round scores, and for the finals even a paragraph on each match might not be excessive, in my opinion. Also the pre-season competition should be documented, plus who was coaching each club for the year, and a list of notable events (eg coach sackings, players in media controversies etc - might be easier for newer years!), afl draft listing too. Of course, all that can happen gradually over time, doesn't have to be done all in one hit.</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">On club songs in articles</span></h3>
<p>I've noticed some AFL articles have club songs listed in them. Is this a copyright violation? I have a feeling it is, since the lyrics of many of them are pretty recent (especially for the sides only recently joining the league), and hence will still be copyrighted. I can't see how we can claim fair use, since we're just quoting them wholesale without any surrounding critique or discussion. I'd like someone to clarify if we can use them, because otherwise I think we should remove them. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 09:28, Nov 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Copyright or not, I don't see why the whole song should be on the site. My 2 cents is that is easier to just link to the lyrics page on the official club site. --<a href="../../../r/o/i/User%7ERoisterer_ae8b.html" title="User:Roisterer">Roisterer</a> 21:03, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Come on, they're not so long that they clutter up the articles—I think they're a good addition. <i>If</i> we can use them that is. I've also had some concerns over logos, such as the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">AFL</a> logo and all of the club emblems. I notice ShaneKing that you added most of them? Did you find anything about the copyright status? Since there is no fair-use in Australia, I'm not sure we can use these without permission.</dd>
<dd>One other thing, I wanted to add either pictures of diagrams of the club jerseys as well (besides not knowing where I'd get them all), I'm wondering whether we could use them too? (Obviously when they're in a photo of a game or something, it's not a problem, but when it's used wholesale like the songs?)

<dl>
<dd>But at least with the club songs, fair dealing only allows their use if there is some form of criticism or the like, and as there isn't any, <i>and</i> they are reprinted entirely (fair dealing only allows less-than-significant portions), I'm not so sure. I still want them in the articles, but only if we can have them. And I don't know how fair dealing applies to images; I don't think it does, does it? <small><a href="../../../t/p/k/User_talk%7ETPK_8851.html" title="User talk:TPK"><font color="black">█ <b>T</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK"><font color="black">█ <b>P</b> █ <b>K</b> █</font></a> 06:10, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</small></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bunbury Western Australia information</span></h2>
<p>I'm happy for you to use this article on Bunbury Western Australia -</p>
<p>Bunbury Western Australia</p>
<p>The first recorded mapping of what is now Koombana Bay and the eventual City of Bunbury, was in 1803 by the French explorers Nicolas Baudin and Louis de Freycinet, from their ships the Geographe and Casuarina. In 1831 there was a temporary English military settlement with the first settlers moving to the area named after Lieutenant Henry William St Pierre Bunbury in 1838. A growing port serviced the settlers and the subsequent local industries that developed.</p>
<p>The area is the traditional land of the Noongar Aboriginal people with many Noongar names and travel routes still widely used today. The Noongar (which means "man") people have occupied the south west area of Western Australia for around 38,000 years and their traditional stories tell of the Waagle (or Rainbow Serpent) giving life and sustenance to their people who in return were the caretakers of the land.</p>
<p>Enjoying a mild Mediterranean climate, the city is bordered by the Indian Ocean, Koombana Bay and Leschenault inlet and naturally enough water sports, port and harbour facilities as well as a growing seafoods industry, feature highly in the local lifestyle and economy. Bunbury's port is Australia's ninth largest port by volume and by 2020 should be rated within the nation's top five.</p>
<p>Located 175km south of Perth, the city and its neighboring suburbs have a population of 52,000 and Bunbury is one of Australia's fastest growing cities. Bunbury is the commercial hub to WA's "South West", an area that is home to the Margaret River wine region and major coal, alumina and mineral sands industries; a region that boasts around 8,000 businesses and a GDP of over $5 billion. Presently it is about a 2 hour drive from Perth to Bunbury, but this will be reduced by 30 minutes on the completion of the recently announced Bunbury Highway or Peel Deviation.</p>
<p>Bunbury is well known for its "Cappucino Strip" restaurant and café precinct and more recently the fast developing Marlston waterfront area that already includes the upmarket Vat 2 restaurant, Taffy's "live" confectionary outlet, Barbados tavern and nightclub, Jiving J's waterfront bar and eatery and "Surprise Chef" Aristos's own seafood boardwalk.</p>
<p>Thousands of years ago Bunbury was subject to lava flows which resulted in both the unique basalt rock formations on the city beach as well as the present Marlston Hill and Boulters Heights, where today some of Bunbury's most exclusive residential real estate is located. Bunbury is also home to Australia's southernmost mangroves and the world's last native Tuart forest is just south of Bunbury.</p>
<p>There are numerous property choices in the Bunbury area ranging from trendy cosmopolitan apartments to traditional suburban family homes and from beach retreats to rural or semi-rural properties.</p>
<p>There is a wide variety of attractions, with Bunbury the home of the Dolphin Discovery Centre where you can learn about and interact with wild dolphins, whilst in 2005 the city hopes to host a round of the Formula Nippon motor racing circuit. There is an indoor skate centre, ten pin bowling, cinema within the CBD area with the Bunbury Entertainment Centre alongside. Bunbury boasts a major aquatic and fitness centre with a smaller indoor pool located at Australind. You can get a good view of Bunbury and the surrounding areas from the Apex Lookout Tower at Marlston Hill or at Boulters Heights, right alongside the city centre. Our 360º night-view panorama of Bunbury is shot from the base of the Apex Lookout.</p>
<p>Bunbury is home to up to 90 bottlenose dolphins and visitors can wade in Koombana Bay while dolphins swim amongst you or you can take one of the Dolphin Discovery Centre's "Swim with the Dolphins" cruises. Bunbury is one of the few places where wild dolphins freely visit the beach and interract with humans.</p>
<p>There are 9 secondary schools in the central Bunbury area, a campus of Edith Cowan University, TAFE College, several shopping centres, sporting grounds and major private and public hospitals.</p>
<p>Shops are normally open 8.30am-5.30pm Monday to Friday and 8.30am-5.00pm Saturdays with late night shopping until 9pm on Thursday. The Eaton Fair Shopping Centre in Bunbury's north-eastern suburbs has extended trading hours 7 days a week. Banks only operate 10am - 4pm Monday through Thursday and until 5pm on Fridays, although credit and building societies normally also open on Saturday mornings. There are a host of automatic teller machines and bank agencies dotted in and around Bunbury.</p>
<p>To get around Bunbury there are ample modern taxis, a public bus transport service and more recently a tourist "tram" that will carry you about the city areas and give you an explanation of the local sites as you go. The Bunbury Visitor Centre in Carmody Street near Centrepoint Shopping Centre will also assist with additional maps and local knowledge.</p>
<p>There are several Bunbury medical practices and we have a listing of emergency medical contacts on our "Contact" page.</p>
<p>There are a number of Post Offices in the Bunbury area and postage stamps can also be purchased at local newsagencies. Postage for a standard letter, anywhere in Australia, is 50c.</p>
<p>Free to Air TV channels in Bunbury are the ABC, GWN, WIN and SBS but many homes also receive the Perth networks 7, 9 and 10. Foxtel pay TV is also available in Bunbury. The electricity supply in Bunbury, like the rest of Australia, is 240v. While you are travelling you can be updated on Bunbury and the South West region by turning to Western Tourist Radio. In the Bunbury region turn to 98.4 FM.</p>
<p>City and suburban locations in the Bunbury area include Australind, Eaton, Dalyellup, Vittoria Heights, Marlston Hill, Clifton Park, Gelorup, Mangles, Leschenault, Crosslands, Sandridge Park, Glen Padden, South Bunbury, Withers, College Grove, Carey Park, Picton, Davenport and East Bunbury. There is a full listing of Bunbury real estate in our Bunbury real estate guide.</p>
<p>The Bunbury region of Western Australia includes the areas of Harvey, Capel, Dardanup, Binningup, Myalup, Burekup, Boyanup, Peppermint Grove Beach, Stratham, Yarloop, Wokalup, Benger, Brunswick, Roelands, Leschenault and the Ferguson Valley.</p>
<p>Bunbury is now also home to a substantial expat community from the USA, Canada, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Our Bunbury real estate guide is of obvious benefit to both business migrants and the local Bunbury community alike.</p>
<p>The Noongar Story in Bunbury and the WA South West:</p>
<p>The Noongar people are the original human inhabitants of Bunbury and the South West area of Western Australia. Today, as locals try to make sense of the established Western seasons, it is worthwhile examing the traditional Noongar seasons that divided the south west's climate into 6 rather than 4 separate seasons.</p>
<p>In Noongar Aboriginal culture, Boojar (or land) is of the utmost importance. Each tribal group had their own kaleep or favoured camping locality, which held a special significence to them. The culture has a complex relationship to the land and pays respect to the seasons and the bountiful supply of food.</p>
<p>The Noongar year has six seasons, the first being from December to January. This season is called Birak where hot, easterly winds blow during the day and Noongar people used to burn sections of scrubland to force animals into the open to hunt.</p>
<p>From February to March, during Bunuru, the dry weather conditions meant Noongars moved to estuaries where fish constituted a large proportion of the seasonal diet.</p>
<p>During Djeran, in April to May, the weather was becoming cooler with winds from the south west. Fishing continued and bulbs and seeds were collected for food.</p>
<p>During the coldest season, Makuru (june to July), Noongars moved inland to hunt areas once rains had replenished inland water resources.</p>
<p>In Djilba, as the weather was becoming warmer from August to September, roots were collected and emus, possums and kangaroo were hunted.</p>
<p>In Kambarang, when rain was decreasing during October to November, families moved towards the coast where frogs, totoises and freshwater crayfish were caught.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request Feedback About Geographic Articles</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to get some opinions from the general pop. as to whether or not local areas that are not technically suburbs in their own right should be permitted on Wikipedia. +</p>
<p>I'm having a friendly difference of opinion with an experienced Wikipedian about whether <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndal.html" title="Syndal">Syndal</a> deserves its own page or not. I believe it does - Syndal has its own railway station, its own post office and is for all intensive purposes besides pure technicality, as good as a suburb. Of course its article should, and did, clearly outline that Syndal is <i>not</i> technically a suburb, but is still an area worthy of mention. Also, if Syndal is out, this then puts into question other articles such as Kmart Plaza or, to go to extremes, even possibly <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chadstone_Shopping_Centre_332a.html" title="Chadstone Shopping Centre">Chadstone Shopping Centre</a> - if there is no blanket policy, who decides what level of publicity or notability an area needs to have before becoming worthy of an article? I can guarantee you, the average American wouldn't consider <a href="../../../l/y/g/Lygon_Street%2C_Melbourne_63e7.html" title="Lygon Street, Melbourne">Lygon Street</a> to be any more or less encyclopedic than <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndal.html" title="Syndal">Syndal</a>, but many Melbourne residents may disagree.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to fully comprehend the democratic process behind Wikipedia, but on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat%27s_in%2C_what%27s_out_7f38.html#Cities" title="Wikipedia:What's in, what's out">Wikipedia:What's in, what's out#Cities</a>, "<b>Towns/locations of historic significance, regardless of present status.</b>" comes up twice as <b>In</b>, as well as "<b>All human settlements and geographic features that more than a stub could concievably be written about.</b>", but these contradict other users who feel that "<b>Small towns without other significance</b>", for example, should be left <b>Out</b>. And I'm left <b>Confused</b>!</p>
<dl>
<dd>The whole idea of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat%27s_in%2C_what%27s_out_7f38.html" title="Wikipedia:What's in, what's out">Wikipedia:What's in, what's out</a> was to express opinions, including conflicting ones. Don't the introductory paragraphs make this clear? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 05:48, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So I think an article should be left in, and another user disagrees, and yet no distinct definable Wikipedia policy, guideline, or rule can be shown by either party to settle the matter. Do we just have an edit war where the user with the most time and patience wins in the end, or is there a logical, democratic way to resolve this?</p>
<p>Would really appreciate any and all feedback on this matter, either here or on <a href="../../../v/a/e/User_talk%7EVaelor_cece.html" title="User talk:Vaelor">my talk page</a>. Thanks!</p>

<dd>The general consensus so far has been that articles on these are fine. Years ago, a bot created articles on every single locality in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, and a handful of attempts to delete these have been roundly shouted down. It's basically been the same everywhere - I don't think I've ever seen an article about a place ever deleted. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:25, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Ambi, appreciate your prompt and firm response. Any chance you might be able to point me towards any information that backs up what you're saying? Ie. a policy page, precedent, archived VfD page, talk page, or anything else that stands on Wikipedia as supporting evidence that all geographic locality pages should be kept? Also, if anybody else could please throw their two cents worth in, that would be appreciated too - failing any solid proof, I'd like a majority show of hands one way or the other if possible. =) Thanks. - <a href="../../../v/a/e/User%7EVaelor_76f9.html" title="User:Vaelor">Vaelor</a> 12:18, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's been numerous VfD discussions - one time in particular, someone (<a href="../../../e/e/q/User%7EEequor_b13d.html" title="User:Eequor">User:Eequor</a>, I believe) put all the bot articles up on VfD, but I'm not sure where that is, and we haven't been very good with archiving VfD results. It's also come up on the mailing list a fair few times. Also, even most deletionists (of which I'm one) haven't been pushing for the removal of any locality articles.</dd>

<dd>A school is (in general) a geographic locality in addition to being an educational institution. Most schools are fixed and don't move! The point I was demonstrating is there is certainly a level of granularity that people draw a line in the sand at. Maybe for some people sub-suburbs cross that, although I doubt it would be enough for a successful VfD. Personally, I wouldn't worry about VfD: write an article if you think the topic is valid, chances are if the article is half decent and it's not on something totally crazy people wont bother to list it on VfD anyway. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 13:29, Nov 14, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think there's the slightest doubt that <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndal.html" title="Syndal">Syndal</a> is an acceptable article topic. It's a real place with a real history and geography, there was even a state electorate of Syndal for a while. Who says it's not a real suburb? I assume that means it doesn't have a postcode, but that's true of lots of places. In my own area <a href="../../../r/i/p/Ripponlea.html" title="Ripponlea">Ripponlea</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Park_b39d.html" title="Middle Park">Middle Park</a>, Gardenvale and <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balaclava%2C_Victoria_7659.html" title="Balaclava, Victoria">Balaclava</a> don't have postcodes but they are real places where people live. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:01, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was <a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK">TPK</a> who said that <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndal.html" title="Syndal">Syndal</a> was not a suburb, and in that he is correct - Syndal is a locality on the border of <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Waverley_c45f.html" title="Glen Waverley">Glen Waverley</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Waverley_e03b.html" title="Mount Waverley">Mount Waverley</a>. Still, I felt that it merited its own page, and TPK disagreed, but the page was never listed on VfD - TPK simply turned the page into a disambig pointing to <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndal_railway_station%2C_Melbourne_fb77.html" title="Syndal railway station, Melbourne">Syndal railway station</a>. When I asked him what the deal was, he said that Syndal wasn't a suburb and hence he didn't feel it merited its own page. When I disagreed, he suggested I post here to get people's general opinions on the topic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I mentioned above, Syndal does have its own post office (sharing Mount Waverley's postcode, 3149) and train station, and most other amenities including schools (ie. Syndal South Primary School)... and I know a lot of people who consider Syndal to be their home who would be pretty confused to hear that it apparently doesn't exist!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm no geography expert, nor do I claim to have any knowledge about how geopolitical boundaries affect our lives, but all I know is, if I can have my mail addressed to Syndal, VIC, 3149, and receive it, then Syndal is real enough for me. What would you guys think overall if I were to revert my article on Syndal and let it stand? Would you agree that is the right thing to do in this case? - <a href="../../../v/a/e/User%7EVaelor_76f9.html" title="User:Vaelor">Vaelor</a> 15:15, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC) +</dd>

Personally I think this article's notability lies in that fact, rather than as a shopping complex that has a Coles and a Kmart and a bunch of other shops there. =) - <a href="../../../v/a/e/User%7EVaelor_76f9.html" title="User:Vaelor">Vaelor</a> 03:22, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, that's a fair point - if the only notable feature is the 24/7 trading hours, I suppose there's no reason why this can't simply be mentioned as a feature of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burwood_East_bfa3.html" title="Burwood East">Burwood East</a>'s suburb article instead. I'll happily make that change if/when the Kmart Plaza article is deleted (which it looks like will be a unanimous vote when I retract my Keep vote). It seems the majority don't consider 24/7 trading to be notable enough for a seperate article anyway, so scratch it, and render this a moot point. - <a href="../../../v/a/e/User%7EVaelor_76f9.html" title="User:Vaelor">Vaelor</a> 09:45, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd keep <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndal.html" title="Syndal">Syndal</a>.

Neither the Kmart Plaza, Burwood East nor the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chadstone_Shopping_Centre_332a.html" title="Chadstone Shopping Centre">Chadstone Shopping Centre</a> articles establish this notability IMO. <i>One of the largest</i> is too vague.

<dd>The article isn't about <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndal_railway_station%2C_Melbourne_fb77.html" title="Syndal railway station, Melbourne">Syndal railway station, Melbourne</a>, it is about the local area around the station. As for Chadstone, I believe it is the second or third largest shopping centre in this hemisphere, and not so long ago <i>was</i> the largest. Knox or Fountain Gate I think is now the largest in this country (I think a development in South Africa is now the largest in the hemisphere), but Chadstone and several other centres in Melbourne are in at least the top 10, maybe even 5, below the equator, as such, they deserve articles IMHO. <small><a href="../../../t/p/k/User_talk%7ETPK_8851.html" title="User talk:TPK"><font color="black">█ <b>T</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK"><font color="black">█ <b>P</b> █ <b>K</b> █</font></a> 07:07, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Looks like Knox is the biggest, taking over from Chadstone, although the Age article I found mentions Chadstone has a planned extension to be completed in 2004 (the article being from 2002). I don't live in Melbourne anymore, so I have no idea at all whether that happened or not. See: <a href="http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:gKosXVcwicUJ:www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/28/1038386259015.html+chadstone+shopping+centre+lettable+area+australia&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:gKosXVcwicUJ:www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/28/1038386259015.html+chadstone+shopping+centre+lettable+area+australia&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<dd>Knox is the current largest in the country, followed by Fountain Gate, Chadstone, and Southland, all in Melbourne. Chadstone's new development is still in the works and would make it the largest again. I'm not so sure of the international standing, but am certain it's still high. <small><a href="../../../t/p/k/User_talk%7ETPK_8851.html" title="User talk:TPK"><font color="black">█ <b>T</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK"><font color="black">█ <b>P</b> █ <b>K</b> █</font></a> 07:41, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Thanks for providing the more concrete info there Tom. I'll edit this in shortly so that the Chadstone article is more clear about its notability. Cheers. - <a href="../../../v/a/e/User%7EVaelor_76f9.html" title="User:Vaelor">Vaelor</a> 09:45, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Completely off-topic thought: You mean Fountain Gate is real?! Naive Sydney-sider that I am, I just assumed it was some made-up name given to the shopping mall in Kath &amp; Kim episodes - I had never realised it was actually a real place!

<dd>True. The point I was trying to make is that a suburb with a railway station is likely to be notable too. Post offices I'm not so sure, unless they have their own postcode. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 00:29, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndal.html" title="Syndal">Syndal</a> article is fine, but this one reads like it was written by the Chamber of Commerce.

<dd>Well, that would be because so far the only person who has contributed to the article has been me, and I'm a businessman. That's what makes it a stub - it's open for one or more of my esteemed Wikipedian colleagues with much more knowledge/experience than I have in non-commercial matters to improve upon in their own fields of expertise.
