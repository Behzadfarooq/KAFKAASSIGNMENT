<p>Interesting indeed. How'd it go? I'm somewhat back from my break, if only for a short time. I'm involved in an awkward legal situation which is going to demand a lot of my time shortly so I'll be taking another longer break from December until approximately March where my edits will be slowing down around here somewhat. Apologies to all for the lack of replies of late. I'm getting on top of them all now if they're still valid questions. I still keep a keen eye on this place and it's great to see the Aussie content expanding in many different directions. Gives me plenty to read even when my editing time is lacking.

<dd>Where would we start on this? It might be worth writing to the court to see if we can obtain one - I'd be happy to go down there myself and take one, but my camera sucks and is broken at the moment anyway (it died when I was taking Wikipedia photos at <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floriade%2C_Canberra_e960.html" title="Floriade, Canberra">Floriade</a>, strangely). <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 05:43, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Odds are it does exist. The question will be to know if it is an encyclopaedic topic.

<p>I notice we have recently ended up with two articles about the Australian Brumby <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brumby.html" title="Brumby">Brumby</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Brumby_e68e.html" title="Australian Brumby">Australian Brumby</a>. <i>Brumby</i> is the shorter of the two, but also more encyclopedic.

<dd>I like how the Canadians do it (yet again). They have separate lists of current ministers and secretaries at <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_of_Canada_83ed.html" title="Cabinet of Canada">Cabinet of Canada</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Canadian_Parliamentary_Secretaries_607f.html" title="List of Canadian Parliamentary Secretaries">List of Canadian Parliamentary Secretaries</a> (do we have a list of parliamentary secretaries?). But then, Canada's different: they don't really have an outer ministry. Seeing as though <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Howard_Ministry_75c1.html" title="Fourth Howard Ministry">Fourth Howard Ministry</a> is a rather obscure location, I think it might be best to note the current ministry elsewhere as well.

<dd>The problem with that is that the Canadians don't have articles for past ministries, and the current article really needs to fit in with them.

<p>Could Australian editors please comment as to whether they think the <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything_Linux_3925.html" title="Everything Linux">Everything Linux</a> article should be included in Wikipedia or nominated for deletion? Apparently it is one of the largest Linux retailers in Australia (LSL is the only other one Chuq can think of off the top of his head) and a VfD nom might get a lot of unfounded delete votes from both non-Australians and non-Linux users, as it is only really notable to Australian Linux users. Chuq suggested we run a straw poll here to get a sense of what other Australian wikipedians thought. I personally cannot think why such a retailer is notable enough for an article ...--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">User:AYArktos</a> | <a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">Talk</a> 11:04, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

I will nominate for deletion and allow the debate to continue there, perhaps resulting in modifications to Company inclusion guidelines or affirmation of those guidelines. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">User:AYArktos</a> | <a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">Talk</a> 21:20, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is stretching the definiton of "urban myth." Firstly it's rural, not urban. Secondly, an urban myth is based on anecdote and rumour, like the story about crocodiles living in the New York sewers. This story is baed on reported sightings. In that sense it's more like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. It probably belongs under Apocryphal animals or something like that. Thirdly, to be a myth something has to be known not to be true. There might in fact be pumas in the Grampians, just as there are kangaroos in the Scottish highlands. So it isn't proved to be a myth. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 08:39, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Darby Ash's proposal. Also, I can see Adam's point regarding urban myths. The reason I wrote that it was an urban myth is because that's how the story has spread - I've been told several times that a friend-of-a-friend has come face to face with the beast. And the fact that there are multiple variations of the origin of the cat also lends it to urban myth. But yes, perhaps it should be removed. And should we perhaps be discussing this on the page's talk-page? <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 12:21, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, given Indigenous Australian has been rightly recognised as the term of choice for Wikipedia content, categories should pretty much correspond. Thus all "Australian Aboriginal" and "Australian indigenous" should probably migrate to "Indigenous Australian". Whether we will need specific "Australian Aboriginal" categories (thus excluding TSI) is now the question to be asked.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 15:30, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>I've thought for a long time that the article <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Aborigine_5939.html" title="Australian Aborigine">Australian Aborigine</a> ought to be renamed <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Indigenous Australians</a>, and all references to "Aborigines" ought to be changed correspondingly. I realise that this would entail a lot of work. I also think there needs to be two separate articles, one on the indigenous peoples themselves, and one on the history of Australian government policy towards them. Plus I think the existing article needs substantial work, whatever it is called.

<dd>I don't think Ind. A. politicians should be a subcat of Ind. A. leaders. Is any Indigenous Australian who enters politics a leader? It is arguable that any leader is a "politician" in a broader sense of the word, but if we are not going to have leader as a subcat of politician, then I think they should be distinct categories with overlap. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> 09:33, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A.I. Politicians is already a subcat of A.I. Leaders. In the sense that people are not generally referred to as "politicians" until after they have been elected, I think it <b>is</b> reasonable to consider any elected person as a leader of the people who elected him/her. They have achieved a level of approval amongst their peers. If this is contentious, the solution is to drop Cat:Indigenous Australian leaders completely. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_politicians_ae10.html" title="Category:Australian politicians">Cat:Australian politicians</a> is a subcat of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_people_by_occupation_43bb.html" title="Category:Australian people by occupation">Cat:Australian people by occupation</a> which has 50 subcats, but Cat:Australian leaders is not one of them. I think this needs to be handled in several stages - let's wait until the Aust indig... cats are renamed to Indig. Aust..., then focus on the shape of the hierarchy. the ...peoples category needs to be split to separate articles about tribes from articles about individual people. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:44, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is already a subcat, but we are discussing changes, and I don't think it is appropriate. Even if any elected person is a leader, even unelected politicians are politicians. I am inclined to agree that the solution might be to drop the cat altogether. As it is at the moment, the articles in A.I.politicians are politicians who are indigenous, and the articles directly in A.I.leaders are (mostly) leaders of specifically indigenous groups. I suggested the heirarchy above because I don't see why Neville Bonner and Aden Ridgeway should necessarily be categorised as leaders, but many of the people listed as leaders could be called politicians.

<p>I'm concerned that the mass edits and renames from "Aborigine" or "Aboriginal" to "indigenous Australian" may be POV-pushing, and has certainly resulted in some clumsy language in some places. I said "may be" as I'm not sure, and would like to test the waters to see if I'm the only one with a problem with it?

<p>It's a tricky issue I agree. Any choice of name can be seen as POV, and of course in a sense it is a POV in favour of one term over another.

<p>Re <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liberal_Movement&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=25628953" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liberal_Movement&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=25628953" rel="nofollow">yr edit</a>, thanks for the diligence, but "standardizing" the Dab'g suffixes for article titles</p>
<ol>
<li>is a lousy idea bcz it forces long, distracting and potentially confusing titles on the 95% of Dab'd articles for which a short one would work fine;</li>
<li>can't work for the articles that cross domains and would thus be subject to two or more conflicting "standards" (e.g., Australian politicians notable
<ul>
<li>in other fields like writing about political science or policy matters, or acting in movies,</li>
<li>for roles in international organizations,</li>
<li>for receiving prizes,</li>
<li>for (like Pres. Carter) using public office as a stepping-stone to greatness,</li>
<li>etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>is irresponsible if you don't have a means (better than editing the URL; ask me) to find the (supposedly) non-standard existing rd-lks, so you can count them and, if still appropriate, "fix" them; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Ian_Wilson_%28politician%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Ian_Wilson_%28politician%29" rel="nofollow">the 16 IW (politician) lks</a> (mostly old) should convince you of this.</li>

<dd>I'm having a little trouble following some of the bases of your objection. Specifically,
<ol>
<li>It's two words - no more, no less - this seems to me to largely eliminate the potential for distraction. Articles on politicians are relatively common on wikipedia; for those who have common names, it's likely that we'll require nationality disambiguators (<a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Ahern_0291.html" title="Mike Ahern">Mike Ahern</a> comes to mind here). One downside of inconsistently using nationality disambiguators is that some politician articles get saddled with the "long, distracting and potentially confusing" extra bit, while others don't. More common names will require more extensive disambiguators than less common ones, which is undesirable.</li>
<li>I believe it does work for people who cross domains; <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Latham_%28Australian_jurist%29_fd75.html" title="John Latham (Australian jurist)">John Latham (Australian jurist)</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Murphy_%28Australian_politician%29_4e92.html" title="Denis Murphy (Australian politician)">Denis Murphy (Australian politician)</a> come to mind. At any rate; redirects are cheap - eg. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Latham_%28Australian_politician%29_68a2.html" title="John Latham (Australian politician)">John Latham (Australian politician)</a> already exists. If we settle on a few standard terms to use (eg. politician, author, journalist) etc, but not "Nobel-prize winner", "human rights advocate" etc, confusion is reduced.</li>
<li>I don't see how the fact that non-standard links are hard to find is a basis for not eliminating them. It's precisely *because* they're hard to find that they must be eliminated.</li>

<dd>If I understand correctly, you are only talking about standardising the form of article titles for Australian politicians whose article titles cannot be their names due to disambiguation requirements? I am in favour of a standardised form, and I think (Australian politician) is a good one. One difficulty not raised by <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">User:Jerzy</a> above is the problem of multiple Australian politicians having the same name. e.g. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Brown_%28Australian_pastoralist%29_e2de.html" title="Thomas Brown (Australian pastoralist)">Thomas Brown (Australian pastoralist)</a> (a W.A. politician) versus Thomas Brown (Australian federal politician). <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnottygobble_bf70.html" title="User:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> | <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Talk</a> 05:19, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Problems come with, for example, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Cameron_808d.html" title="Donald Cameron">Donald Cameron</a>. There are at least two Canadian politicians with that name, at least one U.S. politician, and five Australian politicians (all federal MHRs). I still have no idea how to sort that out until articles are written on all of them and we find out what exactly they were notable for, then an alternative dab phrase can be found. But in most cases, "Australian politician" works just fine. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 06:19, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no need to tack (Australian politician) onto the end where there's the middle name too.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Education-related articles</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I would appreciate some wider input on articles relating to education, namely <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higher_School_Certificate_f591.html" title="Higher School Certificate">Higher School Certificate</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Certificate_of_Education_0986.html" title="Victorian Certificate of Education">Victorian Certificate of Education</a>. Probably a few more links should be filled out from <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Certificate_of_Education_7744.html" title="Australian Certificate of Education">Australian Certificate of Education</a> too. HSC and VCE are the two biggest ones I guess, and they both seem to mostly be edited by disgruntled year 12 students. Not very <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> at all! So I would appreciate some help.

<dl>
<dd>There are hardly any sources cited for "criticisms" in either article. That's my main beef, with both.</dd>
<dd>Specifically, with VCE:
<ul>
<li>The explanation of the VCE structure is dense and hard to understand.</li>
<li>Quote from VCE: <i>It is generally easier to obtain a higher mark for SAC than for exams as a higher percentage of people are given A's and A+'s on the SAC than on the exams where the upper quartile mark is lower. The Average mark in all subjects varies but is generally around B+ for SAC and B for exams. The VCAA (Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority) most likely award students a high average mark to help them with employment (high marks look impressive) and to help reduce disappointment.</i> Hardly NPOV.</li>
<li>I don't think that "examples" of classes demonstrating "flaws" in the "statistical moderation process" are appropriate -- if anything such examples belong in an article on the statistical method in question, with a link there.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>With HSC:
<ul>
<li><i>As one teacher put it, "Our best students take high-level mathematics, physics, and chemistry, so they can get the marks they need to get into a law degree."</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>and again, unsourced opinions.</dd>
<dd>I don't know how to fix these short of just removing material, which doesn't seem like a very good fix to me, which is why I'm asking for more opinions. Please don't take offense.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Streets</span></h2>
<p>I was thinking that an article that gave a list of streets in a suburb would be really useful for Wikipedia and give all those local history buffs out there some really cool stuff to research. For instance, we could have list of streets in Strathfield and have an entry something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Redmyre Street:</b> the name originally came from the original Redmyre Estate that existed before Strathfield was proclaimed (see <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Strathfield_area_0e05.html#Birth_of_Strathfield" title="History of the Strathfield area">the birth of Strathfield</a>). The street was named by <i>such and such</i> on <i>such and such date</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I know this would be invaluable for the site, and a great source of information (I've always wondered how some streets got their names, and figure that Wikipedia would be a great place to put this information). What do people think? I think that we'd be referenced by quite a few places if we did this: right now it can be really difficult to find out how a name came about.</p>
<p>Add to this, then we could create an open map to add to articles. The possibilities are endless! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 11:40, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>As a Canberran I note that street name origins for Canberra take up half a dozen print volumes. I think if a suburb has a street name theme it is useful to metion and any historical links between the street name and the suburb would of course add value, for example naming after an early settler of the district. I think the content should be kept as part of the suburb article until worth breaking out. Transcribing from already published material at length would breach copyright but of course mentioning the existence of a publication, such as a local history, as an external reference would add value.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">User:AYArktos</a> | <a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">Talk</a> 22:04, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It has occurred to me that origins of names can be applied to many things (streets, suburbs, cities, buildings, companies, bands, albums, movies, events) that may even justify another wikimedia project in itself.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">a request for some australian peer-review</span></h2>
<p>Over the last week I've done some work on the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_gangland_killings.html" title="Melbourne gangland killings">Melbourne gangland killings</a> article. This is my first 'big-ish' article on wikipedia and so I was wondering if some local folk could have a look over it with some suggestions. I'm aware a couple of issues a) perhaps too many references and b) possibly need to move away from the list-centric format - although i'm not sure what would be more readble; and c) need a longer intro. I know theres a formal peer review process, i'd just prefer to have you lot look at it before going there. love, james <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgnte_3614.html" title="User:Agnte">Agnte</a> 23:17, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Friends, I've just returned from the launch of the new <i>Encyclopedia of Melbourne</i> <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521842344" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521842344" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I had a chance to flip through the pages (I couldn't afford a copy at $150), and can report that it would be utterly <i>invaluable</i> to Australian Wikipedians. There's a rudimentary online version, but only the 'A' entries are listed so far, though this will expand over the next two years <a href="http://www.emelbourne.net.au/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.emelbourne.net.au/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<dd>I saw this, and immediately thought of Wikipedia, too!&#160;:) Melbourne Uni has two copies on its reference shelves. Once my exams are over I can sit in the library with a laptop on one side and this (no doubt) great tome on the other. Ahh, bliss... <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 12:14, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the pointer, Cnwb. I'll have a look after exams. I've got a couple of books to which the indexes would make a great to-do list; perhaps we can work on a combined one using sources like this as well. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 13:37, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Prisoner flap</span></h2>
<p>Hello y'all, from far north of many of you. A day or so ago I came across a kerfuffle at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Australians_in_international_prisons_c3ee.html" title="Talk:List of Australians in international prisons">Talk:List of Australians in international prisons</a>. (I infer that "international" means non-Australian.) It's hard to summarize neatly, but in brief, a lot of allegations are flying around. (Also check the talk page history.) As I then wrote at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28assistance%29_e548.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (assistance)">Wikipedia: Village pump (assistance)</a>, I had no time to fix it beyond attributing some anonymous comments. Today I had a little more time but I found I had no stomach for this. I have a vague understanding that there's a lot of bad feeling in Australia over the perceived injustice of the imprisonment of various Australians outside Australia; organizations are helping the prisoners, and it's common for some examples of this kind of organization to be accused (rightly or wrongly) of political motivation (etc. etc.) -- but that's about the sum of my background knowledge. I have a strong hunch that any of a lot of level-headed Australians here could quickly distinguish between the plausible and the silly on this talk page, and thus could do a better job than I (who'd be inclined to zap a great deal of it). Thanks! <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 14:48, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have <i>zapped</i> some of the discussion and inserted the talkpage template to remind editors (anons and others) that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_chatroom" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not usenet or a chatroom</a>.
