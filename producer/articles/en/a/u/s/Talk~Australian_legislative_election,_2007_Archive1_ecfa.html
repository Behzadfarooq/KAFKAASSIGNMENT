<p>Do we really need this page?</p>
<p>Normally, I'm in favour of having articles on events such as the next election, but most of the original research on this page is pure garbage.</p>
<p>As well as the mini-edit-war over this rubbish about the Greens being under threat, who added the line about Family First being a potential threat to the Liberals to rival One Nation? As they could only win one senator, despite being preferenced by practically everybody, and got roundly thrashed by the Greens on primary vote in (I believe) every single state, I'm finding this a little hard to believe.</p>
<p>Mark Latham will lead the ALP into the next election? Says who? He may well do so - but we shouldn't be stating this as a given, particularly considering the last week. The Liberal leadership speculation is premature, particularly as it fails to mention other likely candidates for the job.</p>
<p>About the only "facts" on this page that aren't likely to be disputed are the fall of the Democrats, which could be attributed to practically any political commentator around, and Howard's impending handover of the leadership. Everything else is at best disputable, and at worst, complete and utter rubbish. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:31, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your rewrite, Gene poole - it's a significant improvement. I'm going to delete the bit about the Greens, though. a) It's very unlikely that the preferences deals of this election will be repeated, as it got the Labor Party and the Democrats exactly what they didn't want, so we shouldn't be stating it as if it is a likely occurrence. b) If Christine Milne could get elected, as a new senator, despite all the preference dealing against her, I don't think Bob Brown, with his much higher profile, is going to have much trouble getting re-elected. As for Kerry Nettle, who knows - any assumptions there would truly be original research. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:51, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we should retain something about the potential impact of 2004-style preference deals on the Greens' - and indeed Family First's chances. At this stage we have no idea what imperatives may be driving party decision-making on the subject in 2007 - but I think it would be safe to assume that if the current government perceives the Greens as a threat to their unfettered control of the Senate they will preference every which way imaginable to maximise any perceived disadvantage. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 09:59, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only thing that I'd consider mentioning - but it's probably still too early to tell - is that Family First is very unlikely to get such a good deal again, particularly from Labor. The government may try to maximise the disadvantage of the Greens, but I don't think it's quite what Labor had in mind, and it's them who led to the Greens' bizarre situation this time around. They clearly saw the deal as a means of helping Senator Collins retain her seat, rather than helping Steve Fielding beat David Risstrom in Victoria, and Jacquie Petrusma (almost) beat Christine Milne in Tasmania. I doubt Labor would be so foolish again. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:09, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>this article is getting too speculative. i suggest that all speculation is removed and we simply leave the details of election timing etc and comment on the rest IF and when it eventuates. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 10:49, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Beazley</span></h2>
<p>Since Latham has now resigned and leadership speculation is ended, I reckon its fair to say that Beazley will lead the ALP at the next election, unless of course, he gets run over by a bus. <a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvolver_of_Borg_d229.html" title="User:Evolver of Borg">Evolver of Borg</a> 21:24, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bennelong</span></h2>
<p>Before we post POV crap like that paragraph on the page, we have to consider why the seat is a marginal. As with Brand, Beazley's seat, Bennelong is now held by a small margin. This swing occured at the last election. It was identified by Anthony Green that the main reason for the swing was due to the anti-Howard movement that built up in the electorate. Factors also notable are the standing of Andrew Wilkie as the Greens candidate. This style of swing also occured in Phillip Ruddock's seat. When Howard resigns, it is likely the anti-Howard camp will split between the Liberals and ALP with a new margin of around 57% to the Libs. <a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvolver_of_Borg_d229.html" title="User:Evolver of Borg">Evolver of Borg</a> 19:16, 7 Nov 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In reply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for describing my work here as "POV crap." In a similar charitable spirit let me describe your comments as "ignorant shit." I will retract and apologise when you do.</li>
<li>Bennelong has become a marginal seat partly through boundary changes (the seat has been moved substantially to the west), partly through demographic change on the Lower North Shore (particularly a growing Asian community) and partly through the general long-term softening of Liberal support in upper-income areas (seen across the North Shore and also in seats like Kooyong, Higgins, Boothby and Ryan) since the 1980s. I doubt Howard's personal standing is a contributor to the decline in Bennelong, in fact the reverse is probably true. Of course, the ideological tone of Howard's government has contributed to the softening of the Liberal vote in its safe seats, but that is a different issue.</li>
<li>The swing to Labor in Bennelong was not unique to that seat. Every seat on the North Shore, plus Wentworth and Cook (ie, all the safe Liberal seats in Sydney), swung to Labor. Even in 2001, Bradfield and Mackellar swung to Labor.</li>
<li>The reason Brand is marginal is quite different. It is full of "Howard battlers" and sensitive to issues like immigration and national security. That part of WA has never been safe for Labor, whereas Bennelong used to be a safe Liberal seat.</li>
<li>Wilkie did poll very well for a Green, but of the 12.3% increase in the Green vote, only 3.2% came from the Liberals. 4.4% came from the Democrats and 2.5% from Labor. In other words he largely redistributed the "left" vote rather than took votes directly from Howard.</li>
<li>Neither of us can know what will happen if Howard retires in 2007. My view is that he has built up a personal vote over 30 years and that some of this will be lost. Your view is that he has a "negative personal vote" and that the Liberal vote will recover. We will see.</li>
<li>I am reinstating my paragraph, minus the sentence about 2007.</li>

<p>I have also noticed and removed your stupid partisan swipe at Beazley. Perhaps you would like me to add "Phillip Ruddock: May retire if convicted of incest" - a perfectly true statement. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 09:46, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, in his defence, there is quite reasonable and widespread speculation that Beazley may not be leader at the next election, whereas I've not yet heard any claims about Ruddock being charged with incest. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:51, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Adam, that Beazley comment was not partisam, but just a comment on a possibility. What has it got to do with incest? <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 09:52, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am making that point that including Beazley in the "list of members who may retire," when he is the Leader of the Opposition and fully intending to fight the 2007 election, is a gratuitous partisan swipe (from an editor who is a self-declared Liberal). For the record, I have no reason to believe that Ruddock is to be charged with anything. Nevertheless, the statement that he would probably retire if he was charged with incest is a true one, which goes to prove the point that a factual statement can still be very misleading. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 10:02, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It just makes clear that there is speculation that he may be toppled as leader, and that in that case, there is a good chance that he would resign; just as if Howard steps down as leader, he is likely to resign from parliament. Considering that that's been touted as a possibility by quite a number of commentators, I don't think it's all that unreasonable to add here. And for the record, I'm a Labor supporter. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:42, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am, as we speak, sitting in the Labor whips' office in Parliament House. I talk to Caucus members all day. I can assure you that there is absolutely no speculation here that Kim will be toppled as Leader. Howard's IR bills have had a quite miraculous rallying effect on Caucus, and Kim's performances have been his best for years (not that you'd know that from reading The Age). OK, I am an ALP staffer and I am biased, but I have enough independence of judgement to know what is going on here. Of course it is true as an abstact proposition that "if Kim's leadership collapses" he might retire. But if he can be added to the "list of members who may retire" on those grounds, then I am entitled to add every member of the House, because there are, as abstract propositions, reasons why each one of them "might retire." <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 10:54, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To note something as "striking" is innappropriate on an unbiased encyclopedia, unless it is in the context of arts. "Striking" is POV language and thereby crap. I apologise for not being specific in referring to this, because that use of language is just plain bias. However, I still believe that work of Anthony Green qualifies him better to analyze the situation in Bennelong, although I would be very interested to see you joining in the ABC's election coverage (I'm being very serious).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will restate my position once again however, supported Xtra and Ambi. If we are going to remove Beazley, we have to remove Howard. Howard wants to stay in his job as much as Beazley wants to stay in his. This page is speculative, it doesn't necessarily have to be accurate. I also do not see why you keep removing John Andersohn. You seem to have a thing about removing my edits on him&#160;:). Nonetheless, tell me why you believe that Anderson won't be resigning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, saying Brand was never safe when there was previously a 60% margin is incorrect. Maybe it is more prone to swing, but safe in my and many other people's definition is when there is a margin getting above 8%.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm going to reinsert Anderson and remove Howard. I'm going to go further and speculate that he's going to retire at a bi-election, and therefore doesn't belong on the page. And please stop taking personal swipes at me Adam, you only succeed in creating unnecessary tension. And if you see Senator Gavin Marshall, tell him one of the boys he met at Bialik College says hi. <a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvolver_of_Borg_d229.html" title="User:Evolver of Borg">Evolver of Borg</a> 10:31, 8 Nov 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I hardly see how that is partisan when we are speculating. Accusing someone of this is highly offensive Adam. I personally hope that for the ALP's sake, Beazley does get the chance to resign if a better leadership choice becomes available. However, I did not put this point in the article. <a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvolver_of_Borg_d229.html" title="User:Evolver of Borg">Evolver of Borg</a> 10:36, 8 Nov 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Borg, your concern for the ALP's welfare is very touching. For my part, I hope that Howard sinks into a pit of burning sulphur. I think we had both better abstain from editing this article and leave it to people who don't have obvious partisan loyalties. I didn't intentionally delete Anderson from the list. My personal opinion is that all three of them will run again, but as you say this is all speculation. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 00:20, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree. Everyone has some kind of loyalty. We just need to try to keep them in check. However, snideness and rudeness don't help resolve conflicts. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 00:51, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, but nevertheless, when we have a situation like this, where I am an ALP member and Borg is a Liberal member and we are arguing about a political article, it is probably better if we both back off and leave it to someone else. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 01:14, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Adam, and with Xtra's second point. Lets leave it there. <a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvolver_of_Borg_d229.html" title="User:Evolver of Borg">Evolver of Borg</a> 20:09, 8 Nov 2005 (UTC)</p>
