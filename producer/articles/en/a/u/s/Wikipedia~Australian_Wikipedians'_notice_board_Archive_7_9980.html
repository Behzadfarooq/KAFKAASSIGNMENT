<p>It's my view that we need, as part of the Australian history series, a specific entry on the history, and process, of Federation. Trouble is, I'm not really sure what such an article should include. Does anyone have any ideas? <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 09:06, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Firstly, the article should really be at <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_federation.html" title="Australian federation">Australian federation</a>, instead of <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation_of_Australia_75d3.html" title="Federation of Australia">Federation of Australia</a>. The latter makes it sound as if it's about Australia itself. It shouldn't be too hard to get a good article on federation - starting off with the early ideological rumblings and causes, through the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenterfield_Oration_7439.html" title="Tenterfield Oration">Tenterfield Oration</a> and the official conferences, then the people's conferences and referendums, and finally, to January 1, 1901. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 12:18, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was hoping that we could add to this new report that has been released in Western Australia. I have lots of links to information, so we really have no excuse not to be able to work on this article. Not only this, but it's a high visibility article (especially in WA) and the media may pick it up. You have a good chance of having your work quoted, cited, mentioned by the media!

<dd>I've never heard of turpentine gum before, but research on google seems to suggest that turpintine gum, is rosin. In normal converstaion aussies call turpentine oil 'turps'. Also turpentine is the name of a native tree (not a pine - hard wood semi-rainforest) which i doubt trups oil can be got from, so i dont know why it has the same name (and its not a gum tree either, so turpentine gum cant refer to it). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_bellman_55cf.html" title="User:The bellman">The bellman</a> 11:01, 2004 Dec 17 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Added Australian Suburb Mapping template</span></h2>
<p>Folks, I've added a new Australian mapping template based on the stuff the Americans have been doing (and which will soon be added to all or most of the RamBot articles). This template only needs a longitude and a latitude, and you can see an example of it <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales_3916.html#External_links" title="Summer Hill, New South Wales">here</a>. The template itself is <a href="../../../m/a/p/Template%7EMapit-AUS-suburbscale_7585.html" title="Template:Mapit-AUS-suburbscale">Template:Mapit-AUS-suburbscale</a>, the discussions the Americans have had about their new templates are <a href="../../../m/a/p/Template_talk%7EMapit-US-streetscale_4a21.html" title="Template talk:Mapit-US-streetscale">here</a>, and an example of it being added to an American town is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Loyal%2C_Wisconsin&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=8531676" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Loyal%2C_Wisconsin&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=8531676" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Please feel free to expand / update / modify the template as you see fit. It would be great to see all Australian Suburb articles include this type of information (which is why I thought it better to mention it here, rather than just on the Sydney Suburbs WikiProject page).

<dd>Nice idea, but I would prefer the Ausway maps over Sensis/Mapquest (the latter of which has no data at high zoom levels in Australia), at least for Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, (which are all mapped in Melway style) - nothing better frankly&#160;:P<br />

What though is the difference between the 'street map' and the 'suburb map' - they're the same thing, just with different websites and different starting zooms. Seems redundant to me.

<dd>Fair enough! This is the benefit of using a template, that it can easily be changed once in one place ... I've ditched MapQuest (couldn't zoom in very far), added Ausway (as "Street Map 1"), but I've kept Sensis (because it lets you zoom in much further than Ausway does), and renamed it "Street Map 2". Yes, I know, two street maps, which is redundant, but they've both got good points, so they're complementary. The Americans also include a topographic map, but I don't know if such a thing is available for Australia. If it is, or if there are any other resources that should be included in this template, please feel free to add them in.

<dd>A quick update: You can get an approximate longitude and latitude for just about all Australian suburbs from <a href="http://www.spatialonline.com.au/gisca02/rural_health/townname.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.spatialonline.com.au/gisca02/rural_health/townname.pdf" rel="nofollow">this list</a>.

<dd>I think its okay the way it is. There is only two articles called Lake Albert, and the African one was just lucky to get in first. As long as the dismabiguation notice at the top of that page remains, and only two same-named articles exist I don't feel an additional disambig page is needed.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 04:44, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm happy with Xtra's disambiguation. Stan said Google is a good source to identify which one is most significant. It was interesting that Yahoo put 3 each of Africa, South Australia and NSW in the top 12 (plus one each for Alaska and Ontario and two for Albert Park Lake in the top 20), while Google was much stronger biased towards Africa. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 11:03, 2005 Jan 10 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The two boats mentioned in the Murray article (<i>Mary Ann</i> and <i>Lady Augusta</i>) were paddle-steamers. I don't know why I linked "steamboat" instead -- possibly because, as you say, the "paddle steamer" article is so US-centric. The "steamboat" and "paddle steamer" discussion pages suggest the two articles shouldn't be merged (but that duplicate content should be reduced) so I think Australian stuff should be added to "paddle steamer". If there is going to be a lot of content, or if there were Australian river boats that weren't paddle-steamers, perhaps a separate river transport in Australia article would be worthwhile. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff/Gsl</a> 21:30, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The trouble with creating new articles is that they tend to overlap (some <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_River_9586.html#Mythology" title="Murray River">Murray River#Mythology</a> could also fit in <a href="../../../n/g/a/Ngarrindjeri.html" title="Ngarrindjeri">Ngarrindjeri</a>). It might be better to just expand the <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_River_9586.html#River_transport" title="Murray River">Murray River#River transport</a> section, and try to add some Australian content to <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddle_steamer.html" title="Paddle steamer">Paddle steamers</a>. I guess a new article would be useful if we wanted to try to list all existing commercial boats or something. There have been significant non-steam vessels such as the <i>Murray River Queen</i>, too. I'd also like to add a bit about transport <b>across</b> the river as well as <b>along</b> it - bridges are significant, and the public road ferries/punts are quite unusual I believe. Transport should also mention contemporary houseboats and tourist rides. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 00:08, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)

<dd>I don't understand your mythology comment. This myth, in various forms is common to more than just one langauge group.

<dd>I didn't contribute any of the mythology stuff. I wrote some of "river transport" and "water storage". As far as overlapping articles goes, I don't see that as a problem. If there's an article on Australian river transport (covering, say, the Murray, Darling, Murrumbidgee, etc.) then there is nothing wrong with summarising the Murray-relevant material in the Murray River article. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff/Gsl</a> 09:50, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it was me.

<dd>Fine - again sorry for not attributing the work to you the first time. I won't be copying any of it across, and won't be adding anything about dreamtime or mythology, as I don't feel I know it myself.

<dd>In my opinion, these should have been deleted and redirected to a page that describes the Australia postcode format, with an off-site link to the actual postcode index.

<dd>My inspiration is the remarkably readable Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0195540220</a>). Compulsory reading. One suggestion I have is that someone might do a bit of an examination of the good things that have developed in Wikipedia re other jurisdictions (esp the USA. I haven't looked at the UK materials), and come back with a list of, say, three or four things that are worth emulating. Now that some people have starting pecking away at descriptions of the courts and what they do, we might as well finish that off. After that, I'd be most keen to see a systematic burst on the big High Court cases. I am very new to WP, but am a relatively senior legal practitioner, so I think I can best assist by helping people find relevant content. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilasM_d3bf.html" title="User:SilasM">SilasM</a> 05:31, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>a list of important High Court cases (per the American example), to give us something to work from - note that we can follow the template established by the US Supreme Court WikiProject, or at least use it as an example.
