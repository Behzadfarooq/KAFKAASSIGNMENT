<dl>
<dd>I can't make head or tail of the discussion below, and previous discussion have been removed. So here's my summary:</dd>
</dl>
<p>There's been an edit war going on about whether this should be Soccer or Football. The page has been protected by <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">User:Woohookitty</a> at 06:33, February 22, 2006.</p>
<p>There are competing arguments in favour of football and soccer being used. To me there appear to be four options:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Australia National Football Team</b> with Australia National Soccer Team and Socceroos redirecting to it.</li>
<li><b>Australia National Soccer Team</b> with Australia National Football Team and Socceroos redirecting to it.</li>
<li><b>Socceroos</b> with Australia National Football Team and Socceroos redirecting to it.</li>
<li><b>Australia National Soccer Team</b> with Socceroos redirecting to it. <b>Australia National Football Team</b> as a disambiguation page including links to national teams in other football codes.</li>
</ol>
<p>So can we just put this up for a simple vote? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShermozle_a420.html" title="User:Shermozle">Shermozle</a> 17:34, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There has already been a vote.

<dd>What difference does it make to the people who contribute to rugby league and Vic rules articles? The fact that All Australian Team and Australian Int. Rules team are listed on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_national_football_team_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Australian national football team (disambiguation)">Australian national football team (disambiguation)</a> but there is no disambig page for <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_national_Australian_rules_football_team_1a23.html" title="Australian national Australian rules football team">Australian national Australian rules football team</a> shows that it is in fact the <s>stubborn</s> Vic Rules contributors who are spending to much time trying to protect "their" word from usage by other sports. Honestly, how does the name changing from soccer to football to reflect official and growing common usage affect the quality of the article or that of NRL and AFL articles? We are writing an encyclopedia here, I for one do not feel the need to alert people who <i>may</i> have the same viewpoint as me to take "concerted action" against those meddling with something outside their apparent preferred subject area. You did not "mention" the matter, you posted notices on several selected pages in an attempt to draw people towards your argument. If they were interested, it'd be on their watchlist, or they'd at least have seen the page some time whilst this argument has been going on.

<dd>In what way does it help Wikipedia to insist the page be called soccer? The page was at football for almost a full year until Grant65 decided to move it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia_national_soccer_team&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia_national_soccer_team&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Nov 29 2005</a>, incredibly marking the move as "minor". There was no problem previously, and anyone strange enough to lookup 'football' when searching for the Kangaroos, Wallabies, the Vic Rules "team" or the Int Rules team was easily redirected using the disambig page. I don't see the reason you are so threatened that sokkah is "hijacking" the word football. Again, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_national_Australian_rules_football_team_1a23.html" title="Australian national Australian rules football team">Australian national Australian rules football team</a> does not exist, which seems to indicate what the agenda behind your constant arguments is - and quite simply, it's not helping Wikipedia in any way, or the people that use it. The team is called the <b>Australian national football team</b> and that's where the majority of people searching an encyclopedia would expect to find it. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbinomonkey_5636.html" title="User:Albinomonkey">AlbinoMonkey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/l/b/User_talk%7EAlbinomonkey_dabe.html" title="User talk:Albinomonkey">Talk</a>)</sup> 06:09, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It does not exist heh? I don't have any hidden agenda and i cannot understand why you are resorting to put downs and calling australian rules football vic rules. I played soccer for three years and just like over 90% of Australians, I know the game as soccer. I do not know what your problem is. You are making a mountain out of a molehill. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 06:43, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, no, I don't know anyone who calls it the "Australi<b>a</b>" national football <i>or</i> soccer team".&#160;:o) Using the noun rather than the adjectival form of the name is a rather strange Wikipedia convention, and not one this little bunfight is going to make any difference to. As for what way it helps Wikipedia to call the page soccer — it stops <i>Australians</i> from doing a double-take at the page title. Most of us call the round-ball game "soccer", whatever the FFA would like — if we didn't, there'd've been no bloody point to all those "Football, but <i>not as you know it</i>" ads, would there? "Australia national football team" redirects to the soccer page right now <i>anyway</i>, so overseas fans of what SBS calls the World Game aren't going to get confused. Oh, and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_Australian_rules_football_team_ee91.html" title="Australia national Australian rules football team">Australia national Australian rules football team</a> does exist, it's just that people use the official name <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Australian_Team_d362.html" title="All Australian Team">All Australian Team</a> because it's shorter.

<dd>No, "football" was the original name for <i>all</i> these games. It was only when rules started getting written down and disambiguation from other codes was needed that the different names sprang up — notice that most of them are geographic (Aussie rules, American football, Rugby is a town in England, etc etc etc). ～<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_c0d4.html" title="User:Jiminy Krikkitt"><b>J</b></a>.<b><a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_f78f.html" title="User talk:Jiminy Krikkitt">K</a></b>. 08:59, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have read that football meant a game played on foot, as opposed to on horseback, if that makes any difference.

<p>I've reverted to redirect to soccer, because the expression "national football team" is mainly used to refer to the soccer team. Even though football can mean any code, "national football team" almost always means the soccer team. Even if we ignored that, we already have a <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_national_football_team_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Australian national football team (disambiguation)">perfectly good disambig page</a> which we could redirect to. This page should not be a copy of it. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 11:26, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The point is that we don't need a separate disambig page. I'm sure both rugby league and Australian rules supporters refer to their respective "national team" or "Australian team". If they don't say "national football team" it's because they are generally talking to people who know which game they're referring to. Another reason for this to be a disambig page is to educate non-Australians about usage of the word "football" in Australia. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 11:49, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Put it another way: if you're up for fixing all the links here that refer to the soccer team (and there are more than 100), <i>and</i> keeping a frequent eye on the Whatlinkshere page for the foreseeable future — which would be necessary to catch all the soccer-fan editors from overseas putting links to the Socceroos' page in the usual Wikipedia format without checking — then go ahead and put the disambig here. I don't think it's worth the bother when we can put <i>one</i> disambig link on top of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_soccer_team.html" title="Australia national soccer team">Australia national soccer team</a>, getting most people where they want to go in one click and everyone else in two or three. ～<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_c0d4.html" title="User:Jiminy Krikkitt"><b>J</b></a>.<b><a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_f78f.html" title="User talk:Jiminy Krikkitt">K</a></b>. 08:55, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Even if someone is good enough to volunteer to do that work, the fact that it would need to be done is evidence that common usage is that "national football team" means Socceroos. This doesn't mean we shouldn't use the word Soccer in Australian articles about soccer, even including articles about the Socceroos, just that the expression "national football team" means soccer.

<dd>No, It's evidence that people writing soccer articles are unaware of Australian usage of "football" and are using the standard format for the names of articles about national soccer teams. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 09:27, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, fixing the redirects with a bot is a relatively simple technical matter. This is not going to go away. I have tried to point out to the "soccer = football" fraternity how this is at odds with normal usage in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>, and how controversial and provocative it is to redirect this to the Socceroos article. Eventually, I think, weight of numbers from the other football codes will take their course. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 05:00, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So 99%+ plus of those links will be pointing to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_%28soccer%29_team.html" title="Australia national football (soccer) team">Australia national football (soccer) team</a> - yet you don't think it should be redirected there? I have no issue with general articles with "football" in the name being a disambiguation page. However when talking about a "national football team" there is no question that <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_%28soccer%29_team.html" title="Australia national football (soccer) team">Australia national football (soccer) team</a> is going to be the intended target for 99%+ of links. (And if you disagree, then that implies the redirects can not be fixed with a bot, in which case my original point still stands.) -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 06:58, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Talk about circular logic. It is beside the point which articles point here at the moment, because (1) those links relating to the Socceroos have been created by people who don't know and/or don't care about the normal/popular/common usage of "football" in Australia and; (2) you are presuming that internal linkage is all that counts, when many peple will come to this page as a result of Google searches. You cannot verify that the Socceroos are going to be the intended target for people using search terms like "Australia football national team", and it is logical that followers of rugby league or Australian rules would also search for their respective national teams using terms like "Australiian national football team". If the problem can't be solved with a bot, then it shows that the Socceroos are not the only possible objective of someone coming to this page. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 07:48, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>202.47, put it this way, "football + national + team" = ARL Kangaroos to most people in NSW and Queensland.

<dd>Why would we want to not let people find what they are most likely looking for, going by both internal and external statistics? The All Australian team and International rules football in general are nothing more than marketing gimmicks to make it look like Australian has a national AFL team (which it clearly doesn't)? And as far as rugby union/rugby league goes, it would be rugby, or rugby league, or rugby union, or Wallabies, or Kangaroos, or Bledisloe Cup match, or Tri-Series match or anything like that before you would ever hear it be called "football" on the news or in a newspaper.</dd>
<dd>This has been gone over again and again (I'm sure you (Grant) have read <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Football_in_Australia%29_c250.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Football in Australia)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Football in Australia)</a> and its talk page) and whenever it comes up it is some anon IP out of nowhere or one of Rugby 666's socks causing trouble. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 12:57, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not going to waste time arguing with your bald and toothless contradictions, because I think the history of Australian English will have the final say. We do have "national AFL [sic] teams", however much you want to deny it, and most rugby league fans call their game "football". As for marketing gimmicks, what else is the futile attempt by the soccercrats to hijack the word "football"? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 15:30, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
