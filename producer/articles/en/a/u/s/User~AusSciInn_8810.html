<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAusSciInn_8810.html" title="Edit section: Australian Science Innovations (ASI)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Australian Science Innovations (ASI)</span></h2>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Australian Science Innovations (ASI) offers science education programs which provide students throughout the nation with opportunities to enhance their knowledge, understanding and skill in Biology, Chemistry and Physics. Our overall aim is to enhance the value that the community places on science through advancing the enthusiasm and capability of Australian science students. We do this by providing high quality extension programs for students and teachers which promote science in a positive and effective manner. A key emphasis of ASI activities is not what an individual achieves, but whether or not they have done their best in developing and realising their potential.</p>
<p>Amongst its programs, ASI is proud to have the unique responsibility of ensuring Australia’s representation at the International Biology, Chemistry and Physics Olympiads through the Australian Science Olympiads program. The Australian Science Olympiads program is supported by the Australian Government Department of Education, Science and Training and pharmeceuticals company Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme.</p>
<p>ASI is an independent, non-profit organisation that operates with the support of industry, government, schools, teachers and students throughout Australia. ASI is dependent on many individuals and organisations that give freely of their time, services and facilities.</p>
<p>ASI delivers its programs in partnership with other organizations. ASI has a long-term partnership with Rio Tinto, now focused on delivery of the Rio Tinto Big Science Competition and is supported by the Australian Government through the Department of Education, Science and Training.</p>
<p>Valued support is also received from many businesses, institutions and professional societies.</p>
<p>ASI activities seek to have every participant learn in an environment that is not only challenging but is also enjoyable and rewarding, and to acknowledge those who are involved.</p>
<p><br />
<b>History</b></p>
<p>Until 2005, ASI was known as the Australian Science Olympiads Incorporated, focused on development and delivery of Australia’s representation at the prestigious International Science Olympiads.</p>
<p>The ASO Physics Program was first established in 1987. This was followed by Chemistry in 1988 and Biology in 1992. The selection and teaching program surrounding the ASO developed at a rapid rate with the result that Australia is now placed amongst the top Western countries. Australia regularly achieves top-10 placing amongst the up to 80 nations competing in the Science Olympiads. The most rapid development of the ASO program came through a focused partnership with Rio Tinto from 1997 until 2004. As well as breaking new ground in inter-organisational relationships, this unique partnership markedly developed the capacity of the organization underlying the Olympiads program.</p>
<p>With the growth and strengthening of the organization, new opportunities became apparent to widen the organisation’s impact. This included the Australian Science Challenge, first offered in 2004 with more than 20,000 students competing and becoming the focus of the ongoing partnership with Rio Tinto as the Rio Tinto Big Science Competition in 2005.</p>
<p>2004 also saw another major project through the hosting of the 15th International Biology Olympiad and the introduction of an associated promising new program, the Biology Olympiad Online.</p>
<p>Working in partnership with the University of Queensland, Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and Griffith University, ASI took an initiating and ongoing major role in bringing the 15th International Biology Olympiad to Australia. IBO2004, as it became known, involved some 400 international visitors and almost 100 Australian staff and a budget in excess of a million Australian dollars.</p>
<p>An organising committee with a Brisbane based secretariat was established and a panel of sponsors and partners were developed including the Queensland and Australian Governments, Comalco, ENERGEX, Brisbane Airports Corporation and Telstra. The event was successfully staged on-time and on-budget to great accolades from the international and local communities.</p>
<p>In association with IBO2004, and working on a very tight timeframe and budget, ASI initiated and developed the Biology Olympiad Online – an interactive online Biology competition offered to Australian secondary school students in the lead-up to the IBO2004 event. Sponsored by ENERGEX, the project was completed in a five week timeframe and delivered to an audience of almost 7000 students, exceeding our own expectations as well as those of our sponsor. E-BIOL as it came to be known identified a new niche in the Australian educational landscape and has great promise for future development.</p>
<p>From humble beginnings and the hard work of many people, the ASI is now proud to offer several educational programs, including the original Australian Science Olympiads, and a proven capacity for developing and delivering new programs. Our programs now involve tens of thousands of students and many hundreds of teachers and schools each year.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Future</b></p>
<p>Science and technology has an important and increasing role in every aspect of our lives – be it the environment, economy or leisure activities. The key to the future for individuals, institutions, the nation, and indeed humanity, will lie with the ability to understand, utilize and develop science and technology. ASI and those that support it are committed to helping today’s students extend and realise their full potential as they become tomorrow’s citizens, leaders and achievers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAusSciInn_8810.html" title="Edit section: Our Programs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Our Programs</span></h2>
<p><b>Australian Science Olympiads</b></p>
<p>The Australian Science Olympiads program consists of three sub programs in Biology, Chemistry or Physics, each consisting of a number of levels, starting at the school level (National Qualifying Examination) and works up to a National level (Scholar Training Program) and International level (Australian Olympiad Team). Every secondary school in Australia is invited to nominate and support students for entry into the National Qualifying Examinations.</p>
<p><br />
<i>National Qualifying Examinations (NQEs)</i></p>
<p>The National Qualifying Examinations (NQEs) are the first stage of the ASO programs. An NQE is held annually for each discipline - Biology, Chemistry and Physics. The NQEs are primarily targeted at students in Year 11, however, in the past, capable students in lower levels, notably in Years 9 and 10, have achieved excellent results.</p>
<p>Each year the ASO invites every secondary school in Australia to nominate students for the NQEs. Posters and registration brochures are sent at the beginning of each year. Almost 4000 nominations are accepted annually from schools. Awards of High Distinction, Distinction, Credit or Participation are provided to all candidates from whom a script is received. The first, second and third ranked candidate in each discipline from each state and territory are acknowledged as being the Gold, Silver and Bronze State Award Winners.</p>
<p>The main emphasis of the NQEs is the understanding of fundamental concepts and problem solving skills. It is important to note that the NQEs are testing knowledge and understanding that is not necessarily covered by school curricula in each State or Territory.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Scholars</i></p>
<p>From each National Qualifying Examination, around twenty five candidates in each subject are invited to become Scholars. The Scholar Training Programs are an accelerated program of learning consisting of a series of assignments and tutorials by correspondence and a 17 day residential school in Canberra. Whilst the Scholar Training Programs primarily aim to enhance theoretical and practical knowledge and skill, they also seek to equip Scholars with vital time- management, communication and effective study skills. Scholars enjoy acceleration in their academic, career and personal development.</p>
<p>Scholars’ achievement is recognised by the presentation of certificates and medals, indicating their achievement at the highest levels of the Australian Science Olympiads.</p>
<p><br />
<i>International Science Olympiads</i></p>
<p>The International Biology, Chemistry and Physics Olympiads are independent of each other and are held annually under the auspices of UNESCO. They are regarded as the "Olympic Games for Science Students".</p>
<p>The host nation for each Olympiad varies from one year to another. More than 80 nations compete in at least one of the Olympiads. Each team in the Biology and Chemistry Olympiads has four Members with the Physics team having five. The 2007 International Olympiads will be hosted by:</p>
<p><br />
• Biology: (18th International Olympiad) Canada</p>
<p>• Chemistry: (39th International Olympiad) Russia</p>
<p>• Physics: (38th International Olympiad) Iran</p>
<p><br />
Competitors must be under the age of twenty years and never have enrolled at University. Typically, Australian Science Olympians are Year 11 or 12 students.</p>
<p>Each Olympiad is hosted by a different nation each year over a one-week period and consists of a series of theoretical and practical examinations. There are also impressive ceremonial events and cultural activities. The examinations test knowledge and skill in all aspects of the relevant discipline.</p>
<p>Physics Scholars may also compete in the more regional Asian Physics Olympiad. Established in 2000 at Jakarta, Indonesia, this competition allows for a larger team of 8 competitors. Many nations, including Australia, use this regional competition as advanced training and preparation for the International Physics Olympiad. The 6th Asian Physics Olympiad will be held during April 2007 in China.</p>
<p>Australia has a tremendous track record of achievement at the Olympiads with almost every team member now returning with a medal. This is a reflection on the very high level of talent and commitment that exists among the nation’s school students.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Rio Tinto Big Science Competition</b></p>
<p>Held for the first time in 2004 as the Australian Science Challenge, the Rio Tinto Big Science Competition has been renamed to reflect its growth and support under a major partnership with Rio Tinto. The Rio Tinto Big Science Competition has been created by teachers and academics nationwide to provide a test of real scientific thinking for all secondary students. The RTBSC is open to all secondary school students and is held annually in each participating school.</p>
<p><br />
<i>The Competition Papers</i></p>
<p>Three papers are offered, each with 30 multichoice questions, carefully graded for difficulty:</p>
<p>• Junior (Australian School Years 7 &amp; 8);</p>
<p>• Intermediate (Australian School Years 9 &amp; 10); and</p>
<p>• Senior (Australian School Years 11 &amp; 12).</p>
<p><br />
The time allowed is 75 minutes and the Competition is suitable for students of all abilities. The papers contain conceptual problems, self-contained scientific problems and problems which draw on factual knowledge from lower year curricula.</p>
<p>Extensive moderation of the competition papers ensures their accuracy and appropriateness.</p>
<p>The Competition showcases science as an important subject in the curriculum, vital to a modern society, and gives students an opportunity to discover a talent in this area without the pressure of it affecting normal school assessment. The questions, over time, will provide a rich resource of scientific questions for classroom discussion.</p>
<p>The principal aim of the Competition is not to be a testing service, even though comprehensive reports are issued which supply meaningful statistics. Rather, the event is intended to genuinely enrich scientific study at school. The questions are stimulating and students who wish to further their interest in science can be identified to take part in more challenging activities such as the Australian Science Olympiads. The early identification of scientific talent could, for some students, result in them ultimately being selected and trained to represent Australia at International Science Olympiads in Biology, Chemistry and Physics.</p>
