<h2><span class="mw-headline">The farmer's wife's ute</span></h2>
<p>I've just removed the following.</p>
<pre>
A farmer's wife once required a vehicle that could be used as a farm hack (farm car) through
(during, in) the week, and used for church over(at[UK], on[US]) the weekend, which resulted in
the "ute" (pick-up truck). Words such as "biro"(ball-point pen), named after its designer, can
be heard in the United Kingdom and France.
</pre>
<p>What was it trying to say? What relevance did it have? What's with all these alternative prepositions? (Use Aussie English here.) Where is this information from? <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 02:22, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Um, just re-reading that, it looks like it's explaining the origins of the ute - a farmer's wife needed a car that could be used on the farm during the week and at church on the weekend, hence the ute was born. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevage_a8b0.html" title="User talk:Stevage">Stevage</a> 13:19, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>This seems strange to me: "commonly one could be 'jailed' in a 'gaol'". Surely such a strange combination of spellings wouldn't normally be found...? --<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingkong2005_96e7.html" title="User:Singkong2005">Singkong2005</a> (from Sydney) 10:24, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>where I come from we say "in clink" "in the slammer" "behind bars", theres jail pronounces in south staffordshire jayul and bayul, ie " a yo gorra goo t'jayul, no iye aye"</p>

<dd>What was all that about above? If this is that paul bloke who's trying to push the black country influence debate then give it a rest mate. Also sign your comments with the four tildas so we can see who made the comment and when. As to the original question, 'gaol' isn't used very often thesedays so I'm not sure what the original author of that section referred to as 'commonly'. <a href="../../../c/i/t/User%7ECitizen_D_640b.html" title="User:Citizen D">Citizen D</a> 23:05, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it would appear that it's the same guy. I removed a rather long rant of his last week. This one at least started out on topic, so I left it. Is everyone else sick of his long, rambling, and poorly-written rants? At least he's no longer trying to insert similar material into the actual article anymore. <a href="../../../i/m/r/User%7EImroy_06a3.html" title="User:Imroy">Imroy</a> 08:18, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok then, I won't remove your text. I'll leave it for everyone to see. How does that fit into your conspiracy theory then? Not that it matters much, anyone who went through the page history could have seen your other rants anyway.</dd>
<dd>I don't know where to start replying to your allegations. It would help if you tried to write more clearly. Try learning about punctuation and sentence structure. If it weren't for some of the topics you raise, I would swear you were in primary school, because that's how you write. Seriously, if you want people to read all of what you write and give your opinion any weight, then try making your comments a little clearer.
<ol>
<li>I have never "<i>carefully edited the parts of [your] comments that have some bal[sic] behind em and left the light ones</i>". I have only ever removed your comments, in whole.</li>
<li>Britain is not the only source of <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_%28people%29.html" title="White (people)">white people</a>.

<li>It might surprise you that I quite like the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen of England</a>, as do many Australians. My wish for Australia to one day become a republic has nothing to do with my opinion of the British monarchy.</li>
<li>Just what is your problem with the Irish? You rejection of the suggestion that Austrlian English has been influenced by Irish immigrants strays into what looks like ethnic hatred.</li>
<li>Just where is your proof? All you've offered so far is opinion. Your opinion. Show me some proof of your long-winded claims and I won't be so quick to dismiss you.</li>

<dd>"Alot of you guys descend from convicts look at your horse saddles". Wow, some inspiring research there. I still can't quite figure out what your point is, though your English really is terrible. All I get is anger, bitterness, and resentment though I'm not really sure what your angry about. Can you explain, in 50 words or less the point you are trying to make and how it is relevant to the Australian English Wikipedia page? <a href="../../../c/i/t/User%7ECitizen_D_640b.html" title="User:Citizen D">Citizen D</a> 03:28, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"...miners came from ireland...". Really? A lot of Australia's early copper and silver mines were developed by Cornish miners and the ore was smelted by Welsh smeltermen. Overgeneralising again, the gold rushes brought a lot of Chinese miners. I doubt any of these would have appreciated being told they came from Ireland. You would do much better writing with proper sentences with proper punctuation, and sticking to your point (whatever it is). --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 12:45, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>upper class diallect that had germanic, yiddish influence</b>; Actually, the upper class dialect is more <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francophone.html" title="Francophone">Francophone</a> in derivation. You've conveniently glossed over the Battle of Hastings, and the [[Foreign language influences in English|influence of French] language on the current dynastic rule of England (the Tudors, etc). After all, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matinee.html" title="Matinee">matinee</a> is an English word derived from <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matins.html" title="Matins">matins</a>, a French and Latin word. Also, don't discount the influence of Romans upon the Bretons and Angle tribes.</li>
<li><b>there was mass emigration from this region during the colonial persiad, because people wanted to get away from the melencholy and dull sceenery</b>; thanks. You really cleared up our convict history there.</li>
<li><b>diallectual shift in alot of people over here because of the jewish migrants</b>; ok. Firstly, the Jews have migrated most toward Poland from Spain at the end of the Christian conquest of the Moors. Then from Russia to central europe in the early 20th centruy, thanks to the Russian pogroms. Then from Europe to Palestine in 1948 due to the war. So, which Jewish migrants? The ones stealing your jobs and your spelling and punctuation?</li>
<li>If it wasnt for us you wouldnt be there, youd probably be in some meloncholy <b>smokey town</b> (1). Irish didn't start building big ships until the <b>early last century</b> (2), and they only built two of them, and they still had to relly on us to make the anchors and chain and it had a fake funnel and lets face it, the hull was paper thin. you guys arived in australia in the <b>1750's</b> (3) in english <b>galleons</b>(4), the <b>fisrt ship</b> to arrive in australia was sailed by a man called captain cook an english explorer(5), who went as far as hawaii to <b>watch them surf</b>(6), he wrote about it in his diary. the first white man to see a budgerigar was called "Gould" he was also english. Alot of you guys <b>descend from convicts</b>(7)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1: You said you all left during "colonial persaid".</li>
<li>2: The Irish were sailing during Roman times and had an effective Navy, enough, in fact, to defend themselves against the Vikings. Fact, but not known in smokey midland shitholes full of illiterate idiots.</li>
<li>3: We actually arrived in 1788, as a colonial convict culture. Cook sailed into Botany Bay in 1770. Right after <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Perouse_503e.html" title="La Perouse">La Perouse</a>. So the French technically discovered Australia first, but the English gazetteered the find first because La Perouse considered the coastline at Botany Bay "worthless". Ditto the Dutch 200 years before for the coast of Western Australia. And see 5 and 7 below.</li>
<li>4: The English did not field <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galleon.html" title="Galleon">galleons</a> in the 18th century; they were exclusively a 15th and 16th century vessel. Galleons wouldn't be able to make a long journay, being too top-heavy and laden with cannon.</li>
<li>5: The first man to arrive in Australia was actually a Dutchman, so you're well wrong there.</li>
<li>6: He actually went to Hawaii to watch the solar <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transit_of_Venus_be17.html" title="Transit of Venus">Transit of Venus</a> across the sun, an <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomical.html" title="Astronomical">astronomical</a> observation, not a sporting leisure trip. How ignorant are you?</li>
<li>7: You just said we were descended from Midlands emigrees. I'm confused.</li>

<p>some people calls it a lorry some truck, but its a wagine in my county. but ya don't say lorry driver, you say waginedriver. if your a working driver they say "yer on the wagines" or "om on the wagines" and theres all difrent kinds, tatwagine which is for the scrapmetal, builderswagine the yellow one for the brickie, cattlewagine for the livestock.</p>
<p>if your refering to purely sand and coal you say skip, and much the same for a truck lorry wagine or train carrying raw materials such as sand.</p>
<p>the real aussy for a big truck with loadsa trailers its a "roadtrain", they run through the dessert and they won't stop for you.</p>
<p>funny you should mencion chippie, where I come from its a carpenter or joiner, also we have brickie for bricklayer, a bloke who does more than one trade is called a builder, you can call any a builder though.</p>
<p>also theres chippy with a Y, the fish and chip shop. leckie does not mean electrician it refers to the electricity bill. we call the electrician the "sparkie", in america sparkie refers to the chair mr sparkie, old sparkie aswel.</p>
<p>I don't think there is slang word for plumber. but i do know one called lee king, hes very good, if we sue the same sorta slang ideal, a plummer would be a waterie but it just doesnt sound good cause theres alread the word watery, describing "like water", ive heard of gas fitter, which most plumbers are.</p>
<p><br />
good onya is when you give someone credit, its like saying "good on you" I've heard that saying since the day I was born. but cause skip a few generations over a few hundred years you aussies have forgotten, to say it full you say "good onya'r'aye" "good on you ain't it" we black country folks are better than you people at speaking slang, thats cause were the master copy of the record the silver one that reads backwards, and the viynl has the arragance to say he knows best. I think if your this arragant about your history you should all just be eaten by the abbos, theres another we invented putting the o to shorten a word we usually do it with the village names, like cheslyn hay becomes chesso, if you don't beleive me email anyone from my village the school the church and ask em whats slang for it. if we can, but if a name sounds okay we use a small part of that name, great wyrley will be just wyrley. years ago walsall was called walesho the oh is hundreds of years old from old anglo saxon language, you aussies never invented it, we did. look on the internet and see how many refferences there are to "wolvo" for wolverhampton,</p>
<p>where I come from we say canabea or canabaya, theres only one other place that I know of that referes to beer or ale as beah baya, thats down under. if you don't beleive in me well why don't you call a few of my local brewers and ask em how you say beer in south staffordshire and the black country.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now you're just coming across as a complete tool. Oh let me guess - you came up with the idea of using the word "tool" as an insult too? I'll email someone from your village to find out. Or you're local brewer. Hell, you don't get much more credbile as far as evidence goes in my book...ahem... <a href="../../../c/i/t/User%7ECitizen_D_640b.html" title="User:Citizen D">Citizen D</a> 04:46, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear anonymous twat;</dd>
<dd>Well, now we know you aren't an Aussie and Australian English didn't come from Staffordshire.Sure, you can crap on aboutyour chippies and sparkies and brewies, but you didn't know the true-blue fair dinkum ridgy-didge word we use for plumber over here: a staffie.

<p>C'mon, who seriously calls it that? One book named it that. One book. I've never heard anyone call Australian English "strine" and I've never heard an Australian pronounce it that way, either. Yes, I am one. Even the Steve Irwins and the Harry Butlers and Rex Hunts of this world say it "Australian".</p>
<p>I'd love to see a poll or something where people associate it with Australian English, 'cos I tell you what, it'd be news to most Australians, that's for sure.</p>
<p>It's one of these bogus appellations that somehow gets tagged to something that nobody uses. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter1968_d813.html" title="User:Peter1968">Peter1968</a> 15:03, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Obviously there is a new phenomena that needs to be documented. Last night completely out of the blue the thought popped into my head, "I wonder if there is an entry on 'Strine'". A few hours later I land here to find an ongoing contoversy. Kewl. But I digress. Should "Strine" (ie as a proper noun) have its own entry given that it was an ongoing joke (in Sydney and Melbourne at least) 40 odd years ago (that was later picked up by the Poms to describe Australian pronunciation perjoratively)? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbatross2147_b76b.html" title="User:Albatross2147">Albatross2147</a> 23:13, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At the risk of making a personal attack, here's some information about our British AOL'er, found after five minutes of googling. In previous messages (check the archives) he provides the email address of xxxxxxxx@aol.com and the name 'xxxx'. And he just recently linked to an image in bluenfunky's <i>members.aol.com</i> web space. Do a google search on 'xxxxxxxxx' and you find quite a lot. His full name would appear to be Paul Hinton, but be careful searching with that name as it seems to be fairly common. There's also a golfer with that name. On a few forums he uses the name xxxxxxxxxxx', which fits with some of his rantings about the Black Country. He's also made [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx] to the Urban Dictionary, which lists his location (click on one of the definitions).</dd>
<dd>So with this information we can at least give him a name now. I'm half tempted to look up his telephone number and give him a sampling of my Australian accent!

<dd>Paul, the article only says that "many Australians are of Irish descent", not 'all' or 'most'. It also refers to "the influence of Irish Catholic priests and nuns", meaning it's not necessarily us who are of Irish descent.

<dd>whats that crap about being irish? we are australian!!!! descent is irrelevant, very few people (to be safe) dont have distant ancestors who came from foreign lands, no matter where you live, humanity stemmed and became more diverse as it became larger. if you find that irrelevant, then you get my point already. i am 5 generations (at least) australian, as a result i find where my great-great-great- grandparents who i didn't even live to meet came from irrelvant, this stereotype that we find being australian inferior and instead to restore our sense of sanity we must find what foreign "culturally superior" lands our ancestors came from is total b/s, and it should not be considered a general feeling of all australians, many couldn't care less about the lands their distant ancestors came from.</dd>

<p>I have just been looking at articles about various branchs of Arabic and notice they virtually get their own pages with population figures etc.</p>
<p>Given Australia's isolation it would be surely true that although obviously English in origin, Australian English could constitute a language comparable to various dialects of Arabic, and due to our isolation I would think perhaps it'd be even more applicable.</p>
<p>Given that Australian English indeed does have its own page it receives wide recognition as a distinctive dialect.</p>

<dd>The English language doesn't really have the same level of variety or regional influence from local languages, at least in modern times.

And the influence of radio, movies, and TV means that most English speakers (mostly) understand the variations from other parts of the world.

A question re the POV nature of "Use of words by Australians" The examples are of two labour party leaders using colourful language. Are there Liberal Party equivalents? Given the ratio of blue collar workers who came from the shop floor that is indeed possible. But is it true that say Tony Abbot has no similar quality colourful quotes.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Both correct?</span></h3>
<p>Both "program" and "programme" mean the same thing, and both are used in Australian English, but the difference between the two lies in the relative popularity. "Programme" is increasingly rare, and "Program" common and increasingly so. This article should reflect the actual usage, not "what came first". If we stuck to "what came first", then both articles and language would never change, and as we all know, this is not the case. As I mentioned to <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">User:Xtra</a>, this shouldn't become a pissing contest over who is an admin and who isn't. That's a poor way to write an encyclopaedia, especially one where we must rely on sources.

Looking at <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="WP:MOS">the MoS</a>, the only thing I can see that looks consistent with your advice is this: <i>If all else fails, consider following the spelling style preferred by the first major contributor (that is, not a stub) to the article.</i>.

</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You make a good point about WP not assisting change in language, and of course our role is to reflect what is common usage, which is why I cite the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macquarie_Dictionary_57a6.html" title="Macquarie Dictionary">Macquarie Dictionary</a>, the accepted standard reference to Australian English. In fact the Macquarie has been criticised for lagging behind current usage. As evidenced in the pagescan above, "program" is the headword and "programme" is not.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On looking into the history of this article, I find that you may be embarrassed by your supposition that the original usage was "programme". In fact it was "program", as seen in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australian_English&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=7497515" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australian_English&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=7497515" rel="nofollow">this version</a> of 16 November 2005.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>May I ask if there is any good reason why you (or any other editor) should think this article should now change to preferring "programme";; over "program"? The original usage was "program", the accepted standard for Australian English prefers "program", the overwhelming majority of online Australian style guides specify "program" over "programme", and all of the major television networks use "program" (even the ABC, the most conservative of the four).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So far in this discussion we have had two reasons advanced:
<ol>
<li>Xtra cites Chambers Dictionary</li>
<li>You claim that "programme" was the original usage in the article.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>With all respect, both arguments fail, the first on the grounds that Chambers is a dictionary of <b>British</b> English, the second because it is incorrect.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And finally, may I quote from the very article we are discussing, in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html#Spelling" title="Australian English">the version</a> to which you reverted: <i>The exposure to the different spellings of British and American English leads to a certain amount of spelling variation such as organise/organize. British spelling is generally preferred, although some words are usually written in the American form, such as program and jail rather than programme and gaol (although commonly one could be 'jailed' in a 'gaol').

What seems to be coming out of this is that Australians don't necessarily respect any coherent particular spelling pattern. Also, on the MoS rule, what happens if the first major contributor mixes several different styles? What if he does something new and funky? Is that to be respected too? :) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevage_a8b0.html" title="User talk:Stevage">Stevage</a> 13:11, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The general rule on Australian articles is to use "Australian" spelling unless it is a quote from a foreign source. The problem is when there are different variants of Australian English. If this is the case there are two options. 1) get uniformity by having all uses of that word to be identical; or 2) stick with the usage of the original contributor. However, just changing words from one style to another when both are accepted is <b>never</b> appropriate. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 14:00, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no reason to use <i>programme</i> in this article - <i>program</i> is (by far the) more common spelling in Australia and was used by the editor who initally added the word to the article (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">User:SuperJumbo</a>'s post two above this one gives the links to the diff and the relevant MOS quote). If this discussion comes to 'consensus by numbers' I'm for <i>program</i>. I always find it jarring to read <i>programme</i> in Australian-related media, it happens so rarely. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatgoo_1194.html" title="User:Natgoo">Natgoo</a> 18:42, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I said, individual preferences are irrelevant; in disputes such as this, we fall back to the spelling employed by the original author. Since Jumbo has shown that <i>program</i> was the original spelling, that form may prevail. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 10:44, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No argument from me. <i>Program</i> let it be. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 14:49, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
