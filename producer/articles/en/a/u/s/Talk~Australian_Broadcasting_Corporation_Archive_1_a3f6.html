<p>Tannin, I notice your edit to remove the claim of left-wing bias. I would think it pretty hard to dispute that overall, the network's tone is to the left of just about every other mainstream media outlet in Australia (with the possible exception of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a>) - not so much in its treatment of the major parties (it used to excoriate Labor when in power too), nor in the accuracy of its reporting, but in the issues it chooses to cover and the attitudes it assumes (for instance asylum seekers, where it assumes that human rights treaties are important and many Australians clearly don't).--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Robert, that's an oxymoron. Just about <i>everything</i> is to the left of the Packer and Murdoch press. Right-wing people complain about the bias of the ABC, left-wing people complain about the bias of the ABC, just about everybody complains about the bias of the ABC. I take issue with the claim that right wingers are more vociferous: that is only true insofar as right-wing ABC bias claims tend to get reported more in the tabloid press and perhaps TV (i.e., by Packer, Murdoch, and their clones.) Slip along to a union meeting and you'll get a whole different point of view.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the particular issue you mention, I agree, the ABC <i>has</i>, generally speaking, taken a more pro-immigrant line than middle Australia - though whether this counts as "left wing" bias is debatable. (I'd suggest that the support of the parties of the right and of the left for various positions on this issue is more a matter of historical accident and wanting to take a contrary stance vis-a-vis their opponents than base ideology. And, come to think of it, that the ABC's bias here is largely a bias towards the trendy inteligentsia - who are, after all, their primary market.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, there are plenty of examples where the opposite applies, in particular, almost anything to do with management, labor and economics. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course the commercial networks tend to be more right wing in my opinion so it tends to even out somewhat</p>

<p>As a Conservative and lover of the ABC (I tend not to touch commercial radio or TV networks), I find that Kerry O'Brien (particularly during the ABC's election coverage), at the very least, is far from being a Labour supporter. I don't see much left-wing bias, and I listen to and watch almost every ABC News and Current Affairs programme they have! <a href="../../../c/y/v/User%7ECyvros_8db9.html" title="User:Cyvros">Cyvros</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>You are going to find a lot of bias in many TV networks. Public broadcasters, in my honest "Yankee" opinion, are the hardest networks in terms of bias because they are supposed to be objective, and yet public broadcasters tend to be accused to support the current Government in power(doesn't matter which country) or towards a left-wing bias (because, to quote John Reith, the founder of the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>, public broadcasting is meant to "elevate the human condition") or a right-wing bias (on some issues brought up in the news or just in the programming itself). Take <a href="../../../p/b/s/PBS_66e9.html" title="PBS">PBS</a>/<a href="../../../n/p/r/NPR_8c1a.html" title="NPR">NPR</a> in the United States, for instance. In the US, ABC, CBS, and NBC are usually biased to the left, while FOX (thanks to Rupert Murdoch controlling the show) is usually biased to the right. PBS/NPR usually tries to avoid bias, but I've heard complaints from both sides regarding either left-wing bias or right-wing bias. Getting back to the topic here, I listen to Radio Australia on shortwave radio occasionally (when ionospheric conditions are right) and I don't hear any bias. -<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanCBJMS_2858.html" title="User:DanCBJMS">Daniel Blanchette</a> 18:53, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been bold in tampering with the opening, and I hope that contributors think the changes are reasonable.

'Majestic Overture'â€”Don't know who the composer was; probably a minor British composer, 1930s. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 16:16, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
.It's called <i>Majestic Fanfare</i> (or sometimes <i>The Majestic Fanfare</i>), and it was written in the 1940s by a British composer known as Charles Williams. It was originally recorded under his direction by the Queen's Light Hall Orchestra in 1940s, and this recording was used as the ABC News theme until the 1980s, when ABC Radio adopted a synthesised news theme, and the TV news morphed into the disastrous <i>The National</i> (which featured, at great expense to the ABC, the theme from UK's Channel 4 News - an arrangement of <i>Best Endeavours</i> by Alan Hawkshaw).</p>
<p>.In 1987, ABC-TV returned to the half-hour news (and also introducing <i>The 7.30 Report</i>), and used the TV News theme used until Australia Day '05 (written by the late Tony Ansell and Peter Wall).</p>
<p>.A year later, in 1988, to celebrate Australia's bicentenary, ABC Radio decided that <i>Majestic Fanfare</i> should make a comeback, and Australian composer Richard Mills reorchestrated (and, to a certain extent, arranged) the music for the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. This recording has been used since then.</p>
<p>.Last year, ABC News and Current Affairs began work on updating ABC-TV News (which was relaunched in digital and widescreen on Australia Day '05). They hired a respected Australian composer, Martin Armiger, to compose a new ABC Radio and TV News theme (with references to Williams' work). Armiger, with fellow composer John Gray, produced the work which has now been on for 10 and a bit months. It was performed by members of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and percussion groups TaikOz and Synergy.</p>
<p>.Due to a backlash from ABC viewers over the replacement of Ansell and Wall's theme (used for 18 years), it is unclear as to whether or not <i>Majestic Fanfare</i> will be replaced by Armiger's News theme as a branded theme for the broadcaster.</p>
<p>.If you'd like to listen to <i>Majestic Fanfare</i> over and over again, the ABC has released two different CDs: "Bakelite Express", which features the original '40s recording; and "ABC Radio Themes", which features two recordings of the '88 version (an extended version, and a reprise). Ansell and Wall's ABC TV News theme has been released on the 2-CD set "ABC TV Themes". <i>Majestic Fanfare</i> is also played on ABC's Classic FM so often, and the original recording will be played on December 17th, 2005 between 10am and midday during Marion Arnold's "Listener Requests" segment.</p>

<p>I notice that there's a statement that the ABC continues to 'own' the six state orchestras. I'm pretty sure that this is incorrect, and that they were divested during the 1990s.
