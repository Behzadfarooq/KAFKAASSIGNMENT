<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Senate_committees_ae6a.html" title="Edit section: Standing committees">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Standing committees</span></h3>
<p>From <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> to September <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> the eight standing committees were actually made up of pairs of committees - a legislation committee and a references committee. The <b>legislation committees</b> were responsible for scrutinising bills referred to it by the chamber, examining the government's budget and activities (in what is called the budget estimates process),<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and for examining departmental annual reports and activities. The <b>references committees</b> were responsible for conducting inquiries into topics referred to them by the chamber. From <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">11 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> each of these pairs of committees was integrated, however their functions remained unchanged.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Senate_committees_ae6a.html" title="Edit section: Select committees">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Select committees</span></h3>
<p>Select committees are temporary committees, established by the Senate to deal with particular issues. This may happen when a particular group of Senators wants to pursue an issue in depth, or there is no existing committee that is suited to addressing a particular topic. Recent select committees include ones examining the <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/indigenousaffairs_ctte/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/indigenousaffairs_ctte/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Administration of Indigenous Affairs</a>, and <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/mentalhealth_ctte/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/mentalhealth_ctte/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Mental Health</a>. Select committees usually examine an issue and upon reporting back to the chamber, cease to exist. One exception to this was the <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/superannuation_ctte/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/superannuation_ctte/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Senate Select Committee on Superannuation</a> which in various guises existed for a decade.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Senate_committees_ae6a.html" title="Edit section: Domestic committees">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Domestic committees</span></h3>
<p>Domestic committees are responsible for adminsitering aspects of the Senate's own affairs. The <b>selection of bills committee</b> meets each sitting fortnight to consider which of the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_%28proposed_law%29.html" title="Bill (proposed law)">bills</a> coming before the Senate will be referred to committees for detailed consideration. The <b>procedure committee</b> considers "any matter relating to the procedures of the Senate referred to it by the Senate or by the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_Australian_Senate_b51f.html" title="President of the Australian Senate">President</a>" (Senate Standing Order 17). This committee thus regularly examines and reports back to the chamber on suggested changes to the operation of the Senate and its committees, such as what times of day the chamber will sit and what rules should govern its order of business.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <b>scrutiny of bills committee</b> is to assess "legislative proposals against a set of accountability standards that focus on the effect of proposed legislation on individual rights, liberties and obligations, and on parliamentary propriety".<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> The <b>regulations and ordinances</b> committee performs a similar task, but for all subordinate legislation.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Senate_committees_ae6a.html" title="Edit section: Membership and rules of committees">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Membership and rules of committees</span></h2>
<p>The most important and high profile of the committees are the standing committees. These each have eight members: four drawn from amongst government Senators, three from the opposition, and one from amongst the minor parties and independents. The <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chair_%28official%29.html" title="Chair (official)">Chair</a> of each committee is chosen from amongst the government members, the deputy chair from amongst non-government members. Because the Chair has a casting vote in the event of a committee vote being tied, the government effectively controls the committees. This control reflects the fact that the government secured a majority of seats in the chamber at the 2004 election. Prior to having this control, the chairing - and control - of Senate committees had been divided amongst government and non-government parties.</p>
<p>Committees have two types of members: full members and participating members. In the case of standing committees, full members are the eight outlined above. In addition, however, any Senator may arrange for the Senate to agree to their being made a participating member of the committee. This gives them the same rights as full members, with the important exception of being unable to move or vote on motions in private meetings of the committees.</p>
<p>The committees are governed by the Standing Orders of the Senate, as well as being able to pass their own resolutions to govern their operations. Some of the key features of the committees include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter</li>
<li>committees can gather evidence, hold public hearings and produce reports</li>
<li>committees can (with rare exceptions) travel from place to place to hear evidence</li>
<li>committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly)</li>
<li>most evidence (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) taken by committees is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (<i>in camera</i>), and regularly do so</li>
<li>committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> parliamentary committees).</li>
</ul>
<p>The rules governing committees are slightly different when conducting budget estimates hearings. In particular, during estimates hearings,</p>
<ul>
<li>any Senator may ask questions of the officials appearing before the committee (normally only members can ask questions)</li>
<li>no evidence can be taken on a confidential basis</li>
<li>under Standing Orders, Senators may direct questions to any government agency. The committee cannot restrict the agencies to which Senators may direct questions (although the committee can control whether this happens at the public hearing, or whether it must be done in writing afterwards).</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Senate_committees_ae6a.html" title="Edit section: The work of committees">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The work of committees</span></h2>
<p>A typical year in the life of a Senate standing committee will see it conduct eight days of hearings around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (supplementary budget estimates). In addition, it will typically conduct several inquiries into policy issues and into some pieces of legislation being considered by the parliament. Each of these inquiries will usually result in a report tabled in the Senate (there may be exceptions if an election intervenes during the committee's deliberations). A <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/register/report/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/register/report/index.htm" rel="nofollow">consolidated list of the reports</a> prepared by all Senate committees since 1970 is published by the <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/dept/about.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/dept/about.htm" rel="nofollow">Department of the Senate</a>.</p>
<p>The work of the committees can be greatly affected by the composition of the Senate itself. The <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerk_of_the_Australian_Senate_e9b4.html" title="Clerk of the Australian Senate">Clerk of the Senate</a>, Harry Evans, has argued that a government majority of seats in the Senate has resulted in limitations on what the committees inquire into, and how readily governments respond to their queries and requests for information.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
