<p>It is a small yet well respected institution: the undergraduate student body of Austin College (referred to as "AC" by students and faculty, never "Austin") is limited to about 1,250. Most students are required to live on campus for the first three years, creating a close-knit community. Austin College actively promotes various <a href="../../../s/t/u/Study_abroad.html" title="Study abroad">study abroad</a> programs; 70% of students study abroad during their four years at the college. The college's strengths include the close interaction between the students and professors. Most of the professors at Austin college are focused on teaching, as opposed to research. The college maintains a 12:1 student to faculty ratio and the average class size is less than 25 students. The college uses no teaching assistants, so senior faculty teach all levels of coursework.</p>
<p>Chartered in November <a href="../../../1/8/4/1849.html" title="1849">1849</a>, it is the oldest college in Texas under original charter and name as recognized by the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Historical_Commission_05b6.html" title="Texas Historical Commission">State Historical Survey Committee</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_College_4def.html" title="Edit section: Communication/Inquiry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Communication/Inquiry</span></h3>
<p>The Communication/Inquiry class is one of a number of classes and program that the school believes sets it apart from other private universities. Communication/Inquiry, or "C/I" as it is abbreviated, is a seminar course taken by freshmen during the fall of their entry year. The professor becomes a mentor for the students in the class over the next four years. Students choose the topic of their C/I soon after matriculating. It serves as the initial course in the undergraduate core curriculum. Each section of C/I is meant to emphasize the enhancement of many core academic skills, among them general writing, oral communication, computer technology, and library usage, as well as intellectual inquiry and critical thinking. As with most Austin College classes, the classes are never more than 25 people, and usually less. Freshmen are encouraged to use the class as an opportunity to make friends. On the opening weekend, students participate in activities and games with their C/I group. Course topics, which are generally aligned with specialty of the instructors, have in the past included an analysis of children's literature, a studio art class where the participants create sculptures on campus, and a study of how food and culture have intertwined throughout history. C/I professors and topics rotate every year.<a href="http://www.austincollege.edu/Info.asp?2332" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.austincollege.edu/Info.asp?2332" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_College_4def.html" title="Edit section: Heritage of Western Culture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Heritage of Western Culture</span></h3>
<p>Heritage of Western Culture, known on campus as "Heritage" or "HWC", is a staple of the Austin College curriculum. The purpose of the Heritage classes is to tie together various liberal arts disciplines into an overview of the development of western culture.</p>
<p>All students are required to take three Heritage classes during their time at AC:</p>
<ul>
<li>101, "The Early Western World," usually taken as a freshman or sophomore, is a study of selected aspects of early western culture (antiquity to the Enlightenment) with particular attention to critical issues in the study of cultural heritage before the modern era and the legacy of the early west.</li>
<li>201, "Integrated Science," usually taken during sophomore or junior year, is a study of notable scientific achievements to develop an understanding of the nature of science, the structure of scientific thought, and the influence of some of the achievements of science on western ideas from the 17th through the 21st centuries.</li>
<li>301, "Individual and Society in the Modern World," usually taken during junior or senior year, is a study of the evolution of western culture and civilization from the Enlightenment until the present. Special attention is given to those ideas and events that shape the contemporary world, and may include aspects of non-western culture.<a href="http://www.austincollege.edu/Info.asp?855" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.austincollege.edu/Info.asp?855" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Each class focuses on a particular topic or subject and traces it through time in order to ascertain its effect on contemporary western culture. The topics are taught on a rotating basis (the same topic will generally be taught for four years consecutively, then the topic is changed), as the professors that teach them rotate as well. The majority of the classes are taught jointly, with 2-5 professors sharing the class and taking turns giving lectures, in order to provide a cross-section of disciplines and professors who specialize in various aspects of the class. The average class size is considerably larger, around 100 students, as opposed to the usual 25. For many AC students, the class is their only exposure to a lecture-hall type of class commonly found at larger universities. To supplement the lectures, each professor will usually have what is termed a "small group" of about 25 students that meets several times throughout the semester in addition to the "large group" meetings that take place regularly.</p>
<p>Opinions differ on the value of Heritage, as many current students view it as worthless (though some alumni remember the courses as some of the most valuable they took). This attitude led to increasing numbers of students taking the course on a pass/fail basis (and devoting minimal effort), leading Austin College to disallow such a grading system for the course. Currently, the class cannot be taken at a pass/fail for those under the program graduating in 2008 and beyond. Many professors agree with the negative student assessment of Heritage, although the program does have its supporters among the faculty too.</p>
<p>During the fall semester of 2006, the decades-old program has been made the subject of a full scale re-evaluation by the faculty. A committee of faculty members who teach in the course have been meeting to determine the future of the course sequence. That committee has made its report and the faculty will vote on the future of Heritage in the coming near future. There is strong sentiment to do away with the courses completely in some quarters, while others argue that Heritage (or something like it) should be retained. It may be that given the nature of this debate, the structure and context of the Heritage courses in the future -- should they survive -- will be very different from the present configuration.</p>
<p>In early March, 2007, the Austin College faculty voted to end the HWC program, and after the spring semester of 2007 HWC courses will no longer be offered.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_College_4def.html" title="Edit section: January Term">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">January Term</span></h3>
<p>January Term is Austin College's mini-semester, a three-week course taught every January. Students are required to take three Jan-terms during their time at AC, and many use the semester to either take a class in a different area than their regular studies, intensify their study in their designated field, or travel abroad on one of the many travel Jan-terms. Off-campus Jan-terms are an opportunity for those who cannot study abroad during the normal school year to do so. Destinations rotate from year to year, and past and current locations include <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/s/Costa_Rica_e226.html" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeast_Asia_4c93.html" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Africa_e6b4.html" title="West Africa">West Africa</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. There are also a number of domestic travel locations, such as <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_Ranch_434a.html" title="Ghost Ranch">Ghost Ranch</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> (where students can take landscape <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">photography</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_writing.html" title="Creative writing">creative writing</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silversmithing.html" title="Silversmithing">silversmithing</a>), <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_D.C._708d.html" title="Washington D.C.">Washington D.C.</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>.</p>
<p>Courses are taught on-campus as well. A longstanding policy requires freshmen to spend their first Jan-term on-campus, although some instructors allow exceptions. Many students can only afford only one off-campus Jan-term over the course of their Austin College career, and take the rest on campus. Topics have included bird-watching, a writing class on utopian literature, an analysis of contemporary comic books, the philosophy of mythological archetypes, as well as wine making and beer brewing, instructed by chemistry faculty.</p>
<p>Some Jan-terms serve as Heritage classes (generally 201 and 301), which are usually accompanied by a pre-departure class in the fall semester. Tests are taken throughout the students' travel in foreign countries and a passing grade fulfills the Heritage requirement of the degree plan.</p>

<p>Completed in 1998, the Jordan Family Language House is both a residence hall and a place of study for German, Spanish, French, and Japanese language and culture. The hall is divided into four sections, one for each language. Each section functions independently, with the number of students varying from Spanish (the largest) to Japanese (the smallest, with a capacity for eight). Students are encouraged to speak in their language of study when in the house.</p>
<p>A native speaker, always coming from abroad, resides in each section to assist students in their study of the language. The native speaker also holds intermediate and advanced conversation classes for the students. The Jordan House contains a multimedia language laboratory.</p>
<p>Students who live in the house are enrolled in a half-credit course, in addition to another course in the language or literature. Course requirements include meeting several times a week for language table, weekly house meetings with skits, games, and other presentations in the target language, and a variety of other culturally appropriate activities. <a href="http://www.austincollege.edu/ViewPage.asp?857" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.austincollege.edu/ViewPage.asp?857" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<p>The Austin College <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mascot.html" title="Mascot">mascot</a> is the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroo.html" title="Kangaroo">kangaroo</a>. The unusual mascot name traces its roots to the 1850s, when Austin College upperclassmen held mock trials — called Kangaroo Kourt — in which freshmen were "tried" by upperclassmen. The practice was abolished in 1915, but some students had, through the tradition, grown fond of the kangaroo. Accordingly, the class of 1923 bought a live kangaroo from a zoo in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. Named after trustee Pat E. Hooks, "Pat" the three-year-old kangaroo, who stood five feet tall, came to campus in 1922 and lived under the steps of long-time dormitory Luckett Hall.</p>
<p>Pat was a rallying point for student morale, taken on a leash to home football games, pre-game bonfires, biennial games with archrival <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_University_%28Texas%29_8719.html" title="Trinity University (Texas)">Trinity</a> in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio_20a5.html" title="San Antonio">San Antonio</a>, and to games with <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Methodist_University_7ccb.html" title="Southern Methodist University">SMU</a> in <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas.html" title="Dallas">Dallas</a>. Pat and the 12-piece band gave Austin College students "the conviction that the Kangaroos could compete athletically with any school in the Southwest."</p>
<p>However, Pat died accompanying the team to training camp at Woodlake. He was buried just north of the current Baker Hall at a funeral service held by students after chapel. A second kangaroo was purchased from a circus in 1924, but after "Pat II" met a similar fate, the student body decided a kangaroo was too delicate a creature to survive in Texas. Pat II was not replaced until the fall of 1950, when Austin College students bought a six-month-old female Australian <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallaby.html" title="Wallaby">wallaby</a> named Katy.</p>
<p>Katy was smaller than Pat, standing three feet tall and weighing 75 pounds, and lived next to the gymnasium in a pen. Students fitted Katy with a harness, who entertained the crowd at during halftime at football games by running up and down the sidelines. She appeared at the <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton_Bowl_%28stadium%29_7292.html" title="Cotton Bowl (stadium)">Cotton Bowl</a> in Dallas during a Austin College-<a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico_27ab.html" title="National Autonomous University of Mexico">Mexico City University</a> game.
