<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austro-tai.html" title="Edit section: Genetic Structure of Austro-Tai Populations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Genetic Structure of Austro-Tai Populations</span></h2>
<p>Going with the development of the natural philosophy in its own field, especially the development of methods, molecular anthropology has gone out of the range of genetics, and become a multidisciplinary field cross-linked by both natural science and social science. In the studies of molecular anthropology, human DNA is just a tool to analyze the structures and relationships among populations and in result shows a so called genetic structure, which is used to reconstruct the phylogenesis of populations combined with the results from other anthropologic fields. In this thesis, the phylogenesis of Austro-Tai populations was reconstructed by this method, and the materials used in this study were paternal Y-chromosome and maternal mitochondrial DNA, which were regarded as the most powerful tools in molecular anthropology.</p>
<p>The Austro-Tai populations studied in this thesis include 3 parts. One is the Tai-Kadai family in South China and Indo-China Peninsular, one is the aboriginal group in Taiwan Island, and the other is the Malay-Polynesian family through out the Pacific Ocean, India Ocean and Southeast Asia. We studied 1,325 samples, covering all the Austro-Tai population from Taiwan, Hainan and the mainland of China, and Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. The Austro-Tai populations were found a unity not only in culture but also in genetic structure, compared with a plenty number of data from other groups in East Asian. The most obvious marker of Austro-Tai is O1 haplogroup of Y-SNP. By observing the inside structure of O1 haplogroup, the phylogenesis of the whole Austro-Tai population can be traced out. Beside O1 of Y-chromosome, B4a, B4b, M7b etc of mtDNA are also fairly Austro-Tai specific. Austro-Tai populations were found to be a branch of modern human out of Africa 50 thousand years ago. Mongoloid people came into being in the way to far east. About 30 thousand years ago, the population was split into two parts, and went northward into East Asian along two sides of Yun-Gui Altiplano separately. Austro-Asiatic, Hmong-Mien and Sino-Tibetan were in the west line in Myanmar and Yunnan, while Austro-Tai was in the east line in Vietnam and Guangxi.</p>
<p>The Austro-Tai population have developed for quite a long time around Gulf of Tonkin, and O1 haplogroup originated there about 20 thousand years ago. The differentiation and diffusion of Austro-Tai can be classified into 3 periods. The first period is the differentiation in the Paleolithic Age. First, difference appeared between mountain populations in Guangxi backland and seashore populations around Gulf of Tonkin. The mountain population developed into Daic-Kloc (Luo-Yue) later. O1 haplogroup originated in seashore populations, and spread along the seashore in the coming years, which laid an oldest structure in Hlai population in Hainan. By 14 thousand years ago, seashore population had spread along the seashore of Guangdong and Taiwan, which were connected at that time. The Taiwan aborigines began to develop since then. Some later, some other populations began to go southward along Vietnam seashore from Gulf of Tonkin, which developed into Malayan later. So we can see in the genetic structure that Taiwan aborigines and Malayans were in the contrary side of Tai-Kadai.</p>
<p>About 10 thousand years ago, Tai and Kadai populations were polarized. Populations in the west of Guangdong became Kadai, the ancestor of Glao people, and those in the east of Guangdong became Tai, the ancestor of Kam-Tai. We now can see that it is Kam-Sui population which is most close to Glao genetically. The second period is the diffusion and differentiation in the Neolithic Age. About 8 thousand years ago, Neolith and agriculture began to germinate in a certain population in the east of Guangdong, maybe even far in east. They spread out in no time, and gave birth to 3 groups, Yue, Klam and Lowland Taiwanese. Yue was the part of populations arrived in Zhejiang, and later developed out the splendid Hemudu and Liangzhu Culture. The inside spread in Guangdong and Fujian became the second lay of Kam-Tai structure. A actual discovery was found by time estimate in O1 haplogroup that paternal lineages of Yue, Kam-Tai and Taiwan aborigines were mostly founded about 8 thousand years ago. That can be confirmed by archaeology. In the time from 5 to 3 thousands ago, Min-Yue in Fujian and Nan-Yue in Guangdong were polarized, and then East-Ou went northward to south Zhejiang from Min-Yue, and West-Ou went westward to Guangxi from Nan-Yue. West-Ou mixed with Luo-Yue and became the ancestor of Zhuang-Tai. In some time around that, Kadai went northwest to Guizhou, and found some Kingdom such as Yerong(Ye-Lang), and assimilated a great number of Phu population there whose mother languages were Proto-Austro-Asiatic. This was concluded from the duality of Kadai genetic structure. The third period is the scattering and migration of <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kam-Tai_2aa1.html" title="Kam-Tai">Kam-Tai</a> in the historical age. About 2 thousand years ago, Han people began to move into the area of Kam-Tai, and Kam-Tai populations left the southeast coast zone one after another. The biggest migration was the exile of Min-Yue. It was a coercive migration by Han government, and almost all of the Min-Yue populations left Fujian, so we can hardly find Austro-Tai markers in todays Fujian population. Some Min-Yue populations escaped to Guangdong and then went further west to Guizhou, became today’s Sui-Maonan people. We can see that Sui is the population with most genetic relationships with Taiwan aborigines among populations in mainland China and even the world. Most of the Guangdong populations also migrated northwest and became Kam people. In some later time, a part of Zhuang-Tai people left Guangxi and migrated to Indo-China peninsular, became Tai-Thai populations. By genetic structure of molecular anthropology, we reconstructed a compendious phylogenesis of the headstream of Austro-Tai. There are still a lot of migration routes left unchecked, and the studies on ancient populations are stingy, which means a heavy load of genetic structure study of Austro-Tai.</p>
