<p>The indigenous people of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> are traditionally largely nomadic, ranging over an area, depending on the availability of particular foodstuffs that could be gathered at different times of the year. They managed the land through which they travelled by biennial burning-off which stunted the growth of forests and encourage grassland from which seed crops and kangaroos could be harvested.</p>
<p>The housing of the people first encountered by Europeans in the Sydney region was simple, shelters constructed of a semi-circle of stick, covered with large sheets of bark which could be conveniently stripped off melaleucca trees which grew profusely along waterways. Other types of simple structures were seen including lean-tos and in tropical regions raised sleeping platforms. Grass, leaves and reeds were used as a thatch where suitable bark was not available.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1840s, the Victorian Protector of Aborigines, George Augustus Robertson described dry-stone dwellings in which the aboriginal people of Western Victoria lived in family groups or villages. His drawings passed into the Mitchell Library where they have been virtually ignored for 140 years by White Australians who have maintained the mistaken impression that all indigenous people were nomadic hunters and gatherers, that they did not manage the land that sustained them and that there were certainly nothing that one could describe as a permanent settlement. In fact, the stone dwellings of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people were known to the White settlers, but the knowledge was largely ignored, along with the brutal suppression and murder of Tasmania’s people. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Aboriginal people also built dry-stone Fish Traps, of which the most extensive, ranging over 500 metres, is on the Barwon River at Brewarrina. Its age is unknown. It has been maintained and rebuilt after floods many times and is said traditionally to have been given to the local tribes by the Creator Spirit.</p>
<p>It appears that in conjunction with such catchment schemes, there may have also been nearby sedentary settlements of people who maintained them.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> There is evidence at Lake Condah in Victoria of houses in conjunction with eel traps dating back about 8,000 years.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In January 2006, bushfires uncovered another nearby site of a village of stone houses that are large enough to have provided sleeping space for several families. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_residential_architectural_styles.html" title="Edit section: Old Colonial Period 1788 - c. 1840">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Old Colonial Period 1788 - c. 1840</span></h3>
<p>Colonial Architecture is the term used for the buildings constructed in Australia between European settlement in January 1788 and about 1840.</p>
<p>The first buildings of the British penal settlement in Sydney were a prefabricated house for the Governor and a similarly prefabricated Government Store to house the colony's supplies. Sydney was a tent settlement. Building anything more substantial was made unnecessarily difficult by the poor quality of spades and axes that had been provided and the shortage of nails.</p>
<p>The convicts adapted simple country techniques commonly used for animal shelters and the locally-available materials to create huts with wattle and daub walls. So useful were the local acacia trees for weaving shelters that they were given the name <i><a href="../../../w/a/t/Wattle.html" title="Wattle">Wattle</a></i>. Some pipe clay was obtained from the coves around <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Jackson_7961.html" title="Port Jackson">Port Jackson</a>. Bricks were fired in wood fires and were therefore soft. Lime for cement was obtained by burning oyster shells.</p>
<p>The first imported roofing material was <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corrugated_iron.html" title="Corrugated iron">corrugated iron</a> sheeting. Roofs of this type were to become part of the Australian vernacular. For many years imported roofing was in very short supply. Two local roofing materials were available- there were extensive reed beds near the Cook's river for thatching. There was also bark which could be peeled off a number of the indigenous trees in large sheets. Methods of heating and flattening the bark were used by the Aboriginal people and these were quickly assimilated by the convict builders.</p>
<p>The two most significant trees, both of which grew in the Sydney area, were the Melaleuca and the Iron Bark. The Melaleuca bark, having the texture of paper, could be peeled off the tree in layers up to 2cm thick, a metre long and perhaps half a metre wide without serious damage to the tree. Although not particularly durable as exterior roofing, the material provided excellent insulation and was used for ceilings and lining the walls.</p>
<p>The resilient bark from the Iron-bark tree was adapted as a major building material everywhere that such trees grew. It was widely used as a roofing material, was weatherproof, insulating and could last for thirty years. Houses of axe-hewn slabs with Iron-bark roofs continued to be built in rural Australia until WWII.</p>
<p>As better tools became available the Colonial builders became adept at working the extremely hard and durable timber of the native hardwood forests. The majority of houses were built of split logs rather than sawn timber. The technique employed for the construction of a wall was to chisel out a deep groove in a straight log, preferably of the local termite-resistant Cyprus pine which became the foundation. Split logs that had been adzed flat at the ends were then stood in the groove and another groove log was placed on top and slotted into place in a circular corner post. The gaps between the split logs were either packed with clay and animal hair or had narrow strips of metal cut from kerosene tins tacked over them. The interior could be plastered with clay, lined with paperbark or papered with newspaper, wrapping paper or calico. Cards, photographs, news clippings and commemorative items were often stuck directly onto the walls.</p>
<p>The technique of making durable hardwood roofing shingles was also developed. Where these shingles have been applied to brick houses, they have sometimes survived to the 21st century, covered by subsequent corrugated iron roofs.</p>
<p>In the earliest houses windows were usually small, and multi-paned with cylinder glass. When the cost of glass put it beyond reach of the home-owner, blinds of oiled calico were tacked across window openings in the winter months.</p>
<p><b>Types of buildings</b></p>
<p>The simplest houses were of a single room, which, if the bread-winner prospered, became the kitchen to a more substantial residence, or conversely, became the living room with a lean-to kitchen added. Houses that grew piecemeal were generally asymmetrical, with the door leading into the original room.</p>
<p>Houses that were planned were generally symmetrical, and very simple, usually containing 2 to 4 rooms around a central hallway. The kitchen was frequently detached and entered from a rear verandah or covered breezeway where pantry or scullery might also be located. Fireplaces projected outwards from the walls of the house. Except in the case of some small inner-city Georgian row houses built of brick, houses generally had a verandah added to them, often on three sides.</p>
<p>One class of people who maintained the tradition of wattle and daub, with a bark roof was the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatting.html#Squatting_in_Australia" title="Squatting">squatters</a> who did not have title to their land, and potentially had to move on every two years.</p>
<p>Very few 19th century houses of wattle and daub or split timber have survived. A small number of split timber cottages which later became kitchens may be seen adjacent to more substantial homes, generally painted to match the house and barely recognizable.</p>
<p>Most buildings erected in the first 50 years of Australian settlement were simple and plain. Convict huts, marine barracks, government stores and houses for officials were simple rectangular prisms covered with hipped or gabled roofs often with verandahs supported on wooden columns in the Classical manner. They were influenced in particular by the regulation British military buildings in India and other tropical locations.</p>
<p>At the time of the first settlement, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgian_architecture.html" title="Georgian architecture">Georgian architecture</a> was the architectural vernacular in Britain. Craftsmen, including carpenters and plasterers were trained in the classic proportions associated with the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palladian_architecture.html" title="Palladian architecture">Palladian style</a> fashionable across Europe. Palladian ideals reveal themselves in some of the few larger homes of the Regency period such as “Elizabeth Bay House”. <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoclassical_architecture.html" title="Neoclassical architecture">Neoclassism</a> incorporating not only <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greek</a> but also sometimes <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egyptian</a> <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motif_%28art%29.html" title="Motif (art)">motifs</a>, beginning in Europe about 1760, also influenced Australian architectural style. “Fernhill” at Mulgoa with its wide colonnaded verandah shows the influence of Neoclassicism.</p>

<p><b>1840 - 1880</b></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, of which Australia was an integral part, was heavily influenced by the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>. In turn this was influenced by the 19th century teachings of the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_movement.html" title="Oxford movement">Oxford</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Movement_e428.html" title="Cambridge Movement">Cambridge Movements</a> which believed <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_architecture.html" title="Gothic architecture">Gothic</a> architecture to be the purest, truest form. According to these English Movements, this was the only way to achieve spiritual communication with God through architecture. Thus while a local <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnate.html" title="Magnate">magnate</a> may have built his home in a classical style, he would fund a church in the Gothic style, thus during the 19th century, when Australia was expanding rapidly two forms of architecture were very evident - Gothic and the classically influenced styles. Originally Gothic was for God, and the classical for the man. Later a new "self made" Australian began to emerge, unhindered by a classical British education - dictating classical gentlemanly interests. This "new" self made man (like is contemporaries in Britain) would often choose Gothic as the design for his home.</p>
<p>The great Cathedrals of the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> during the Gothic Period of <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_architecture.html" title="Ecclesiastical architecture">ecclesiastical architecture</a> formed the inspiration for this particular Architectural style. Not only in residential buildings, but in many commercial structures and, Churches and Cathedrals built during this time. St. Paul's and St. Patrick's Cathedrals in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> are excellent examples of the Gothic Revival Period. Often referred to as Victorian Gothic, deriving from the Victorian style Architectural name from a similar time period. Steeply pitched roofs often made of slate, Narrow doors and windows resolving in a classical Gothic pointed arch at their height,(known as <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancet_window.html" title="Lancet window">lancet windows</a>) diamond pane glazing to windows imitating a stained glass affect and intricate parapets, often of a religious nature bearing a cross resembling that of those atop Cathedrals and Churches. In non-terrace houses the drawing room was often pulled forward adding a bay window to the front of the dwelling.</p>

<p><b>1845 - 1900</b> The <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_architecture.html" title="Victorian architecture">Victorian</a> Style in Australia can be divided into 3 periods to break up the whole; Early, Mid and Late. The period in its entirety stretches from 1837 to 1901 and was named after the then Queen, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Victoria_69b5.html" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. Early styles featured symmetrical layouts and façades, a centrally located front door and a hipped roof of corrugated iron, leading to a veranda on the façade. During the 1850s cast iron lacework came to Australia where it made its way on to Mid and Late Victorian Homes. With much the same floor plan as the Colonial Style, a central hallway with a standard 4 rooms. <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weatherboard.html" title="Weatherboard">Weatherboards</a> were used, however, larger homes had red brick and blue stone incorporated. Into the Mid Victorian Style the decoration began to gain popularity. The bull nosed Veranda roof was introduced, sidelights were added either side of the front door and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrace_house.html" title="Terrace house">terraced houses</a> were springing up everywhere, containing parapets and detailed dividing walls between the property boundaries. Late Victorian Style homes had perhaps the most decorative features in all of the known Architectural styles to date, and it is often referred to as Boom Style. Towards the end of the Victorian era timber fretwork was being used more and more, which led into the Edwardian Style.</p>
<p>From the 1840s, a specific style of building emerged in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a>. The <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queenslander_%28architecture%29.html" title="Queenslander (architecture)">Queenslander</a> style of houses are identifiable by large verandahs and large double doors which open onto these verandahs, stilts rising the house above ground level (particularly in older houses), metal roofs typically of corrugated design and the houses are always constructed of mostly wood.</p>

<p><b>1915 - 1940</b> This style can almost instantly be recognised by the columns holding up a front veranda area. The name is almost self explanatory, bungalow, a country rugged type of home, and this led to the belief that picket fences looked their place as the front fence, however originally, they were never used. Darker colours were originally used however, as the years went by, new brighter paint served as a welcoming change to open up the spaces and brighten up the homes. Stone, brick and timber, earthy materials were used. A gable roof faced either the front or side always.</p>

<p><b>1930</b> onwards - Originally specific to Queensland, the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queenslander_%28architecture%29.html#Ashgrovian" title="Queenslander (architecture)">Ashgrovian</a> style developed from the hipped bungalow style and was characterised by a frontage with a grand gable roof, often surrounded by secondary smaller gables behind, the smaller gables usually sheltering verandahs and sleep-outs. A staircase almost always dominated the front yard leading to the verandah.</p>

<p><b>1940 - 1950</b></p>
<p>Fashionable modern houses of the thirties in the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streamline_Moderne_2988.html" title="Streamline Moderne">Streamline Moderne</a> style were sometimes described as being like ocean liners, with walls, windows and balconies all sweeping around corners. By the 1940s these details were entrenched into suburban designs. The 'Waterfall' or 'Waterfall Front' style came to be known as such from the use of descending curves in chimneys, fence pillars and other vertical elements. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Boyd_88f8.html" title="Robin Boyd">Robin Boyd</a>, the Australian architect and writer, noted that three was 'the key to decorative smartness'; three steps usually being used for the waterfall effect and featured parallel lines were often in threes.</p>
<p>Defining features of houses from this period are curved corner windows, including Venetian blinds, some rare examples of which are curved. With a slightly steeper pitched roof than the Early Modern Style, this style was generally of brick veneer cream brick but also could have dark brown glazed feature brickwork incorporated into the external walls, and under windowsills. Chimneys were either stepped or plain, and together with the round windows perhaps gave meaning to the "Waterfall" name.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastical, International, Melbourne Regional, Brisbane Regional and American Colonial were also styles which existed in the period 1940-1960.</p>

<p>After the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">second World War</a>, architects in Australia were influenced by the development of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_style_%28architecture%29.html" title="International style (architecture)">International style of architecture</a>. Some regional variations developed. In Melbourne, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Boyd_88f8.html" title="Robin Boyd">Robin Boyd</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Grounds_0818.html" title="Roy Grounds">Roy Grounds</a> articulated a Melbourne interpretation of the modern style. Boyd's book <i>Victorian Modern</i> (1947) traced the history of architecture in the state of Victoria and described a style of architecture that he hoped would be a response to local surroundings as well as the popular international style. In particular he nominated the work of Roy Grounds and in some outer suburban bush houses of the 1930s as being the early stages of such a style. Grounds and Boyd later worked in partnership.</p>
<p>The houses were typically narrow, linear, and single storey with a low pitched gable roof. They had exposed rafters and wide eaves. Walls were generally bagged or painted brick and windows were large areas of glass with regularly spaced timber mullions. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
