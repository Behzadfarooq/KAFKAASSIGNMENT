<p>Hmm i thought Bob Brown was the leader of the Greens in Australia. Seeing there is an election on I could be wrong, but i would also like to be sure that wikipedia does not contain any errors because of the upcoming election. I would sincerely appreciate it if someone could research this, i am currently a bit busy. Thanks 61.68.57.29 11:23, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>im just wondering. under political ideology it says green politics. i would suggest that it should say green politics / left wing (or something to that effect). as an example, the liberal page says conservative / neo-liberal. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 10:53, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Greens policy cannot completely be defined as environmental. It is heavily socialist and generally socially radical as well. liberals for forests is an example of a green libertarian party. They do not preference the Greens highly because they disagree massively on non-environmental issues. Being "green" does not fully describe the Greens. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatturn_857b.html" title="User:Matturn">matturn</a> 12:05, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Liberals for forests has a chequered history. It started in WA and took votes from the Liberals due to Liberal policy being to continue with destructive logging/woochipping practices. In 2004 in NSW the party was hijacked by Glen Druery(?) - a political operator who attempts to get elected by micropreference flow tactics. He did not succeed, but he DID direct Senate preferences away from the Greens to right wing parties. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 03:46, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Greens political platform has recently been selectively represented by some sections of the media (most notably the Murdoch press), the Coalition (e.g. Howard, Anderson, Brandis etc) as "extreme left wing" etc. But Lindsay Tanner (ALP) has as well. Why does negative other party POV feature so prominently in this section?</p>
<p>And why are only the "controversial" policies stated from a very long list?</p>
<p>While some of the Greens are "disliked by many in the Labor party and the trade unions" there are many Greens who are very active and even employed by several influential trade unions - this is not mentioned. Nor is Dean Mighell's much publicised "defection" to the Greens (he subsequently returned to the ALP).</p>
<p>Many Greens have joined the party from the ALP after becoming dissaffected with ALP policies on environment, and more recently on asylum seekers. Some Greens have joined from the Liberals for similar reasons too. No mention of these trends either. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 12:32, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Neither the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">ALP</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal Party</a> articles have a section on "ideology", and neither contain significant "criticism or comment or other party's POV" on them. So why does this article on the Australian Greens differ in this regard? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 22:32, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the idealogy section was drifting into other party POV of the Greens so I have shifted it under as subheading, and moved the Greens-Democrat rivalry section under it. I have also added information about links and relations with environmental organisations. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 13:00, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The ALP and Liberal articles aren't necessarily perfect, and I think an ideology section in this article is entirely justified. That said, you're entirely right in that no other party has this amount of crap about what everyone else thinks about them, as to what they actually are. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 13:21, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think we should expect this article to be entirely parallel to the ALP/Liberal articles in that regard. IMHO, it's a fact of life that "other parties' POV" matters more to minor parties such as the Greens than it does to the ALP and Coalition. For them, being able to win allies and cut deals is <i>important</i>; for us, it's <i>essential</i>. A better comparison might be <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_First_Party_1e5d.html" title="Family First Party">Family First Party</a>; while they don't have a specific section on their relationships with other parties, there is quite a bit throughout the article, in particular <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_First_Party_1e5d.html#2004_Federal_Election" title="Family First Party">here</a>. I do agree with separating 'relationships' section off from party ideology, though - if anything, it probably ought to be moved a little further away. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 23:36, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a key difference there. A "relationships" section in the context of their ability to do preference deals with other parties would make a lot of sense. That's not what we have at the moment - far too much of this article is still about the opinions of every other party but themselves. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 00:52, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This would certainly be an improvement.

<p>... are tricky things. More to the point, anyone who isn't familiar with Australian politics already isn't going to know what the article's talking about if we mention it.

<dl>
<dd>And I've reverted. What the heck? If the Greens had the balance of power, they would have a huge amount of influence over legislation to be passed. As they do not, they now have practically none.

<dd>Let's look at this sentence: "In the 2004 Federal election the Greens' primary vote rose by around 2% (to an average of around 7%), giving them two additional seats in the Senate, but the success of the Howard government in winning a majority in the Senate, however, meant that the Greens' influence would decrease." How many commas there? Just throw in "however" for good measure, when you want to tack something on? That last snip is not necessary, and was placed on the end of the sentence recently. "What the heck" indeed. 203.214.146.4 05:15, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Unless, you know, you want to add a snip about "[x] party will lose influence due to the Howard majority" to EVERY SINGLE party's page on Wikipedia. There's no mention of "balance of power" in this article anymore, and without a reference to it, I don't see the relevance of <i>predictions</i> like "[x] party's influence will decrease." That's not encyclopedia-worthy. 203.214.146.4 05:20, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>its not a prediction. its a fact. when one party (or a coalition of parties) gains an ABSOLUTE MAJORITY in a house of parliament. oposition parties which would have otherwise held the balance of power and gained huge influence due to their individual good results no longer have any real effect and are in fact in a worse position than when they had less seats. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 05:48, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC) Typical right wing bias.</dd>

<p>I've added a paragraph on the 2004 election results to the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal Party</a> article, naturally including reference to their Senate success. (I'm not quite sure what to do with the Nats or Labor, since their articles are shorter and don't leave an obvious spots for modern elections results to go; the ALP one in particular could use an expansion. Adding a ref in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Latham_1e63.html" title="Mark Latham">Mark Latham</a> might work, though.) Since the other minor parties involved in the elections all either lost seats or only have one senator anyway, I don't really think it's necessary to bring up the other reasons for their lack of influence in the articles. If no-one objects, I think we can safely put back the reference to the balance of power here. (Oh, and just so we're clear: I'm a <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Democrats_2114.html" title="Australian Democrats">Dems</a> supporter, and I have the same contempt for John Howard as any other latté leftie.

<dd>I'm not leaving a horrid run-on sentence like that. It reads horribly, is an eyesore, and serves no purpose. Unless there's an <i>equally poor</i> sentence added to every other Australian party page, I'll keep removing it. I'm surprised to see so many prominent Australian Wikipedians defending such poor writing. The main Australian 2004 election article covers plenty of "the Greens didn't do as well as they'd hoped" tone, and I'll not have this page reading like a eulogy when the Greens <i>increased</i> their numbers in the Senate. Inter-party dynamics are for the main election article. So far as this article goes, they gained two Senate seats -- nearly three, had it not been for the Victoria preferences sham. 203.214.144.52 20:39, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then reword the damned thing, not remove it. Please stop accusing us of being biased against the Greens - almost all of us are either Greens (as I am) or ALP voters. It <i>should</i> note just how much their vote increased, and how Siewert and Milne picked up seats despite the preferences sham - but it should also note that they had expected to do better (i.e. in seats such as Melbourne, and the Queensland Senate), and that their influence has now decreased, as a result of their support no longer being needed to pass legislation. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 00:13, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>IMHO (and I'm a Greens member myself), the fact that we increased our seats is the reason *why* it should be included. When we note that the Democrats lost seats, it hardly needs saying that this weakens them. But if we note that the Greens won seats, the natural presumption is that they'd be more powerful in the Senate than they were last time around. This *isn't* the case, it's not obvious to a casual reader that it isn't the case, it has a lot of impact on the Greens' role in the Senate, and so it bears mentioning here. Even if it means a small amount of duplication. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 00:23, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<p>Just for the record, the ALP offered to do a preference swap with the Greens in Tasmania, but the Greens were so confident of getting a quota in their own right that they declined. The ALP then did a deal with Family First instead. The ALP's view is that it is not their job to help get Greens Senators elected. The current Senate election system makes preference deals absolutely necessary to win the sixth spot, and the ALP did whatever deals seemed likely to maximise its own chances of doing so. The reason the Greens failed to win Senate seats in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia was not preference "shams" but their own failure to win enough votes. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 00:21, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not the ALP's job to get Green Senators elected, but it also seems somewhat logical to preference someone who is likely to have similar views and vote with you, rather than someone who is likely to vote for the government. Preferencing Fielding over Risstrom was a disaster - rather than helping Collins hold her seat, he took it from her, and the ALP now has a right-wing nuisance in the Senate for the next eight years. So, at least in Victoria, if not a sham, it was one hell of a stuff-up. The ALP also should've known better than to preference Petrusma over Milne in any circumstances. It is madness for a left-wing party to be preferencing the far-right. Let us just hope the lesson has been learned for next time. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 06:10, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I'm unsure that the Greens would receive Labor preferences in the future because one of Labor's biggest problems this time around was that it was seen as getting too cuddly with the Greens (re: Tasmanian forests especially). Conversely, Labor rather enjoyed its effective Senate majority on the matter of anything remotely progressive in a de facto ALP/Greens/Democrats voting bloc and such an arrangement will happen with Family First when hell freezes over. (Or when St Kilda wins the flag). - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 08:30, Nov 1, 2004 (UTC)

There are two important points you are missing. <b>1</b> The article refered to was in Australia's most popular newspaper and even after the investigation was still shown to be <b>substantially correct</b>. <b>2</b> Every major Australian political party has links on their page to websites not only from newspapers, but from other political parties, whose sole purpose is to discredit them. I resent any suggestion that I am not being neutral. I am being more fair to the greens than other editors are being to other political parties. Given the way you are just throwing around accusations, I may just re-insert the Family First link, as it is <b>a</b> relevant, <b>b</b> fully referenced, <b>c</b> far more tame than many other links that spout full on slander.

My mistake.

<dd>I have added some Liberal and Democrat views from the 2004 election. Not sure quite frankly that they offer much insights - you need to go more between the lines. The broken record of the Prime Minister on the links between Labor and the Greens dowes not come through from one speech - it is when you realise he said it many many times through the elction and had nothing else to say that it becomes more interesting - the absence of any meaningful comment on Greens' policies is harder to depict. The weasling of the Democrats that they prefer the Greens to Pauline Hanson is well - what can one say but they are trying not to disenfranchise sympathisers - or that is how I read it. Could be fascinating but would veer into the realm of original research. In summary I found it hard to raise any other party's views of the Greens, certainly not in such categorical terms as Family First.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 23:22, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps rather than relying on external links, we ought to bite the bullet and create a section on other parties' criticisms of the Greens? (Or more broadly, 'relations with other parties'?) Balancing for NPOV would be tricky, but we seem to be having that problem anyway, and it would allow us to cover some things that aren't well explained on any single site. Explaining the political relationships would also help put some of these criticisms in perspective - for instance, the fact that the Greens and Democrats are to some extent rivals for the same political niche colours interpretation of their criticisms of one another. Most of the links that have been posted here previously could be worked into such a section at appropriate points. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 02:38, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Q: Is Bob Brown the leader of the Greens?</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>No. Bob Brown is the Greens Senator for Tasmania. From 1998 to 2001 he was the only member of the Greens in federal parliament so he has naturally been the spokesperson for the Greens. He is labelled by the media as the "leader" of the Greens because all the other parties have leaders. Since Kerry Nettle was elected to federal Parliament as Senator for NSW in 2002, she is equally a spokesperson for the party.</i></dd>

<dd><i>The Greens don't have leaders. We have various people who do various jobs. In WA there are five Green MPs. None of the five is the "leader". Each is a spokesperson for various issues.</i></dd>

But Kerry Nettle is not equally a spokesperson, nor is any other Green. Yes, in theory, there is no leader, but in the public realm that is only one Greens member that has a role anything like that of offical leaders of the other major parties, and that is Bob Brown. Behind closed Green doors it may be a different story. In any case, some sort of connection between "Bob Brown" and "leader" is warranted. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatturn_857b.html" title="User:Matturn">matturn</a> 13:41, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The upcoming National Conference of the Australian Greens in Hobart next weekend will be dealing with this issue. There is a motion from the Senators to create the Leadership position. I don't think it's worthy of placing in the article, but worth noting that, while it is disputed about how this person will be elected, Bob Brown will certainly win any leadership contest at the moment, and by the next election the position will have been created. I also wanted to flag that I've fixed up references to the State Convenors on the state pages. While that's not on this page, I don't want to have to explain it 8 different times. The position of Convenor in the Greens, state, federal, and at every level, is an administrative position, similar to a party president, not like a leadership position, and it is misleading to describe it as such. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraue_8793.html" title="User:Braue">Braue</a> 02:41, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a note to say that I believe Peter Campbell who's made a few edits, is an Australian Greens candidate. He's also conveniently made his own page - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Campbell" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Campbell" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> - which is kind of vanity page, but may well be encyclopedic.

<p>There are many politically aligned people on Wikipedia. Many of whom edit articles which they are involved with the subject matter of. As long as Peter Campbell edits in an NPOV way, he should not be barred from editing any article. It also might be useful to point out our NPOV policy to him if he becomes too POV. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 01:55, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I'd guess that <i>most</i> of the political content on Wikipedia is written by people with strong political views (me included&#160;:-) - we generally rely on the editing process to prevent bias, rather than people recusing themselves. But people are discouraged from writing articles about <i>themselves</i>, because it's very hard to keep those neutral (see <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>) and hence, listing of Peter Campbell on VfD. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 02:07, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not currently an Australian Greens candidate - but I have nominated for preselection at state level in Victoria again. I have been surprised by the amount of other party POV content in sections of this article, along with some important ommissions and some innaccuracies - which I have amended/corrected. I am not too familiar with the detailed Wikipedia processes yet, but I am learning. I don't like having "conflict of interest" levelled at me though. If this accusation stands I will refrain from any further edits. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 12:19, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Jgritz may have been suggesting that there could be a conflict of interest, but he does not represent Wikipedia policy. From what I know, Wikipedia values every editor, and acknowledges that everyone has their own views. Wikipedia just asks people to write in a way that represents a neutral point of view. So, instead of saying "Bill Gates sucks because he supports software patents only when it suits him", we say something along the lines of "Bill Gates has been widely criticised for his support of software patents. It is commonly claimed that Microsoft uses software patents as a way of stifling competition."</dd>
<dd>Please continue editing any article that interests you. I think it is Wikipedia policy to discourage you from editing your own (Peter Campbell) article, but even then, no one is out to stop you. - James Foster 13:37, 20 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, actually, not even that's correct. <i>"Bill Gates has been widely criticised for his support of software patents. It is commonly claimed that Microsoft uses software patents as a way of stifling competition"</i> is an example of <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a>. Everything on Wikipedia must be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> and controversial statements, such as the above, would need <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">references</a> to a valid third-party source (as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> is prohibited). However, James' encouraging comments are true: it's great to see someone involved in Australian politics editing Wikipedia; I'd imagine you'd be quite knowledgeable in important areas (check out <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australian_politics_8b5c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian politics">WikiProject Australian politics</a>).

<dd>Probably not possible to be <i>perfectly</i> neutral, but some pages are closer to neutral than others. Members of a party are in a great position to provide inside detail and fact-checking on some angles, but perhaps not so good at discussing the party's negatives - even with honest intentions, it's hard to argue against your own side. IMHO, the best people to write about a party are a <i>mixture</i> of its supporters and its opponents, plus a few unaligned... and a wiki is a reasonably good way to make that sort of collaboration work. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 22:29, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tanner leafletted his entire electorate (Melbourne) with information on "mad Greens policies". I will see if I can track down a copy of the leaflet and any references to it. Interestingly, the Liberals then lifted several of Tanner's anti-Green quotes onto their own "green coloured" leaflet which was selectively letter boxed in Kooyong and Chisholm, and mailed out by Lib Senator Judith Troeth at least to some people in Balwyn. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 05:14, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that of the references were mislinked. Firstly, the Article contains a reference 14 and 15, but these are not present in the list of reference links at the end. Secondly, reference 13, after the 'they have even been called fascists' sentence is actually a link to a press statement regarding the Herald Sun, and makes no mention of who called The Greens fascists, or to the comment ever being made. I can think of several people who would make a comment like that, but am very curious to find out who it was!&#160;:) I'm not sure what links references 13-15 are supposed to be to, is there someone who does, who could fix them up?

<dd>The actual links seem to be OK, but not the numbers displaying on them.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The discrepancy between the total number of references within the article and at the end seems to be because three of them (numbered 9, 10, &amp; 11 in the article) are direct links to the sources rather than pointing to anything in the 'References' section.

<dd>It's sloppy wording, but that's not where the issue lies. Vallentine was elected in 1984 as an NDP Senator, resigned to sit as an independent, and joined the Western Australian Greens - then a seperate, if related party - in 1990. The WA Greens - and with them Senators Vallentine, Chamarette and Margetts (who all preceded Brown anyway, making the replacement statement in the article incorrect) were not part of the federal Greens until 2002. Brown was the first <i>Australian Greens</i> Senator in 1996. Rachel Siewert, elected in 2004, is the first WA Green to actually be part of the federal party. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 04:38, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The current wording says that Bob Brown was the second Greens parliamentarian. In fact he was the fourth.

<li>I'd agree with your assessment, Peter; it would appear (I won't bother attrib. in a talk page) that the ex-democrat vote has not simply xfrd to the Greens, either in the Aus. state elections of recent weeks or elections in the last few years.

<p>Interesting difference btw the Greens and Dems. When distributing preferences, people who vote for the Democrates preference Labor over Liberal by a 2:1 ratio, whereas Greens voters favour Labor over the Liberals by a 4:1 ratio.

<dd>Let's not go nuts here. Where does my edit quoted above talk about one-to-one transfer? Don't forget that the Dems have historically attracted a lot of disenchanted Labor voters, especially during the Kernot/Stott Despoja periods of leadership; these voters aren't going to be heading for the Liberals any time soon. And of course, a lot of "bet hedgers" would vote for a major party in the House and minor in the Senate. The Dems fobbed this themselves after passing the GST; now someone looking for the same effect in the Senate will vote Green (actively encouraged by Green candidates; I still remember Mike Stasse's 'never forget the Democrat's GST' sign). <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus">speak up!</a></small> 09:59, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah. The entire history section really needs clarifying in this respect. It really needs to lay out exactly when each state group affiliated, and detail the working relationship between the parties during the 1990s (what links they had, if any, before 1996, and the working relationship between Margetts and Brown between 1996-98). It needs to make clear that Brown, Nettle, Siewert, Milne and Organ are the only people to represent the party federally, and stop trying to claim (at all) that Vallentine, Chamarette or Margetts were actually Australian Greens Senators. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 00:32, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, our vision of the future is based on the four interconnecting pillars of social justice, environmental responsibility, peace and nonviolence, and participatory democracy." (National-level policy pages seem to be offline at the moment, but those same four pillars are listed at the federal-level site.)</dd>

<dd>If both the Greens and their opponents agree that the party is not just about environmental issues, it hardly seems controversial to say that they no longer have a reputation as a single-issue party. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 03:02, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
