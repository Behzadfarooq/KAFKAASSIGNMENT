I think a campaign to write "NO DAMS" on ballots at a Tasmanian (Bass?) bielection in the early 80's help convince the ALP to adopt a policy of preventing the Franklin Dam and that these votes were still counted.</p>

<dd>This tactic was used twice:<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>1. At the 1981 (I think) referendum held by the Tasmanian government which asked the voters to choose between two dams. Those who didn't want either dam wrote NO DAMS. These votes <i>were</i> informal because the voters refused to express a choice between the two options given. 2. At the 1983 federal election the No Dams people urged their supporters to write NO DAMS on their ballots. These votes were formal provided the numbers were filled in correctly. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Adam_Carr_8ba5.html" title="User:Dr Adam Carr">Dr Adam Carr</a> 07:04, 23 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Could you change the wording so it is clear that writing on ballot papers does not make them informal?</p>
<p><br />
This is getting of the topic, but according to the [<a href="http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/tpl/InfoSheets/referendums.htm|Tasmanian" class="external text" title="http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/tpl/InfoSheets/referendums.htm|Tasmanian" rel="nofollow">parlimentary website</a>] many of the referendum ballots with NO DAMS written on them still expressed a preference. These were initially deemed informal, but then counted as formal after legal advice!</p>
<p>I looked at your website, Dr Adam Carr, and I see that the Bass Bielection was in 1975! What was I thinking?</p>

<p><i>Preferential voting is the Australian expression for what is called elsewhere the single transferable vote (STV) or instant runoff voting (IRV).

<p>I've heard "it's not compulsory to vote, only to get your name checked off the electoral roll" from many people. However, none of them so far have offered a cite for this claim; "hard to prosecute" doesn't mean "legal".</p>
<p>The Electoral Act<a href="http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/html/pasteact/0/57/0/PA003170.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/html/pasteact/0/57/0/PA003170.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is quite clear: "It shall be the duty of every elector to vote at each election." It repeatedly refers thereafter to "failure to vote" in the regulations concerning punishment for non-voting.</p>
<p>AFAICT, the confusion arises from other portions of the Act which note that failure to get marked off the rolls can be considered as evidence of failure to vote (and in practice, that's the usual form of evidence). However, I'm yet to see anything saying that this is the *only* form of evidence that would be accepted.</p>
<p>If I walk in, get my name checked off, tear up the ballot I'm given in front of the officials and other witnesses, then sign a stat dec. confirming that I did not vote... it seems to me that I could well and truly be fined under section 245. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 02:44, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The counter example to this claim would be the electoral system in the ACT - specifically electronic voting. You are allowed by the computer programme to cast an invalid vote, or even submit a "blank" ballot (ie no vote cast), although it will apparently try to gently persuade you to actually vote formal. This would suggest something greater than mere acceptance of something that is hard to prevent, and at least a pseudo-legality to informal voting in the ACT.</p>

<p>When did we start using the term "ballot access" in Australia? - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronhill_5384.html" title="User:Aaronhill">Aaron Hill</a> 02:12, Oct 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Never, and I have been reverting the use of this term as often as it appears.</li>
<li>On the above discussion, the law is quite clear that it is compulsory to vote, not just to turn up at a polling station. The polling officials cannot prevent people casting blank ballots, and probably cannot stop a person putting the ballot in the bin rather than in the ballot box. But they would probably mark such a person as having not voted. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 07:08, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

Something needs to be explained (for ease of reading), but I feel this much is not really necessary. 6) Voting is compulsory. Is this enforced? How? 7) A map of the electorates (the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_electorates.html" title="Australian electorates">Australian_electorates</a> is just a stub) would be useful, since it is not very clear what the electorates are. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeronimo_378d.html" title="User:Jeronimo">Jeronimo</a> 07:13, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Forgive me, I'm a lawyer, and I tend to remember things mostly if they generated interesting litigation, but what about Albert Langer and his bizarre campaign (whenever it was; 1993? 1996?) to promote the option of voting validly but without distributing preferences between whichever candidates you consider to be the equal worst. There was a prosecution, and some legislative amendments.

<dd>Langer's "vote 1, 2, 2, 2" campaign &amp; prosecution for it were 1996 - see <a href="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/Martin_def.html" class="external text" title="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/Martin_def.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~anarch/whoweare.html" class="external text" title="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~anarch/whoweare.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for instance.

<p>The article suggests that failure to fill out all the boxes on a ballot paper renders a vote informal. However, it then goes on to discuss an actual election result (Helen Caldicott's attempt on parliament). In those tables refererence is made to "exhausted" votes. These are votes that have <b>run out of preferences</b> - that is, did not have any more votes beyond the person just eliminated (or only included preferences for other eliminated candidates). It is claimed that the Electoral Act has been changed since it would nice to have a date. I helped scrutinise at the 2000 ACT election and virtually any sort of vote was allowed (even ones with additional "made up" candidates added to the ballot paper and then included in the preferences). Maybe this is just a Canberra thing.</p>
<p>The AEC link provided is slightly vague (while seeming to confirm the statement through its definition of a formal vote, the definition of what is an informal vote does not include a failure to fill all the squares, just a duplication or uncertainty about the voter's intention - although there is another page with a summary of types of "informal" votes including the ones otulined above).</p>
<p>The claim that (Under ss.240 and 245(1) "in scrutinising ballot papers for formality the franchise will be favoured" suggests that a vote is formal as long as the voter's intention is clear. Filling out the form with 1,3,4,5 is valid because the intention of order is clear. Similarly filling out a ballot with 1,2,3,3,4 will be formal as long as the vote is not attempted to be transfered beyond the second preference (as up to this point the voter's intention is clear).</p>
<p>Even the used of X is accepted. Voting X,2,3,4 will usually be accepted by scrutineers as a valid vote for the candidate with the X first and the preferences following.</p>
<p>Maybe there is a difference between "informal" and "disenfranchised" here. There appear to be contradictions in the AEC stuff, general knowledge and practical application here. --Jlsa</p>

<p>Blimey! Now they tell me, after all these years... My grandmother used to give them all a tick, to be fair to everyone...</p>
<p>On a more serious note, can anyone tell me WHERE it says informal voting is illegal? Because that is what the article is suggesting:</p>
<p>In practice, while illegal, informal voting - going through the motions of voting without actually filling in a valid ballot - is near-impossible to prosecute, given the secret nature of the ballot.</p>
<p>The legislation cited seems to make not voting illegal. But informal voting is still voting, wouldn't it be called something like "informal non-voting"? I think maybe someone has misinterpreted the legislation cited here. Or confused "informal voting" with "advocating informal voting". <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeslegloupier_8007.html" title="User:Georgeslegloupier">Georgeslegloupier</a> 15:06, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The legislation doesn't say it is every elector's "duty to attempt to vote". It's clearly a pedantic point, but I believe we need a lawyer's opinion to suggest an informal vote is legal, as compared to an unenforceable illegality. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkhurd_585b.html" title="User:Markhurd">Mark Hurd</a> 05:28, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found this a little while ago that states that voting informal is legal:</p>
<p>"A few years ago all the major parties passed an amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act making it illegal to encourage people to vote informal or in any other way not specified by the Act. Maximum penalty: imprisonment for six months. Although it is quite legal to actually vote informal, it is now a crime to advocate doing so." <a href="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/Martin_def.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/Martin_def.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeslegloupier_8007.html" title="User:Georgeslegloupier">Georgeslegloupier</a> 16:11, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And the reason is that the SA legislation has the same wording as the Federal one mentioned in the article (and above), but point (2) is added to explicitly allow blank ballot papers.

<dd>IIRC, that "voting informal is illegal" was my edit. Looking back at it, I think I mentally amalgamated "voting informal" with "not voting", which I shouldn't have. It's clear that "not voting" is an offence - see refs in the preceding paragraph - but not so clear (to me, at least) whether an informal ballot would count as "not voting". (While we might refer to it as an 'informal vote', that doesn't necessarily mean it's a 'vote' in legal terms; I don't have a Macquarie handy, but dictionary.com defines a vote as a "formal expression of preference", and I'm not convinced an informal vote counts as either 'formal' or an 'expression of preference'.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I'm not a lawyer and looking back on it, I don't think I had good grounds for including that claim, so I've removed it. The article could do with something on the illegality of <i>advocating</i> informal votes, but that's a separate issue (and wasn't the basis for my claim that voting informal is illegal). --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 08:32, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it worth noting or even clarifying the point that quite a few Australians believe that "preference deals" are given to other parties automatically without the voter's consent? As an Example: In QLD I vote (optional preferential system) 1 for the Fishing Party without voting for anyone else, once the vote has been counted it has been exhausted, but quite a few people think that because the Fishing Party did a "preference deal" with the Cotton Underwear party, my vote than goes to that party (in a close count). This seems to be perpetuated by the Australian media quite a bit, when the real meaning of "preference deals" is that a party will "direct" someone to vote in a certain way via a How-to-Vote card, but there is no automatic mechanism that makes it happen unless the voter willingly follows the How-to-vote card.--81.144.244.194 15:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)Lucas</p>
<p>The situation in the Senate is rather different, because there we have compulsory full preferential voting - the voter must <i>either</i> vote above the line, in which case their preferences are allocated as their party has directed, <i>or</i> vote below the line, in which case they must fill in every square themselves. In practice more than 95% of voters vote above the line, which means that a preference deal between (say) Family First and the ALP <i>will</i> result in the overwhelming majority of preferences being allocated according to the terms of that deal - which is how Steve Fielding got elected, and also how various obscure people got elected to the NSW Legislative Council despite getting hardly any first preference votes. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:16, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There seems to be a gap in Wikipedia's coverage of joint sittings of the House and Senate. One would come to the conclusion that the only time a joint sitting could ever be held is under s.57, following a double dissolution. However, casual vacancies in the representation of the ACT in the Senate (and presumably of the NT as well), are filled not by nomination by the relevant "state" parliament (the ACT or NT Legislative Assembly), but by a joint sitting of the Federal Parliament. This is precisely how <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Reid_83da.html" title="Margaret Reid">Margaret Reid</a> was chosen to replace John Knight. As far as I can see there is absolutely nothing about this in any article at present. Indeed, there seems to be nothing about how casual vacancies in either house of parliament are filled. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 13:00, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the reasons for Australia adopting Compulsory Voting could be looked into a little more than "a duty to defend freedoms so dearly bought". Writing that 60,000 Australians died "defending freedom" seems a bit of a generalisation.</p>
