<p><i>Australia did not play a single Test match during this period.</i></p>

<p>When I first read through the article, I noticed that the lists of various top batsmen and such tended to break the continuity of the article. Perhaps these can go into a separate article? I'd also suggest that a list of contracted players be provided instead of having the list of player numbers at the end. The current list contains people like Di Venuto and Higgs, who probably won't have the opportunity to play for Australia in the future, while omitting Warne, who's still an integral part of the test side.</p>
<p>I'd go ahead and make these changes, but being a bit of a n00b when it comes to this, I thought it best to ask the opinion of others first. <a href="../../../o/m/d/User%7EOmdal_6d11.html" title="User:Omdal">Omdal</a> 04:15, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it incorrect to say something like:</p>
<p>"Australia is a team having won 365 of the 603 One Day Internationals <b>they</b> have played against other countries."</p>
<p>We shouldn't say "they" - rather we should say "it" as we are referring to the collective unit of the team, not the players. I wont revert the last edits cause I think we should just see what people think first.</p>
<p>Also, I think when saying Australia is the leading team in tests and ODIs, its useful to reference the ICC test and ODI tables which say such rather than just the statement. Again I wont revert the edits as I think its worth the debate. This article contains a fair bit of point of view, which we should try to avoid.

<dd>I believe the correct usage in Commonwealth English is pluralisation - e.g. "Australia have won the toss" and "Australia are batting first" rather than "Australia has won the toss" and "Australia is batting first". So it is "they", as a plural combination of players, rather than "it" as a singular entity. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 13:25, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An Australian cricketer can be assigned up to three different numbers. The first of these numbers is their test match designation. This is the order in which the particular player was selected to play test cricket relative to all other test cricketers from Australia. So for example players who were selected in the first ever test match side would have the numbers one through 11. The second of the three numbers is the one day designation. As like the test designation this one day number represents the order in which the player was selected to play one-day cricket. ^hese numbers are known as "Cap numbers" (as they are embroidered into the players caps) and do not change throughout the player's career. the third number is the jersey number. Jersey numbers are assigned to all contracted one-day cricket players. A player may have more than one jersey number throughout their career. Also, two players may share the same jersey number as jersey numbers are reused from generation to generation. don't forget that the players test designation will be different to the players one-day designation as test matches have been around longer than one day matches. Also don't forget that it's possible for a player to only have one number the test designation as test match uniforms do not have jersey numbers on them only one-day uniforms. I hope this clears this matter up. --220.237.166.156 12:29, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm thinking of adding this paragraph "Some fans, while acknowledging rebuilding is going on within the team, feel Austrlia's current problems have paritally come about as a result of a run of bad umpiring in their matches. While this umpiring does affect both teams in the match the Australians seem to be on the recieving end of the worst of the decisions. Against teams of similar ablity, such as England, this has cost the Australians matches."</p>

<li>Simply my opinion, but personally I think the umpires are all strongly pro-Australian except for Taufel, who is excellent.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">ßlηguγΣη</span></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> - <a href="../../../e/r/_/WP%7EER_5c78.html" title="WP:ER">review me</a> 08:18, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

All it means is that the batting order was pretty inexperienced and not making a great contribution and the only person who could be relied upon to make any significant contribution was Allan Border - How could this be considered weasel words? It doesn't show some great devotion to Allan Border, merely attempts to illustrate the situation; pointing out that the team was not posting any great achievements during this time.--165.228.217.234 07:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The list of contracted players confused me hugely. I was browsing them and read that Nathan Bracken had player 300+ games for Australia. So had all the team. Of course, after a while I realised that these referred to the numbers under their badge. Surely though, these columns should be re-named or changed to the number of the games they've played (which would be far more useful). Cap columns normally refer to the number of games they've played. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornetMike_bb8b.html" title="User:HornetMike">HornetMike</a> 18:58, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The more and more I look at this page I don't like it. The contents of the most part is fine however there is a lot of redundant information, and information that appears on other pages. The following is a list of all the edits I have done.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have moved the list of significant dates to the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>I have removed the lists from the tournament sections. I have replaced them with articles. Most articles I have started and added and expand section tag. if people want a list of the winners they can head to the pages for the tournaments which are linked in the titles. I have purposely left these articles to be expanded at a later date. I have done this because right now I want to focus on this page as a whole, then get into the specifics.</li>
<li>I have set up a trivia section at the bottom of this page. I have also converted trivia that appears throughout this page into the correct list format.</li>
<li>I have consolidated all the images throughout this article into one photo Gallery at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>Consolidated the 1880 section into a paragraph not three separate lists.</li>
</ul>
<p>that's enough for now however there is still a lot more formatting work to be done. Since no one else seems to be editing this page to much I will come back later and continue the job. by no means is anything that I'm doing permanent or set in stone so if you have any suggestions please voice them.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStewartM82_ed90.html" title="User:StewartM82">StewartM82</a> 14:40, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the images are much better at the relevant point of the article. Trivia shoudl either be left out, or incorporated in the appropriate section - there is no need for a trivia list. Less importantly, I feel that if a list of dates is necessary at all, it is better at the top. What the article really needs is for the various history sections to be written as interesting prose, rather than simply lists. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 14:52, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>the images I don't mind in setting throughout the article that's fine. as for the trivia and the list of dates, I challenge you to find me a wikipedia article that does not list the trivia at the bottom all in one section.

<p>The infobox has a place for the coach. We also mention the assistant coach, which is reasonable but not necesssary.

JPD, I see your point of view, but i'm willing to bet the fielding coach has a bigger impact on the team (and is more respected by the players) than the assistant coach. Btw, I have nothing against the assistant coach...</p>

<p>Okay, this is a nice article, but it leaves me puzzling over the state of Australian cricket (i.e. Australian national cricket, not intercolonial cricket) between 1877 and 1905. Cricket Australia (formerly the Australian Cricket Board) was formed in 1905, four years after Federation and Australia has been a Test nation since 1877. Thus prior from 1877 to 1901 the Australian cricket team represented a number of colonies (rather like the West Indies cricket team did originally in 1928 and like how the Irish cricket team represents two entities,though non-colonial, today). My questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>what body oversaw the Australian cricket team between 1877 and 1905?</li>
<li>and what flag, if any, was used to represent Australia between 1877 and 1901 (since the Australian flag was only adopted in 1901 and I don't imagine that they would pick the flag of only one colony to represent all the Australian colonies)?72.27.8.49 02:29, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I think you are overestimating the amount of organisation that went on at the time. I don't know the details of how the early Australian teams were managed, but the early Test tours were each organised separately, often at the initiative of individuals, and home teams were often selected by the club hosting the matches. The teams were not often fully representative, and it is only in hindsight that these mathces have been labelled "Test matches", a term which was first used in 1885.</dd>
<dd>There is no reason why any flag would necessarily have been used to represent the team, and if any flags were used, they probably varied from tour to tour if not match to match. The only mention I have seen of any such flag was in the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Morning_Herald_ca72.html" title="Sydney Morning Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a>'s Column 8 in September 2002:
<dl>
<dd>"For six years Dover Heights vexillologist George Poulos has searched vainly for one of Australia's earliest national flags. In 1899, two years before the Federation, England was toured by an Australian cricket team flying a green and gold flag. He says green and gold were chosen because they were not used by any of the colonial teams squabbling over the colours. "But not even the Australian Cricket Board has any idea what the flag looks like... I am aching to see it." He hopes a descendant of the players has a picture tucked away."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The old coat of arms of the ACB was already also used on that 1899 tour. It was one of many similar unofficial Australian coats of arms at the time, roughly based on the NSW arms. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 10:55, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
