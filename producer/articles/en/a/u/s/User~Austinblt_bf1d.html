	    <p><b>BLT: BETTER LUCKTOMORROW</b><br />
<br />
Tommy and Austin began playing guitar in yrs 5-6. Once in highschool, they joined a band with older, more experienced guys. Once they learnt more than 4 chords, they began playing with a drummer by the name of Mitch Stanger (heart shot), singer Jocie P and Bass guitarist Rick G. They played under the name of '20% Female', and played at a couple of school performances. In this time, Luke Neely had begun to play drums, and Charlie Hill began Guitar.</p>
<p>After about a year however, 20% Female fell apart, and Tommy and Austin began to jam with Luke, who was picking up drums very quickly. the guys jammed on a regular basis, but needed a bass guitarist. Charlie had approached us about joining the band, but as we already had two guitarists, we suggested he learnt bass. Charlie instantly got into bass and over the next year became the next flea. He picked it up quickly, and in just a year and a half, can play bass as fast as the guys play ing guitar.</p>
<p>Under the name Big Left Toe, or BLT, They began playing at many school related band nights, and won the school battle of the bands competition. BLT continue to play at parties, band gigs and competitions, and just recently took out the battle of the bands comp at Tara.</p>
<p>Anyone need a band for their party? because... WE WILL PLAY AT YOUR PARTIES!!!!!!!!!</p>

CHARLIE HILL<br />
Charlie lives in Dural down Carters Rd next door to Greg (The Yellow Wiggle). He is 16, and has been playing bass for about a year now. He loves the Chili Peppers, by far his most favourite band ever. Don't worry, he's not another flea copy, his style is very different to Flea's. He is influenced by Victor Wooten as most bass players are. He is currently writing some more serious songs with much greater technical skill. He loves slapping and melodic bass lines. He loves his music all the time and he LOVES JAMMIN, improv is the best, he loves to play with new people whether they be funky drummers, hardcore shredders or old school rocker/blues masters. He wants to make music for the rest of his life. bloodsugarsexmagik_rhcp431@hotmail.com<br />

AUSTIN UEBEL<br />
I am an Arcadian from Galston High. I am known for my lame jokes, and can be funny when i want to be. I have a line 6 - 75 watt - and two practice amps. I love to play Blink 182, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The living End and The Offspring. I play guitar, mostly rythm, cos i sing a lot in BLT. I play a Gibson SG standard, which i bought off ebay not too long ago. Its pretty much my pride and joy... I have a few idols in rock; Angus Young, Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Chris Cheney, Joe Satriani, John Frusciante, Steve Vai, Flea, Tom Delonge, Anthony Keidis and Yngwie Malmsteen. Tommy and i met Joe Satriani when he played at the Enmore...That was awesome. I've also been to see The Living End, with Kisschasey and Gyroscope supporting, which was a mad experience, and am going to RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!! I like writing riffs and ideas for songs, and i love the feeling of playing something i wrote. I enjoy meeting other guitarists and musicians, and others in general, so feel free to contact me. www.myspace.com/austins_west_end_riot austinissmiling@hotmail.com Add me&#160;;)<br />
<br />
TOMMY HENRY<br />
Im the guitarist/singer of the band along with Austin. I live in Galston near the Gorge. I play a crappy Ibanez GIO - dark green... My favourite band is AC/DC and my favourite guitarists are Angus Young, Joe Satriani, John Frusciante and Chris Cheney. I really want to get a new guitar with a floyd rose tremolo but cant decide which one to get. Music is my passion and i always want to be in a band. I love the feeling of playing in front of other people or just jamming with the band at my place.&#160;;)<br />
<br />
LUKE NEELY<br />
My name is Luke Benjamin Keith Neely, I have four names because I'm English and I'm cool because my name is actually Luke Neely II. Steve Kemsley, my teacher, is a major influence, along with Lewis Matheson, Travis Barker, and Chadd Smith. I play a Tama Superstar which is blue and I like playing it and I like to spend time with it and I also like to tell it how I'm feeling when I'm upset. But it gets to me when I hit the rims, which I'm learning to stop doing FOR F****S SAKE. I'm 16 and I was born in 1990, in a little town in west Europe. I have dark brown hair but I like to think it's black, I have about ten girl's at school that want me to go out with them but I don't like cheating so I say maybe and then I don't go to school for months so they can get over me. My favourite bands are Living End, Feeder, Blink 182 but I'm angry with Tom Delonge and think he's a tool now, even though he looks like Jake Hardy. I currently live in Australia.</p>
