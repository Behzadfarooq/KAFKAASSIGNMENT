<h2><span class="mw-headline">Naming convention for geographic places - conclusion</span></h2>
<p>After much discussion, debate, toing and froing and general mayhem at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Australian_places_6c79.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Australian places">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Australian places</a>, the various views were distilled to the following logical and comprehensive <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decision_tree.html" title="Decision tree">decision tree</a>:</p>
<div style="background: #efefff; margin-top: 1em; padding: 7px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
<ul>
<li>All City, suburb, town articles use the format <b>[[Town, State]]</b>, e.g. <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Eliza%2C_Victoria_c884.html" title="Mount Eliza, Victoria">Mount Eliza, Victoria</a>;</li>
<li>Unambiguously named geographic features use <b>[[Geographic Feature]]</b>, e.g. <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluru.html" title="Uluru">Uluru</a>;</li>
<li>Ambiguously named features that cross state borders use <b>[[Geographic Feature (Australia)]]</b> format, e.g. Snowy River (Australia);</li>
<li>Ambiguously named features that are unambiguous within a state use <b>[[Geographic Feature (State)]]</b>, e.g. Mount Eliza (Western Australia);</li>
<li>Ambiguously named features that are ambiguous within a state use districts or regions, <b>[[Geographic Feature (LGA, State)]]</b>, e.g. Mount Eliza (Gippsland, Victoria) (although option may exist here of simply using Mount Eliza (Gippsland) where there is little risk of confusing the location of the feature);</li>
<li>Ambiguously named features that are co-located and therefore cannot be distinguished on location use <b>[[Geographic Feature (type)]]</b>, e.g. Wolfe Creek (crater) and Wolfe Creek (watercourse) (used only where there is no other Wolfe Creek anywhere else);</li>
<li>Pathological case: Features that include co-located features of different types AND features in other states use <b>[[Geographic Feature (State-ian type)]]</b> e.g. Arthur River (Western Australian river);</li>

<p>I've already summarised it at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28places%29_59d5.html#Australia" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)">naming conventions</a>, but I have to admit, I'm not too keen on the red links I have left behind. I encourage you to have a quick look to ensure it fits in reasonably well where it is. I haven't added it yet to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australian_places_223a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian places">Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian places</a> itself - I imagine it should be. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">πίππύ δ'Ω∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 07:29, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re the last dot point recently added: "contradicts <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Rivers_e9c8.html#Naming" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Rivers">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Rivers#Naming</a>" - I've just had a quick look and can't see a huge contradiction - in fact, generally speaking it seems to fit in quite neatly. The only problem that may exist is that they don't broach the point of "Pathological cases", which we needed to for a comprehensive guideline. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">πίππύ δ'Ω∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 22:55, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dont know if any else has suggested this but i thought with the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Census_in_Australia_7249.html" title="Census in Australia">2006 Australian Census</a> approaching we could have our own on wikipedia. This would mainly be a geographic census, a attempt to find out were most Aussie wikipedians are from. Not all wikipedians use userboxes and the categories mainly divide us up by state. I propose spliting each state up into regions like <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regions_of_Western_Australia_b8b9.html" title="Regions of Western Australia">Regions of Western Australia</a>, this would define were you are from without going into to much detail (eg. town, city). <a href="../../../h/o/s/User%7EHossen27_2e47.html" title="User:Hossen27">Hossen27</a> 13:01, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been having a revert stoush with <a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EICanDoItNineTimes_153c.html" title="User:ICanDoItNineTimes">User:ICanDoItNineTimes</a> over <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Oliphant_8d9d.html" title="Mark Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>. He has been including that Oliphant was a triplet and is officially named Mark Oliphant III. As someone who researched Oliphant to produce the article I know this to be rubbish. After a couple of reverts, the user suggested that as a compromise he leave out the triplet business and just mention that Oliphant was the III. I am certain he is talking through his ring, especially as the user is considered a sockpuppet, but I don't want to be seen deleting edits without asking for a source, which I have done. Anyway, I mention this in case anyone wants to be bolder than me and revert his edits again and then possibly ban the account for repeated vandalism. --<a href="../../../r/o/i/User%7ERoisterer_ae8b.html" title="User:Roisterer">Roisterer</a> 04:53, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm surprised at this response. I'm pretty sure Prime Ministers' spouses <i>would</i> be notable - Tammie Fraser and Sonia McMahon certainly (news articles, public events, public comment all involve them). And if they're not we won't create (or categorise) the article. I don't see what's wrong with categorising people on the basis of who they're married to - it's factual, it's accurate, and here it is the reason, like it or not, for their notability. Let's face it, <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Keating_van_Iersal_3be9.html" title="Anita Keating van Iersal">Anita Keating van Iersal</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janette_Howard_9110.html" title="Janette Howard">Janette Howard</a> wouldn't have articles if they weren't the spouses of someone notable.

<dd>Being maried to someone notable, doesn't mean that person meets WP:BIO - it pops up frequently on afd, spouses almost always get redirected. Not one of the wives of the 17 dead PMs (assuming she is also dead) has an article in in the Australian Dictionary of Biography. It might be beause Australians don't hold the PMs wife in high regard, but its also likely that most of these women didn't lead extraordinary lives.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">Peta</a> 05:51, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suspect that Janette Howard has not lead a life more extraordinary than that of the 15 or so other Prime Ministerial spouses. My proposal is that we research, find sources, and create articles to remedy a systemic bias in coverage. And to re-emphasise, I don't hold the view that all Prime Ministerial spouses are <i>ipso facto</i> notable - but given they are usually participants in public life, most would be. If a given Prime Ministerial spouse is not notable, then we won't create an article - but I refuse to believe that can be the case for all of them. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus">speak up!</a></small> 06:01, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mount_Buller%2C_Victoria&amp;curid=2137311&amp;diff=67740839&amp;oldid=67025026" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mount_Buller%2C_Victoria&amp;curid=2137311&amp;diff=67740839&amp;oldid=67025026" rel="nofollow">edit to Mount Buller</a> led me to an article on Snowsports interactive, an Australian company incorporated last year that employs 30 people.</p>
<p>I suspect the company isn't notable enough for wikipedia. Googling for "Snowsports interactive" and whispar, for example, only gets 22 unique hits. However, it has got one or two technology articles for having the first wireless in an Aussie ski slope, and has won an award.</p>
<p>Another factor is that the only edits have been by User:Mbrett (who is presumably Michael Brett, Chief Engineer for the company), and by anonymous IPs, who (apart from User:203.55.158.100) apparently haven't edited any other articles (though that could just be dynamic IPs for you).</p>
<p>Any thoughts? Also, would mentioning that Mount Buller has wireless be more suited for wikitravel than wikipedia? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 13:58, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Although their mention on <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Buller_da2f.html" title="Mount Buller">Mount Buller</a>, along with the name of the owner of the lifts, is questionable, the articles and award make them notable IMHO, and we'll have to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> for the rest, since they respect <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComte0_c1bb.html" title="User:Comte0">Comte0</a> 14:47, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's a further notable event that this startup company, which has only been around for 12 months (and has about 15 people, not 30), is now installing a similar network at Sun Peaks Resort in Canada, and has successfully raised almost $1.5m in private financing, including from VC investors.

<p>Currently most instances of this infobox use the Statistical Division/District population, and rank the cities using the same. I propose we use the Urban Centre population figures instead, because Stat Divisions and Districts exist only for the 40 or so biggest cities, and major population centres like the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Coast%2C_New_South_Wales_1d0f.html" title="Central Coast, New South Wales">Central Coast</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maitland%2C_New_South_Wales_68d8.html" title="Maitland, New South Wales">Maitland</a> are ignored because they are parts of other Stat Districts. There is an Urban Centre figure available for every town in Australia with more than 1000 people, allowing this box to be used for lesser population centres and also those big ones that belong to another larger centre. See also the discussion taking place at <a href="../../../s/y/d/Talk%7ESydney_0c43.html#Population" title="Talk:Sydney">Talk:Sydney</a> about the relative merits and meanings of both sets of figures. - <big><span style="color:#FF0000;">҉</span></big> <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandwicked_8ae2.html" title="User:Randwicked">Randwicked</a> <big><span style="color:#FF0000;">҉</span></big> 02:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No opinions on this?

<dd>It would also be grossly misleading to use density data for one part of a city, especailly in the case of a place like Sydney.

<dd>It was a fairly good article. The only thing I disagreed with was when it said that content is decided by consensus - that 2 plus 2 can equal 5 if wikipedians agree on it. That isn't the way it works. 2 plus 2 equals 5 if reliable sources say it equals 5. I liked the bit about MUDs as "multiple undergraduate destroyer" - I'm glad wikipedia wasn't around when I was at uni. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 10:07, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're spot on with your last statement. Re the 2+2=5 idea, it's true that weight of numbers will occasionally lead to, shall we say, an inconsistent application of wikipedia policy, but that is probably a slightly different problem to what he was intimating. Using his opening example, and changing the conclusion, weight of numbers may have declared him as not being sufficiently notable (he told that story with a good deal of humour, which I enjoyed) - but that is a far cry from, for instance, weight of numbers describing him as the current King of England - that simply will not happen, or if it does, it will not remain for too long. So 2+2=5 is not the correct analogy, we will correctly show 2+2=4, but the title of the article on "4", whether it has primacy or is part of a disambiguation page and what categories it should carry will nearly all be determined by those who have the keenest interest in that article (within certain limits). <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">πίππύ δ'Ω∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 12:37, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The format used for elections doesn't really make sense for referendums. An election is an election, regardless what year it is in. The crucial thing with a referendum, however, is what the referendum is about, not what year is in.

<dd>The most obvious options would be to follow the "Australian republic referendum, 1999" format, or to extend the existing format for multiple questions at a referendum (descriptor after in brackets) to all articles. I think either system would be an improvement. Are there any other suggestions? I think including the year is necessary, since there have been multiple referendums on the same question (monopolies for example). --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 08:35, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zoo pics are great, though they are pretty hard to take. Generally, frogs are behind glass in zoos, so if you have a technique which can prevent reflection (as flash is usually required indoors) then give it a go. I have had a lot of trouble, so if you, or anyone, has a technique, please tell me. <b>If anyone lives near Melbourne</b> (bolded to get attention), and goes to the zoo, try and get a <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corroboree_Frog_256f.html" title="Corroboree Frog">Corroboree Frog</a> photo. They are almost extinct in the wild (and too fragile to go near their habitat without permission and assistance), so it is our only chance at a photograph. We currently have one, but as you can see it isn't great.</dd>

<dd>In the wild, it is much easier. Frogs are probably the easiest wild animal to photograph, as they can't quickly run away (though I have lost many), and a lot of species don't move when you are around. The biggest problem is finding them, many species are great at hiding. It is best to go frogging with three people, and you can try out triangulation. You spread out around a calling frog, and point torches in the direction of the sound. Where the beams cross should be the frog. Also just look around the edges of ponds, dams, creeks and you will find them sitting there in the right season. The best time, I find, is the night after rain or the night after two days of rain in the right season. The season depends on where you live.</dd>

<dd>Now, to the photography. I recommend a point-and-shoot digital for frog photos. They are very easy to carry around, and they are so good now. I use a Canon Powershot A520. I will keep these instructions to point and shoot, as those with SLR should know how to use their camera&#160;;). Firstly, as it is usually night time, bring a torch. Set the camera to macro mode (usually a tulip symbol, see your manual), and turn on the flash. I use the lowest flash setting, but test out your camera, and see what works best. Shine the frog with the torch, and auto-focus the camera with the other hand. You want it focused on the eye/nose area. Try and get a side-on shot, with as much of the frog in focus as possible, but remember eye/nose. Also, you don't want the photo to have a large reflection (frogs shine), so make sure it isn't 90 degrees. Take away the torch light once it has focused, and take the shot. Take a few until you are happy with it. This should result in a shot like <a href="../../../l/_/w/Image%7EL_wilcoxi.jpg_912a.html" title="Image:L wilcoxi.jpg">this</a>, which was shot at 11:14pm. --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 08:43, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gathering species images</span></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was thinking about the problem of animal and plant species images... we should work smarter, not harder, and organise pre-planned group photography excursions to places like zoos and botanic gardens to systematically and efficiently collect the free/better quality/ANY images we need. What I was thinking was we could somehow get ahold of species lists from zoos/gardens (?? do they maintain such things? I have a feeling they might, although maybe not publicly...), cross-check them against WP articles° and figure out which ones are needed. The great thing about zoos and gardens is that they label the species - no guessing! Then it's a fun day at the zoo for all, with a simple point-and-click.&#160;:)</p>
<p>What do people think, a viable idea? I guess such excursions would be wikichildren of <a href="../../../t/o/l/WP%7ETOL_6e15.html" title="WP:TOL">WP:TOL</a> and local WikiProjects, depending on the location...</p>
<p>° <small>(Worth also checking them against Commons and Flickr first - masses of poorly described and sorted species.)</small></p>

<dd>It's made even more complicated because some high schools <i>also</i> offer TAFE-accredited courses! (or, at least, mine did). However, I think that in these cases, the courses are actually offered by a TAFE college, and simply offered on another campus. So a course that was offered at my old high school would be attained through Brisbane North Institute of TAFE, not the actual school itself. I don't think it's necessary to put non-TAFE institutions that offer TAFE courses into this category. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 02:09, 1 September 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Primary schools in Northern Ireland</span></h2>
<p>I have been adding Primary schools articles for Northern Ireland, largely stubs, to which new contributors have started to add to and develop etc, but have come under attack by people proposing that all such primary school articles should be deleted as being non-notable etc. You can see the debate at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Abercorn_Primary_School_2760.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Abercorn Primary School">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Abercorn Primary School</a>.

<dd>Thanks for your photos. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_65b4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life">Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life</a> would probably be the best place to seek plant ID's, although plant ID from photos can vary from easy to impossible. Grevilleas can be particularly difficult to identify with all the species, forms, cultivars etc. Its good to have mutiple photos (if you have them) that show both leaves and flowers. Its also a good idea to show on the image page the location where the flowers are photographed for ID and encyclopedic purposes (also identifies if they are cultivated or in "the wild").<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelburnian_8c45.html" title="User:Melburnian">Melburnian</a> 13:40, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know of TOL (have identified things there myself), just checking here first. I am also aware of the difficulty of IDing plants. There is only one Grevillea I want identified, and that is because it smells so beautiful and I want one for my garden. The others are mostly not native, and I will only upload those which I think are possible to ID with the photos I've taken. I will get onto expanding the descriptions later this week.

<p>Talking about notability of (alleged) criminals, Lindsay Michael Hearn has plead guilty to some fairly vicious crimes.

<dd><b>Report</b>. Will I went to the zoo on Monday (sorry for the delayed response) and got a few OK shots, but largely I was disappointed - the weather was terrible! Gray, overcast to the point of spitting at some points - no where near enough light to work with (and the lighting I got was flat). Anyway the only decent shots I got where outdoors. As mentioned my 70-200 has poor macro (1.5m min focus distance) and that just wasn't effective to work with animals behind glass. I plan to get a macto lens before the next school holidays (December) so I can effectively photograph inside the Butterfly enclosure - now there's a fantastic photo-op! I found that largely the animals were behind too much wire to be able to photograph. If anyone else is planning to go I recommend only going to the butterfly enclosure, the giant bird aviary, and the Australian Animals exhibit - these are well worth visiting!<br /></dd>

<li>I see a tonne of edits - I don't see much vandalism. Many of the edits claimed to be reverting vandalism were not reverting vandalism as we would normally call it, misguided edits perhaps and worth reverting but not vandalism - see for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steve_Irwin&amp;diff=73700007&amp;oldid=73699980" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steve_Irwin&amp;diff=73700007&amp;oldid=73699980" rel="nofollow">this claimed reversion of vandalism</a>.

<dd>This is a common misconception. Essentially the present AFL side is the same side that competed in the SANFL until the end of 1996. It moved to the AFL, and remonikered itself the Power. To fill the big hole left by Port, the SANFL created a new team called the Port Adelaide Magpies. Hence it's entirely appropriate that the SANFL history of Port be included in the Power's article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Brain_of_Morbius_d51f.html" title="User:The Brain of Morbius">The Brain of Morbius</a> 06:52, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia-based Guidebook to Sydney: What would you include?</span></h2>
<p>Hi All, Question: If you were trying to make a tourist's guidebook to Sydney, composed only of as-is Wikipedia articles (i.e. you can only include an article wholesale, or not - you can't edit it), and you were limited to just 400 pages (of which only 360 pages were usable), or around 90 articles, which articles would you include, and which would you not include? I've had a quick go - <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_Sydney_Visitor%27s_Guidebook_5bc2.html" title="User:Nickj/Sydney Visitor's Guidebook">list of included articles is here</a>, and a <a href="http://files.nickj.org/Wikipedia/guidebook-rough-preview-v2.pdf" class="external text" title="http://files.nickj.org/Wikipedia/guidebook-rough-preview-v2.pdf" rel="nofollow">15 Mb PDF print preview of the result is here</a>. What would you add, and what would you take out? Including everything (or even most things) Sydney-related in that many pages is impossible, so you have to be very selective; and because it's a guidebooky-type-of-thing, it probably shouldn't be very hard to read (i.e. a quick overview of what people are likely to encounter is sufficient), and it has to be reasonably general (e.g. the reader may be from overseas, and/or may like different things to you).

Where this particularly affects Australian coverage is where such an entity is a cultural phenomenon in Australia, is little-known in the rest of the world, and where external references are scarce.</p>
<p>Any suggestions or comments of this matter are much appreciated, perhaps Aus-related articles we can keep an eye on/clean up so this doesn't happen again. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 06:01, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While this was a bad application of G11, there are heaps of trivial (ie. nonencyclopedic) products, companies and websites on Wikipedia that should be speedied. If an admin makes a bad choice, a deletion can always be undone.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">Peta</a> 06:15, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, absolutely, I agree that G11 is a necessary measure to cope with the deluge of spam on Wikipedia these days, but certainly in this case a clean-up tag or AfD would have been more appropriate. I notice on the Village Pump there is some discussion on how to spot "blatant advertising" - written in the first person, glowing superlatives, copied directly from company website, etc. It's not a good start for G11 but hopefully the criteria can be better defined and applied in future. -<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 07:01, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some people don't get out much, or look outside the square they live in I guess, but you can't blame them when they live on the other side of the world and the only link in the Tim Tam article is to the manufacturer. Here's what I do - and I've had no complaints yet... If you come across any article without any references whatsoever, tag it as unreferenced, even if you know the article contents to be true. <a href="../../../k/i/c/Kick-to-kick.html" title="Kick-to-kick">Kick-to-kick</a> is one recent example. I play kick-to-kick myself with my son, but the article still needed references when I spotted it a few weeks back. Since the {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} tag went on, external links have begun to arrive - and everyone's happy. The article is somewhat safe from deletion, and I can verify the information within by following the new external links. In time it'll be cleaned up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's a lot of unreferenced articles out there needing a slap with the unreferenced tag. Be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> an slap them on where needed. Another Aussie editor recently let me know a while back that they liked my approach (I forget who it was sorry, maybe Snottygobble?), and suggested if I keep the unreferenced push up, the category for unreferenced articles will grow so large, there'll be a greater push for referencing in the first place, avoiding this problem altogether. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a>\<sup><a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">talk</a></sup> 06:22, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For those in Melbourne, is this pub notable enough for an article? I'm certain I've actually been there myself in times past, though I don't consider it to be notable enough to be remembered in an encyclopedia.

<dd>I've scratched the surface of something bigger here I think. What actually makes an Australian pub notable, or any hotel for that matter needs to be decided. I think the fact that being built during the 1800's isn't enough, as is being established at the AfD above. Take <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albion_Hotel%2C_Balmain_2a3c.html" title="Albion Hotel, Balmain">Albion Hotel, Balmain</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Patrick%27s_Inn%2C_Balmain_44eb.html" title="St Patrick's Inn, Balmain">St Patrick's Inn, Balmain</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Bald_Rock_Hotel%2C_Rozelle_389a.html" title="Bald Rock Hotel, Rozelle">Bald Rock Hotel, Rozelle</a> and Mertonville Hotel, Balmain for example. Whilst those articles contain a reference, all the reference really provides without looking deeper into the facts is that the hotel merely existed. There's a heap more linked at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_pubs_in_Balmain_c222.html" title="List of pubs in Balmain">List of pubs in Balmain</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_pubs_in_Rozelle_63cf.html" title="List of pubs in Rozelle">List of pubs in Rozelle</a> and possibly others. Before I suggest an AfD on those pub articles which claim no notability, perhaps somebody can tell me why these pubs should have an article in the first place? -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a>\<sup><a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">talk</a></sup> 22:30, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd suggest the Balmain and Rozelle pubs be given some time. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmitch_cbf2.html" title="User:Amitch">User:Amitch</a> has only recently started work on improving the articles, and I believe we will see notability develop in the near future. I plan to help out on these articles too as soon as I can find some time and some more references. A couple of reasons why these articles should be given a chance to improve (strongly based on Amitch's thoughts):
<ul>
<li>These pubs (like a number of other buildings in the area) are of historical significance in the local area</li>
<li>The area itself is of particular significance to the history of Australian drinking establishments in general</li>
<li>In general, there is a shortage of information about this topic online.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>These articles will 'not' be of interest to the vast majority of wikipedians, but is significant to those interested in the history of the area. I'd really like to see this information move from the domain of short-run local print to WP, lest it become even harder to research in the future. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChovain_e53a.html" title="User:Chovain">Chovain</a> 00:34, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Chovain. I suspected the pub articles needed expanding rather than deletion, considering where they're located. As they currently stand, the articles may very well be deleted by another admin for citing no claim to notability. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a>\<sup><a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">talk</a></sup> 00:39, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
