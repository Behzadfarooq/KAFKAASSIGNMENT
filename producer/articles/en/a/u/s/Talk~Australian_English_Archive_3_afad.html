<h2><span class="mw-headline">New <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_phonology_5bbd.html" title="Australian English phonology">Australian English phonology</a> page</span></h2>
<p>I've created a new <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_phonology_5bbd.html" title="Australian English phonology">Australian English phonology</a> page and deleted the information that is now there from here. I did this because this page was pretty big, and the information on the phonology pretty dodgy. In particular, I didn't like the vowels table, which seemed to make Australian English into a transformation of Received Pronunciation, and the bulleted list after it, which was full of muck, and which I'm ashamed to say I contributed to.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with you about the vowels table. I found it quite useful in comparing the pronunciation differences between AuE vowels and RP vowels and I feel a bit disappointed that it's gone. You also decided to unilaterally change things without discussing it first, which is a bit rude, but anyway. I agree with you regarding the bullet list though, it <i>was</i> a bit messy. – <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">AxSkov</a> (<big><a href="../../../a/x/s/User_talk%7EAxSkov_04ac.html" title="User talk:AxSkov">☏</a></big>) <small>13:04, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't completely get rid of the comparison to RP; you can easily derive that from the Mitchell-Delbridge system included. The only differences between M.-D. and RP are, I think, /a/ for /ɑ/ (Durie-Hajek /aː/), and /oʊ/ for /əʊ/ (revised /əʉ/). Also, M.-D. never uses the length marks that are optional in RP. Of course, there's differences between the pronunciations of words, so that any correspondances between Australian phonemes and RP ones are misleading. (e.g. we pronounce 'Austria' as /ɔstri.ə/, but I believe the RP pronounciation is not the /ɒstri.ə/ a table of correspondencs would imply, but /ɔːstri.ə/.) Anyway, a better resource is at <a href="../../../i/p/a/IPA_for_English_ad1f.html" title="IPA for English">IPA for English</a>, which further has the advantage of providing the American equivalents.</dd>

<dd>My dictionary says /ɔːstri.ə/, but I don't know who else does... It definitely starts with /ɒ/ for me. (Same with <i>Australia</i>.)--<a href="../../../j/h/j/User%7EJHJ_006a.html" title="User:JHJ">JHJ</a> 07:45, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well that's true with regards to the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_for_English_4b7c.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet for English">IPA for English</a> page, that also includes American equivalents. There is a similar page, with a simple chart, located at <a href="../../../i/p/a/IPA_chart_for_English_dd8a.html" title="IPA chart for English">IPA chart for English</a>, which I find very useful. – <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">AxSkov</a> (<big><a href="../../../a/x/s/User_talk%7EAxSkov_04ac.html" title="User talk:AxSkov">☏</a></big>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I made two changes to the IPA transcription used here. Firstly, I'm using /a/ and /a:/ instead of the turned glyphs. IPA principles indicate that Roman characters are to be preferred over non-roman ones, and in almost every other language with only one low vowel, /a/ is used. (The classification of /æ/ as open doesn't interfere with this, because it's not fully open; it occupies its usual spot.) /a/ and /a:/ are also commonly used for the phonome in question, just not by our source. In any case, the turned-a glyph doesn't really represent the sound adequately; turned-a is not a fully-open vowel. I hope this change can filter through to other pages.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I also think the AuE /ɐː/ is further forward and hence closer to the phoneme /a/; whilst /ɐ/ is further back and hence closer to /ɐ/ or /ɑ/. So the transcription of /aː/ makes sense, but I don't know about /ɐ/. I actually prefer /ɐ/ rather than /a/, because in English /hat/ could be mis-pronounced as "hat" instead of <s>"heart"</s> "hut".</dd>
<dd>Can you give sources for this (why /a/ and /aː/ is used instead of /ɐ/ and /ɐː/) and were I can obtain them? – <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">AxSkov</a> (<big><a href="../../../a/x/s/User_talk%7EAxSkov_04ac.html" title="User talk:AxSkov">☏</a></big>) <small>12:50, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In most diagrams I've seen, AusE /aː/ is definitely not a front vowel; it's usually drawn almost perfectly in the middle if you get one of the normalised diagrams as in the IPA chart. Apparently there's a fronted allophone after velars, though. Aside from general principles of IPA (e.g. using the Roman character when you have a choice; the fact that [ɐ] is intended more for a "second schwa"; these are cited in Durie and Hajek, but I was familiar with them well before, and for my own purposes have usually used /a/ and /a:/ for these reasons), the best source I can point you to at this stage is Durie and Hajek (1994) as quoted in the article. If you want, I can give you an electronic copy (PDF) of this I got via my Uni library's databases; <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Cassowary_00aa.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Cassowary">email me</a>.</dd>
<dd>The fact that /hat/ could be mispronounced (it's actually <i>hut</i>, not <i>heart</i>, but nevermind) is, I think, neither here nor there. After all, cannot /j/ also be mispronounced? /i/ when used in the M.-D. system?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I guess so. – <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">AxSkov</a> (<big><a href="../../../a/x/s/User_talk%7EAxSkov_04ac.html" title="User talk:AxSkov">☏</a></big>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Secondly, I've included the phoneme /æ:/. I think "proper linguists" can justify this better than me, so I've included references to two of many sources that consider it a separate phoneme. (In spite of the fact that one source is called ‘“Short a” in Melbourne English’, this is not a phenomenon specific to Melburnian English.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not a proper linguist either, but I don't think [æː] is a separate phoneme from [æ], rather they are allophones of the one phoneme. Do you have any sorces to back this up and where I can obtain them? – <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">AxSkov</a> (<big><a href="../../../a/x/s/User_talk%7EAxSkov_04ac.html" title="User talk:AxSkov">☏</a></big>) <small>12:50, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As cited, there's Durie and Hajek (1994) and Blake (1985); also Durie and Hajek (1995). These cite a variety of different sources (who I haven't followed up on yet). The page on the <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad-lad_split.html" title="Bad-lad split">Bad-lad split</a> cites other sources, which I also haven't followed up on. Ingram (1995) is a response to Durie and Hajek (1994) who argues (very poorly, IMHO!) against including it. D&amp;H 1995 is a reply to his response. If you want, I can give you D&amp;H 94 and 95 and Ingram 1995 (which are all from the Au. J. Linguistics, vols. 14 and 15). Another Wikipedian gave me an article written on the subject which has so far not found a publisher; it is as such unfit for citation, but if you are curious I might be able to find it and forward it to you.</dd>
<dd>There is the possibility it's a phoneme for some speakers an allophone for others. If this is true, it's best to include it, because you can always derive the allophonic variation from split-phonemic form, but you can't always do the reverse (hence being separate phonemes).</dd>
<dd>Would you say "bad" and "lad" (etc.) rhyme for you? Whenever I've read English poetry that wants them to rhyme, I've always found it stilted and jarring—a bad rhyme—even before I knew anything about linguistics. Just a personal annecdote, of course, not an argument&#160;:)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well sometimes "bad" and "lad" rhyme and sometimes they don't depending on the context they are in. Two words that – to me – never rhyme and are always pronounced differently, no matter the context, is the noun span /spæːn/ and the past-tense verb span /spæn/. I think <i>span-span</i> is a good example for the <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad-lad_split.html" title="Bad-lad split">bad-lad split</a>, clearly showing minimal pairs. – <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">AxSkov</a> (<big><a href="../../../a/x/s/User_talk%7EAxSkov_04ac.html" title="User talk:AxSkov">☏</a></big>) <small>03:08, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Macquarie Dictionary</span></h2>
<p>As far as i am aware the Macquarie Dictionary is not used as a reference in academic writing. The macquarie dictionary has typically been the butt of several jokes concerning its validity.</p>
<p>The sentence "Publishers, schools, universities and governments typically use the Macquarie Dictionary as a standard spelling reference" is therefore a little excessive, and may be misleading. I find that more often than not, the Concise Oxford Dictionary is used for schools and universities.</p>
<p>perhaps "The Macquarie Dictionary is often used as a spelling reference by publishers, schools, universities and governments " but that sounds a little strong to me, perhaps a weaker construction may still be needed</p>
<dl>
<dd>AusInfo's Style Guide for Authors, Editors and Printers (Commonwealth Govt style guide), at least the edition of it I've read, certainly says to use Macq's spelling as a default.

<p>A small point, but the last sentence of the second paragraph sounds awkward, especially the last few words. Is this just me? E.g. I believe the original:</p>
<p><i>Many Australians' speech patterns do not conform to this stereotype, and the "questioning intonation" is often found in many regional speech patterns in the south of England, Northern Ireland, and in some American ones.</i></p>
<p>should be more like:</p>

<p>Anon has a point: monophthongal realisations of centring diphthongs are very common, particularly in connected speech—still, similar changes are happening in RP. Also, the diphthongs that in RP are <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[aʊ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[aɪ]</span> are shorter in Australian English: <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[æɔ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɑe]</span> in normal but clearly-annunciated speech, and especially the former tends more towards <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[æə]</span> in connected speech. On the other hand, compared to RP, our diphthongs <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/æɪ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/əʉ/</span> (which has a very open starting point, more like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɐ]</span>) are longer than RP <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/eɪ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/əʊ/</span>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Words from aboriginal languages</span></h2>
<p>In this section we mention how rare such words have made it into Australian English and go on to mention "cooee" and "yakka". There is also the word "bung" meaning "broken" or "on the blink" which comes from the same language as "yakka". Though it seems rare today, so does "yakka" and we certainly used "bung" in my family in Melbourne when I was growing up in the 1970s. — <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippietrail_ecc5.html" title="User:Hippietrail">Hippietrail</a> 21:03, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Not True</span></h3>
<p>The rarity of use of Aboriginal words within the Australian language is a misnoma at best and miss leading at worst, the number of diverse Aboriginal dialects is the direct cause of this. This page would be more accurate if it acknowledged this fact rather than dismissing the use of Aboriginal words. Besides early exploration adoptions aboriginal words, words that are common knowledge across the whole country are the result of commercial usage. 'Cooee' early use was with WWI advertising and recruitment, there was also some washing powder/soap that used the it as well. 'Yakka' is a direct result of the use of this word in the clothing lable.</p>
<p>Then there's the yabbie, though growing up in perth i know them as gulgies, but you can catch them with a gidgee they look the same and taste the same cause they are the same. Oops translation catch Maron with a spear. Gidgee is a Noongar word for the best type of tree used to make spears, but hey I brought a gidgee in Melbourne a couple of years back though this was aluminium. Now its time for a couple swigs of wobbla join the corrobbaree and listen to stories from the dreamtime about the wagyl. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 14:20, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
There is also bung (in the sense of bad/defective/infected), which is a Jagara (<a href="../../../m/u/r/Murri.html" title="Murri">Murri</a>) word for "dead".</p>
<p>Gilgies (or jilgies) are technically a different species to yabbies, although (just to confuse matters) the crustaceans farmed commercially in WA are usually yabbies, introduced from the eastern states. A lot of people in WA use the two words interchangeably. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 15:46, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How about we rephrase this? The word <i>you</i> cannot have a plural standard or otherwise: not any more than the word <i>children</i> can. The word is plural. It a plural word which has come to be used as a singular one not the other way around.

<dd>I don't follow your objections. Are you claiming that "you" is not used in the singular? Are you claiming that "youse" is not used in the plural? Are you claiming that no-one has a contrast between "you" in the singular and "youse, y'all, you guys" etc. in the plural, in at least some circumstances? I think maybe your example of "children" is confusing me: Perhaps something like "fish" would be better ... "fish" nicely parallels "you" in that by default, the plural of "fish" and of "you" is "fish" and "you", but in some circumstances, the plurals become "fishes" and "youse". I mean, the fact that when people have decided that "fish" and "you" are hard to use in the plural for whatever reason, new plurals have cropped up, respectively "fishes" and "youse"/"y'all"/"you guys"/"you'ns" etc. etc. So yeah, "you" is plural, but it's also singular, so if someone says "'youse' is the plural of 'you'", it's obvious they're talking about the singular meaning of "you" and not the plural.</dd>
<dd>So I don't think there's anything wrong with the current phrasing. We could perhaps be more specific and describe "youse" as "a non-standard second-person plural pronoun", but then we alienate those who don't know what a second-person pronoun is, plural or otherwise. OTOH, everyone who's English is up to the level this article should be at will be able to understand "the plural of 'you'".</dd>

<dd>I wonder if Jim means that <i>gramatically</i> the word "you" acts as a plural (you are, they are, we are — but: he is, she is, it is, I am)? "You" in middle English was the polite or formal form of the second person pronoun (object form), comparable to <i>vous</i> in French or <i>Sie</i> in German, which also behave as plurals. But we've lost the casual/intimate 2nd person pronouns that those languages have retained (see <a href="../../../t/-/v/T-V_distinction_d894.html" title="T-V distinction">T-V distinction</a>). Maybe a comparison to "chicken" rather than "fish" would be helpful — chicken was a plural of chick (cf. ox-&gt;oxen, brother-&gt;brethren) but has come to be seen as singular, with a new plural formed by adding an "s", a bit like "yous". Or I might be completely off the mark here...? <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 01:07, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I'm not saying that <i>you</i> is not used in the singular nor am I saying that <i>youse</i> is not used in plural. Maybe <i>children</i> was not the best example. Okay, <i>fish</i>: by default the plural of <i>fish</i> is <i>fish</i> but by default the singular of <i>you</i> is <i>you</i>. Ntennis points out that in Middle English <i>you</i> was the "polite or formal form". However, in Old English <i>you</i> was the plural with <i>thee</i> the singular. Unlike <i>chicken</i> the word <i>you</i> is now both singular and plural. The fact that it has come to also be used as the singular doesn't detract from the fact that it still is plural. How do you have a plural of a plural? I s'pose it's not really that great an issue. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 20Dec05

<dd>According to your logic <i>fish</i> has no plural, because it is a plural. Yes, <i>you</i> is a plural, but it's also a singular. Just like <i>fish</i> is a plural, but it's also a singular. It doesn't matter which form came first. So, yes, <i>you</i> has a plural. The plural of <i>you</i>, is <i>you</i>, <i>y'all</i>, <i>you guys</i> or <i>youse</i>. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.194.44.220.html" title="User:64.194.44.220">64.194.44.220</a> 03:16, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Jimp, are you trying to argue that by default, "you" is interpreted in the plural, which contrasts against my "fish" because by default, "fish" is interpreted in the singular? or are you taking it wholy from the etymology? I think the etymology is irrelevant. "You" is today used in the singular and the plural, so the fact that once <i>ge</i> was only used in the plural is neither here nor there. If "you" can be used in the singular and the plural, then I don't think anyone would interpret "a plural of <i>you</i>" to refer to the plural of a plural usage, neither would "a singular of <i>you</i>" be interpreted as referring to the singular usage. As you say, a plural cannot have a plural. Maybe to take a different example—"people" is the plural of "person", but it's also another word which itself has a plural. If you say, "<i>foo</i> is a non-standard plural of <i>people</i>", then people will think foo==peoples (with a meaning along the lines of "ethnic group"), whereas if you say "<i>bar</i> is a non-standard singular of <i>people</i>", then people will think bar==person. (Of course, in general you <i>wouldn't</i> say these things, you'd use clearer words, but this is an example. ... yet there's no clear word that means singular-you in English, apart from "you", so you can't use clearer words except "second person plural pronoun".) —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> <span class="usertalk">(<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECassowary_89f2.html" title="User talk:Cassowary"><span title="Ae hI: ja" class="IPA">ɑe hɪː jɐ</span></a>)</span> 10:15, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>You</b> is singular and plural in modern English. In older forms of English there were separate singular and plural forms. <b>Thou</b> was already disappearing in Shakespeare's time as the unambiguous singular 2nd person plural. He uses <b>thou</b> sometimes and <b>you</b> sometimes. Ancient etymologies do not directly determine modern senses or uses. Different English-speaking communities around the world have for some time been using various new unambiguous 2nd person plural pronouns, all of them unstandard. Some are <b>you guys</b>, <b>youse</b>, <b>yous</b>, <b>y'all</b>. — <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippietrail_ecc5.html" title="User:Hippietrail">Hippietrail</a> 17:52, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not in the least! "I'm correct" is totally bizarre and I've never for the life of me heard it. "I'm right" is normal and everyday, and I've heard it often enough that I'd be surprised if it was unique to Australia! "I'm right", I imagine, is a contraction of "I'm alright", but when you say it you don't think of it as being that—you just think of it as being a standard reply. (Actually, I was thinking that it was a personal idiosyncracy of his that caused him to change "I'm right" into "I'm correct", when you said it was a response to "Do you want this?".) —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 13:21, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I pronounce it as a single word, so I'll write it as a single word. Better still, it's in the dictionary—not that inclusion in a dictionary is a prerequisite for wordiness. You might think of it as a common mistake. If that makes you feel good, then great. But it doesn't give you room to criticise me, because not everyone thinks it's a mistake, including a number of fine authors. (Still, I would be interested in how you define being a word. Obviously being in the dictionary doesn't mean it's a word, which is an interesting diversion from most people's most conservative definition. And there is no Academie Anglaise to make pronouncements.) —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 13:48, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&#160;:) It's funny. Maybe you should try saying "I'm left" to him one day&#160;:) I'm still really surprised it's an Australianism. (Or maybe it's an unamericanism? Are you American or British or what...?) —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 13:48, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I live in America. I can't say "I'm left" to him because after I say it three times it will be right again. I'll just tell him I'm wrong.&#160;:) -<a href="../../../i/o/p/User%7EIopq_3a60.html" title="User:Iopq">Iopq</a> 15:01, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps cf the common Australianism "She'll be right", meaning "Things will turn out OK". Sbz5809 13:53, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is kind of a bit off-topic, but I noticed that when I was living in Bundaberg Qld last year for a few months that when you apologise to someone (say you bump into a stranger in a supermarket), that people respond with "no, you're right". It's relatively uncommon to hear that in the Southern States (SA and Vic, the two that I have lived in). When that happens, you usually get "that's OK". Has anyone else made that observation? I will be moving to Cairns in the next few weeks (will mess Melb dreadfully and I don't know how Cairns' humid heat will be dealt by this little Croweater) and I have to keep my ears open for this.</p>
<p>Another one (again a bit off-track), another Australianism surely would be the "yeah, nah" thing ("yeah" I acknowledge what you are saying and answer in the negative to a question) <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrances76_502f.html" title="User:Frances76">Frances76</a> 21:11, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry bout the late response, but: I've spoken to a couple of people who aren't Australian (but live here) and they all reckon that saying "I'm right" is not particularly an Australianism, people do it elsewhere too. It might just be an unamericanism or an unbriticism or something. As for "no, you're right" after an apology, I wouldn't've described that as particu'ly uncommon in Melbourne. In fact, I would think about the only way you could say that it's uncommon in comparison to another region is if that region uses it nearly exclusively. As for "yeah, no", there's a paper in an issue of the <i>Australian Journal of Linguistics</i> about it. Can't remember which issue though, and I've never read it yet so... —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 09:45, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, no, I'm not sure, I didn't read the article. It might've just been on its use specifically in Australian English, it's title is something like "Obligatory Bad Joke: The use of "yeah no" in Australian English".

<dd>Well saying "No, you're right" sounds like it's interchangable with "No, you're correct (in doing what you did)." But about other people who live in Australia... I even say things in Russian that make no sense, but I believe that they do because their English translation makes sense&#160;:) I still feel that even saying "I'm alright" is falling into DISUSE in California. It might be an un-Californianism.</dd>
