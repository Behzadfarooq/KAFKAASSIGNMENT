<p>One of the key <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inventor.html" title="Inventor">inventors</a> of the game of Australian Football was a New South Welshman, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Wills_02f2.html" title="Tom Wills">Tom Wills</a>, who was born near <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundagai%2C_New_South_Wales_505f.html" title="Gundagai, New South Wales">Gundagai</a> and lived there for a few years before moving to <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria%2C_Australia_096e.html" title="Victoria, Australia">Victoria, Australia</a>, where he helped devise the game.</p>

<p>The first recorded game of Australian rules football in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> was between the <i>Waratahs</i> rugby club and the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlton_Football_Club_f590.html" title="Carlton Football Club">Carlton Football Club</a> in 1877, two days after a rugby game between the two clubs and 14 years after rugby was first played in the state.</p>
<p>Waratahs and some others claimed that the Australian rules resulted in a more exciting game, but the rugby authorities repeatedly rejected suggestions to switch codes or even play intercolonial matches under alternating rules against <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_%28Australia%29_71e6.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a>. In response, the proponents of the Australian game formed the NSW Football Association in 1880 and in 1881 the first Australian rules game between NSW and Victoria was played in Sydney. The NSWFA was small, with only a few clubs, including the Waratahs who switched code in 1882, and competition did not begin in earnest until 1889, when clubs competed for the Flanagan Cup. Having trouble gaining access to enclosed grounds, and therefore gate receipts, the association also had trouble with antagonism between its clubs, and it collapsed in 1893.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The NSW Football League was born on February 12, 1903 at a meeting held in the YMCA Hall in George St. The NSWFL promoted the game in schools and the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Victorian Football League</a> (VFL) held premiership matches in Sydney in an effort to establish the code. In 1908, largely through the switch of codes by the talented <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dally_Messenger_2a1f.html" title="Dally Messenger">Dally Messenger</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> established itself into the culture of Sydney, and although Australian Football remained popular, the NSWFL was again denied access to enclosed grounds and the new professional code further drew players from the NSWFL. By 1911, Australian rules had achieved more support than rugby union, according to <i>The Referee</i>, but only because the main rival was now rugby league.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1933, a proposal by the VFL and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_f16a.html" title="New South Wales Rugby League">New South Wales Rugby League</a> to amalgamate Australian football and Rugby League was carried out and a report and set of proposed rules, known as Universal Rules was prepared by the secretary of the NSWRL, Harold R.

<p>Australian Football was introduced to the <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverina.html" title="Riverina">Riverina</a> region of New South Wales in Wagga Wagga in 1881 with a match between sides from <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagga_Wagga%2C_New_South_Wales_9aaf.html" title="Wagga Wagga, New South Wales">Wagga Wagga</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albury%2C_New_South_Wales_a918.html" title="Albury, New South Wales">Albury</a>. Subsequently, a local competition formed in 1884 around Wagga Wagga. The league went through many incarnations including the Murrumbidgee District Football Association (1897), Wagga United Football Association (1898–1921), Riverina Mainline Competition (1922–24), Rock and District Association (1925–1926), Wagga and District Association (1926), Wagga Football Association (1928–1957).</p>
<p>The South Western District Football League commenced in 1894 and the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farrer_Football_League_7687.html" title="Farrer Football League">Farrer Football League</a> commenced in 1957.</p>
<p>In 1982, at the instigation of the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Country_Football_League_4fb0.html" title="Victorian Country Football League">Victorian Country Football League</a> (who had jurisdiction over the area at the time), the South Western District Football League, the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farrer_Football_League_7687.html" title="Farrer Football League">Farrer Football League</a> and the Central Riverina Football League were all combined into the <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverina_Football_League_a2ec.html" title="Riverina Football League">Riverina Football League</a> and the Riverina District Football League. The district league reverted to the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farrer_Football_League_7687.html" title="Farrer Football League">Farrer Football League</a> in 1985.</p>
<p>In 1995, these two leagues came under one umbrella of the <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murrumbidgee_Valley_Australian_Football_Association_6254.html" title="Murrumbidgee Valley Australian Football Association">Murrumbidgee Valley Australian Football Association</a>.</p>

Clubs also formed in the smaller towns around 1900 and played ad hoc fixtures against each other, as well as organising formal competitions during the 1900s and 1910s in southern Riverina such as the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coreen_%26_District_Football_League_abb5.html" title="Coreen &amp; District Football League">Coreen &amp; District Football League</a> (formed as the Coreen Football Associaton), the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Hume_Football_League_91d9.html" title="Hume Football League">Hume Football League</a> and the Albury &amp; District Football League.</p>

<p>Australian Football was first played in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broken_Hill_5b6d.html" title="Broken Hill">Broken Hill</a> in 1885 between Day Dream and Silverton.

<p>Australian Football was introduced to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle%2C_New_South_Wales_49e2.html" title="Newcastle, New South Wales">Newcastle, New South Wales</a> in 1883 when the Wallsend Football Club was formed by miners from <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballarat.html" title="Ballarat">Ballarat</a>. In 1888, the Black Diamond Cup, Australia's oldest sporting trophy began.</p>
<p>Five clubs were established in the Newcastle area: Newcastle City, Plattsburg, Northumberland, Lambton, and Singleton.</p>
<p>In 1883, a touring <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Swans_645f.html" title="Sydney Swans">South Melbourne Football Club</a> defeated a Combined Northern District team by only one goal.</p>
<p>In 1888, a touring <a href="../../../f/i/t/Fitzroy_Football_Club_aa48.html" title="Fitzroy Football Club">Fitzroy Football Club</a> defeated Wallsend by 10 goals to 5. The following year, Wallsend defeated Fitzroy.</p>

<p>The game was first played in the <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffs_Harbour%2C_New_South_Wales_2703.html" title="Coffs Harbour, New South Wales">Coffs Harbour</a> area as late as 1978. The North Coast Australian Football League was formed in 1982 and has grown rapidly.</p>

<p>The debt ridden South Melbourne Football Club moved to Sydney in 1982 and was renamed the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Swans_645f.html" title="Sydney Swans">Sydney Swans</a>. It became the first club based outside of Victoria and represented the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">VFL</a>'s first serious attempt to broaden the game's appeal, culminating in its extension into a national competition, the AFL.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_31.html" title="July 31">31 July</a> 1985, for what was thought to be $6.3 million, Dr <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Edelsten_ab70.html" title="Geoffrey Edelsten">Geoffrey Edelsten</a> "bought" the Swans. In reality it was $2.9 million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman within less than twelve months. By 1988 the licence was sold back to the VFL for ten dollars. Losses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Willessee_5772.html" title="Mike Willessee">Mike Willessee</a>, Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in.</p>
<p>With substantial monetary and management support from the AFL, the club survived, and with player draft concessions in the early 1990s, has fielded a competitive team throughout the past decade.</p>
<p>In 1996 the Swans lost the grand final to <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroos_Football_Club_6c61.html" title="Kangaroos Football Club">North Melbourne</a>, which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground_93ce.html" title="Melbourne Cricket Ground">MCG</a>.</p>
<p>Since 1996, the Swans have made the finals in each season except 2000 and 2002.</p>
<p>The culmination of the recent success is the 2005 premiership against the West Coast Eagles played in front of 91,898 at the MCG, taking the flag to Sydney for the first time and breaking a 72 year drought for the club from when it was based in South Melbourne It also broke the longest premiership drought in the history of the competition.</p>
<p>Despite the final success of the Swans, the former Melbourne based club struggled for many years to gain support of the Sydney public.</p>

<p>The Australian Football League has expressed intentions to invest in junior development in the growing Sydney market, particularly in Sydney's west and compete head on with the established <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_football.html" title="Rugby football">rugby football</a> codes, particularly under new CEO <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Demetriou_045d.html" title="Andrew Demetriou">Andrew Demetriou</a>.</p>
<p>A second team in Sydney is a key strategy of the AFL, and has been trialled unsuccessfully with a relocation attempt by the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroos_Football_Club_6c61.html" title="Kangaroos Football Club">Kangaroos Football Club</a> in 1998. Poor crowds led to the Kangaroos leaving the Sydney market.
