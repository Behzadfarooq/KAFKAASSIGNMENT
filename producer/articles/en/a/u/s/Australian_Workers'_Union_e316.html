<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Workers%27_Union_e316.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The AWU grew from a number of earlier unions, notably the Australasian Shearers Union, founded by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Spence_9fab.html" title="William Spence">William Spence</a> and David Temple in <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creswick%2C_Victoria_d58e.html" title="Creswick, Victoria">Creswick</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_%28Australia%29_71e6.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a>. This union joined with shearers' unions in <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourke%2C_New_South_Wales_2bc2.html" title="Bourke, New South Wales">Bourke</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagga_Wagga%2C_New_South_Wales_9aaf.html" title="Wagga Wagga, New South Wales">Wagga</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> to form the Amalgamated Shearers Union of Australia in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a>. In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1894.html" title="1894">1894</a> this union amalgamated with the General Labourers Union, which had formed in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a>, to form the Australian Workers' Union.</p>
<p>The Queensland Shearers Union, formed in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a>, and the Queensland Workers Union merged in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a> to form the Amalgamated Workers Union of Queensland. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a> the AWUQ amalgamated with the AWU, to form a union with a combined membership of 34,000.</p>
<p>The AWU later absorbed a number of other unions in the pastoral, mining and timber industries notably the Amalgamated Workers Association of Queensland in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>, and the Federated Mining Employees Association of Australia in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>. Since these industries were the principal sources of Australia's wealth in the 19th century, the AWU soon became Australia's largest and most powerful union.</p>
<p>The defeat of the great shearers' and maritime unions strikes in the 1890s led the AWU to reject direct action and extremism, and it has been a force for moderation - its critics would say conservatism - in the Australian union movement ever since. It was a firm opponent of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World_366b.html" title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the World</a>, the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Australia_a69d.html" title="Communist Party of Australia">Communist Party of Australia</a>, NSW Premier <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Lang_%28Australia%29_a5fc.html" title="Jack Lang (Australia)">Jack Lang</a> and other radical forces in the Australian labour movement. For many years Communists were banned from AWU membership. In the 1930s the Communist Party launched a rival Pastoral Workers Industrial Union, but this failed to break the AWU's grip on its membership.</p>
<p>When the trade unions formed the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a> following the defeat of the 1890s strikes, the AWU became a powerful influence in the party, particularly in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Australia_84d0.html" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a>, and to a lesser extent in the other states. Labor state governments were heavily influenced by AWU leaders such as Edward Grayndler, Tom Dougherty and NSW AWU Secretary Charlie Oliver. Labor was in government in Queensland from <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> and from <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, and the AWU was able to exert considerable political influence through long-serving premiers such as <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Forgan_Smith_bc17.html" title="William Forgan Smith">William Forgan Smith</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Hanlon_0220.html" title="Edward Hanlon">Ned Hanlon</a>.</p>
<p>The federation of the Australian colonies in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a> led to the establishment of a federal arbitration system. The AWU strongly supported arbitration as mechanism of resolving industrial disputes without resorting to strike action. The Pastoral Industry Award, negotiated by the AWU, was the first federal award granted by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The AWU maintained its registration under state industrial systems and continues to participate in many state awards.</p>
<p>During the years since federation that the Australian industrial relations system has been dominated by the Court and its successors, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Industral_Relations_Commission_ed3b.html" title="Australian Industral Relations Commission">Australian Industral Relations Commission</a>, the AWU and its members were among that system's principal beneficiaries. The AWU remains a strong advocate of arbitration in the union movement. The AWU was not affiliated with the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Council_of_Trade_Unions_9b9d.html" title="Australian Council of Trade Unions">Australian Council of Trade Unions</a> for many years, preferring to maintain its independent relationship with the arbitration system. In Queensland the AWU is one of only two unions (the other being the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shop%2C_Distributive_and_Allied_Employees_Association_450f.html" title="Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association">SDA</a>) not affiliated with the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland_Council_of_Unions_49b0.html" title="Queensland Council of Unions">Queensland Council of Unions</a>.</p>
<p>With the shift in employment from the pastoral industries to the urban manufacturing and service sectors, the AWU's political influence and power declined as the pastoral areas became less significant in terms of employee numbers. This shift led to many rural electorate areas that were influenced by the AWU and workers falling to the conservative side of politics and in particular the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_of_Australia_5507.html" title="National Party of Australia">National Party</a>. The split in the Queensland ALP in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, which resulted in Labor being in opposition for 32 years, deprived the AWU of its greatest area of influence, although it remained influential in the long-serving (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">65</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">88</a>) New South Wales Labor governments.</p>
<p>In 1993 the AWU amalgamated with the Federation of Industrial Manufacturing &amp; Engineering Employees (formally the Federated Ironworkers' Association of Australia) to form the AWU-FIMEE Amalgamated Union. In 1995 the union reverted to using the name Australian Workers' Union.<a href="http://www.awu.net.au/national/about/timeline.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.awu.net.au/national/about/timeline.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>In recent years the AWU has sought to modernise and to broaden its membership beyond its declining traditional base. Today it represents workers in the metals, aviation, oil and gas, mining, construction, food processing and retail industries, as well as its traditional base in the pastoral and mining areas. Its expansion into new areas has brought the AWU into conflict with some other unions, particularly the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Union_of_Workers_2222.html" title="National Union of Workers">National Union of Workers</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Construction%2C_Forestry%2C_Mining_and_Energy_Union_6275.html" title="Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union">Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union</a>.</p>
<p>The AWU is the most powerful union in the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_Right_6bdf.html" title="Labor Right">Labor Right</a> faction of the Labor Party, and its current National Secretary, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Shorten_40f4.html" title="Bill Shorten">Bill Shorten</a>, is standing for election to the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_House_of_Representatives_e683.html" title="Australian House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a> at the next election. Some speak of him as a future Labor <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Australia_3aa3.html" title="Prime Minister of Australia">Prime Minister</a>.</p>
<p>For many years the AWU published two newspapers, <i>The Australian Worker</i> in New South Wales and <i>The Worker</i> (founded in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a>) in Brisbane. Under the editorship of Henry Boote from <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> they were among the most influential union newspapers in Australia. The two papers were merged in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> and today <i>The Australian Worker</i> is published in a magazine format in association with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Consolidated_Press_0e16.html" title="Australian Consolidated Press">Australian Consolidated Press</a>.</p>

<p>The AWU is a federation of state, regional and industry-based branches. Each member of the AWU belong to one of twelve geographic or industry-based branches. Every four years AWU members elect branch and national officials: the National Secretary, National Assistant Secretary and National President. They also elect the <a href="http://www.awu.net.au/national/about/natexecutive.html" class="external text" title="http://www.awu.net.au/national/about/natexecutive.html" rel="nofollow">National Executive</a> and the Branch Executives which act as the Board of Directors for the union.</p>
<p>The AWU's rules are registered with the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission_50b9.html" title="Australian Industrial Relations Commission">Australian Industrial Relations Commission</a> and its internal elections are conducted by the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Electoral_Commission_268c.html" title="Australian Electoral Commission">Australian Electoral Commission</a>. This has largely ended the regular (and sometimes justified) allegations of corruption which used to surround AWU elections.</p>
<p>The AWU is affiliated with the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Council_of_Trade_Unions_9b9d.html" title="Australian Council of Trade Unions">Australian Council of Trade Unions</a>, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Metalworkers_Federation_2b99.html" title="International Metalworkers Federation">International Metalworkers Federation</a>, the International Union of Foodworkers and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Transport_Workers_Federation_3454.html" title="International Transport Workers Federation">International Transport Workers Federation</a>.
