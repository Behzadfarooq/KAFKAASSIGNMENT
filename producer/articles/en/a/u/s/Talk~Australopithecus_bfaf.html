<p>First, two critics about a portion of the first paragraph (copied in red below) -- one supporting the possibility of <i>afarensis</i> as an ancestor, and one against it:</p>
<p><font color="red">“...since then, Hominid fossils have been found that are older than A. africanus, yet nevertheless seem to belong to the genus Homo. Thus, the genus Homo <b>either</b> split off from the genus Australopithecus at an earlier date (the latest common ancestor being A. afarensis or an even earlier form), <b>or</b> both developed from an as yet possibly unknown common ancestor independently. ... The fossil record seems to indicate that Australopithecus is the common ancestor...”</font></p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.accessexcellence.org/WN/SUA14/newhominid.html|" class="external text" title="http://www.accessexcellence.org/WN/SUA14/newhominid.html|" rel="nofollow">A recent discovery by those famous Leakey anthropologists</a> shows that even <i>afarensis</i> had a non-Australopithecine competitor, so -- for the same reason that I agree with this Wikipedia entry when it says that we might not have descended from <i>africanus</i>, but from another, competing genus instead -- I think there's just as much reason that we should not state, with so much certainty as this author has, that <i>afarensis</i> is a "common ancestor" of ours. We can't be certain whether even <i>afarensis</i> is what we "developed from," especially given this 2001 discovery. This is why we still call these species the 'missing link(s)': We aren't certain; this part of our history is 'missing'. Also, since this other genus discovered in 2001 were <b>contemporaries</b> of <i>afarensis</i>, I also doubt that <b>they</b> "developed from" (to quote the red text) <i>afarensis</i>. And thus, this new genus brings up a very plausible scenario which the Wikipedia entry doesn't recognize the possibility of: that we descended from this other genus, <i>Kenyanthropus</i>, without them descending from any Australopithecines, which would contradict the two only scenarios which are recognized as possible in this "either...or" claim in red(that "genus Homo either split off from the genus Australopithecus at an earlier date...or...") ).</p>
<p>We can't even make an affirmative case that we descended from any Australopithecines: Basically, the claim of our ‘descent’ from <i>afarensis</i> was only a presumption to begin with: There wasn’t any actual <b>evidence</b> to merit this theory of descent from Australopithecines (or if there is evidence, I'd love to see it because I've been asking fruitlessly for years.&#160;;-) ), but rather an <b>assumption</b> was made because (at the time, i.e. before 2001), "We know of no competitors to <i>afarensis</i>, nor species similar to us, like <i>afarensis</i> is, so we must have descended from them". Such presumptions are 'burden of proof' fallacies in the system of logic (i.e., A negative presumption, in logic, can never prove an affirmative conclusion, such as, "We <b>did</b> descend from...")&#160;: Or as we scientists would say, <b>‘Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,’ as the 1972 and 2001 Leakey discoveries painfully pointed out because finally, that evidence was no longer absent,</b> with 1972 as the demise of <i>africanus</i> being considered the only known (homonid) species of that era, and 2001 being the demise for our assumptions about <i>afarensis</i> being our only possible ancestor from their respective era -- and with scientists on both sides, ever since, arguing about which species was 'more human' in each era and thus more likely to be our ancestors, without either side really having incontrovertible evidence. And really, who's to say a third species of that era won't be discovered, which is more similar to us than these two? The only rational stance on this issue is agnosticism, and to simply admit that we don't posess enough knowledge to come to any hard-formed opinions. To assume things without <b>affirmative</b> evidence is simply bad science and bad logic (with science being called <i>Logical</i> Empiricism by philosophers for a reason&#160;;-) ), which ironically seems to have been accepted by a large portion of my fellow ‘scientists’ until the 1972 and 2001 discoveries made them question their assumptions. Can we try parsing the word assumption, to bring some levity to this regarding us 'oh so smart' scientists: ass|u|me.</p>
<p>2. Note that I put emphasis on the word ‘either,’ in the above red text: There’s another, plausible option which has been ignored by the author of this Wikipedia entry (Is anyone starting to see his pattern?&#160;;-) ): that <i>afarensis</i> did exist earlier than the genus <i>Homo</i> but we simply haven’t yet discovered fossils to prove it, just as we “didn’t yet discover” *any* fossils of <i>Kenyanthropus</i> until 2001... Just because we haven't discovered it, doesn't mean it didn't happen, as we found with <i>Kenyanthropus</i> and as the saying "Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence" summarizes. We can’t ASSume whether or not we’ll find such fossils, and therefore we shouldn’t be falsely led into this ‘either/or’ false claim, nor that no possibilities exist besides those two simply because they were the only two which the author came up with as possibilities. This area of science, being so immature, still gives us very little evidence to back the claims of the Wikipedia author, especially given the certaintism with which some of these claims were stated; so of course I'm pleased that at some of the claims were stated with the appropriate amount of probabilism, but not certaintism, which is merited by the (lack of good) evidence.</p>
<p>And finally, a critique about this last bit:</p>
<p><font color="red">“The existence of <i>Australopithecus</i> seems to have put firmly to rest the theory that human-like intelligence evolved first and bipedalism followed.”</font></p>
<p>3. Kenyanthropus platyops had a larger braincase than Australopithecus, and we can’t be sure whether these BOTH were evolutionary dead-ends because they might have competed with an even smarter species. We’re still discovering fossils, folks, and there might be a third, fourth, and so on as-yet-undiscovered species, one of which could have had human-like intelligence before any of these genera went bipedal, so no, the existence of Australopithecus proves nothing firmly; this is yet again non-sequitur logic from the author of this article.</p>
<p>Just a closing thought... History is like walking through fog: The further back we try to see, the harder it is to see much detail.</p>
<p>Oh, and if anyone wants to get more info on these two species of <i>australopithecus</i> and the newly-discovered species with whom they competed:</p>

<p>I doubt that it's a human. It's extinct monkey that related to simple chimpanzee, skull of Australopithecus is more closer to chimp than to human. If we'll see skulls of chimpanzee &amp; human, you'll see big difference.</p>
<p>Such metamorphosis of bones can't be possible even in 10 billion years. I doubt that Austoralopithecus is hominid. It's much closer to chimpanzee. Conclusion: It is monkey.</p>
<p>This article must be fixed, Australopithecus is not a hominid. I don't believe in any evolution &amp; I think that appearance of evolutionary materials in any article about animals &amp; human is violating of Wikipedia's principle of neutrality. End</p>

<dd>Australopithecus&#160;: An Ape Species</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The first category, the genus Australopithecus, means "southern ape", as we have said. It is assumed that these creatures first appeared in Africa about 4 million years ago, and lived until 1 million years ago. There are a number of different species among the astralopithecines. Evolutionists assume that the oldest Australopithecus species is A. Afarensis. After that comes A. Africanus, and then A. Robustus, which has relatively bigger bones. As for A. Boisei, some researchers accept it as a different species, and others as a sub-species of A. Robustus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All of the Australopithecus species are extinct apes that resemble the apes of today. Their cranial capacities are the same or smaller than the chimpanzees of our day. There are projecting parts in their hands and feet which they used to climb trees, just like today's chimpanzees, and their feet are built for grasping to hold onto branches. They are short (maximum 130 cm. (51 in.)) and just like today's chimpanzees, male Australopithecus is larger than the female. Many other characteristics-such as the details in their skulls, the closeness of their eyes, their sharp molar teeth, their mandibular structure, their long arms, and their short legs-constitute evidence that these creatures were no different from today's ape.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, evolutionists claim that, although australopithecines have the anatomy of apes, unlike apes, they walked upright like humans.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This claim that australopithecines walked upright is a view that has been held by paleoanthropologists such as Richard Leakey and Donald C. Johanson for decades. Yet many scientists who have carried out a great deal of research on the skeletal structures of australopithecines have proved the invalidity of that argument. Extensive research done on various Australopithecus specimens by two world-renowned anatomists from England and the USA, Lord Solly Zuckerman and Prof. Charles Oxnard, showed that these creatures did not walk upright in human manner. Having studied the bones of these fossils for a period of 15 years thanks to grants from the British government, Lord Zuckerman and his team of five specialists reached the conclusion that australopithecines were only an ordinary ape genus and were definitely not bipedal, although Zuckerman is an evolutionist himself.71 Correspondingly, Charles E. Oxnard, who is another evolutionist famous for his research on the subject, also likened the skeletal structure of Australopithecines to that of modern orang-utans.72</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Briefly, Australopithecines have no link with humans and they are merely an extinct ape species.</dd>

<p>Place Australopithecus afarensis, A. bahrelghazali, A. garhi, and A. anamensis in a new page, Praeanthropus. This is based on the new hominid family tree proposed by Cela-Conde &amp; Ayala (2003), which shows that Orrorin is more related to Praeanthropus than to any other hominid genera. Praeanthropus africanus (Weinert, 1950) (P. afarensis [Johnason et. al., 1978] is a synonym) is the type species of Praeanthropus. Praeanthropus and Orrorin are placed in their own subfamily, Praeanthropinae Cela-Conde &amp; Altaba, 2002. Strait &amp; Grine (2004) suggest that Australopithecus is paraphyletic, based on a cladistic analysis.</p>
