<h2><span class="mw-headline">Western Australian Election called - some requests</span></h2>
<p>Anyone feel like writing Western Australian state election, 2005? I know the Canadians are ahead of us in this respect, and it'd be nice to get articles on at least the upcoming state elections.</p>
<p>We also still don't have an article on Opposition Leader (and arguable favourite for the next Premier) <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Barnett_9f1b.html" title="Colin Barnett">Colin Barnett</a>. Our article on Premier <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Gallop_72e1.html" title="Geoffrey Gallop">Gallop</a> could also do with some work - it's among the shortest of our articles on state premiers. In addition, we have no articles on <i>any</i> members of the Legislative Assembly apart from Gallop. These could receive a few hits over the next month, so it'd be nice to get some decent articles - particularly on the election itself, Gallop and Barnett happening as soon as possible. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:57, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>isn't HELP the loan for full fee students?</dd>
<dd>as such it wouldnt be part of HECS.</dd>
<dd>the main differences to HECS are allowing uni's to charge from $0 up to&#160;?25%? over the recomended HECS price. and increasing the amount of money that needs to be earned before students need to repay HECS - i don't believe that any interest will be charged.</dd>
<dd>the HELP system i think is a low interest loan for full fee students.</dd>
<dd>i think that is correct. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 05:05, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>HECS places are now 'Commonwealth supported', and a HECS debt is now HECS-HELP. The pricing is different - Australians can pay for courses if they don't qualify for a HECS place on academic merit (just like foreigners). HECS has always had interest, and I expect will continue to (although it's low interest indexed to cost of living, and was negative once). --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 05:29, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A further thought. Before anyone gets too far into creating lists, stubs or articles for High Court cases, it might be good if we work out a template, at the very least for how to name the articles. I think you are on the right track, in your <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Commonwealth_v_Tasmania_e74f.html" title="The Commonwealth v Tasmania">Tasmanian Dams</a> article, to call the article "The Commonwealth v Tasmania" and insert a redirect for the pupular name. If we're going to start on prominent High Court cases, and especially in relation to the constitutional cases, we're going to quickly run up against the problem that many, many of the major cases involve litigation between the States and the Commonwealth, and many cases have identical names. I shudder to think how many "Commonwealth v Victoria" and especially "Victoria v Commonwealth" cases are milling around in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Law_Reports_4d0f.html" title="Commonwealth Law Reports">Commonwealth Law Reports</a>. My first suggestion is that each article on a High Court case should have a name which includes its proper <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Law_Reports_4d0f.html" title="Commonwealth Law Reports">CLR</a> citation. In the case of your <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Commonwealth_v_Tasmania_e74f.html" title="The Commonwealth v Tasmania">Tasmanian Dams</a> article, it would be moved to Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983) 158 CLR 1. Any comments? If a consensus developes about this (or any alternative) template policy, then I think we are entitled to start a Wikipedia:Wikiproject Australian law page, and post it there. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilasM_d3bf.html" title="User:SilasM">SilasM</a> 04:26, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that is another way to do it. I have an aesthetic preference for my suggestion, but I don't see any particular logical reason for preferring one over the other. If your suggested method is to be preferred, then I'd recommend that it be complemented by a suggestion that a template prompt editors to include at the start of their article at least the CLR citation, and preferably the citation of other report series as well (eg, Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983) 158 CLR 1; (1983) 46 ALR 625; (1983) 57 ALJR 450). --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilasM_d3bf.html" title="User:SilasM">SilasM</a> 04:55, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Major/Minor political parties</span></h2>
<p>There seems still to be some contradictions over which Australian political parties are classed as minor. I originally raised this issue on the talk page for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_parties_in_Australia_5b21.html" title="List of political parties in Australia">List of political parties in Australia</a>, where I noted that parties like the Democrats and the Greens had been moved from the minor parties section into the significant parties section. I have been creating and editing electoral division pages (eg. <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Brand_03f9.html" title="Division of Brand">Division of Brand</a>) and noting the best result from a minor party, which I have defined as any party other than the ALP, the Liberals or the Nationals (or their predecessors) or any other party that has held government in its own right. Thus, for Brand I noted that the best performance by a minor party was by One Nation in 1998 while for others it has been the Democrats. Fine and dandy, except for the fact that the information doesn't match up between the Division pages and the List of political parties in Australia page.</p>
<p>This is made even more confusing now that I see that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_parties_in_Australia_5b21.html" title="List of political parties in Australia">List of political parties in Australia</a> has under the heading "Significant political parties (and their federal leaders)", the sub heading "Minor parties include". So the Democrats and Greens are now seen as the somewhat odd minor significant parties. All no doubt confusing to the casual reader. Ideally, I would list parties like the Democrats and the Greens under minor parties on List of political parties... but if anyone has a better suggestion on how to fix this, I'd be pleased to hear it. --<a href="../../../r/o/i/User%7ERoisterer_ae8b.html" title="User:Roisterer">Roisterer</a> 23:30, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>that sounds ok. there should be some kind of threshold requirement to be classified a major party. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 23:45, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think a threshold requirement is a good idea, perhaps based on the percentage of votes recieved (data for the 2004 federal election <a href="http://vtr.aec.gov.au/NationalTotal-12246.htm" class="external text" title="http://vtr.aec.gov.au/NationalTotal-12246.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> (House) and <a href="http://vtr.aec.gov.au/SenateStateResultsByGroup-12246-NAT.htm" class="external text" title="http://vtr.aec.gov.au/SenateStateResultsByGroup-12246-NAT.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> (Senate)). For example, a threshold of 5% nationally would make the major parties the Libs, Nats, ALP and Greens (these parties broke 5% of total votes in the House and the Senate). All other parties would thus be minor parties. Also, I don't think that state-by-state variations should be taken into account since this article has national scope. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> 00:29, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with this is that the definition of "likely" or "not likely to be elected" is going to vary wildly according to political views, and this creates inherent POV problems.

<dd>How about if Major Parties are parties that have formed government on their own, or been the senior partner in a federal government (Labor, Liberal, and their predecessors), or in a semi-permanent coalition (National and Country Liberal, ie. there is an assumption of coalition). Minor parties should be those that have elected at least two members of Parliament at any level. This can include the re-election of the same person. So this includes Family First and the CDP, but not Socialist Alliance, or the 'microparties' in the NSW Upper House. Microparties can be everyone else. I'm also gonna change the Family First line in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_parties_in_Australia_5b21.html" title="List of political parties in Australia">list of political parties in Australia</a> to list Senator Steve Fielding as leader, not <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Mason_a49b.html" title="Andrea Mason">Andrea Mason</a>.</dd>

<p>Would it be preferable to decide Major/Minor/Micro status on the basis of party membership?

<dd>I went and looked at some of the Australia geographical articles and it looks like most of the city articles <i>do</i> exist; it is shire articles that are much more incomplete. For now, that will be okay, as cities and towns are a higher priority, in my opinion. My primary concern involves dividing each state map into specific regions. Regions seem to be an agreed-upon state subdivision in every Australian state, but also seem to lack the consistency of, say, counties in U.S. states. I want to make sure that the maps I make are acceptable at least in terms of <i>de facto</i> accuracy, so feedback on this specific point would be greatly appreciated.

I also have a map in Photoshop at home, with capital cities and some major regional cities marked, ready to generate png/gif format maps for each town. (My choice of colours needs a lot of work however!)</p>
<p>One thing I've found with the US county maps and the UK shire maps, is that the counties/shires are usually unrecognisable shapes, and don't offer context (ie. a map of the county within the state, for example). Also, while US counties are reasonably equal-sized (like <a href="../../../m/a/p/Image%7EMap_of_Michigan_highlighting_Oceana_County.png_b084.html" title="Image:Map of Michigan highlighting Oceana County.png">Image:Map_of_Michigan_highlighting_Oceana_County.png</a>, Australian local government areas vary greatly in size. A map of (eg) <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_%28Australia%29_71e6.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a>, with one of the inner-city council areas marked (eg. <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Casey_98e6.html" title="City of Casey">City of Casey</a>), would be very hard to read (the city - and i mean a city council area, equivalent of a county - would be merely a dot). -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 05:21, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand the issue with urban/inner-city council areas. Dot-maps were never meant to address this issue, rather simply show a city/place's location within the greater context of the country's primary geographic subdivision (in this case, Australian states). Other maps are clearly a better solution for showing where a place within a larger city's metropolitan area lies. A city council area isn't necessarily the rough equivalent of a U.S. county, although such comparisons are never truly straightforward. <a href="../../../b/u/m/User%7EBumm13_d24e.html" title="User:Bumm13">Bumm13</a> 11:53, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For completeness, the SA local government areas are at the <a href="http://www.lga.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=209" class="external text" title="http://www.lga.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=209" rel="nofollow">Local Government Association website</a>. However, as others have said, neither the local government boundaries nor the "region" boundaries are well-recognised divisions. The coastline is fairly distinctive for locating things, plus the Murray River and the major highways. It is also common to only use the southeast part of the state, as there isn't much north of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Augusta%2C_South_Australia_e906.html" title="Port Augusta, South Australia">Port Augusta</a> or west of <a href="../../../c/e/d/Ceduna%2C_South_Australia_347c.html" title="Ceduna, South Australia">Ceduna</a>. These pictures have too many roads for the purpose, the coastline needs to be heavier, and the Murray needs to drawn better. The red and green roads without the highway identifiers would be about the right amount of them. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 13:55, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

As with the Canadian system dealt with in the wikipaedia article, Australian copyright law has its foundations in English law. The Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (the Copyright Act) established the current legal framework in Australia and enacted in Commonwealth legislation a provision similar to s 39 of the 1956 UK Act.</p>
<p>In its issues paper the committee noted: Australian governments (Commonwealth, State and Territory), like most of their overseas counterparts, create and disseminate a wide range of material. This ranges from public announcements and media releases, legislation and other legal and parliamentary materials, reports, directories, guides and educational material, photographs, to specialised historical works, maps, plans and commissioned works such as biographies and art works. Under Australian copyright law, the respective government normally owns copyright in those materials where they are the creators of those materials.</p>
<p>In some of the material published by these governments there is a strong and identifiable public interest in ensuring its widest dissemination. In other material, such as general historical works, this interest is not as strong. The Committee also notes that the government owns copyright in a wide range of unpublished materials. Such materials would include submissions to Ministers, some databases and computer software. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 23:34, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I started this article, but I'm not sure now whether that is the correct title - is it <i>Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia</i> or <i>Chief Justice of Australia?</i></p>

<p><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Justice_of_the_High_Court_of_Australia_fc6b.html" title="Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia">Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia</a> is correct. The other was a title Garfield Barwick arrogated to himself as a result of his megelomania. The <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/gleesonj.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/gleesonj.htm" rel="nofollow">High Court website</a> says: "Anthony Murray Gleeson was appointed <b>Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia</b> in May 1998. At the time of his appointment he was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, having been appointed to that office in November 1988." <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 07:44, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

The holder of that office is confined to legal powers and responsibilities relating to the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Court_of_Australia_754b.html" title="High Court of Australia">High Court of Australia</a>, with some minor exceptions.

The term was used by William Cullen when welcoming Knox to the court as Chief Justice in 1919. There is some statutory basis for the term. The Pensions Act 1918 (Cth) provided for the grant of a pension to the "First Chief Justice of Australia".

<dd>But, as noted above, this was the time when Garfield Barwick, who had a predilection for the other title, was Chief Justice. The point isn't that instances of "Chief Justice of Australia" are impossible to find; it's just that they're not as frequent as "of the High Court of Australia", and if it was indeed the official title, you would not expect to see any reference to the "Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia" in any official work. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 21:24, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not quite sure why anyone would want to include it on wikipedia. I don't regard it as iconic. The originator of that article contibuted only that morsel of information and no other. The article links nowhere and has no particular context.</dd>

<dd>I can't vouch for the notability of the roadhouse. Looking at the article there seems to be an error in the reference tothe Blue Mountains. Surely should be Snowy Mountains. Seldom Seen Roadhouse is marked as a locality in my road atlas otherwise I would suggest merging it with a geographic stub article on the locality of Seldom Seen.</dd>

<p><a name="Category:Australian_mobsters" id="Category:Australian_mobsters"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Category:Australian mobsters</span></h2>
<p>In the last few days a new category of Australian Mobsters <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_mobsters" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_mobsters" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> has been started as a sub-category of Australian Crime. Two entries have so far been been categorised: Squizzy Taylor and Mark Chopper Read.</p>
<p>The naming of the category is just on the margin for me - I don't think the word "mobsters" is an Australian word in the sense that we would apply to our own local thugs. For me it is a word associated with overseas - eg Chicago.</p>
<p>What does anybody else think?</p>
<p>As the category was set up from an anoymous IP I can't talk to the user involved.</p>
<p>PS how do you reference within Wikipedia the category page without making the page on which you are citing an article linked to the category? I have been using the external link to get around that problem. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 22:18, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To link to category pages, put a colon just inside the double square brackets, like this: [[:Category:Australian mobsters]]. As for the naming of the category, they tend to call the organised crime scene "gangland" (down here in Melbourne at least) in the media, which sounds just as odd. Mobster has stronger connections to the Mafia particularly, so perhaps <b>Australian gangsters</b> might be a better name. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> 22:52, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps - organised crime figures works as well. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 23:05, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I ageee, mobsters isn't a word we use here, gangsters would be better as per bainers suggestion--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 23:16, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another quibble - is Chopper "organised" crime? I thought he was more free-lance. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 23:29, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Mobsters" is a horrible Americanism, and is pretty tabloidy even in the US. "Gangsters is somewhat better but still slang. My suggestion would be Category:Australian crime figures. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 23:37, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>More than this, "mobsters" doesn't reflect how professional criminals are organised. From what I've read in the newspaper on the topic (and yes, some skepticism is probably deserved) freelancing and "independent contracting" seems to be the rule, rather than the exception as far as the Melbourne underworld goes. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 01:22, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Adam's suggestion of renaming the category to Australian crime figures would seem to cover the issue of independence that differentiates Australian culture and values, not least in criminal activity as evidenced by Chopper Read and the current Melbourne gangland activities. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 01:48, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>New category page created - Category: Australian crime figures --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 20:30, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>My apologies. While I initially was unsure of creating a "mobster" category regarding international organized crime figures, as several others had already been created under that title, I thought it would be better to keep the categories consistant. If you feel the name itself is inapprpriate then please feel free to rename or redirect to another category. Again my apologies for the misunderstanding. <a href="../../../2/0/9/User%7E209.213.71.78.html" title="User:209.213.71.78">209.213.71.78</a> 20:48, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
