<p><br />
Austin is in Hollywood shooting a movie called 'Austinpussy' with Steven Spielberg. After the opening credits, Dr. Evil is shown to have a new secret lair behind the famous HOLLYWOOD sign. He explains his new plan: in the 70's, a Dutch man became obssessed with gold after losing his genetelia in a smelting accident, hence the name Goldmember. Dr. Evil plans to use his time machine to travel back to 1975, bring Goldmember to the future, and work together to complete a tractor beam designed by Goldmember, and use it to pull a molten golden meteor to Earth and slam it into the polar icecaps, causing a global flood. However, Austin and several other men burst in on the 'evil-laugh' sequence, and arrest Dr. Evil. Austin is knighted by the Queen, who is sure that his father Nigel must be proud of him. However, upon looking around the crowd of onlookers for dear dad, he is no where to be found. At his pad, Austin is partying with the promise of having a threesome with Japanese twins (named Fook Yu and Fook Mi), when Basil interrupts. He tells Austin that his father was kidnapped (after Austin was knighted, meaning his father simplym didn't care to show up) off his yaut, the HMS Shag-At-Sea. The three sailors with Nigel have had their penises painted gold. In search of answers, Austin visits Dr. Evil in his maximum security prison. After a flashback in which we discover the origins of the title 'international man of mystery', as well as the famous Austin 'male symbol' medallion, Dr. Evil tells Austin that the insane Goldmember is behind the abduction. Dr. Evil offers to tell Austin where Goldmember is, but on the condition Austin get him transfered to a normal prison, so Dr. Evil can be with Mini-Me. Austin agrees, and Dr. Evil tells him that Goldmember is in 1975. Travelling back, Austin infiltrates Goldmember's club (Studio 69) and begins the search. Goldmember skates around the club, showing off some incredible acrobatic prowess; since his nether regions are apparently covered in gold, he feels no pain when pulling his legs up against his chest, or doing a splits. Austin meets Foxxy Cleopatra, an old flame who still has feelings for Austin. She's undercover, spying on Goldmember on the suspision he killed her partner. Using her directions to find Nigel Powers, Austin and Nigel are found by Goldmember, who confirms his genetals are gold (he pulls off his robe behind a screen, and gives off a golden glow from between his legs). After Nigel telling Goldmember that he can't stand the Dutch, Foxxy turns on Goldmember and helps Austin fight off Goldmember's henchwomen. However, Nigel is taken in 2002 by Goldmember. Austin and Foxxy flee to Austin's time-travelling 'pimp mobile' and give chase to the future. Meanwhile, Dr. Evil is visited by Frau in prison. Frau gives him the joyful news that Scott wants to take over the family business, and has started becoming evil, to the point that he's losing his hair! A flashback shows that Dr. Evil was adopted, and that his parents were killed in a car accident, and that 'Belgian man and his 15-year old love slave with webbed feet were looting the scene', and they found him. They took him as their own, raising him to be evil. Dr. Evil and Frau french kill, and Frau slips a key into his mouth. After rapping to prove to the other prisoners he's one of them, the inmates start a riot, distracting the guards and allowing Mini-Me and Dr. Evil to escape from prison. Austin and Foxxy flirt a bit before Basil arrives with The Mole (A spy who, appropriately enough, has a large mole on his cheek). The Mole tells Austin that Dr. Evil has moved to a new evil lair just outside of Tokyo. After Austin is shown having a lot of trouble being discreet about The Mole's mole (who is perfectly aware of the irony that he himself, a Mole, has a large mole on his face), the scene shifts to a submarine shaped like Dr. Evil in Tokyo Bay. Dr. Evil is there with Goldmember, who tells Dr. Evil that they have the ultimate insurrence policy. After Nigel shows that he is a master of the spy-game (he says to the armed guards "this is how it works, you attack me one at a time, and I knock you out with a single punch, okay?". A pleased Dr. Evil mutters "He's good" as the guards follow Nigel's orders), Mini-Me captures him and takes him to his cell. Nigel shows concern over the way Dr. Evil treats Mini-Me, and after expressing curiosity if everything about Mini-Mi is 'mini', Mini-Me unzips his pants, and Nigel exclaims "My word! You're a tripod!" Driving around Tokyo, Austin and Foxxy are informed that one of Dr. Evil's henchman is sumo wrestling at the Asagi Sumo Arena. The henchman is the infamous Fat Bastard, who plays dirty to win the sumo match. Sneaking into the back, Austin fights Fat Bastard, who botches a wire-assisted jump and is thus subdued. He says that the Japanese businessman Mr. Roboto is making some sort of contraption for Dr. Evil. Fat. Bastard then confesses that he has been trying to go straight, but his childhood has skewed his sense of right and wrong. This is followed by a scene in which he soils himself, and expresses joy about the smell, and the discomfort it causes Foxxy and Austin. Back at Dr. Evil's lair, Scott greets his dad, pulling off a hat to reveal that his remaining hair is spiked to cover up his baldness. Scott tells Dr. Evil he got him a present, a fish-tank with a pair of sharks with lasers attached to their heads (the creature Dr. Evil expressed frustration over not having in the first movie). Scott and an overjoyed Dr. Evil confess they love each other, and Dr. Evil makes Scott his new heir, letting him sit beside him. A rejected Mini-Me drives his chair away, giving Dr. Evil the finger. Meeting with Mr. Roboto, Austin is prone to 'mis-read the subtitles' on Roboto's Japanese. Finally just settling for speaking in English, Roboto tells Austin he knows nothing about Nigel's kidnapping, but Austin and Foxy aren't fooled. Spliting up to search for clues, during which time Austin urinates into a pond to pose as a fountain, the two infiltrate Roboto's factory, where the command unit for the tractor beam is placed in Goldmember's penis-shaped car. Roboto then hands Goldmember the activation key for the beam, a golden key. Austin and Foxxy hold up Goldmember, who then points to a smelting machine. Nigel is strapped to it, about to have an 'unfortunate smelting accident'. Austin saved his father from the tragic fate of guilded genetals, but Goldmember escapes. After a chase through Tokyo in which Goldmember enters Dr. Evil's sub, Austin and Nigel dispute over the course of action. Nigel wants to have commandos attack the lair, while Austin wants to infiltrate it. Finally admitting that Austin thinks Nigel was a terrible father, and Nigel admitting he has no respect for Austin's spy methods, the two go their seperate ways. At a hotel where Austin is staying, the Mole is meeting with Mini-Me, who has switched sides to join with Austin. After a fight scene between Austin and Mini-Me in which Austin doesn't trust Mini-Me, the Mole explains the clone has switched sides, and Austin apologizes. He once again shows his lack of discretion about the Mole's mole. The Mole encourages Austin to just get it out of his system, which Austin does; "Mole! Bloody mole! We're not supposed to talk about the bloody mole, but there's a bloody mole winking me in the face! I'm gonna chirp it off, cut it up and make some guaca-moly!" Austin, Foxxy, and Mini-Me (dressed up like Austin now) use Nigel's spy car to dive underwater and sneak into the lair. Foxxy splits up from Austin and Mini-Me, and the three begin to search the sub for Dr. Evil and Goldmember. In the main chamber, Dr. Evil threatened the World Organization with the possibility of a global flood. Proving he isn't bluffing by using the tractor beam to pull a satalite out of orbit. Roboto enters the chamber, and demands a bonus since the beam works. Dr. Evil laughs, thinking Roboto is joking, but Roboto is not amused. Scott walks up behind Dr. Evil, now sporting a combover, and presses a button on Dr. Evil's chair, dumping Roboto into the tank of sharks with lasers. Austin and Mini-Me find a change room with a unifrom, and use it to slip about the ship unnoticed with Austin on Mini-Me's shoulders. After the sub physician orders them to have a physical, Austin and Mini-Me narrowly (and humorously) avoid being caught until the physician holds Austin at gunpoint. Mini-Me grabs a map of the sub and slides down a duct, meeting up with Foxxy. Austin is taken to the main chamber, where Dr. Evil says he'll show Austin his plan before he kills him. Upon opening the box containing the key to the tractor beam however, it's gone! Foxxy and Mini-Me enter, Foxxy holding the key. Dr. Evil is shocked to see Mini-Me dressed as Austin. Austin holds Dr. Evil at gunpoint, when Nigel enters and reveals the shocking truth that Dr. Evil and Austin are brothers! After a flashback in which Nigel says that the car accident that killed Dr. Evil's mother was an assassination attempt, Nigel reveals Dr. Evil's real name ('Dougie'), and tells Austin he's proud of him. The three embrace with Mini-Me, but Scott ruins the moment. Angry that he's finally become evil, only to have his father turn good, Scott declares that he hates them all, and that they'll all pay, before fleeing. Goldmember appears, telling Dr. Evil that the plan goes on. Foxxy throws the tractor beam key into the shark tank. Goldmember then says he keeps a spare: He turns, unzips his pants, and unscrews his golden genetelia to reveal that "His winkie is a key!". Goldmember snatches Foxxy's gun and begins to activate the tractor beam. Austin and Dr. Evil race to one of the tractor beam's conduit boxes. Dr. Evil switches the polarities, and the tractor beam explodes, along with the meteor. Foxxy holds Goldmember at gunpoint, who turns to reveal that he is John Travolta. The scene is actually from the movie Austinpussy that Austin was shooting earlier. As the theatre empties, Fat Bastard makes another appearance as a normal-weight man. He joyfully tells Austin that he lost 180 pounds in the Subway diet, but now he has a lot of excess skin, and his neck "looks like a vagina". Outside, Foxxy kisses Austin and thanks him for everything. In the movie's final scene, Scott is shown in Dr. Evil's Hollywood lair, now wearing all black and completely bald. He laughs that he'll get Austin Powers, and dances around the lair.</p>
<p>I admit my first summary was long-winded. Sorry. I made a second attempt at a much shorter version though.--<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Clawfang_c8e4.html" title="User:Drake Clawfang">User:Drake Clawfang</a>--</p>
<p>While Austin shoots "Austinpussy", a movie based on his life, Dr. Evil in anew lair behind the HOLLYWOOD sign, inveils his new plan. Dr. Evil plans to travle back to 1975 and bring back a Dutchman named Goldmember. Goldmember had designed a tractor beam to pull a molten meteor of gold to earth, striking the polar icecaps and flooding the Earth. Austin barges in and arrests Dr. Evil. However, Austin is then informed that his father Nigel has been kidnapped. Austin seeks help from Dr. Evil, who refuses to help unless he's transfered to a regular prison to be with Mini-Me. Austin agrees, and is told that Nigel was kidnapped by Goldmember.</p>
<p>Austin goes to 1975, and meets up with an old flame, Foxxy Cleopatra. The two find Nigel, but Goldmember escapes in a time machine to 2002. Austin and Foxxy retreat to Austin's time-travelling 'pimp-mobile', and follow. Meanwhile, Frau tells Dr. Evil that Scott has become more evil to the point of losing his hair, and slips him a key to his handcuffs. During a prison riot, Dr. Evil and Mini-Me escape to Dr. Evil's new lair in Tokyo Bay- A gigantic submarine shaped like the good doctor.</p>
<p>At said new lair, Scott gives Dr. Evil the "sharks with laser beams attached to their heads" that he's always wanted, and Dr. Evil accepts Scott as finally being evil enough. A rejected Mini-Me is sent from the main chamber, but not before giving Dr. Evil the finger.</p>
<p>Now in Tokyo, Austin and Foxxy discover that the businessman Mr. Roboto is in charge of building Goldmember's tractor beam. Infiltrating Roboto's factory, they find Goldmember holding Nigel hostage. Austin and Foxxy rescue Nigel, but Goldmember escapes with the tractor beam power unit. Austin and Nigel reveal their deep-seated feelings of disrespect for each other, to the point that Austin accuses Nigel of being a bad father. The two part ways.</p>
<p>Mini-Me joins Austin (even dressing up like him), and with Foxxy and Mini-Me, Austin sneaks into the sub. Austin is captured by Dr. Evil's henchmen, but Foxxy and Mini-Me quickly rescue him. Nigel appears and reveals the shocking secret that Austin and Dr. Evil are brothers, and that Dr. Evil's real name is Dougie. Scott, enraged that he has finally become evil, only for his father to turn good, flees from the chamber.</p>
<p>Goldmember appears and declares that his plan goes on as planned. He activates the tractor beam, but Austin and Dr. Evil work together to reverse the beam's polarities, destroying it and blowing up the meteor. The two brothers enjoy the premier of Austinpussy, while, in Dr. Evil's Hollywood lair, Scott dances around, now dressed in black and completely bald.</p>

<p>Has anyone seen the scene where "the Pokemon Charmander and Pikachu can be seen running across the screen." That was recently added to the trivia section, but I don't remember seeing that. Can anyone verify this? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Genesis_6413.html" title="User:The Genesis">The Genesis</a> 01:49, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's just after Austin and company crash into the Godzilla statue while they chase Goldmember in Tokyo. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Clawfang_c8e4.html" title="User:Drake Clawfang">User: Drake Clawfang</a>, April 28, 2006. 11:21 PM, EST.</p>

<p>Does anyone want to attempt to transcribe the "'English' English" speech between Austin Powers and his father, and explain the various slang and references throughout it?

<dd>You sure? I remember the term saying "English English" being used to describe the vernacular Nigel and Austin spoke in during that scene. Have you seen the film? <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimson_Shadow_fe6b.html" title="User:Crimson Shadow">Crimson Shadow</a> 16:30, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It was definitely "English English," but of course when anyone says that they are meaning "British," which isn't a language like "American" or "Australian" isn't. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseRafe_93c8.html" title="User:JesseRafe">JesseRafe</a> 02:05, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regardless of what they called it, what they were actually speaking was a combination of Cockney rhyming slang and gibberish. As for "English English" that was a reference to "British English" (sometimes called Queen's English), which is the variation of English spoken in Britain and in some former British colonies. It's mostly the same as American English, but it use words like "lorry" instead of "Truck" and "pavement" instead of "sidewalk". It also has a few grammatical differences too. For example the way that it deals with nouns describing groups of objects. For example, "Our office softball team IS useless" V "Our office softball team ARE useless".</dd>

<dd>There are three trivia comments on Goldmember's language, I can't fix them myself, not being familiar with either language, but I can see that they make redundant and/or contradictory comments. I have currently placed them together as they need to be corrected and made into one single block of text.<a href="../../../z/o/l/User%7EZoltan_Pandemonium_c050.html" title="User:Zoltan Pandemonium">Zoltan Pandemonium</a> 02:40, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
