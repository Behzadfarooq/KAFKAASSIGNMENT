<p>I haven't lived in North Queensland for a while but I think its fair to say that there is a bit of a rivalry between <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townsville%2C_Queensland_aacf.html" title="Townsville, Queensland">Townsville</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairns%2C_Queensland_be34.html" title="Cairns, Queensland">Cairns</a> (see the talk page of the former). I think there is also a general anti-Brisbane sentiment in parts of regional Queensland. (Queensland being the most decentraliased state with 60% of its population living outside the capital). Some of these might be worth mentioning in the article. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 03:50, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>people often talk about property values of different cities, some place is affordable/expensive etc. Would something like that be worth including? <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey44</a> 04:58, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn’t have thought so. I think these sort of rivalries are essentially parochial in nature, and from the discussion on the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Wikipedia%7EAustralian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_6d2a.html" title="Wikipedia:Australian Wikipedians' notice board">Wikipedia:Australian Wikipedians' notice board</a> it would appear that they are usually harboured more by less dominant areas toward more dominant areas in an attempt to gain recognition. I think arguments such as those about property prices only serve to prop up whatever case the particular parochial viewpoint is trying to put forward. The only case that I am aware of where property prices might be relevant is in Tasmania/Hobart where, as I understand it, many locals are resentful of mainlanders who have moved to the area and driven up land prices (through speculative investments or otherwise), resulting in housing becoming unafordable for those who used to live there before the influx of mainlanders. Whether that is actually the case or whether it is just a common whinge among Tasmanians I don’t know. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 05:14, 12 November 2005 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>I see what you mean, its just that people often say things like "Sydney is expensive compared to Melbourne" or "Melbourne is expensive compared to Sydney" and it is never actually clear which place is more expensive. I suppose any house anywhere can get sold for any price and with different neighbourhoods theres differences with rent everywhere, but it would be nice to get some clarification on it <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey44</a> 05:43, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But I don't see how doing that would contribute to the article, which as I see it, is about the cultural phenomenon of regional rivalries between geographical areas in Australia. The article should discuss and explain the phenomenon and the reasons behind it rather than add fuel to the fire. Both cities are expensive. I'm not sure that house prices are part of the rivalry so much as just people generally complaining about house prices (although I tend to hear it more from people in Sydney, who really wouldn't care about houses in Melbourne, wheras perhaps people in Melbourne tend to say that houses are cheaper there to make themselves feel better - I don't know). -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 05:53, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, people move to Melbourne from Sydney because of it (and less so other things), so IMO it's quite relevant. <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 13:10, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But does that constitute rivalry or is it just a reason for people moving? And you would think that if people harboured some sense of rivalry towards another city, they wouldn't want to move there. So I think it shoots the argument to pieces.. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 23:26, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the section about Tasmania being left off maps - <i>This is particularly common in imported goods at the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Victoria_Market_f993.html" title="Queen Victoria Market">Queen Victoria Market</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>.</i> was removed from the article.

<dl>
<dd>I removed it because I didn't see a reason for singling out the QVM. The way it was written seemed to suggest that QVM was in some way relevant without explaining how. Does the QVM have a particular quarrel with Tasmania? Is it trying to suggest that Melb has issue with Tas? Is it because all the traders at the QVM get their stock exclusively from a cheap manufacturer in SE Asia who can't go to the effort of adding Tas, whereas other cheap t-shirt and souvenir shops don't? It seems out of place and should be written in more general terms. ie: souvenir shops with cheap imported goods. Also, I think the fact that they are cheep imported goods means that it isn't a product of any rivalry harboured by Melbournians towards Tasmanians, but simply a reason why Tasmanians get upset. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 00:06, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Mainland Australians often use the island state Tasmania (or Tasmanians) as the butt of jokes. Many joke that people from the small island of Tasmania are inbred, or have two heads. The origins of these jokes are most likely due to the fact that Tasmania is an island state, and its (presumed) low population, when in actual fact Tasmania is much less remote and more populous that places such as Darwin, and up until the early 1900s, Perth. [1]</i></p>
<p>Is it meaningful to compare a state with a city? Granted, Tasmania's a bit smaller than WA and the NT.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess I used Darwin and Perth because it is hard to specify WA or NT as being a certain distance from somewhere else; different parts of the state/territory vary greatly. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 23:33, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've heard that Tasmania has the lowest per-capita rate of immigration from overseas (don't know about inter-state), and that it is very ethnically homogenous, and that it has been the target of genetics research since it is so homogenous (for example <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=447590" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=447590" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). By contrast, I've heard that WA has the highest per-capita rate of immigration from overseas, and that Darwin is ethnically diverse.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting article - I notice when they say 90% homogenous, they mean anglo-saxon, not Tasmanian born (they include NZ, Canada, UK etc. and the rest of Australia in that statistic). Also the study included about 14% Tasmanian-born people living in Victoria, which assists with the next statement. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 23:33, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>More Tasmanian born people live in Melbourne than in Tasmania.</i></p>
<p>More in Melbourne than in Hobart would be plausible (along the lines that Melbourne is one of the biggest Greek cities), but a emigration rate of &gt; 50% seems a little surprising. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 15:07, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Good points to bring up Andjam - the top one first - comparing states with cities - just look at population figures of the places that's why some people make these comparisons. If someone can provide exact census details at two points in time that one can be verified.</p>
<p>The Tassie/Melb issue, is that a considerable flow over time of tasmanians has occurred and generations of tasmanians have ended up in Melbourne. It was written in the sense that the outflow of tasmanians over time, has created a significant number of tasmanian born people actually now have melbourne as their place of residence. I'll check out the census tables to see if they can confirm or deny this one. I didnt write the top quote item, and would not have written that anyway. <a href="../../../v/c/x/User%7EVcxlor_b6bb.html" title="User:Vcxlor">vcxlor</a> 15:39, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
