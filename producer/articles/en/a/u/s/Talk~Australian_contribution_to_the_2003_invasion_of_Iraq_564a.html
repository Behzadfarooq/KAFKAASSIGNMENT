<p>I removed the entry abotu the withdrawal of troops, John howard in each successive media statement says explicity Australian troops will remain in Iraq for as long as they are needed. Mark Latham on the other hand, wanted the troops home by Christmas 2004. Mark Latham's policy release was on March 23rd, 2004. Please provide a source for John Howards "cut &amp; run approach" of the war in Iraq. Aside from the mistake....Great Entry! ~ Benjamin17</p>
<p>Interesting entry. Only main problem is that it's written in the current tense. Much better to use the "As of X date, ... was..." form, since that can be revised/edited much more easily later. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cunctator_a9b6.html" title="User:The Cunctator">The Cunctator</a></p>
<p>Thanks Cunc. I guess you are right. I've been focussed on getting the context in without veering way off track, and on making it as NPOV as I can. No prizes for guessing that I'm a historian at heart - I'm not used to writing about current stuff, and haven't got the hang of it yet!

<p>--- A great entry. I would nitpick and point out the Australian Army operations in Iraq fell under the rubric of <b>Operation Catalyst</b> while RAN operations were called <b>Operation Bastille.</b> Only the RAAF effort was called <b>Operation Falconer</b>. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulinSaudi_f672.html" title="User:PaulinSaudi">Paul, in Saudi</a></p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry PaulinSaudi but that is not correct. Bastille was the name for all ADF Ops in Iraq prior to hostilities on 18/19 March 03, Falconer for all ADF Ops during Hostilities, and Catalyst from the 'end of combat opserations'(read post the invasion) in 2003. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrait_d7ff.html" title="User:Krait">Krait</a> 08:33, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Australia has a standing force of about 53,000 combined services. The US has 1.4 million active soldiers, 700,000 National Guard, and 700,000 reserve. As National Guard is a defensive force which the Australian military has to carry sole responsibility for.</p>
<pre>
53,000 Aust. to 2,100,000 US regular troops.
Percentage wise US 3.2% GDP, UK 2.3%, Aust. 1.9%
</pre>
<p>Next what were they doing? the SAS were already 3 or 5 hundred kilometres inside Iraq on day one. The navy was actively intercepting Iraqi mine attempts. The Air Force was flying real missions and without shooting Americans down. They were providing real military combat services. I think the article could do with a review. From memory didn't one of our pilots get some dirty US looks for canceling a mission when he decided he couldn't reliably isolate the intended target, as per his Aust. orders accuracy in avoiding civilians had top priority. <a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaeron_489a.html" title="User:Daeron">Daeron</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I agree, this could use a review. For one thing, the first section reads like a bunch of propaganda. Given, I doubt politicians do anything much for un-selfish reasons, but geez, don't you think it's possible that we're sending people to Iraq because we *believe* in it, and not just for some selfish reason? I bet the troops themselves would tell you, they're there to help out and make things better for people, not as some kind of stunt. I certainly hope that my tax money isn't being spent and fellow countrymen aren't risking their lives for something as hollow as this article makes it sound. I hope the average Iraqi, middle-easterner, and ultimately everyone benefits from this, even if some unpleasant things have happened. It's war, I don't expect it to be pretty, but I do hope the people on the ground are doing the right thing.</p>
<p>If there's any criticism to be levelled, I'd blast John Howard for his failure to do anything diplomatic at all. Licking American boot is not what I'd call diplomacy. I think he should be asking Bush some tough questions - such as why we should continue helping them when they are doing things which could tarnish our reputation as allies, and then not taking proper action to rectify the situation. <a href="../../../n/v/i/User%7ENvinen_0b3f.html" title="User:Nvinen">Nvinen</a> 15:21, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mate, if we had "believed" in it, we would have sent enough of a force to make an actual difference. We didn't. That's the whole point: practically everyone else made a major boots-n-all commitment (US, UK) - or avoided sending combat troops (Japan, most of Europe). Australia managed to do neither. That makes the whole matter of Australia's involvement a very interesting one. When was the last time we did that? Have we <i>ever</i> done that before? I cannot think of another involvement like it. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 11:51, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here are some figures from the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a> (source: Keep Off the Skyline, The Story of Ron Cashman and the Diggers in Korea, with some creative estimation where no figures were provided):</dd>
<dd>Total troops involved throughout the war for all sites, approx:
<ul>
<li>Australia - 11 600 army, 6000 navy, 1115 air force. 339 killed, total.</li>
<li>Total for Commonwealth - no figures, at a guess 50 000 men total, 1263 killed</li>
<li>USA - total 1 300 000 men. 33 629 killed</li>
<li>South Korea - no figures, at a guess 2 000 000 men, 415 000 killed</li>
<li>China and North Korea - no figures, at a guess 3 000 000 men, 1 500 000 killed</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Keep in mind that of the 11 600 army personnel sent, only about a third (3RAR) arrived towards the beginning of the war. A second regiment was sent later, and yet another later. So the initial commitment of ground forces would have been around 4000 men. This is certainly more than we've sent to Iraq, but there were a lot more troops in the Korean theatre. Proportional to the number of American troops involved, we would have had to send about 800 army personnel to Iraq to equal our commitment at the beginning of the Korean war. I'm not sure of the exact number but I don't think this is so far off.</dd>
<dd>I'll leave this at that, I have some work to do, but I think it's an interesting comparison. We could probably also dredge up figures from Vietnam, I'd be interested to see how they compare too. My point is that Australia doesn't have a huge military and we never seem to commit large numbers of troops except for during World Wars, which is typically when our own country is being threatened directly. <a href="../../../n/v/i/User%7ENvinen_0b3f.html" title="User:Nvinen">Nvinen</a> 14:59, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've just added a few more details about the structure of the special forces task group and added my sources for this to the list.</p>
<p>IMO, this page greatly over-states the possibility that F-111 aircraft could have been deployed - to the best of my knowledge, this was never seriously considered, and there was no real "debate". In addition, I've seen no suggestion that Australia's EP-3 aircraft were deployed (Janes' reports we have two along with an EC-130H), and given that they're vital to Austrlia's intelligence gathering capabilities I greatly doubt that they would have been sent into harms way, especially as the standard AP-3 aircraft have a useful SIGINT capability. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Dowling_2e6a.html" title="User:Nick Dowling">Nick Dowling</a> 09:43, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>From the info I have, have read, there is one upgraded Elint/Signit Orion, probably similar to US Aries II Configuration, this info fits with the AP3-C Upgrade where not the full number of planes were upgraded. Although it would fit that Australia sent their Elint P3-C to use in Iraq, where is the evidence, or even evidence of 'widely reported'.</p>
<p>There may be one other 'secret' elint/signit plane in the Australian arsenal, and that is a Elint/Signit Hercules, upgraded C130-H model, done in the late 1990s as part of the upgrade of the EWSP suite of four H models, the costs associated with this upgrade seem to fit with the idea a bit more was done than said. This has been reported in the Journal of Electronic Defense (as has the one EP3-C upgrade). It is possible that one of these planes was sent to Iraq but who knows.</p>
<p>So perhaps a 'bit more source' on the Elint P3-C orion is needed.</p>

<p>As an Aussie I am a little embarrassed by the fact we feel we need this table. Why? So what? How about the alternate view: compare total KIA with commitment. Thankfully our war KIA is zero (so far), but the US and UK KIA numbers show a far different story. This table is frankly a bit of an insult IMO. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrait_d7ff.html" title="User:Krait">Krait</a> 08:47, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As an Aussie I disagree. The basic fact is that Australia's commitment to the war was very small in comparison to the commitment made by the US and UK, even when the small size of the Australian Defence Force is factored in. At the end of the day, Australia's commitment was more political than military and the Australian force contributed very little towards winning the war in 2003. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Dowling_2e6a.html" title="User:Nick Dowling">Nick Dowling</a> 11:17, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was reading the table the other way - ie a table to prove how 'big' our committment was based on population etc. Relevant for Aus commitment in WWI and maybe WWII but not here. Whilst I agree wholeheartedly that the size of the commitment was small (very small), the impact in the large SOA in the western desert along the main highway from Baghdad to Jordan was quite large - potentially preventing Israel from entering into the war. Of course none of us were to know that there weren't actually any SCUDs. Yes it maybe could have been done by another US SF or UK SF unit, however the so called tier 1 units were all in use in other SOAs. Still think its better to just state we had a very small commitment and get rid of the table. won't die in a ditch over it though. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrait_d7ff.html" title="User:Krait">Krait</a> 08:49, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This quantitative 'debate' is pretty pathetic and penile. Even if Australia did send its entire Army ~25,000 it's still a piss poor amount.

<p>I think the whole section on the F111 debate looks like original research and therefore should be removed <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. I also question if this really belongs here? The article is about the contribution and almost a quarter of the article is about an aircraft that did not participate. The whole section is an unreferenced controversy that I suspect may only be important to F111 pilots. You could for example write a whole section on similar lines about why the Australian Leopard Tanks didn't go instead of LAV25s? I feel it adds little to learning what the Australian contribution actually was. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreynurse_44a0.html" title="User:Greynurse">Greynurse</a> 01:16, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. I don't think that it was original research though - I read an article at the time which discussed pretty much the same issues. The 'debate' was pretty non-existant though and I agree with removing it from this article. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Dowling_2e6a.html" title="User:Nick Dowling">Nick Dowling</a> 19:46, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me that the line "No Australian personnel were killed, wounded or taken prisoner during the war." is incorrect. The <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multinational_force_in_Iraq_1580.html" title="Multinational force in Iraq">Multinational force in Iraq</a> page lists Australian casualties and injuries as follows:</p>
<p>"In January 2005, eight Australian soldiers were wounded, two seriously, in an ambush on the road to Baghdad International Airport. One Australian private military contractor was ambushed and killed along with a British and American counterpart in mid-2005; with another killed by a roadside bomb in June 2006. On November 7, 2005, an Australian soldier was killed in a traffic accident while training in Kuwait for Iraq duty. On April 21, 2006, an Australian soldier died after accidentally shooting himself, although this report has been challenged. For more information see Jacob Kovco. The independent Australian force in southern Iraq will remain in the country until at least late 2007[16]. Australian journalist Paul Moran was killed in a car bombing in March 2003, while another was killed five months later when an RPG struck the US military vehicle he was in."</p>
<p>Perhaps we can update this article to reflect that. In the meantime i have removed this line... <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmartaalec_6e74.html" title="User:Smartaalec">Smartaalec</a> 05:55, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The line was in reference to the "major combat operations" phase of the war and I've reverted your edit as this is an important point. I have added a couple of sentances about subsequent Australian <b>military</b> casualties in Iraq. I personally don't think that the deaths of Australian security guards or journalists fits into this article as the individuals were not in the country due to the "Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq". --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Dowling_2e6a.html" title="User:Nick Dowling">Nick Dowling</a> 08:44, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I felt that this section was biased and defended Howard: for example, it said that the 'deputy sheriff to the US' claim was wrongly attributed, and was only used by a few media commentators. Other politicians and even scholars have used this term to describe Howard. As there is a lot of debate over whether Howard is like a 'deputy sheriff' or not, it is wrong to just say one way or the other. <a href="../../../1/3/1/User%7E131.217.6.8.html" title="User:131.217.6.8">131.217.6.8</a> 01:44, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The reason we went to war is to secure American goodwill against future Asian aggression. That's not theory, it's fact. Befriending a superpower has been the sole focus of Australian foreign policy for the last two hundred years. Any Australian student who takes History knows that. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBattle_Ape_1022.html" title="User:Battle Ape">Battle Ape</a> 18:10, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm an Australian who minored in history and majored in poltical science and I don't 'know' or agree with that. Australian foreign policy is much more complex than just sucking up to the great power of the day. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Dowling_2e6a.html" title="User:Nick Dowling">Nick Dowling</a> 09:46, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
