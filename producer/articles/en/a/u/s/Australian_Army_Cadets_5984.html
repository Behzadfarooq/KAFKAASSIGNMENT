<p>The <b>Australian Army Cadets (AAC)</b> is a <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_organisation.html" title="Youth organisation">youth organisation</a> that is involved with progressive training of youths in military and adventurous activities. The programme has more than 19,000 Army Cadets between the ages of 13 and 20 based in 232 units around <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>.</p>
<p>The cadet programme has strong links to the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Army_5208.html" title="Australian Army">Australian Army</a> but it is not incorporated in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Defence_Force_def3.html" title="Australian Defence Force">Australian Defence Force</a>. While cadets are encouraged to consider enlisting in the military, it is not expected or required that they do so.</p>
<p>Activities of the Army Cadets include canoeing; orienteering; ceremonial drills; communication skills; basic bush skills; equipment maintenance; and, cadet bands. Although basic use of firearms was abolished when the AAC was moved over as a community project in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>, cadets are still permitted to use firearms on a military range under the supervision of an instructor.</p>

<p>The AAC is authorised under Section 62 of the <i>Defence Act 1903</i>. The Australian Army Cadets (AAC) is an equal opportunity organisation that does not discriminate on the grounds of race, colour, gender or religion. The AAC has a no drugs policy and is committed to a zero tolerance of sexual and other forms of harassment. Adult personnel who have attained the appropriate age and who satisfy prescribed criteria, may apply to join the adult staff of the AAC. Adult staff members are offered initial and follow-on training to enable them to perform the duties of their appointment. Adult staff also receive payment at a prescribed rate. An adult staff member appointed as an Officer or Instructor of Cadets in the AAC is not, by virtue of that appointment, a member of the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>Youth who are 12 years and 6 months of age are eligible to apply for enrolment into the AAC. Once enrolled, they may remain as a cadet until the end of the year in which they attain 18 years of age, or in special circumstances, until attaining 20 years of age. A cadet in the AAC is not a member of the Australian Defence Force.</p>

<p>The Australian Cadets have a rich history that outdates even that of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Army_5208.html" title="Australian Army">Australian Army</a>. The first unit was established in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>, at St Mark's Collegiate School, NSW. This unit subsequently became <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_King%27s_School%2C_Sydney_caea.html" title="The King's School, Sydney">the King's School, Sydney</a> Cadet Corps in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a> but it is not the oldest continually running. The <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newington_College_17c1.html" title="Newington College">Newington College</a> Cadet Unit has this honour.</p>
<p>With the establishment of many cadet units and corps at numerous boys schools throughout the Commonwealth, His Majesty <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Edward_VII_cfc4.html" title="King Edward VII">King Edward VII</a> established the Commonwealth Cadet Corps in Australia on the <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_16.html" title="July 16">16 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>.</p>
<p>On the <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2.html" title="May 2">2 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, The <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh_e472.html" title="Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a> presented his banner as a gift to the Corps following his appointment as Colonel-in-Chief of the Australian Cadet Corps in 1963. The presentation took place at Victoria Barracks, <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>.</p>
<p>On the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_24.html" title="September 24">24 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor-General_of_Australia_3807.html" title="Governor-General of Australia">Governor-General</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jeffery_8848.html" title="Michael Jeffery">Michael Jeffery</a> presented a replacement banner on behalf of the Duke to commemorate the centenary of the cadets.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the corps has experienced three name changes, firstly to the Australian Cadet Corps (ACC), then the Australian Army Cadet Corps, and finally, in 2001 to its present title, the Australian Army Cadets.</p>
<p>In 2001 the ADF approved the title of Australian Army Cadets with the short title of AAC, The Corps title was dropped so that they would not be linked with the Australian Army.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the Duke of Edinburgh's Banner was presented to the Australian Cadet Corps by Prince Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh on the <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2.html" title="May 2">2 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> (the organisation being some 46,000 cadets strong at the time). This banner has been carried with pride on many a subsequent parade of significance in the AAC. As stipulated in the Australian Army Cadets Policy Manual (2004):</p>
<ul>
<li>Carriage of the Banner
<ul>
<li>2.09 The Duke of Edinburgh's Banner may only be carried on:
<ul>
<li>a. parades and Guards of Honour which are representative of the AAC as a whole or in a AAC BDE/BN, or</li>
<li>b. special occasions as described below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.10 Approval will normally be given for the Banner to be carried on the following special occasions:
<ul>
<li>a. royal visits,</li>
<li>b. ceremonial parades which are reviewed by the Colonel-in-Chief of the AAC,</li>
<li>c. ceremonial parades attended by a Vice-Regal personage when the occasion is such that it would be appropriate to parade the Banner, and</li>
<li>d. on occasions of significance to the AAC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Duke of Edinburgh's Banner may only be carried by a Cadet Under Officer, referred to on-parade as 'Banner Ensign'. When on parade, the Banner must be escorted by two cadets holding maximum rank of Cadet Warrant Officer Class One and preferably minimum rank of Cadet Sergeant, with this extending to Cadet Corporal, should circumstances dictate.</p>
<p>On the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_24.html" title="September 24">24 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the Governor-General, Major General Michael Jeffery, presented a replacement banner to the AAC on the behalf of the Duke of Edinburgh. The Governor-General was received on-parade by some 250 cadets from units across the nation, representing the 16,000 members of the Australian Army Cadets as a whole. This Parade took place at Victoria Barracks - Sydney.</p>

<p>The rank structure &amp; titles are identical to those of The Australian Army, with the exclusion of the rank of Cadet Under Officer. Cadets are able to experience numerous ranks and appointments as they progress. As well as Instructors of Cadets (IOC's) who are Australian Regular Army <i>(ARA)</i> or Army Reserve (<i>ARes)</i> Staff, who assist cadet units with Training, Management and Logistics. Officers of Cadets can be former members of the Australian Defence Force, school teachers and volunteers from the greater community. OOC's manage cadet units and can progress through to higher positions in Battalion, Brigade and National Headquarters. In cadet ranks the CDT prefix, and for the same reason with IOC's and OOC's the bracketed AAC, which is a way of identifying the members as part of the AAC and not part of parent organisation, The Australian Army. This due to cases where by Misconception they are seen as being so.</p>

<p>School Based Cadet Units are essentially the same as Regional Cadet Units with a few minor differences. When the Whitlam government discontinued funding to the Cadet organisations government school cadet units where unable to operate due to lack of funds and equipment. Cadets was kept alive solely by private school cadet units such as <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Grammar_School_d8f3.html" title="Sydney Grammar School">Sydney Grammar School</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Church_of_England_Grammar_School_1456.html" title="Sydney Church of England Grammar School">Shore School</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_King%27s_School%2C_Sydney_caea.html" title="The King's School, Sydney">Kings School</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barker_College_5570.html" title="Barker College">Barker College</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch_College_50cb.html" title="Scotch College">Scotch College</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Aloysius_College_8c43.html" title="St Aloysius College">St Aloysius College</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newington_College_17c1.html" title="Newington College">Newington College</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normanhurst_Boys%27_High_School_067d.html" title="Normanhurst Boys' High School">Normanhurst Boys' High School</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_High_School_%28Victoria%29_667c.html" title="Melbourne High School (Victoria)">Melbourne High School (Victoria)</a>, <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knox_Grammar_School_5510.html" title="Knox Grammar School">Knox Grammar School</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_College_72fe.html" title="Scots College">Scots College</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/v/Waverley_College_3b9e.html" title="Waverley College">Waverley College</a>. These schools were able to use surplus bursaries to effectively fund the units. After the Whitlam government was dismissed from office some staff and former cadets were able to establish cadet units with the support of the local community or Army unit (using their facilities to conduct training) - hence the terms 'community based unit' or regional cadet unit (RCU). School based units allow non-members of that school to become members, in some units membership in the unit for a certain period of time is compulsory, although there are not a lot of units that still do that.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cadet Recruit (CDTREC) - Cadets begin their experience where they are allocated to a section which consists of their section commander, a section second-in-command and up to 8 fellow recruits/cadets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cadet (CDT) - At completion of recruit training, may take on other roles such as logistics after completion of their first year or stay in a section, sometimes appointed as section second-in-command.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cadet Lance Corporal (CDTLCPL) - Most commonly a section second-in-command, a variety of other appointments exist eg, logistics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cadet Corporal (CDTCPL) - Most commonly a section commander, again a diverse variety of appointments exists.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cadet Sergeant (CDTSGT) - Position known as a platoon sergeant or training sergeant, other positions exist.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cadet Staff Sergeant (CDTSSGT) - Positions can vary. Most commonly a CQMS or Company Quartermaster Sergeant. Other positions in special cases include the Company Sergeant Major or CSM and Platoon Commanders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cadet Warrant Officer Class Two (CDTWO2) - Position is generally the Company Sergeant Major. Another existing appointment is the Training Warrant Officer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cadet Warrant Officer Class One (CDTWO1) - Position exists in the AAC for Regimental Sergeant Majors. RSMs are appointed in each brigade and in the case of SBU's or School Based Units, an RSM may be appointed with the CDTWO1 rank due to large numbers. Brigade or Regional RSMs may apply and possibly receive the position of National Cadet Regimental Sergeant Major, bearing an insignia similar to the RSM-A or Reginmental Sergeant Major of the Army - encircled in a blue wreath so as to distinguish the difference.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cadet Under Officer (CUO)- Cadet Under Officer exists to give the most senior cadets in a unit the chance to act in the role of an officer without receiving a commission. The insignia consists of a large diamond, with a solid outline, referred to as a "lozenge". Previously, the diamond's outline consisted of 27 1/2 chevrons, but this was changed in the late <a href="../../../9/0/s/90s.html" title="90s">90s</a>/early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a>. CUOs are generally Platoon Commanders and more senior CUO's are Company Commanders and Company Second-In-Command's . Headquarter positions exist both at brigade and national level, with each brigade having a Cadet Adjutant who bears the lozenge with blue in the center. At National Headquarters level, the CUO is appointed as a National Cadet Adjutant. They bear a lozenge with a red centre.</li>

<p>To receive a promotion above the rank of Cadet in the Australian Army Cadets, cadets must complete promotion courses. Promotions courses are run by each Brigade for their own cadets and are planned by Brigade Headquarters. To obtain the rank of Cadet Lance Corporal or Corporal, a cadet must be deemed competent on the AAC Junior Non-commissioned officers Course (JNCO course). To be promoted to Cadet Sergeant or Cadet Staff Sergeant, a cadet must then pass the AAC Senior Non-commissioned officer's course(SNCO course). For any further promotion, a cadet must complete AAC Senior Leaders' Course - Module 2 (SLC Mod 2). After this, the Sergeant can go on a Cadet under officer's course or a Warrant Officer course (CUO/WO course). This is the highest rank a cadet will get, for the CUO's, anyway.</p>
<p>In New South Wales, promotion courses have been held in such locations as the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holsworthy_Barracks_a460.html" title="Holsworthy Barracks">Holsworthy Barracks</a>, south of Sydney, <a href="../../../h/m/a/HMAS_Harman_0a8f.html" title="HMAS Harman">HMAS Harman</a> in Canberra, and Centre Ridge at the Singleton Army Trainig Area. In April of 2006, the SLC Mod 2 course was held for the first time ever at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Military_College%2C_Duntroon_0a67.html" title="Royal Military College, Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a> in Canberra, a prestigious moment in both the history of the college and the AAC.</p>
<p>SA AAC Bde hold their promotion courses at Hampstead Barracks in Adelaide. the course is held over a week and consists of long hard days without much personal time. this 'sorts out the men from the boys' by identifying the cadets unable to cope with the stresses that come with being a junior or senior leader.</p>
<p>In Victoria the promotion courses are held at <a href="../../../p/u/c/Puckapunyal.html" title="Puckapunyal">Puckapunyal</a>. They were not held at Puckapunyal between 2004 and 2005 due to asbestos removal at that site. Instead, they have been held at RAAF Williams, RAAF Point Cook and Simpson Barracks.</p>
<p>In Western Australia the promotion courses are held at Leeuwin Barracks and Bindoon Training Area.</p>
<p>In the Northern Territory the promotion courses are held at Robertson Barracks usually over the Easter holidays.</p>
<p>In Queensland the promotion courses usually are at Abogarie just out of Ayr but in 2006 they were held in Charters Towers.</p>
<p>The content of these courses is outlined by National Headquarters (HQ AAC) in the AAC's Training Management Package (TMP), with a common list of instruction and assessment applicable to each course.</p>
