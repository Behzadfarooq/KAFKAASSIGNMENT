<p><b>Australian feral camels</b> are <a href="../../../d/r/o/Dromedary.html" title="Dromedary">dromedary</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camel.html" title="Camel">camels</a> whose ancestors were imported to provide transport through inland <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and have since made it their domain. While they do not appear to be as destructive as other introduced <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbivores.html" title="Herbivores">herbivores</a>, their increasing numbers may affect native vegetation, and they are also minor <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agricultural.html" title="Agricultural">agricultural</a> pests.</p>
<p>Many different types and <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breeds.html" title="Breeds">breeds</a> of camels were brought into Australia, but most were from <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. They included the large, fleece-bearing, two-humped <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bactrian_camel.html" title="Bactrian camel">Bactrian camel</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongolia.html" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, the elite Bishari riding camels of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Africa_6a9e.html" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabia.html" title="Arabia">Arabia</a>, the pedigreed Bikaneri war camels of <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajasthan.html" title="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a> in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, and the powerful, freightcarrying lowland Indian camels, capable of moving huge loads of up to 800 kilograms.</p>
<p>The feral <a href="../../../d/r/o/Dromedary.html" title="Dromedary">dromedary</a> camels found in Australia are a meld of these breeds but can be split into two types: a slender riding form and a heavier pack animal.</p>
<p>Thousands of camels were imported into Australia between <a href="../../../1/8/4/1840.html" title="1840">1840</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a> to open up the arid areas of central and western Australia. They were used for riding, and as draught and pack animals for exploration and construction of rail and telegraph lines; they were also used to supply goods to remote mines and settlements.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_feral_camel.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camel.html" title="Camel">camels</a>, roving in the only <a href="../../../f/e/r/Feral.html" title="Feral">feral</a> herds of their kind in the world and reckoned to number between 500,000 and 700,000, are descendants of camels imported into Australia, beginning in the mid-1800s, to help lay the foundations of the nation. Shipments came largely from the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>, but animals were also landed from <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscat%2C_Oman_5b89.html" title="Muscat, Oman">Muscat</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canary_Islands_dc3b.html" title="Canary Islands">Canary Islands</a>.</p>
<p>Arriving in a trickle that swelled to a flood by the early 20th century, the camels were often guided and cared for by <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> cameleers. Handlers came from lands as far away as <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a>, though most - with their camels - hailed from northern <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and what today is <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. But the men were all, almost always incorrectly, called <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghans.html" title="Afghans">Afghans</a> or simply "Ghans." The name stuck to a section of the 2,900-<a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilometer.html" title="Kilometer">kilometre</a> (1,800-<a href="../../../m/i/l/Mile.html" title="Mile">mile</a>) transcontinental Central Australian Railroad linking <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Augusta_c738.html" title="Port Augusta">Port Augusta</a> in the south to <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin%2C_Northern_Territory_5a73.html" title="Darwin, Northern Territory">Darwin</a> in the north. Camels hauled material and supplies to the men building that line beginning in 1879, and the segment of track from Port Augusta to <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Springs_00f0.html" title="Alice Springs">Alice Springs</a> was called "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ghan_4bed.html" title="The Ghan">The Ghan</a>" until it was relaid about a decade ago.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the town of Alice Springs owes its existence to the hardy camel and the equally hardy cameleers. It was founded in the early 1870s as a repeater station for the Darwin-to-Adelaide Overland Telegraph Line - which was also built by men who depended on dromedaries for supplies and equipment. Plodding camels not only helped establish "The Alice," they brought it civilization -or at least <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a>. The first <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> arrived in the 1880s, the story goes, strapped to the back of a camel. Aptly, the city holds a state legislative district, a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_school.html" title="Primary school">primary school</a> and a major thoroughfare all named after cameleer Saleh "Charlie" Sadadeen, who came to Alice Springs with his team in 1890. "Children were enthralled with his distinctive, flowing robes and intrigued with the long-stemmed pipe he smoked," reports the Alice Springs Centralian Advocate.</p>
<p>Men like Sadadeen came to Australia on two- to three-year contracts but often lived out their lives in the country, writes <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geographer.html" title="Geographer">geographer</a> Tom McKnight in The Camel in Australia. While a handful became wealthy, deploying "thousands of camels organized into the backbone of corporate business," most toiled from dawn to well past dusk for low pay, and lived near <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outback.html" title="Outback">outback</a> towns in little communities distinguished by the "<a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin.html" title="Tin">tin</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minarets.html" title="Minarets">minarets</a> of their hastily constructed <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosques</a>." Wherever the cameleers settled, writes McKnight, "they would soon construct a place of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worship.html" title="Worship">worship</a>. In every case the mosque was a focal point of community life in Ghan Town."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_feral_camel.html" title="Edit section: The First Camel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The First Camel</span></h3>
<p>The first suggestion of bringing camels to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> was in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1837.html" title="1837">1837</a>, just 49 years after <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europeans.html" title="Europeans">Europeans</a> arrived on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a>, when the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor.html" title="Governor">governor</a> of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> received a report recommending the importation of camels from <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> to <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>. The Sydney Herald (today's <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Morning_Herald_ca72.html" title="Sydney Morning Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a>) took up the call, arguing that camels were "admirably adapted to the climate and soil" of the unexplored country. Though it was not until the 1860s that dromedaries were brought <a href="../../../d/o/w/Down_Under_195b.html" title="Down Under">Down Under</a> in any numbers, the first camel - named Harry - arrived in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1840.html" title="1840">1840</a>, the sole survivor of a group of four loaded aboard ship at <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenerife.html" title="Tenerife">Tenerife</a> in the Canary Islands. And though they would soon prove vital to the country's development, their first representative hardly set a good example.</p>
<p>On a surveying expedition to the <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Torrens_5291.html" title="Lake Torrens">Lake Torrens</a> area of South Australia in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1846.html" title="1846">1846</a>, Harry bit the tentkeeper, grabbed a goat by the back of the neck and "chewed a hole in a bag of flour, leaving a white trail along the route," according to an account of the journey. But the straw that broke Harry's back came when he bumped his owner, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ainsworth_Horrocks_a86c.html" title="John Ainsworth Horrocks">John Horrocks</a>, just as Horrocks was loading his rifle. Horrocks lost two fingers and several teeth in the ensuing blast, and died a month later of gangrene. The camel was executed at his express wish.</p>
<p>In May <a href="../../../1/8/4/1841.html" title="1841">1841</a>, between Harry's arrival and his premature departure, two female camels acquired from the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imam.html" title="Imam">Imam</a> of Muscat arrived in Sydney via India - the fourth and fifth dromedaries to reach Australia. (The third and fourth were landed in Hobart, <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, from Tenerife, but there is no record of what happened to them.) A male companion from Muscat had died en route. Seeking buyers, the animals' importer shuttled the camels back and forth between <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> several times, but, despite the Herald's counsel, no one was interested. Finally, the governor of New South Wales bought the animals, along with a replacement male, and ordered them pastured on the Sydney Domain - government property in the capital. Two were painted nibbling on the lawn there in 1845, and the painting hangs today in <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Library_of_New_South_Wales_3f43.html" title="State Library of New South Wales">Sydney's Mitchell Library</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_feral_camel.html" title="Edit section: The Camel as a &quot;Workhorse&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Camel as a "Workhorse"</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a>, the camel was first called on to do the work for which it was ideally suited: long-distance exploration in a continent of some 7,000,000 square kilometres (about 2,700,000 million square miles) - roughly the area of the 48 contiguous states of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. But here, too, first results were far from promising. A total of 26 camels, several originally imported from Aden in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1859.html" title="1859">1859</a> to perform in a show in Melbourne, were included in the 20-man, 23-horse <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burke_and_Wills_f5bb.html" title="Burke and Wills">Burke and Wills</a> Expedition that set off from Melbourne in August in a bid to cross the unmapped continent from south to north. A picked team of four men, six camels and a single horse made the last 1,600-kilometre (1,000-mile) push from a base camp at <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooper%27s_Creek_6d37.html" title="Cooper's Creek">Cooper's Creek</a>, reaching the north coast in February <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>. But none of those camels - and only one man - made it back. Two of the camels were eaten, two were abandoned and two were destroyed when they became too tired to continue.</p>
<p>Instead, the relief mission that departed from Adelaide under John McKinlay in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a> first proved the value of camels in rough terrain - for a novel reason. McKinlay never found Burke and Wills but did return with valuable reconnaissance, and he praised his camels for their ability to move over stones and through muddy, flooded country. "The camels acted famously," he wrote, "...from their great height they were as good [in protecting the expeditions stores] as if we had been supplied with boats." Further camel-mounted expeditions helped unlock the secrets of the vast, arid interior of the country, pushing in the 1870s through South and Western Australia and what, in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>, became the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Territory_b19a.html" title="Northern Territory">Northern Territory</a>. Indeed, the first Europeans to set eyes on magnificent <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluru.html" title="Uluru">Uluru</a>, the 350-meter (1,140-foot) sandstone monolith on the central Australian plain, were the members of the camel-borne <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a> <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Giles_0955.html" title="Ernest Giles">Ernest Giles</a> expedition.</p>
<p>Australia's first large-scale camel importer was <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a>-born Sir Thomas Elder, whose interest in dromedaries can probably be traced to his own experience in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>. Nine years after an <a href="../../../1/8/5/1857.html" title="1857">1857</a> camel journey from <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo.html" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> to <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, Elder started a stud farm about 400 kilometres (250 miles) north of Port Augusta with 121 camels shipped in from <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>. That first shipment, chosen with care to meet a variety of outback needs, included light camels for riding, medium-weight pack animals and heavy <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kandahar.html" title="Kandahar">Kandahar</a> dromedaries able to carry loads up to 650 kilograms (1,440 pounds). Elder's enterprise wasn't trouble-free, either: His herd was immediately struck by mange and reduced by almost half. But with the animals that remained, supplemented by additional imports, he produced carefully bred beasts that consistently brought higher prices than any others, home-grown or imported.</p>
<p>The firm Elder founded continues today. And even though it long ago phased itself out of the camel trade, it has retained an interest in the animals. For example, the company supplied 10 camels for a 3,426-kilometre (2,124-mile), 117-day walk from Darwin to Adelaide by the Northern Territory and South Australia police forces. The expedition's arrival on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> was timed to kick off Australia's bicentennial celebrations. In 1986, Elders also aided a central <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Aboriginal_7aa9.html" title="Australian Aboriginal">Australian Aboriginal</a> community trying to sell several thousand camels to the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moroccan.html" title="Moroccan">Moroccan</a> government. With Elder leading the way, Australian camel importers began to buy in earnest as the 19th century drew to a close. Between 1894 and 1897 alone, says McKnight, 6,000 camels were shipped from India directly to Western Australia, mainly to serve the booming <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a> camps. In 1910, there were more than 8,400 camels in the country. Numbers peaked around 1920 with some 20,000 in harness.</p>
<p>The Sydney Herald was vindicated. Camels, able to carry heavy loads over long distances and go for days without a drink, proved better adapted than horses or bullocks to working in a continent half of which is arid or semi-arid, where summertime temperatures often soar beyond 35 degrees <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celsius.html" title="Celsius">Celsius</a> (95 °F).</p>
<p>Camels did a variety of important jobs. They hauled the casings that lined the wells that tapped the underground water that opened wide areas to the livestock industry that is vital to the Australian economy to this day. They carried the fencing - and later the fence riders - that held back <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbit.html" title="Rabbit">rabbits</a> from the newly opened ranges; they lugged supplies to <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheep.html" title="Sheep">sheep</a> <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranch.html" title="Ranch">ranches</a> and mines and returned with bales of <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wool.html" title="Wool">wool</a> and wagonloads of <a href="../../../o/r/e/Ore.html" title="Ore">ore</a>; they dragged scoops to carve out lake basins; they pulled passenger coaches between towns where there was barely a road; and they transported policemen and postmen on their appointed rounds far from cities or towns. Outback journeymen even found that the trails pounded smooth by the padded feet of hundreds of dromedaries made excellent routes for bicycling hundreds of kilometres between jobs.</p>
<p>The early camels weren't dawdlers, either. In a famous race, the mount of a cameleer named 'Abd al-Wadi was beaten by a horse in a 176-kilometre (109-mile) run between <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourke%2C_New_South_Wales_2bc2.html" title="Bourke, New South Wales">Bourke</a> and Wanaaring in New South Wales, completed between sunrise and sunset. But the horse died the next day, while 'Abd al-Wadi proudly rode his camel back to the starting point.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_feral_camel.html" title="Edit section: From Rise to Decline and Rise as a Pest">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">From Rise to Decline and Rise as a Pest</span></h3>
<p>At their zenith, dromedaries were in use in some three-quarters of the continent. And, in a bit of irony that Sir Thomas Elder might have relished, the Australian Camel Corps even served in Egypt and <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_%28region%29.html" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a> in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> as part of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>'s Imperial Camel Corps. The force consisted of three companies of Australian Camel Corps to one British, and a company of <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> artillery. But by the middle of the 1920s the future was looking cloudy for Australian cameleers and camel ranchers - clouded by the choking waves of red dust sent up by automobiles and trucks, the new wave of imports into the outback. From the 1930s on, in all but a few long-distance, off-road cases, the camel was a museum piece.</p>
<p>Camel men watched the value of their stock plummet. Many abandoned their beasts to the wild. But the feral camel thrived in the bush, recent surveys show wide camel ranges extending from the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Territory_b19a.html" title="Northern Territory">Northern Territory</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Australia_b9ad.html" title="South Australia">South Australia</a> in the center of the continent well into Western Australia, with animals also reported in the northeastern state of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a>.
