<dd>Jack has given her both sides of the doubt. Jack was burned by the whole Hina Myers affair, but not blinded by other appearances of treason, only to have ended up as poeple who acted for noble reasons, but for the wrong person (Spenser Wolff). Jack probably never believed Audrey was a traitor, but his past told him to take precautions, and his heart told him Audrey was innocent.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Erm... Probalbly not worth stating, but I'm new here so I dont know any better - I fixed a little typo... yea...</p>
<p>In her page, Audrey should be looked at everything from her perspective. She was married, wanted a divorce, got involved with Jack, and her ex wanted reconscile. Her father was the Sectretary of Defense, and she was kidnapped with him. Jack freed them both.</p>
<p>See, Audrey has seen Jack in all lights. Jack was a very effective counter-terrorism agent who did what it took to secure mission objectives. He was her hero when he rescued her and her father in Day 4. Jack is also a cold-blooded son of a bitch who sacrificed her husband so a Chinese national with information about the terror plot could live. After his "death" she felt geniune grief, and when she found out it was faked, she had to figure out her emotions again. What she knows is Jack paid, and paid heavily for his actions to save innocent lives. After China captured him, she may realize even more what Jack's heroism has cost him.</p>

<p><i>Victim of a kidnapping by Cheng Zhi prior to the events of Day 6, Audrey is set to return on the April 9th episode of the show, on FOX (10pm - 11pm).</i></p>
<p>What is the source on this? The way this sentence is written, it sounds as if Audrey has been captured by the Chinese, too? There has been no evidence of this. Is this just a case of poor syntax? <a href="../../../r/p/m/User%7ERpmullan_ff98.html" title="User:Rpmullan">RPM</a> 03:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Audrey Raines is dead because it was stated in episode #6.14 Day 6: 7:00PM - 8:00PM. She was in an accident and was killed.</p>
<ul>
<li>No: Jack was <b>told</b> that Raines is dead, and the "official government story" was that she died in an automobile accident (stated by Graem's widow, confirmed by Chloe at CTU). In the episode stated above, Jack concluded that she did not die as a result of an automobile accident, but if she died at all, she was murdered. On the other hand, multiple sources have indicated that Kim Raver will be returning to <i>24</i> on/by Episode 19 (if I had a link to the TV Guide page that first mentioned it, I'd update the article myself); so the best that should be mentioned about it is that Audrey Raines was <i>reported</i> (or <i>presumed</i>) to be dead. 147.70.242.40 00:43, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ok then.

<p>I read the very same site two weeks ago, <i>before</i> the revelation that Audrey died in a car crash. Considering that the first part of the spoiler was true, the very <b>least</b> that could be done is have a small note at the bottom of the page saying that a website has released <i>possible</i> spoilers on Audrey's <i>possibly</i> true fate, and provide the link (either on this talk page, or on the article page). Either way, we'll find out in a few weeks who was right and who was wrong. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_3872.html" title="User:Dante">Dante</a> 14:14, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Note that the "leaked scripts" were early in the process of production as it is quite common that details often get changed to reflect continuity (such as a "successor" to a scene that was deleted in a previous episode at last minute) or availability of the actor(s) involved (Kim Raver's availability was a question mark once <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nine_0033.html" title="The Nine">The Nine</a></i> became a regularly scheduled series... and was put in hiatus a few weeks later. There have been similar scheduling and cast changes in the last several weeks, including the addition of a character that was not originally in the season outline... and the availability of the actor to play him in a four-episode arc). So confirmation would still be needed to take this out of the "speculation" category. 147.70.242.40 01:35, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While that may be true, as long as it is <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attributed</a> to a source, there is no reason not to mention it. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 02:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> (as defined by Wikipedia policy/guidelines - there has been a battle over this for quite some time now), perhaps, if the same source makes it very clear that it was a <i>preliminary</i> (not necessarily a shooting) script and that fact is indicated in the Wikipedia article as well. What happens/happened after the release of the script would still fall in the "speculation" department without further documentation. And the last time I checked, fan blogs and fansites still are not considered "reliable sources" for much of the speculation that has been posted for "future" episodes. 147.70.242.40 17:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Her DNA was tested...it's Audrey. Besides, making speculation about a character has no place in an encyclopedia. I am going to change Presumed Deceased to Deceased. - <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackWidower_1b56.html" title="User:BlackWidower">BlackWidower</a> 21:25, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah but they did send the samples over to China, and the result must have been good enough for the U.S. Government, since they have declared her as officially "Deceased". Even if she is still alive (which I think she is) until further notice, IMO she's deceased. Mista Tee001 18:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Actually a body is shown in the file, that's the reason they had to send the DNA samples over to "confirm" it was Audrey. They also had several official documents of identity, one of which, seems to be her passport. Mista Tee001 21:29, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You misunderstand me. There shouldn't be speculation. I was saying that taking picture of a dead body proves nothing. They don't have the body. She may still alive. But we shouldn't put that. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperbowlbound_018e.html" title="User:Superbowlbound">Superbowlbound</a> 00:45, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fair enough. Mista Tee001 01:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe there is a spoiler (do not know if it is confirmed) that in episode 19 audrey is found by jack and is brain damaged. I do not know the details.</p>

<li>"Beliefs" cannot be included in a Wikipedia article. There must be a link to a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for it to be properly included... and most fan-based "spoiler sites" are actually speculation sites and not, by definition, reliable sources. "Speculation" - sourced or unsourced - is simply that, and the bar is higher here on Wikipedia than any fansite. Regardless, unsourced speculation, "belief," rumor, or "information" must be removed from the main article until or unless it can be properly documented as true and verifiable. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 20:48, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
