<p>The Community Portal was recently reverted to a version that appeared months ago. Therefore, I've called for a vote to restore to the Community Portal the version that had developed here up until that reversion. There are three drafts competing for the privilege, each representing entirely different approaches, including the current revert version. To show your support for which design should be displayed as the Community Portal, <i><b><a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_Portal_Redesign_1917.html#The_design_drafts" title="Wikipedia:Community Portal/Redesign">VOTE HERE</a></b></i>.

<dd>Possibly you have a large screen? at 1024x768 there is a large blank space immediately under the portal box. looks quite silly. is way worse at 800x600. I can take screen shot if you need&#160;:) --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiddity_6493.html" title="User:Quiddity">Quiddity</a>

<dd>Okay, I see what you mean. The issue has to do with width of the box, and width of the text (particular words). I de-hyphenated "Wikipedia-related" and now some more text should show next to the box. But the word "announcments" causes the text to wrap below the box and still leaves white space. I'm not sure of a good fix for this, though. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 04:04, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>One option would be to make a copy of the CBB somewhere, edit the layout of the WikiProjects/Portals, and transclude that.

<dd>If we decrease the width and font of the wikiprojects box, everything will work better. plus the box won't be quite as drastically "bold" as it is. I'll be bold and try it out. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiddity_6493.html" title="User:Quiddity">Quiddity</a> 04:12, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi. I have moved Wikipedia:Little Ipswich to <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ipswich_92b5.html" title="Little Ipswich">Little Ipswich</a> and made it into a redirect. Your index came up when I checked for double redirects. Here to tell you about it instead of simply removing the link because I don't like to unilaterally edit other people's userpages. I'm also not sure what the intended purpose of the index is, and thus whether deleting the link is appropriate. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 03:44, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The only reason I included this section on the Community Portal is because these links are not available on the Main Page, and because they are not easily accessible from the Main Page either (except for one). The only reason I knew where they were was because I got involved behind the scenes, at which time I had to track them down one by one. Go to the Main page, and try to find the path to these pages from there, and you'll see what I mean.<br />
<br />
Another consideration is that all the departments of Wikipedia should be accessible from a single list. Though I agree that since the Featured content now has a prominent link on the nav menu, those departments are ubiquitous and don't need to be redundantly reported in the Wikipedia by Department section on the Community Portal. --<a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 19:55, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The idea of putting the "Community Bulletin Board" in the left navigation bar is intriguing. I agree somewhat with the comments about the size of the navigation bar, though <i>possibly</i> the CBB could replace one of the other lines (e.g. "Current events" - linked on the main page anyway). As for the Main Page departments, that's an issue to address with the main page itself. For example, with "Did you know", there could be a link there for "suggesting items". We should address some of these issues to cut back the amount of information (where covered elsewhere), along with different colors, cleanup the coding, and some other tweaks while it's in the draft stage. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 20:44, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Kmf. You and I haven't had any direct interaction, but you are an active admin I've seen around so I figured I should ask you this question. I have had <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Archival_materials_cb37.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Archival materials">a request for comment on a potential policy shift</a> up for a while. I was wondering what the next step would be to actually try and alter Wikipedia policy? A vote of some kind? Would this have to be admin endorsed? I ask because adding enforcement power to RFCs is still just a proposal, so clearly this alone has no actual force. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 22:10, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hate pestering people's talk pages about AFD votes (or votes at all... it's <i>very</i> bad form really) but I've just done a huge amount of work on this article, and it is probably 80% different from when you nominated for deletion. I have found a large number of English language references, and I have used &lt;cite&gt; so any reader or editor can identify where each individual statement in the article came from. That ought to deal with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. As for notability, you can make your own decision: <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28books%29_a736.html#Note_on_notability_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (books)">the relevant guideline</a> says "Usually, books with an ISBN-number and/or availability in a couple dozen of libraries and/or a Project Gutenberg type website, and with a notability above that of an average cookbook or programmers manual would qualify". Which doesn't help really, since it's entirely subjective how you are going to compare notability of a best-selling paranoid gutter-press fantasy to a cookbook! If you rank this as below an average cookbook, I'm not going to argue with you&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 04:12, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know it's not nominator's decision to close, but thought you'd be worth asking. It generated quite a lot of press internationally, which is why I was so surprised it was up for deletion. And 100,000 copies is a lot for a "non-fiction" (hehe...). The press coverage was, I felt, worth going with (especially when there was interviews with the author, which are enlightening since they make clear how equivocal the guy is - he doesn't actually make concrete claims about CIA involvement etc, just makes a bunch of insinuations, claims it's not up to him to come up with a substantive falsifiable theory, and that the burden of proof is on the US government to disprove that they were responsible for 9/11 - which is pretty loony really) and also there was some "meta-critical" commentary (i.e. Newsweek suggests the Spiegel's apparently journalism-focused piece was actually a "playtime's over folks, we've got to get serious now" response, and midly hypocritical too). It helped to place things in context - I don't think that many readers literally believe that the CIA was behind 9/11, even if they believe the CIA could have done more to stop it - the press coverage helps to point out that most readers took at least a pinch of salt when reading it. And there's also no way to talk about the row within the German publishing industry it caused without going to press cuttings. Even when it gets published in English, the majority of the article will only be sourced to press anyway (reviews and so on), since it isn't going to get academic commentary, and how a books so ambivalent gets interpreted by editors here would be subject to such a huge amount of POV that in the end I'm sure we'd have to reinforce any "this book claims ...." not just by giving a page reference, but by stating what a reviewer felt the book was claiming. "Whispers in the dark" and "shades of grey" isn't nearly getting there, this guy is incrediby elusive about what he actually believes, or believes to have been possible. Probably because his story would either be less sensational if he was straight with us, or because he'd sound like an even bigger nutter if he had to actually back up his beliefs... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 04:50, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>In your WTC article, you deleted a simple link to an alternative view of the WTC collapse. In all your research, have you made it to Physics911.net?</p>
<p>I invite you to view this video and judge for yourself: Produced by reasearch from American PhDs, engineers, professors http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8260059923762628848</p>
<p>You'll find answers to these burning questions:</p>
<p>1) How jet fuel (most of which flew out of the crashing jets) that burns at 1300F maximum softened steel (melts at 1800F) all the way down to the bottom of both buildings. Is that possible?</p>
<p>2) See the pictures: Why there was only a 16 foot hole in the Pentagon from an apparent jet crash. Why did the FBI confiscated the cameras that showed the crash as it happened from a gas station and a traffic cam. Where was the debris from the crash of the plane into the Pentagon</p>
<p>3) Where was all the debris from the crash of flight 93? The people on the scene including the coroner saw no bodies and minimal damage on the ground.</p>
<p>4) Why is Osama bin Laden wearing a gold watch in that "confession video", which his religion prohibits and using his right hand to write whereas the CIS website states he is a lefty. WHy does he look nothing like the photos that we know of him?</p>
<p>5) How did the builidings collapse perfectly into their own footprint, something that demolition experts contend can only be done with a controlled explosion of highest skill.</p>
<p>6) Why was there molten steel at the sub basement levels of the WTC? heat from 1000 feet up? not possible. see the pictures for yourself. Was that due to thermite explosions from bombs placed? Why were dozens of firefighters telling of explosions that day coming from under them as they climbed to the top of the towers that day?</p>
<p>7) How did complete amateurs learn to fly jumbo jets so skillfully?</p>
<p>8) How come at least 7 of them are alive today?</p>

<p>I feel that an article abour the WTC should include facts about their destruction. The lack of facts surrounding the collapse of WTC7 is unusual - this should also be commented upon. Silverstein's 'pulled' remark should be included - as it is a fact - i agree that speculation about what the remark may mean should be developed in another section/article. To label any fact which questions the offical story of 9/11 as a'Conspiracy Theory' is essentially a form of fundamentalism. Surely as many people as possible should be made aware of Silverstein's remarks. What is happening over there in the land of the free, home of the brave?

<p>now that's some fast feedback!</p>
<p>i was actually just wondering if you had any advice on the whole "highlight search box" thing. I figure i should just let it drop into archives; I only suggested it in the first place to help remove the redundant search box from the MainPage redesigns! Unless you think it's worth reinvigorating, that's probably what i'll do. (i fully grok that hundreds of interesting suggestions disappear into archives, and that's ok, theyre there somewhere, or still in the collective subconscious as it were..) just thinking outloud really. <code>&lt;/ramble&gt;</code> --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiddity_6493.html" title="User:Quiddity">Quiddity</a> 00:12, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's just my personal opinion, but the longer I had the search box highlighted in various ways (yellow background color, orange and gray border), I liked it less. It was worth pursuing though. Perhaps it would be better to swap the position of the search box and navigation box, but I can't really test that out myself. And, such a change would most likely affect all languages and sister projects. I think the best thing to do right now is work on <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearching_5336.html" title="Wikipedia:Searching">Wikipedia:Searching</a>.

<dd>From looking at the Arabic naming convention/style pages (albeit just proposals at this point), as well as the Japanese naming convention page, it seems to be common practice to include the name, as written in the native language.

<p>I have one more left. yes I will collaborate on this.. A new section or whatever. But really this is crucial and needs to be at the top of article.

<p><a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">User:Ombudsman</a>'s revert of the <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Silverstein_2269.html" title="Larry Silverstein">Larry Silverstein</a> pull quote seems to me to be done in bad faith: Objections to its inclusion were by you and I on the talk page and he did not address them.</p>
<p>The edit summary of "rv: restore noteworthy section regarding <i>pull it</i> quote; the matter of Silverstein's relations to persons and entities that stood to gain are well documented, by Don Paul among many others" is full of speculation. More questions: What insight about "relations" is contained in the quote?</p>
<p>Where does the quote show that Silverstein "stood to gain" from abandoning 7 World Trade Center? Objectively speaking, Silverstein couldn't override the judgments being made by the Fire Department at the Chief and Commissioner level at the scene to abandon, not abandon the building -- apart from the speculation that the building was destroyed by controlled demolition.</p>
<p>The quote is only noteworthy where it <i>already appears</i>, namely in the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> article <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 12:54, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please see my comments regarding your sudden reformatting of this page, in which you made it into a table, inconsistent with the other related pages. I am trying to see it objectively (since I did most of the initial build up of those pages before the agressive table format you turned the one single page into), but I really don't see how the table you forced it into is an improvement. My preference is for it to be reverted back. Also, you did quite a few edits to the content, which was a bit aggressive, at the same time as the format change, losing links to specific profiles, thumbnails, etc. Since you are an administrator, I don't want to simply revert the page and undo all of your table work, without at least your response on why you did all this, and what you plan to do to (future tables? cleanup? consistency??) the rest of those pages before I put any more substantial work into them. I don't really care to waste a lot of my own time, if it is just going to be all undone by you after the fact. I am not sure about the protocol, with you being an administrator, or if there needs to be any discussion about major page format changes, such as the one you did. Any response is welcome. If the page can be put back, would that have to be before anybody else makes content changes there? Or is any discussion warranted? It seems as if huge page changes like that should at least receive the courtesy of a note on the discussion page, at the same time as the changes are made, if not before. Yet you left no explanation, not even in the notes lines of your edits, other than the single word "format." Sorry for the long message, but I am at a loss, and I need some sense of where this stands, since I had planned to add quite a bit more to the content <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteven_Russell_a32a.html" title="User:Steven Russell">Steven Russell</a> 06:45, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Aude/Archive3 –</p>
<p>I'm trying to get some discussion going on two proposals regarding the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> page, but so far have gotten little to no response. Since you have recently edited the current events page, I'm asking for your input on these two proposals:</p>
<ul>
<li>One proposal (this is the big one) involves putting the daily events from the current events pages into article-templates, a lá the monthly pages from 2003 to 2005, as well and having a consistent number of recent days on the current events page instead of a monthly archive. This would allow for the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> page and the respective month pages to be updated simultaneously without the monthly archival. For more, see <a href="../../../c/u/r/Talk%7ECurrent_events_efc4.html#Another_Proposal:_Overhaul_of_the_Current_events_page" title="Talk:Current events">the current events talk page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another proposal involves merging the content of the regional current events pages (such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_and_Irish_current_events_2230.html" title="British and Irish current events">British and Irish current events</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_current_events.html" title="Canadian current events">Canadian current events</a>) into fewer continental articles. For more, see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Current_events_13e9.html#Sub-Article_Merges" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Current events">the current events WikiProject talk page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your input on one or both of these issues would be appreciated. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturn</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">r</a> 22:23, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

He has reverted it a second time and threatened administrative intervention (which seems like quite a leap) at <a href="../../../c/h/e/Talk%7ECheers_1b1b.html#Spoiler" title="Talk:Cheers">Talk:Cheers#Spoiler</a> should I violate the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> and return the article to its beginning state. This threat rather ties my hand as either leaving <i>Cheers</i> in it's spoilerriffic state with no warnings or risk tarnishing my reputation as an editor just for trying to keep new fans from having their experience of the show ruined. Could you, as a third party and an administrator, take a quick look, add your opinion, and potentially add/keep removed the spoiler tags depending on what you think?

<p>Hi, I'm an avid contributer to the german wikipedia, not specialiced but attracted to US topics. Right now, I'm planning to write about <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedediah_Smith_3023.html" title="Jedediah Smith">Jedediah Smith</a>, one of the most interesting trappers or mountain men in the 1820s. You seem to be the person to ask map related questions. Do you know a map somewhere in the wikipedia sytem (en, commons, etc), that shows the western part of North America (from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean) with some kind of relief and shading for mountains and all of the rivers, plus maybe the modern state borders to help with orientation, but no modern cities, highways, railways and the like? If not, is there someone or somewhere I can ask to create a map like this? I believe it would be tremendously useful for all kinds of articles on the western frontier in all the wikimedia projects. Thanks in advance. --<a href="../../../h/-/s/User%7EH-stt_df7f.html" title="User:H-stt">h-stt</a> <a href="../../../h/-/s/User_talk%7EH-stt_ce77.html" title="User talk:H-stt"><small>!?</small></a> 14:50, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The best suggestion I can offer right now is to use something from <a href="http://www.nationalatlas.gov/natlas/Natlasstart.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.nationalatlas.gov/natlas/Natlasstart.asp" rel="nofollow">nationalatlas.gov</a>. It provides options for using shaded relief as a layer, as well as other options. At some point, it's possible that I could make something better than that, but don't have the time right now to do so. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 20:54, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>While this certainly not a unique situation, the disturbing fact is that user mezuri is supposedly a member of WikiProject Spam. Please look at the "home automation" section and look at the "custom install" link as well as the history page. They claim to be removing commerical links but are only promoting there own company.</p>
<p>What can be done about this situation? Who can I contact?</p>

tall ones</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I think as far as tall buildings go...there rate them in numerous ways and I will try and find the links I once saw that dicusses whether the building is measured as the tallest point of the building, be it a mast or antenna, the tallest finished surface that is a part fo the main structure or the tallest living/working area. I believe that the Sear Tower is still the tallest one based on occupied floor, whereby others built more recently are taller if you count decorative design. I know that the Chrysler building was considered to be the worlds first building over 1,00 feet, but obviously that the occupied floors are well below this point. Lets hold off on doing a "did you know" until we have more clarification about the height of <a href="../../../2/0/0/200_Greenwich_Street_365e.html" title="200 Greenwich Street">200 Greenwich Street</a>.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 04:23, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for supporting the proposal to create a portal for U.S. government (and politics?) topics. The proposal passed, and I copied my draft over the the portal namespace. It's at <a href="../../../g/o/v/Portal%7EGovernment_of_the_United_States_7a76.html" title="Portal:Government of the United States">Portal:Government of the United States</a>. If you would like to help keep the portal updated (especially anything relating to the Supreme Court), feel free to stop by the portal talk page or just go in and make any improvements or changes you see fit. In its current state, the portal is just a starting point. My interests are more with criminal justice aspects of government &amp; politics, though will do whatever portal updates needed. Thanks again for the support. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 03:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Awesome. I added some things related to SCOTUS cases. Two questions. Do you have any preference about press sources I used all NY Times, but you seemed to have a diversity of CNN, Fox News, etc. Also, do you want to have any coverage of the fourth estate itself, or just the traditional three branches of government? I think something middle of the road, like the administration's reaction to newspapers revealing all its secretive counter-terrorism stuff, would be appropriate.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase02</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 03:49, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm open to whatever ideas you and others have. The news stories were taken from <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a>, where people use a variety of news sources. NY Times is definitely okay as a source. As for portal coverage, your suggestions sound good. I'm also thinking that maybe the portal should be called "Government and politics of the United States" - though it's wordy. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 04:03, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Congrats on the creation of the portal. To briefly expand my position on the portal's name and scope, I believe it should be exclusively for the federal government of the United States, since the federal government is a corporate entity distinct from the governments of states or municipalities. I believe this will best lend itself to providing clear and accurate information about the U.S. Government.
