	    <p>On a <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> (or <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laserdisc.html" title="Laserdisc">laserdisc</a>), an <b>audio commentary</b> is a bonus track consisting of a lecture or comments by one or more speakers, who talk about the movie as it progresses. Depending on the nature of the movie, and upon the person providing the spoken dialogue, it can add a wealth of informative, entertaining information about a movie of which most audience members would not be aware.</p>
<p>Audio commentaries are located on separate 'audio tracks' on the DVD. A single DVD disc can have several of these that can be selected by the viewer from the main menu of the DVD or by pressing a designated button on the remote. Each contains different content: one has the actual dialogue and sound of the movie, while others can contain different language dialogue (for translation purposes), a different type of audio encoding (<a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolby_Digital_0338.html" title="Dolby Digital">Dolby Digital</a> or <a href="../../../d/t/s/DTS_a208.html" title="DTS">DTS</a>), music-only soundtracks, and audio commentaries. Some DVD productions include multiple commentary tracks. In general, directors are open to recording commentary tracks, as many feel it can be helpful to young filmmakers, or they simply want to explain their intention in making the film, while others (such as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Spielberg_f3a5.html" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lynch_ec1b.html" title="David Lynch">David Lynch</a>) feel commentary can de-mystify and cheapen a movie.</p>
<p>There are several different types of commentary. The two main types simply define the length of the commentary rather than the type of content. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Partial</b> or <b>scene-specific</b>, which only covers selected scenes of the film. Sometimes these are recorded without the speaker viewing the film and thusly the commentator may make more general comments than pointing out specific details.</li>
<li><b>Feature-length</b> or <b>screen-specific</b>, which is recorded in one session: the speakers watch the movie from beginning to end and give their thoughts directly based on what is happening on-screen. Occasionally these can include silhouettes of the speakers (to enhance the "live" aspect of the commentary) or even <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telestrator.html" title="Telestrator">telestrator</a> prompts, allowing the director or commentator to "draw" on the screen, pointing out specific details. There are also <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video.html" title="Video">video</a> commentaries, showing the speakers as they are recording the commentary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Commentaries can be done in various fashions. The majority of commentaries include one person, likely the director, but can often contain producers and occasionally cast members. Other types of commentaries include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Edited</b>, which is recorded at various sessions, often with various speakers. Multiple-person commentary tracks recorded for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Criterion_Collection_4163.html" title="The Criterion Collection">The Criterion Collection</a> are noted for this technique. The audio is edited into a cohesive whole.</li>
<li><b>Character</b>, which features one or more actors commenting on the movie while <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_character.html" title="In character">in character</a>.</li>
<li><b>Scholarly</b>, which is performed by a film critic, historian or scholar, taking the viewer through the significance of the film, the technique, and at times telling the story behind its making. Variations feature <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_%28aficionado%29.html" title="Fan (aficionado)">fans</a> who would also have some level of expertise concerning a title.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, audio commentaries will also include <a href="../../../h/o/s/Host.html" title="Host">hosts</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/d/Moderator.html" title="Moderator">moderators</a> to keep the discussion flowing, and will feature either subtitling or a narrator to inform the viewer which person is speaking, if there are a considerable amount of participants. The goal of a commentary is of course to add some context to the choices made in making the film, whether that be of the actual filmmaking, or subtext in the writing or direction, although some commentaries, such as in-character commentaries or group cast commentaries tend to be more for entertainment than for educational value.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_commentary.html" title="Edit section: History of audio commentaries">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History of audio commentaries</span></h2>
<p>The value of audio commentaries as a marketing tool was revealed during the heyday of <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laserdisc.html" title="Laserdisc">laserdisc</a>, the laser-based video format produced before the introduction of DVDs. The Criterion Collection company, for example, produced high-quality "deluxe" editions of classic movies on laserdisc, using the best available prints and re-edited versions. These were often very expensive compared to today's DVDs and included bonus material such as <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trailer_%28film%29.html" title="Trailer (film)">trailers</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deleted_scene.html" title="Deleted scene">deleted scenes</a>, production stills, behind-the-scenes information, and audio commentaries from the <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_director.html" title="Film director">directors</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_producer.html" title="Film producer">producers</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">cast</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinematographer.html" title="Cinematographer">cinematographers</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_editing.html" title="Film editing">editors</a>, and production designers. They were marketed to movie professionals, fans and scholars who were seen as an elite niche of consumers who could afford to pay more for definitive, quality editions. The audio commentaries on laserdiscs were typically encoded on secondary analogue tracks which had become redundant, as modern laserdiscs had stereo audio encoded digitally alongside. This is why certain older videodisc players, which predate the digital audio standard, are only able to play back analogue tracks with audio commentary.</p>
<p>The first ever audio commentary was featured on the Criterion Collection release of the original <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Kong_03dd.html" title="King Kong">King Kong</a></i> movie, on laserdisc in December 1984. It featured film historian Ronald Haver and his first words were:</p>
<div style="margin:1em 5% 0.5em;position:relative;">
<p><big style="position:absolute;left:-1ex;">“</big></p>
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Ronald Haver, and I'm here to do something which we feel is rather unique. I'm going to take you on a lecture tour of <i>King Kong</i> as you watch the film. The laserdisc technology offers us this opportunity and we feel it's rather unique — the ability to switch back and forth between the soundtrack and this lecture track...<big>”</big></div>
<p>The decline of the laserdisc format and the increasing popularity of DVD was highlighted in the fall of 1997, when simultaneous laserdisc and DVD editions of the movie <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Contact_%28movie%29.html" title="Contact (movie)">Contact</a></i> were released. The former contained one bonus audio commentary track by director, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Zemeckis_65e4.html" title="Robert Zemeckis">Robert Zemeckis</a>, and producer Steve Starkey. However, the DVD contained two additional, separate audio commentaries (by <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jodie_Foster_9072.html" title="Jodie Foster">Jodie Foster</a> and the special effects producers), as well as other bonus features. Despite its history with laserdiscs, the idea of audio commentary was still such an uncommon notion that, in its January 1998 review of the <i>Contact</i> DVD, <i><a href="../../../e/n/t/Entertainment_Weekly_7e9e.html" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> scoffed, "Who in the universe would want to journey through more than eight hours of gassy, how-we-filmed-the-nebulae trivia included in this "Special Edition" disc? Meant to show off DVD's enormous storage capacity, it only demonstrates its capacity to accommodate mountains of filler."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li>The DVD release of <i><a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghostbusters.html" title="Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a></i> contains a so-called 'video commentary' track with director, <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Reitman_d7a2.html" title="Ivan Reitman">Ivan Reitman</a>, writer/star <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Ramis_1282.html" title="Harold Ramis">Harold Ramis</a>, and associate producer <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Medjuck_97c7.html" title="Joe Medjuck">Joe Medjuck</a>. Silhouettes of the trio were added to the picture using one of the subtitle tracks, in a manner that made it seem as if they were sitting in a theater commenting on the movie as it was screened for them. This was seen as a homage to (or imitation of) <i><a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000_b5cb.html" title="Mystery Science Theater 3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>.</i> In some scenes, arrows, lines, or circles may be drawn onto the screen to highlight things the directors are talking about. The DVD releases of <i><a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_in_Black_%28movie%29_855a.html" title="Men in Black (movie)">Men in Black</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/u/p/Muppets_from_Space_4a7f.html" title="Muppets from Space">Muppets from Space</a></i> had similar features. Unfortunately, this 'video commentary' feature is not presentable when viewed on a 16x9 display.</li>
<li>The DVD release of <i><a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasia_%28movie%29.html" title="Fantasia (movie)">Fantasia</a></i> features two separate commentaries: one by <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_E._Disney_4389.html" title="Roy E. Disney">Roy E. Disney</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Levine_c6f3.html" title="James Levine">James Levine</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Canemaker_3b05.html" title="John Canemaker">John Canemaker</a>; and a second by <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_627d.html" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>, created using audio clips of interviews and a <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_actor.html" title="Voice actor">voice actor</a> reading his production meeting notes, hosted by Canemaker. When its sequel, <i><a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasia_2000.html" title="Fantasia 2000">Fantasia 2000</a></i>, was released on DVD, it also included two separate audio commentaries: One featuring Roy E. Disney, Levine, and Canemaker, and the other featuring commentary on each of the separate segments of the film by the directors and art directors of each segment. For the sections starring <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Mouse_6607.html" title="Mickey Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> ("The Sorcerer's Apprentice") and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Duck_14d1.html" title="Donald Duck">Donald Duck</a> ("Pomp and Circumstance"), voice actors <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Allwine_b203.html" title="Wayne Allwine">Wayne Allwine</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Anselmo_044e.html" title="Tony Anselmo">Tony Anselmo</a> were used to make it seem as though Mickey and Donald were providing their own commentary on their appearances in the film.</li>
<li>The DVD releases for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Atlantis%7E_The_Lost_Empire_f163.html" title="Atlantis: The Lost Empire">Atlantis: The Lost Empire (Special Edition)</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Finding_Nemo_ebf1.html" title="Finding Nemo">Finding Nemo</a></i> contained specially-edited 'video commentaries'; the feature-length audio commentaries by the directors and producers were punctuated by cues to video segments illustrating various behind-the-scenes aspects. Similarly, in several commentaries on the first season of <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a></i>, the commentators would actually stop the episode's progress and play behind-the-scenes clips, continuing to talk over the footage.</li>
<li>The 2000 DVD of <i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_Tap_1486.html" title="Spinal Tap">This is Spinal Tap</a></i> features a commentary by the three members of the band, in character. They relate how they felt slighted by the film, and how the director (Marty di Bergi in the film) did a "hack job" with the documentary. The commentary is another added element to the fiction of the band. Actors <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_McKean_d9c9.html" title="Michael McKean">Michael McKean</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Guest_9d38.html" title="Christopher Guest">Christopher Guest</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Shearer_2166.html" title="Harry Shearer">Harry Shearer</a> had previously recorded a commentary for a Criterion Collection DVD which had gone out of print.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ultimate_Matrix_Collection_897c.html" title="The Ultimate Matrix Collection">The Ultimate Matrix Collection</a></i>, a <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_set.html" title="Box set">box set</a> of the entire <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrix_trilogy.html" title="Matrix trilogy"><i>Matrix</i> trilogy</a>, has two audio commentaries on each film — one by philosophers who loved it (Dr. <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornel_West_bc12.html" title="Cornel West">Cornel West</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Wilber_82b2.html" title="Ken Wilber">Ken Wilber</a>), and one by critics who hated it (Todd McCarthy, John Powers and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Thomson_%28film_critic%29_ebc8.html" title="David Thomson (film critic)">David Thomson</a>).</li>
<li>The commentary on <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trey_Parker_5b43.html" title="Trey Parker">Trey Parker</a>'s <i><a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibal%21_The_Musical_53ab.html" title="Cannibal! The Musical">Cannibal! The Musical</a></i> (aka <i><a href="../../../a/l/f/Alferd_Packer_3b3e.html" title="Alferd Packer">Alferd Packer</a>: The Musical</i>) is notable in that the commentators — cast and crew — start out sober at the beginning. As the movie progresses, the group drinks and gets more and more inebriated. A similar commentary, featuring many of the participants from that commentary, was recorded for <i><a href="../../../o/r/g/Orgazmo.html" title="Orgazmo">Orgazmo</a></i>.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_DVDs_7da0.html#The_Complete_Fourth_Season" title="The Simpsons DVDs">fourth</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_DVDs_7da0.html#The_Complete_Fifth_Season" title="The Simpsons DVDs">fifth</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_DVDs_7da0.html#The_Complete_Sixth_Season" title="The Simpsons DVDs">sixth</a> season box sets of <i>The Simpsons</i> contain special "illustrated commentaries" on selected episodes, where two <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animation_director.html" title="Animation director">animation directors</a> draw on screen while commenting on the episode. This is achieved by using subtitle data to produce the drawings overlayed on top of the video in sync with the audio commentary track.</li>
<li><i>The Simpsons</i> and <i><a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurama.html" title="Futurama">Futurama</a></i>, both <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Groening_904f.html" title="Matt Groening">Matt Groening</a> creations, are among the few <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_series_7e20.html" title="TV series">TV series</a> to have audio commentary tracks on every episode in their season box set DVD releases. <i><a href="../../../t/w/i/Twin_Peaks_ba4d.html" title="Twin Peaks">Twin Peaks</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Show_9d34.html" title="Mr. Show">Mr. Show</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dwarf_5cc5.html" title="Red Dwarf">Red Dwarf</a></i>, the first season sets of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shield_c357.html" title="The Shield">The Shield</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodnight_Sweetheart_76e7.html" title="Goodnight Sweetheart">Goodnight Sweetheart</a></i> and all episodes and specials of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_League_of_Gentlemen_%28comedy%29_dbbe.html" title="The League of Gentlemen (comedy)">The League of Gentlemen</a></i> are other examples of this.</li>
<li>The commentary for <i><a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurotrip.html" title="Eurotrip">Eurotrip</a></i> has the writers and director playing a <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drinking_game.html" title="Drinking game">drinking game</a> to their own film, while giving a commentary.</li>
<li>When the first season of <i><a href="../../../v/e/r/Veronica_Mars_d7fa.html" title="Veronica Mars">Veronica Mars</a></i> was rushed to DVD so first-time viewers could catch up before the second season began airing in Fall 2005, the creator, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Thomas_f018.html" title="Rob Thomas">Rob Thomas</a>, recorded an audio commentary for the pilot which was a downloadable <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcast.html" title="Podcast">podcast</a> because there wasn't time to get it on the boxed set.</li>
<li>In lieu of recording a commentary himself, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a> allowed his <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intern.html" title="Intern">interns</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary.html" title="Secretary">secretary</a> to record the audio commentary for his documentary <i><a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowling_for_Columbine_e132.html" title="Bowling for Columbine">Bowling for Columbine</a></i>.</li>
<li>Despite his high profile, director <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Spielberg_f3a5.html" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> has yet to provide a commentary track for any of his films. He feels that the experience of watching a film with anything other than his intended soundtrack detracts from what he has created.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_commentary.html" title="Edit section: Alternate commentaries">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alternate commentaries</span></h2>
<p>Originally inspired by a column by Roger Ebert,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> a small but active fan base of DVD commentary enthusiasts has sprung up since 2002 offering their own specially-recorded fan-made DVD commentaries. These tracks (usually made available in <a href="../../../m/p/3/MP3_27bc.html" title="MP3">MP3</a> format) allow the fans to put forth their own opinions and expertise on a movie or TV series in much the same way as an on-disc commentary. These commentary tracks are played either by starting a DVD player and MP3 player simultaneously, or using synchronization software such as <a href="http://www.sharecrow.net" class="external text" title="http://www.sharecrow.net" rel="nofollow">Sharecrow</a>. Alternate commentary tracks were originally aggregated at now-defunct website dvdtracks.com,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> and are now collected at <a href="http://commentarycentral.com" class="external text" title="http://commentarycentral.com" rel="nofollow">Commentary Central</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of downloadable commentary tracks has since been co-opted by TV show creators themselves, as creators of TV shows such as the 2004 <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar_Galactica_%282004_TV_series%29_aaae.html" title="Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)">Battlestar Galactica</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../v/o/y/Star_Trek%7E_Voyager_e7d2.html" title="Star Trek: Voyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></i>, and the <i><a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> revival have recorded downloadable commentary tracks meant to be watched along with the episodes as recorded from TV.</p>
<p>Kevin Smith recorded a commentary track for <i><a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerks_2.html" title="Clerks 2">Clerks 2</a></i> that can be downloaded to an MP3 player for viewing in the movie theater during the movie's first run; however, the commentary was not released because theater chains felt it would be distracting to viewers who were not listening to the commentary.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>DVD commentaries have been parodied by a number of people. Most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coen_Brothers_8c78.html" title="Coen Brothers">Coen Brothers</a> movie <i><a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Simple_a2fb.html" title="Blood Simple">Blood Simple</a></i> has a fake commentary written by the Coens and read by an actor posing as a film historian. This "historian" Kenneth Loring gives information about the production that almost everyone would recognize as being totally ludicrous. He claims for instance that one the opening scene was shot upside down with the actors saying their lines backwards and that some roles were reserved for <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosemary_Clooney_38f3.html" title="Rosemary Clooney">Rosemary Clooney</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Kelly_33e8.html" title="Gene Kelly">Gene Kelly</a>.</li>
<li>In an episode of <i>The Simpsons</i> ("<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bart_Wants_What_It_Wants_4abd.html" title="The Bart Wants What It Wants">The Bart Wants What It Wants</a>" <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/DABF06" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/DABF06" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), Bart is watching an <i><a href="../../../i/t/c/Itchy_%26_Scratchy_52ec.html" title="Itchy &amp; Scratchy">Itchy &amp; Scratchy</a></i> DVD and decides to turn the commentary on. A small box appears at the corner of the screen, showing Scratchy ("We shot this at four in the morning, and the crew was getting a little cranky") and Itchy ("You can never get enough takes for Steven Soderbergh"); midway through Scratchy's next sentence, Itchy cuts off his head.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Welsh</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedian.html" title="Comedian">comedian</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Brydon_9588.html" title="Rob Brydon">Rob Brydon</a> wrote and starred in the <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> comedy show <i>Director's Commentary</i> (2004) in which he played a fictional director, Peter De Lane, and parodied the often conceited and pompous nature of directors when giving DVD commentaries by articulating his thoughts over archive footage. Although the show was well received it did not sustain viewer interest and only one six-episode series was made (as of 2006).<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></li>

<li>As an addendum to the commentary on <i><a href="../../../a/s/_/As_Good_As_It_Gets_7ff6.html" title="As Good As It Gets">As Good As It Gets</a></i> (1997), the film's director, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_L._Brooks_b665.html" title="James L. Brooks">James L. Brooks</a>, and its star, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Nicholson_0c34.html" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, share this brief exchange during the credits:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Brooks</b> [on the virtues of the then new DVD format]: "It's a better mousetrap."</dd>
<dd><b>Nicholson</b>: "...What's better? What's better? You know, we're sitting here being remunerated for what is ultimately the cancer of film, which we claim to love above all else."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Ridley Scott is an enthusiastic supporter of commentaries and the DVD format in general. In the July 2006 issue of <i><a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Film_3b2b.html" title="Total Film">Total Film</a></i> magazine, he stated:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"After all the work we go through, to have it run in the cinema and then disappear forever is a great pity. To give the film added life is really cool for both those who missed it and those who really loved it."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When DVD first started becoming commercially available in 1997, Kevin Smith was not a fan of the format. Smith expressed his animosity on the commentary for the Criterion Collection laserdisc of <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Chasing_Amy_c183.html" title="Chasing Amy">Chasing Amy</a></i>. Smith began the commentary by saying, "This is a Criterion laserdisc, and at this moment, we'd just like to say, 'Fuck DVD'." Smith has since come to embrace DVD. When <i>Chasing Amy</i> was re-released to DVD, and the running commentary re-used, Smith filmed a special introduction in which he apologized for the comment, and attributed it to <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Mewes_93d0.html" title="Jason Mewes">Jason Mewes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_commentary.html" title="Edit section: Commentary re-use">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Commentary re-use</span></h2>
<p>Some film companies transfer the audio commentary of the laserdisc release of a film on to the DVD rather than creating a new one. For example, <i><a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Mariachi_5209.html" title="El Mariachi">El Mariachi</a></i> Special Edition, <i><a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Recall_e11a.html" title="Total Recall">Total Recall</a></i> Special Edition and <i><a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaceballs.html" title="Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a></i> all contain the commentary from the laserdisc release. This may be for financial reasons, depending on whether the rights to the original commentary are cheaper to use than recording a new one (a company releasing a film on DVD today may not be the same company who released it on laserdisc); or it could simply be that the original commentary does its job well without the need for an update. Contrastingly, some DVDs do not have a commentary even though the laserdisc release did (for example, <i><a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxi_Driver_2c80.html" title="Taxi Driver">Taxi Driver</a></i>). This may be because the parties involved have not reached a publication agreement.</p>
<p>The audio commentaries of The <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criterion_Collection_76e3.html" title="Criterion Collection">Criterion Collection</a> are often considered some of the finest and most informative commentaries ever made, and the Laserdisc releases of classic films can be highly prized because Criterion generally does not license their commentaries for use on later DVDs when the rights to films they have release revert back to the studio, including the aforementioned <i>Taxi Driver</i>. Other notables include the commentary for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_99ec.html" title="The Silence of the Lambs">The Silence of the Lambs</a></i> (featuring stars Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, along with director <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Demme_744e.html" title="Jonathan Demme">Jonathan Demme</a>) and Terry Gilliam's tracks for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Baron_Munchausen_18e1.html" title="The Adventures of Baron Munchausen">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fisher_King_aa81.html" title="The Fisher King">The Fisher King</a></i>.</p>
