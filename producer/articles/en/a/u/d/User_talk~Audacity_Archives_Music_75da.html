<p>Well, they actually do have a lot of good songs with messages; the whole Master of Puppets (album) is about themes of control (Battery is violence and anger controlling you, Master of Puppets itself is about drugs controlling you, and so on) is very well played out, and songs such as <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackened.html" title="Blackened">Blackened</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fight_Fire_with_Fire_b41f.html" title="Fight Fire with Fire">Fight Fire with Fire</a> are well written, subtly anti-war songs. I still like Metallica, only St.Anger was (to be frank) a very large dissappointment, and their approach into alternative rock does turn me off a bit. But nice talking to you, and feel free to come over to my talk page if you ever see any need to do so.

<p>I have records with those songs by CMX (CD-single called "Jatkuu niinkuin sade" (Goes on like rain) and triple-CD-collection "Cloaca Maxima II") and Pääkköset (LP called "Pääkköset"). I also had that song by Juice Leskinen in C-cassette. I have listened them (forward and backwards) and they really sound like those messages have been intentionally added. Pääkköset said in some interview that they had added "satanic message" to their song intentionally. --<a href="../../../j/u/h/User%7EJuhtolv_3761.html" title="User:Juhtolv">juhtolv</a> 06:05, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Song lyrics have inherent copyright. Yes, there are tons of lyric sites on the web, and you don't see much prosecution for it, but that doesn't change the underlying fact. As to how much is fair use, I don't know. I've included illustrative lines from songs elsewhere myself. One answer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyright_issues#Song_Lyrics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyright_issues#Song_Lyrics" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> seems to be "a line or two", but I don't know how definitive this is. In any event, part of an argument for fair use has to do with the <i>purpose</i>, I think: the excerpt must be just sufficient to illustrate a particular point being made. Since the article already links to sites that go over the alleged lyrics in detail (and at that point we aren't really talking about the subject of the article which is the <i>song</i> but instead somebody else's "research" on it), I can't see where including an entire stanza is defensible; additionally the structure of the dual-quotes section seemed to give some authority to the claims which I don't think is appropriate. <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 17:10, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I dunno, the clip just seemed to hang there; it seemed odd to have the backwards sample as the only sample in the article about a famous song (it would be interesting, by the way, to have clips from each section of the song in the description section, though I'm not sure that would be completely acceptable). There is also at least one reference to a page that includes samples. I don't disagree with your statement about getting the facts on the table, I'd just hate to see an extended analysis of this controversy take over the article as it seems to tend to (I suppose if that happens again we might consider splitting off a sub-article). If you think the clip belongs there and want to re-add it, I won't object. <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 12:58, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Dan, I'd like to know what you think about this. I was looking at the rammstein page, and thought that on <a href="../../../s/e/h/Sehnsucht.html" title="Sehnsucht">Sehnsucht</a> not every single song needs its own page. Most of the songs on that page are described in detail on the main album page, plus the songs arent singles or controversial, so is there a need for all of these little album stubs? Tell me what you think about this.</p>

<p>Is there a wikipedia special page that tells about what should be done about these? As an official resource? Also what should be done about the info in the main page, kept? or transfered to the other pages and delted off the original?</p>
<p>The only ones in my opinion of keeping are the singles and Buch Dich, as its a controversial song.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Recently discovered feature</span></h3>
<p>Today, I happened to be editing <a href="../../../m/u/s/Portal%7EMusic_DateOfBirth_June_29_98b7.html" title="Portal:Music/DateOfBirth/June 29">Portal:Music/DateOfBirth/June 29</a> and I noticed the rather interesting format used for the entry on Evelyn King. Could you please explain what that is about? Also, are there other undocumented features to the template used for the entries? --Cheers, <a href="../../../f/o/l/User_talk%7EFolajimi_931b.html" title="User talk:Folajimi">Folajimi (leave a note)</a> 16:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Rather interesting option, indeed. Usually, I would have used the pipe key, as in [[Evelyn King|Champagne King]] to address such issues. However, this approach has a drawback, as is evidenced by <a href="../../../m/u/s/Portal%7EMusic_DateOfBirth_January_5_9c6f.html" title="Portal:Music/DateOfBirth/January 5">Portal:Music/DateOfBirth/January 5</a>; the listings with red links occur because the default blue links point to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namesake.html" title="Namesake">namesakes</a>. How would the documented option address such situations? --Cheers, <a href="../../../f/o/l/User_talk%7EFolajimi_931b.html" title="User talk:Folajimi">Folajimi (leave a note)</a> 15:28, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>P.S. At the moment, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Portal%7EMusic_DateOfBirth_January_5_9c6f.html" title="Portal:Music/DateOfBirth/January 5">Portal:Music/DateOfBirth/January 5</a> and Portal:Music/DateOfBirth/January 05 point to different targets; how much of an effort would it be to get them to point to the same target?</dd>

<li>Your responses to all my questions were sufficient. Regarding the redlink(s), I guess redirects would be in order... --Cheers, <a href="../../../f/o/l/User_talk%7EFolajimi_931b.html" title="User talk:Folajimi">Folajimi (leave a note)</a> 16:52, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nope, sorry about that one. It is clearly audible, but I can't seem to find any reference to it on the web. Probably should've paid a bit more attention to the talk page, apologies again. It's definitely a real one though, seems strange there's no reference to it elsewhere. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Demonofthefall (<a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemonofthefall_b0f0.html" title="User talk:Demonofthefall">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demonofthefall_d25b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demonofthefall">contribs</a>) 04:53, 7 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Hi Audacity, just noticed there's a little problem with <a href="../../../m/u/s/Portal%7EMusic_Music_news_e704.html" title="Portal:Music/Music news">Portal:Music/Music_news</a> . It's meant to show news from the previous month as well as the current month, but in a new year, it doesn't work because it's set on {{Month-1}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} - so it's looking for news in December 2007, which hasn't happened yet. I don't know if there would be a way of maybe getting it to do {{YEAR-1}} (if that works?) only when the month is equal to January? I've temporarily replaced the template includes with the actual months so it works for the moment, but it'll stop working next month. All the best, and happy new year&#160;:-) <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadder_9818.html" title="User:Madder">Madder</a> 22:34, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey audacity, are you sure because it still has the line:</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
{{#ifexist:Portal:Music/Music news/December 2006|{{Portal:Music/Music news/December 2006}}|}}
</pre>
<p>and if that's removed it stops working. And recent deaths seems to have something similar? Or maybe I'm just getting confused? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadder_9818.html" title="User:Madder">Madder</a> 22:58, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Audacity, at the time it was coming up as a red link for me, but now it seems to be OK. Maybe it was a temporary problem in Wikipedia with links beginning with v: ? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadder_9818.html" title="User:Madder">Madder</a> 17:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The list of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Portal%7EMusic_DateOfBirth_August_5_d49f.html" title="Portal:Music/DateOfBirth/August 5">Portal:Music/DateOfBirth/August 5</a> has an entry on <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damita_Jo_DuBlanc_c7e9.html" title="Damita Jo DuBlanc">Damita Jo DuBlanc</a>, which supposedly links to the recently created article, However, the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Damita_Jo_DuBlanc_ee5b.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Damita Jo DuBlanc">"What links here"</a> page for the artist fails to list the birthday page as one of the linked-to articles.</p>
<p>This behaviour, as far as I can tell, is unusual; any idea as to what might be going on there? --Cheers, <a href="../../../f/o/l/User_talk%7EFolajimi_931b.html" title="User talk:Folajimi">Folajimi (leave a note)</a> 19:59, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. When you said that you removed the list of dead people from the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Portal%7EMusic_85fb.html" title="Portal:Music">Portal:Music</a> page, are you saying that there was a list of obituaries at some point? Or are you referring to something else?</p>
