<p>Sound's pathway from environment to cortex involves many levels of processing. Sounds produced by a source are conducted through the air and funneled by the outer ear to the ear drum membrane. Vibrations of the ear drum mebrane are transmitted through the <a href="../../../o/s/s/Ossicles.html" title="Ossicles">ossicles</a> to the inner ear- the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochlea.html" title="Cochlea">cochlea</a>. The motion of the ossicles induce waves of vibrations that disturb the fluid within the cochlea. The cochlea contains the hearing organ, the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organ_of_Corti_f59d.html" title="Organ of Corti">Organ of Corti</a>. Outer hair cells and inner hair cells are both structures embedded in the Organ of Corti. Outer hair cells add energy to the fluid vibrations within the cochlea, and induce movement of the nearby inner hair cells. The inner hair cells provide the primary access to the ascending nerve fibers, indicating that their electrical messages go from the body's periphery, specifically- the ear, to the brainstem, and then on to higher cortical centers for further processing. Successful transmission from the peripheral to central structures results in sound awareness.</p>

<p>As reported by Arnold Starr et al. (1996), diagnostic test results from subjects with auditory neuropathy localize the disruption of sound information to the inner hair cells of the cochlea, the synapse between the inner hair cells and the auditory nerve, or a lesion of the ascending auditory nerve itself, or a combination of the three.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditory_neuropathy.html" title="Edit section: Diagnosing AN with ABR and OAEs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Diagnosing AN with ABR and OAEs</span></h2>
<p>Auditory neuropathy is diagnosed when normal <a href="../../../o/t/o/Otoacoustic_emissions.html" title="Otoacoustic emissions">otoacoustic emissions</a> (OAEs) are found in combination with absent or abnormal <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditory_brainstem_response.html" title="Auditory brainstem response">auditory brainstem response</a> (ABR). A little background: OAEs measure the health of the outer hair cells of the cochlea by recording the tiny sound vibrations that they emit in response to an acoustic stimulus. OAEs are generally present in ears with a healthy outer hair cell population (see Probst et al., 1987). Of the two types of auditory hair cells, the outer hair cells are generally the most sensitive to insult and likely to suffer damage before the inner hair cells would. The presence of robust and repeatable OAEs are strongly suggestive of either normal cochlear function or, at most, a mild sensory (ie, cochlear) hearing loss- we reason that present outer hair cells <i>suggest</i> present inner hair cells. Auditory neuropathy presents a case where the presence of robust OAEs is not a sure indicator of healthy inner hair cell function. Clinical testing of the inner hair cell/nerve fiber complex can be accomplished by a number of tests including ABR and middle ear muscle reflexes. (Berlin et al. 2005).</p>
<p>An ABR measures the synchronous transmission of sound information from the inner ear to the lower auditory brainstem, and can be used as an objective test of whether or not the brainstem is receiving synchronous information from the cochlea. The ABR is an electrical waveform that consists of seven positive deflections that represent bursts of intentionally-evoked neural activity; the seven waves are attributed to several locations along the ascending sound pathway from the cochlea through the brainstem (see Moller et al., 1981). Neither ABR nor OAEs are true tests of hearing, but together they assess a person's physiologic response to sound. Normal OAEs in the presence of an abnormal ABR suggests that information on its way to higher processing centers is disrupted somewhere between the inner hair cells of the cochlea and the ascending pathway to the brainstem.</p>
<p><br />
The ABR is widely used as a reasonable predictor of hearing ability and is one of the two major screening tools used by hospitals and clinics to test the hearing of babies. Changes in ABR wave morphology and latency-intensity functions are used to estimate hearing ability in certain pitches to within 10 to 20 dB; the absence of an ABR at maximum click intensity is consistent with severe to profound hearing losses (Rance et al., 1998; Stapells &amp; Oates, 1997). Auditory neuropathy presents a case where ABR cannot be used to reliably predict a person’s <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audiogram.html" title="Audiogram">audiogram</a>. Despite an absent or distorted ABR, individuals with AN display a cortical awareness of sound and can sometimes demonstrate some degree of useable hearing.</p>
<p><br />
Sometimes people with AN are subsequently diagnosed with peripheral neuropathies such as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charcot-Marie-Tooth_disease_4451.html" title="Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease">Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedreich%27s_ataxia.html" title="Friedreich's ataxia">Friedreich's ataxia</a>. Diseases such as these are known to clinically manifest with absent or distorted ABRs (Butinar et al., 2000; De Pablos et al., 1991), a result of axonal demyelination, degeneration, or neuronal death within the peripheral nervous system, including the auditory nerve.</p>
<p><a name="Residual_Auditory_Function" id="Residual_Auditory_Function"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditory_neuropathy.html" title="Edit section: Residual Auditory Function">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Residual Auditory Function</span></h2>
<p>There are three dimensions to sound: Frequency (analogous to pitch), Intensity (analogous to Loudness) and Time. Most hearing loss which is plotted on a two dimension Frequency-by-Intensity chart leads to predictable stable performance. Auditory Neuropathy/Dys-synchrony (AN/AD)(Berlin et al. 2003) affects temporal dimensions (Zeng et. al )and does not follow the same predictable rules. Therefore, there is no characteristic audiogram depicting a degree of hearing loss associated with AN. Evidence from several studies (reviewed in Rance &amp; Aud, 2005) indicate that various individuals have demonstrated a wide array of audiometrically charted hearing losses, including permanent or fluctuating, unilateral or bilateral, stable or progressive, progressively worsening or progressively improving, as well as spontaneous recovery.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearing_aids.html" title="Hearing aids">Hearing aids</a> are usually not beneficial to individuals with AN, even though they may exhibit a significant hearing loss. There are prolific, subjective reports from adults with AN relating that they have awareness of people speaking, but their discrimination of the specific words isn’t there. (See the external link for an amazing simulation of auditory neuropathy). Sometimes the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio provided hy hearing aids and other assistive listening devices are helpful. Some with AN do well with amplification (Doyle et al., 1998; Rance et al., 1999), but the majority of people find that hearing aids do not improve their understanding of speech. <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychoacoustic.html" title="Psychoacoustic">Psychoacoustic</a> experimentation of children with AN suggest the ability to differentiate between sound's pitches is largely intact- the difficulties understanding speech are significantly related to signal distortion introduced by temporal resolution problems- the <i>separation</i> of sound events over time (Rance et al., 2004). Being able to separate the speech information we hear into pitches, and organizing the message over time, contribute to speech perception in a big way. It follows that problems with speech perception result from temporal signal distortion- not from the loss of signal intensity. Hearing aids provide amplification of sound signals, they do not fix temporal distortion of the sound signal due to physiologic processing problems. People with milder forms of AN/AD are often mis-diagnosed as having (Central) Auditory Processing Disorders; however, with the use of middle ear muscle reflexes (which are almost always absent or elevated in AN/AD) one can get a quick index of whether to do an Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) to differentiate CAPD from AN/AD. AN/AD patients will have absent or severely de-synchronized ABRs while CAPDs will show normal ABRs both to a positive polarity (condensation) and negative polarity (Rarefaction) click (Berlin et al., 1998).</p>
<p>Some people with AN are helped by <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochlear_implants.html" title="Cochlear implants">cochlear implants</a>. Conceptually, if AN is a result of inner hair cell damage or an improper synapse across the junction to the auditory nerve, success with a cochlear implant would be related to the fact that the electrodes bypass those elements and stimulate the nerve directly. There are reports of unfavorable outcomes of cochlear implantation in patients with AN (Rance et al., 1999), leading to skepticism of implantation as a viable treatment for the disorder. However, more recent accounts of successful implantation of children with AN exist (Shallop et al., 2001; Mason et al, 2003), as well as very encouraging information about subsequent improvements in their speech perception abilities (see Zeng &amp; Liu, 2006).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditory_neuropathy.html" title="Edit section: Conclusion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Even with Universal Newborn Hearing Screenings (UNHS) being mandated in 37 states in the USA, sometimes children with hearing loss remain undetected. Auditory neuropathy is a prime example, as most UNHS programs utilize either ABR or OAEs as a screening tool. Rarely are the two used in combination due to the staggering cost necessary to implement such a program. This is an unfortunate reality for babies with auditory neuropathy- it is the distinct combination of present OAEs and absent ABR that usually first indicate a possible case of AN in the clinical setting. However, <b>parental suspicion of a hearing loss continues to be a trustworthy screening tool</b> in the unfortunate event that AN would go undetected at birth. If a parent suspects a hearing loss, <b>that is sufficient reason</b> to seek professional assessment of the child by an audiologist. An audiologist is a specialist in the domain of hearing assessment and hearing loss, and he or she can be extremely useful in the provision of information needed to guide newly diagnosed families.</p>
