<p>One last thought, at this point, with places like "Full Sail" and other giant campuses just for this area of training, shouldn't there be a seperate article soley for either audio engineering/production OR 'media' production (Full Sail being an exmaple I can think of; I've seen where the video students film a performance by the music theory/performance students, and the lighting tech's do their thing, and the live sound guys run the FOH stuff, with other groups recording audio to tape or running in-ear monitors...that kind of thing) schools? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.114.145.238 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.114.145.238.html" title="User talk:66.114.145.238">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.114.145.238_bc0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.114.145.238">contribs</a>) 22:31, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Is the statement about the uselessness of many degrees appropriate? <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStizz_cd10.html" title="User:Stizz">Stizz</a> 15:57, 4 January 2007 (UTC)Stizz</p>
<p>Yes, that is absolutely necessary for such an article. 4.january 2007-Anonymus.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's worth noting that a formal engineering degree is usually worth nothing if it's not accredited by a national or international accreditation organization, such as EurIng, NORDING"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am sorry, but in 25 years as a professional audio engineer, I have never met anyone with one of these accredited degrees. As a matter of fact, many of the most successful recording and mixing engineers have no degree whatsoever! <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStizz_cd10.html" title="User:Stizz">Stizz</a> 17:18, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I have to ask why a site such as this <a href="http://www.audioracle.com/Articles/Schools/AudioSchools.php" class="external free" title="http://www.audioracle.com/Articles/Schools/AudioSchools.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.audioracle.com/Articles/Schools/AudioSchools.php</a></p>
<p>Is listed as it is not an authoratative resources for this subject at all, and excludes many schools and options for audio engineering learning, not least the distance learning solution of <a href="http://www.audiocourses.com" class="external free" title="http://www.audiocourses.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.audiocourses.com</a> for one and there are many many more!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, regardless of how you feel, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertising</a> audiocourses.com is not allowed. <a href="../../../v/e/i/User%7EVeinor_0082.html" title="User:Veinor">Veinor</a> <a href="../../../v/e/i/User_talk%7EVeinor_8b70.html" title="User talk:Veinor"><sup>(talk to me)</sup></a> 22:11, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No I dont want to advertise, I in fact think it is a very suitable link for the area, being a verified audio engineering qualification with staff as members of the Audio Engineering Society. And even if it the resource was not entered, I still feel the resource for that audio schools site is limited and frankly very under-represented and does not indicate exactly what is our there for apsiring students.</p>
<p>It seems to me that <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertising</a> <a href="http://www.audioracle.com/Articles/Schools/AudioSchools.php" class="external free" title="http://www.audioracle.com/Articles/Schools/AudioSchools.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.audioracle.com/Articles/Schools/AudioSchools.php</a> should not be allowed here, as it only lists 5 schools that have paid to be listed there. The Mix directory has well over 100 programs listed, and should be sufficient for American students.<a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStizz_cd10.html" title="User:Stizz">Stizz</a> 21:44, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am working on "audio engineers" as in the "scientists and experimenters involved in the history and current development of electromechanical loudspeakers." To that end, I feel some sort of delineation between the two is in order so that in the future the categories and lists are topic specific. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncjr_9e82.html" title="User:Ancjr">Ancjr</a> 09:06, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think this article has a somewhat narrow definition of what an audio engineer actually is. Audio engineer is a very broad term, and the article seems to indicate that a recording engineer and a sound engineer are the same thing. Well, I tend to disagree. I actually am an audio engineer, but I am not a recording engineer. I design and plan large-scale, permanent audio installations in places like concert halls, convention centers, hotels, churches, etc. While I am fully capable of operating a mixing board or any other piece of audio gear, I do not get paid to mix audio. I'm sure that people like sound effects designers or foley artists would consider themselves audio engineers too, but not recording engineers. I think that a clear distinction should be made; and more research should be done before writing such a matter-of-fact article. Snottywong 00:14, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Snotty, I think sound engineer is descriptive of a person that manipulates, records, and otherwise works with sound. I think your profession would better be described as a audio room designer, or an acoustical engineer, or something of the like.Therminator 02:26, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Not sure why someone removed someone's edit adding SAE institute, and my edit adding recordingjunkie.com. But signing in and having proper discussion should be done. Especially when leaving other links that are similar such as NORDING, or the sound and lighting link that is less relevant to audio engineering than recordingjunkie which is audio engineering specific. If content and quality are an issue, neither NORDING nor the uk sound and lighting links should remain. Better resources, such as pro-soundweb.com or gearslutz.com would be higher quality communities. Please sign in before deleting and at least discuss why or why not things should or should not be included. Thank you. Therminator 03:11, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it is correct to not list links to schools, because it quickly gets out of hand as has been seen here. As regards "Communities", I am not familar with the other sites listed and discussed, but I am adding gearslutz, as I find that to be a highly useful and reputable site with a very active community of audio engineers.<a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStizz_cd10.html" title="User:Stizz">Stizz</a> 15:42, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why then delete those other audio sites, while keeping NORDING and EURLNG which noone seems to know who they are. I feel that your removing the other schools and other sites, but selectively leaving others that noone is familiar with is biasing this entry. If those are to remain off then we should remove all sites until they are discussed. From past discussion it seems that other schools were listed in the past, in a non-biased alphabetical order. Aside from that, Gearslutz is a good one to remain I agree, but UK sound and lighting is not. I also think NORDING should be removed since it doesnt seem they are english speaking for the most part, this is the ENGLISH version of the wikipedia, nording might be more at home on the Nederlans version?
