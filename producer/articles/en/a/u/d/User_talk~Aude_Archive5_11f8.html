<p>Why did you mark my edit to this article as vandalism? I gave an explanation for the edit and it was because the link to the picture doesn't work anymore. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFighting_for_Justice_4e45.html" title="User:Fighting for Justice">Fighting for Justice</a> 21:39, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. I never said anything about vandalism. Quite the contrary, I said "re: taxi photo (will find another link)". Also, there was a minor problem with the formatting of the references. I know the taxi photo is available many other places on the web, including the DOD itself. With some time to find it, I will put it in. Thanks.

<dd>Rather than finding another link, I put the taxicab photo directly in the article. (since it's public domain, from the DOD) Hope this is satisfactory. Without your edit and talk page comment, I don't think I would have noticed the bad link.

<p>I was looking at the contribute categories and thought I'd like to work on cleanup and/or copy editing but when I was clicking on articles to find one to work on I noticed that some of those on the lists had no tag at the top of the page.

<dd>I generally stay out of controversial political articles, so might not be able to give the best answers here. But, will try to answer your questions. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> requires that both sides of an issue are included, though in respect with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">due weight</a> to each side. ("the article should fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by a reliable source, and should do so in proportion to the prominence of each.") Is Media Matters a reliable source? If so, what they say could be included (though, in company of other viewpoints). I don't think you need a citation for Hannity saying "X", as long Media Matters (or anything else) is considered a reliable source. As for the second question, I'm not familiar with the specifics regarding Hannity, and how important (or not) they are to his bio. In general, I think the criticism can be included on biographical articles. <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a> provides more guidance on how to handle such articles. The bottom line is that criticism should be well-sourced. Ultimately, it's up to editors on <a href="../../../s/e/a/Talk%7ESean_Hannity_a0ce.html" title="Talk:Sean Hannity">Talk:Sean Hannity</a>, to reach <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> and decide if Media Matters is a reliable source, how much due weight to give the criticism, and whether to include in his bio article or only on the articles about the shows. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 04:34, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. Criminology is a main area of expertise, so there is plenty for me to work on here. With gun violence, it's inevitable to get people with strong POV.

<p>I drifted in from <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">WP:PR</a>. In the intro, you cite a source about gun injuries - does the original source differentiate between <i>violent</i> gun injuries and those that occur in hunting accidents et al.? I have no idea whether that's even a significant proportion but it might be better to be very precise. I hope to keep reading and make some changes/suggestions. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaisershatner_51b9.html" title="User:Kaisershatner">Kaisershatner</a> 18:50, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think the source makes a distinction between violent gun injuries and accidental. The source is the National Academy of Science, which in turn gets the figure from the CDC. I think the CDC derives their figures from hospital surveillance data.I will try and dig up the original CDC source, to clarify what the figure covers.

<p>In reference to your request to not add links to the prison Wikipedia page - I added Corrections.com because it is an unbiased news and information source for and about the corrections industry. It provides daily news about corrections as well as feature stories and resources. Therefore, I think it is a relevant piece to the prison Wikipage as well as other prison/jail/criminal justice pages. Feel free to check it out yourself first, www.corrections.com. Then, please further advise.

<p>Thanks for your prompt reply. I understand the mission to add relevant informaiton to a topic. However, corrections.com is an information resource for a specific industry, and it is very relevant to other criminal justice areas.</p>
<p>But, I'm not sure of your definition of improved articles on the Corrections.com site. The site contains unbiased information about programs and information that is useful to those in corrections and to those who are interested in learning more about the field. It sounds like you're not thrilled with the nunber of ads, which is fine, but limiting the right to post a viable resource based on one's definition of "improved" seems unfair. The site is not blatanly advertising on Wikipedia (unlike companies like Cingular and Proctor &amp; Gamble, who have their own entries). Corrections.com is a genuine resource for and about the corrections industry. It would be a shame if those interesed in corrections,prisons, jails, etc. didn't know about another reference/resource other than Wikipedia. So, I would like to put Corrections.com back on the corrections page and am requesting permission to also add it as a resource/reference to related topics. I'm not trying to be difficult, just trying to better undertand Wikipedia's rules. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jmontalto (<a href="../../../j/m/o/User_talk%7EJmontalto_e174.html" title="User talk:Jmontalto">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jmontalto_2665.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jmontalto">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Hi, Aude. I wanted to clarify (appended below): Hi - maybe this should be moved to talk? There's no way to know what the "major factor" is - it might be that if there were strict gun control laws the homicide rate would be the same but knives would be used instead. Or maybe it would be lower. But it's an assertion that gun violence per se is the difference - or am I wrong? I often am. Kaisershatner 20:09, 14 November 2006 (UTC) The difference for what? For why the U.S. homicide rate is higher? In the intro, I think noting the higher homicide rate and the rate of homicides committed with firearms is important. We can save "why" for later in the article, such as the "Homicides" section where it says "When a crime occurs involving a gun, the likelihood that it results in a death is significantly increased, due to the lethal potential that a gun brings to a situation." and "that if guns were less available, criminals may likely commit the crime anyway but with less-lethal weapons". (if you want to move this to the talk page, that's fine with me) --Aude (talk) 20:40, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My question is basically whether we're guilty of assuming the<a href="../../../c/o/r/Correlation_implies_causation.html" title="Correlation implies causation">correlation implies causation</a> fallacy. (A) The US has a comparatively high rate of homicide (B) The US has a particular position on gun ownership (C) therefore, gun violence is the differential factor in the higher US homicide rate. I'm asking if writing "the US has a higher than average homicide rate" and "the majority of homicides are committed with guns" is a truly direct relationship, and if this is supported by the facts. Since I don't know, I would favor simply, "68% of homicides are committed with guns" standing on its own, and introducing the stats about the overall homicide rate in the body of the article. Again, the subject of the article is NOT the US homicide rate. The rate at which gun violence is a part of the homicide rate IS the subject. Finally, please assume my good faith, it can be hard to infer tone from writing. I may be asking dumb questions but trust me, it's out of curiousity and a committment to intellectually rigorous writing and editing.

In each case, the frame showing "flight 77" sure looks like a missile to me. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 20:11, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zero witnesses have reported seeing a missile, while numerous witnesses saw an American Airlines jet. Even Russell Pickering, who runs PentagonResearch.com <a href="http://www.pentagonresearch.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pentagonresearch.com" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> now believes that the plane did crash into the Pentagon.

<dd>Perhaps you're right. But numerous people saw a small aircraft - not a huge "roaring" 747. Also, the aircraft parts at the scene match a <a href="../../../a/-/3/A-3_Skywarrior_4987.html" title="A-3 Skywarrior">Douglas A-3 Sky Warrior</a>, not a 747. My view is that it wasn't a 747, and a Sky Warrior isn't gonna punch through 3 rings of the pentagon. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 06:52, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aude, I appreciate your input. I had not read the rules in terms of the conflict of interest that arises from adding my own link. I was simply upset that someone had continued to remove a link for the page of the college at which I attend. The site I run with several other students is, in my strong personal opinion, not linkspam, spam, etc. Although it may appear to be a blog, etc., it is actually a portal used by a large number of students at the school. The concept is something that is new, and it helps students become accustomed to our university when transferring here or attending as freshmen. I will add the suggestion for the link under the discussion section, and I hope that others will view the site, evaluate it without bias, and add it to the links as it is a piece of campus life here in Fredericksburg.</p>
<p>Thanks, Bobby</p>

<p>You work on the above is excellent. Nevertheless, I just wanted to share my thoughts about some of the reversals you made to my edits, namely the inclusion of the seat numbers, which would appear to be trivial to the extreme, unless you have information whiah I do not.</p>
<p>In addition, I had removed the sisters' married names and the name of the publisher for the reason that this info already appears in the Published work section which I had ejected the information to, and is thus redundant. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 08:17, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm watching all the major portals. It helps that I now know you are working on the portal, and will recognize your name in the recent changes.

<dd>Well, the actual content pages (<a href="../../../m/a/t/Portal%7EMathematics_Featured_article_2006_47_112c.html" title="Portal:Mathematics/Featured article/2006 47">Portal:Mathematics/Featured article/2006_47</a>) are harder to get to than the the main AotW sub-page... granted the latter can still be vandalised just as eaily, but it will still be on people's watchlists. Actually, I've created the pages for weeks <a href="../../../m/a/t/Portal%7EMathematics_Featured_article_2006_47_112c.html" title="Portal:Mathematics/Featured article/2006 47">47</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Portal%7EMathematics_Featured_article_2006_48_61b5.html" title="Portal:Mathematics/Featured article/2006 48">48</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Portal%7EMathematics_Featured_article_2006_49_e6d5.html" title="Portal:Mathematics/Featured article/2006 49">49</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Portal%7EMathematics_Featured_article_2006_50_982e.html" title="Portal:Mathematics/Featured article/2006 50">50</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Portal%7EMathematics_Featured_article_2006_51_893a.html" title="Portal:Mathematics/Featured article/2006 51">51</a>, so there's nothing to stop you from adding those to your watchlist if you want. (It's also possible to add pages to your watchlist that haven't been created yet, in case you were feeling *really* keen). I'm mildly surprised you hadn't noticed my name cropping up as the author of most of the non-vandalising, non-reverting edits for the AotW... although sadly, that means my edits are in the minority.</dd>

<p>I thought I'd try to get a clear discussion going on the proposed changes so we can get the page unprotected. I've pasted Acebrocks first proposed paragraph on the talk page with a section for comments below.

<p>I was just leaving a message on <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">User:Bov</a>'s talk page, when I noticed that you had reverted the changes that he made. I made a proposal to him for us all to talk about this on the <a href="../../../9/1/1/Template_talk%7E911tm.html" title="Template talk:911tm">Template_talk:911tm</a> page. As per my comments on that page, I was already debating on removing <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Rense_351f.html" title="Jeff Rense">Jeff Rense</a> from the template as he is notable in other areas but is probably quite as notable per the template's subject. I have refrained from removing or adding links on the template without concensus or agreement from others interested in the template. The majority of what I have done is to redesign the look (I got a complaint about it being glaring (I think it was a little glaring)), and to make it more consistent with the look of other navigation templates. Other than that I have not modified the contents of it. Anyway let's discuss this (where the discussion most likely belongs) at <a href="../../../9/1/1/Template_talk%7E911tm.html" title="Template talk:911tm">Template_talk:911tm</a>.

<dd>Bov might not like it but articles about <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loose_Change_%28video%29_a1f5.html" title="Loose Change (video)">Loose Change (video)</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Fetzer_f57b.html" title="Jim Fetzer">Jim Fetzer</a>, etc. are notable and exist because they relate to the "truth movement".

<p>No, Bov doesn't like the defenders of the official version of events promoting the "nukes," (Jimmy Walters) "UFOs," (Jeff Rense) and "space weapons" (Jim Fetzer) pushers being touted as "researchers" when the real goal of that is to discredit us. They do not represent the vast majority of the movement yet when they are promoted in a template format, the implication is that they do. They do not. Loose Change is popular, sure, but is also a commercial video that says, among many other hoaxes and mistakes, that Flight 93 was swapped and never crashed in Pennsylvannia but that the passengers were deboarded into an empty NASA research hanger and disappeared. Those who want the "conspiracy theorists" to look as crazy as you are sure we are will repost this template over and over and over. And as you do, I will now start to make wikipedia my focus again. If this is what you want, go for it. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">bov</a> 22:19, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's called muddying the waters in the intelligence community. When ideas float around a targeted group that you don't like you try to associate them closely with other clearly ridiculous ideas.
