<p>I was reading Sean Ferrer's description about his mother [Hepburn] and he mentioned that many people thought she was thinner than she actually was; she had a narrow upper body, but had rather strong, muscular legs. Also, she suffered from malnutrition because of the war and she had been depressed for some time due to a miscarriage. So, no, though it would seem that she was [anorexic] - especially according to those who think that every thin person is suffering from an eating disorder, she was healthy, else she may not have been able to withstand her duties as an UNICEF ambassadress.</p>

<p>Sorry folks, but i too have "Edda van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston" as her birthname. This is according to <i>Le Musée du Cinéma</i>, Phaidon, Paris, 1999.</p>

<p>Now this is something I find rather interesting. Could you, 149.101.1.119, explain where the name "Edda van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston" -- the one you deleted -- came from? And is it really "A<b><u>n</u></b>drey Kathleen Ruston? All the best, <a href="../../../k/f/_/User%7EKF_917d.html" title="User:KF">KF</a> 22:17 27 May 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>In my encyclopedia it says "Edda Hepburn-van Heemstra". 193.171.249.98 16:22 28 May 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>acording to the book Audrey Hepburn an elegant spirit by Sean Hepburn Ferrer (Audrey's eldest son) Audrey was born "Audrey Kathleen Ruston". After the war, her father, Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston, found documents about his ancestors, some of whom bore the name Hepburn. "This is when he added it to his name, which caused my mother to have to legally add Hepburn to her name as well." Sean continues to write "my grandmother temporarily changed my mother's name from Audrey to Edda during the war, feeling that "Audrey" might indicate her British roots too strongly." He goes on to tell how it was done. "My grandmother Ella came up with the name Edda by simply exchanging the two l's in her own name with two d's." "Since most documents were handwritten at the time, Ella may have had one that could easily be doctored so that my mother could carry it with her whenever she left the house." "just add two c's to the lowercase l's." "change the birth year a bit - Ella was born in 1900, my mother in 1929 - and you have Edda Van Heemstra." I hope this answers your question.

<p>OK-As per "Audrey Hepburn:a biography" by Warren G. Harris (Simon &amp; Schuster) ISBN#0-671-75800-4:</p>
<p>page 12: "Her name at birth was Andrey Kathleen Ruston, "Andrey" being an uncommon feminine of 'Andrew', which would have been her given name if she'd been born a boy. 'Kathleen' honored her father's favorite aunt. Inevitably, the tendency of 'Andrey' to turn up misspelled as the better known 'Audrey' became a constant annoyance, so the quickest solution was for the family to adopt [note-this does not mean a legal adoption, necessarily-Ed.] that name instead."</p>
<p>page 15: "The Rustons settled in a furnished maisonette at 48 rue Keyenveld in the Ixelles district, the most Parisian quarter of Brussels. Their daughter, Andrey Kathleen, was born at home, at three in the morning of May 4, 1929..."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Katharine Hepburn issue</span></h2>
<p>I have put a reference to people erroneously stating that Audrey and Katharine Hepburn were sisters back into the text, but in the Trivia section this time. Although Nunh-huh makes a good point that everyone is related, the fact is to remove this "corrective" would mean that all references to siblings and other relations would have to be excised from Wikipedia as redundant. (i.e. Joan Fontaine and Oliva de Havilland, James Arness and Peter Graves, etc.). If proof exists that the two Hepburns were distantly related, I concede that, but someone should put this into the text because the way it reads now, Audrey's dad chose Hepburn out of thin air. If they were cousins 49 times removed, it's worth noting. However the fact is they weren't sisters, and considering Wikipedia is becoming a major reference, I feel it important to mention this because this erroneous fact has already been committed to print by a national Canadian newspaper and at least one Who's Who-type publication. (Actually, a new Wikipedia article explaining how the two Hepburns are related could be quite interesting.) <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:36, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But now the entry in the trivia section makes no sense:</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
It is often erroneously reported in reference books and media that Audrey Hepburn and Katharine Hepburn were sisters or otherwise very close relatives. They were reportedly related, but very distantly.

<dd>In particular, the repetition of the word "reported" makes these sentences both confusing and potentially contradictory. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 04:12, Jan 5, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They were related, but no more closely than any two white people chosen at random. Perhaps "Audrey Hepburn and Katharine Hepburn were neither sisters nor otherwise closely related, despite occasional, and mistaken, press reports to the contrary. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:17, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>23skidoo: Audrey's dad did not choose "Hepburn" out of thin air, as Audrey's bios make clear, it was her socially conscious mother who discovered the name in her husband's family's background (I believe it belonged to his grandmother).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Biopic POV</span></h2>
<p>Yes there were some very vocal Audrey Hepburn and Natalie Portman fans that were unhappy with Hewitt's performance but it was by no means "general disappointment". A number of months ago I removed "universally condemed" from Hewitt's article audrey biopic section since that is simply also not true, I should have checked this article back then. The biopic section in this article would need to be twice as large to balance out all those POV violations, there are more than a handful of critics that think Hewitt did an OK or better job. However, for Audrey's article I don't need to get that verbose.</p>
<p>Also, should we mention somewhere else in this article that Cate Blanchette played Audrey in the <i>Aviator</i> and is nominated for an Oscar for that performance? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 14:00, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To acknowledge publicized criticism is not POV. If you feel to do so is POV I invite you to try and change the article on <a href="../../../e/n/t/Star_Trek%7E_Enterprise_849e.html" title="Star Trek: Enterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a>. I'm reverting your change, but will try to do some rewording. Incidentally, Blanchett played KATHERINE Hepburn in The Aviator, not Audrey. BTW your edit took out references to the fact that more than one version of the bio-pic exists and that several actresses have been named as potential Audrey Hepburn portrayers including one who has actually done so in a fashion layout. I'm at a loss to understand how that information could possibly be POV. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:56, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok thanks for some clean up but "much of the criticism" and "suggested by fans" is still POV. Most of the criticism of the audrey hepburn story I've read about were about the writing and the way the story was condensed for an NBC movie as opposed to a mini-series.</dd>
<dd>The second paragraph is entirely POV, stating some actresses "should" play or have been "suggested to play" audrey is POV. The point I am trying to make is that the "publicized" criticism was by no means universal and the article still presents it as such, vocal criticism does not equal universial criticism. To rectify the POV problems with that section of the article we need to either state precisely who is criticizing negatively and balance with positive critics or remove the entire section, I chose the later but will be happy to do it the former way if you thing that section needs to remain detailed. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 15:37, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There were a few things removed that I feel are appropriate, in particular the mention that footage of the real Audrey is used in the film. That fact isn't POV, so I will put it back. Also, there is quite a bit of discussion over who should play Audrey if anothe biopic is made, and the actresses mentioned there have been mentioned in media, not just fan circles, so that removes POV. I will make a subsection for that paragraph so it doesn't directly relate to the JLH film.<a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:27, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think the movie aired on NBC, not FOX? The problem with the "potential hepburns" section is that such a thing violates NPOV by its very existence, there are many critics/fans that would say some of those listed actreses should not be allowed, and others would say Hewitt should be included in a future potray possibility, the producers and the studio obviously thought she had potential. It was generally only Portman fans that were upset over her casting. I still say it is better not to have a "potential potrayals" section even though it is worded better now, it still is not NPOV. Think about it this way: do other deceased actors and actress article's on wikipedia include a section on who best could "potentially" portray them on film? I don't think so. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 18:11, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I believe there is a few. And I still say this is not POV as these are things that have been discussed. It's not a case of the writer (i.e. me or whomever) saying "I think so-and-so should play Audrey". It's the fact that these three individuals have been specifically identified in media as having an Audrey Hepburn style to them. If you feel this strongly about it, and rather than us end up in a revert war over it, I invite you to seek a peer review from Wikipedia administrators and let them make the call.

<dd>I do feel strongly about this, it is sneaky POV being allowed in there, I am considering tagging that section with an NPOV template. I am a fan of Natalie Portman (and ironically also Hewitt) but I am a bigger fan of NPOV. I think uncited POV text should be left off of an article prior to peer-review&#160;:-) but maybe that is just my POV. If other articles have a who could *potentially* play a person that would also be wrong (they key is who *has* played someone vs who "should" *potentially* play someone, potentially is rife with POV). We really should state exactly who these internet fans/critics are specifically stating can play audrey, it's not just POV it's also uncited (once it becomes cited then rebuttles or differing opinions can be cited/included as well for well). I am going to fix the fact that the tv movie aired on ABC not FOX. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 19:11, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gay Icon Project</span></h2>
<p>In my effort to merge the now-deleted list from the article <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_icon.html" title="Gay icon">Gay icon</a> to the Gay icons category, I have added this page to the category. I engaged in this effort as a "human script", adding everyone from the list to the category, bypassing the fact-checking stage. That is what I am relying on you to do. Please check the article <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_icon.html" title="Gay icon">Gay icon</a> and make a judgment as to whether this person or group fits the category. By distributing this task from the regular editors of one article to the regular editors of several articles, I believe that the task of fact-checking this information can be expedited.

<dd>I'm no Hepburn expert but what exactly is it that makes her a "gay icon?" She's not LGB or T, and I don't think she has a disproportionate number of fans in the gay community. <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolimo_1920.html" title="User:Molimo">Molimo</a> 02:17, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Belgian-born</span></h2>
<p>Is this worth noting? Should she not be described as an Anglo-Dutch actress, since she was raised in both countries, and her family came from both?</p>
<p>NO--She was a British citizen from birth as per her biography: "Audrey Hepburn: a biography" by Warren G. Harris (ISBN# 0-671-75800-4), page 12: "Because Audrey happened to be born in Brussels, her original nationality has often been erroneously cited as Belgian. But being born on Belgian soil does not by itself convey Belgian citizenship. That must come through at least one Belgian parent or through naturalization, neither of which applied in Audrey's case. Though she had a British father and a Dutch-born mother, both were British in the eyes of the law, and she was duly certified as such by the British consulate in Brussels."</p>
<p>Clear?? 70.19.72.177 18:30, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>- The article still said "a Belgian actress", so I changed it to "British". I hope everyone's okay with that. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunapuella_6b1d.html" title="User:Lunapuella">Lunapuella</a> 18:19, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm OK with that but it is a factual error to remove "Belgian born" from other articles. Nevermind her nationality -- it's a fact she was born in Belgium. I could be an American who was born in London ... that still makes me London-born. David Byrne was born in Edinburgh, so it's correct to say he was Scottish born, never mind his ultimate nationality. So there's no reason (as in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Holiday_e13d.html" title="Roman Holiday">Roman Holiday</a>) to not say she was Belgian-born. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:27, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't go too crazy on adding images to this article, guys. It makes it look cluttered and there should never be side-by-side images at the top of the article, it makes it look junky.

<dd>Having seen a couple of excellent images turfed from <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Bush_9841.html" title="Kate Bush">Kate Bush</a>'s article, I'm sensitive to copyright status. To my knowledge most of the images on this page are Fair Use because they are either publicity stills (i.e. Roman Holiday, Robin &amp; Marian), screen captures (Charade), or government-related (the new UNICEF picture). The only one I'm uncertain of is the recently added Richard Avedon picture at the top from Funny Face. If it can be verified that it was a publicity shot, then it should be OK. That said the images have gotten out of hand. My recommendation is pick TWO and only two, one for the top and one for farther down the article. My votes would be for the Roman Holiday photo and the UNICEF shot, as both shots nicely illustrate both facets of her life. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 02:39, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think everyone is overreacting about this. These are just a few pictures. The Funny Face picture isn't working for some reason, but I think it is the best of the lot. And it is a publicity shot (what else could it be?). Keep that, Roman Holiday, and the UNICEF picture, and the page will look fine.
<dl>
<dd>The Funny Face image could be from a behind-the-scenes magazine article, or a separate assignment by Avedon ... just because an image depicts a scene from a film doesn't mean it's considered a promotional image. (The image is appearing fine for me, btw). But I agree that IMO the best images to use are Funny Face (assuming it's kosher), Roman Holiday (which is a famous publicity still) and UNICEF (ditto and government-related to boot which renders it PD). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:39, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, it looks like the image is toast. Whoever uploaded it just cut-and-pasted from the Audrey1 website and placed no information indication permission was sought or that the image is freeuse. The powers that be at Wikipedia are really cracking down on this sort of thing. I recommend whoever uploaded the UNICEF image make sure it's free use. The Roman Holiday image is from a screenshot so it's safe (in theory).

<p>It's actually a publicity shot that can be found on imdb.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please sign your messages. I noticed it's also on IMDb, but the version that has been uploaded contains a URL for another site, so Wikipedia is treating it as a copyvio. Also the appearance of an image on IMDb is not an indicator of copyright status because it usually means the image is copyright either IMDb or a third party (I believe MPTV or something like that in the case of this image). Wikipedia is getting very strict with the images it allows, in part because of the copycat websites out there. I made a screen capture for <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_Powell_4deb.html" title="Eleanor Powell">Eleanor Powell</a> and I've seen it redistributed all over the Net. In the case of the Funny Face image I agree it should be considered a vintage promotional image, but in all likelihood Wikipedia will delete it now as copyvios more often than not end up that way. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 12:41, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've lost track -- the images seem to change by the week. The calendar image is fine.

<p>page 12: "Her name at birth was Andrey Kathleen Ruston, "Andrey" being an uncommon feminine of 'Andrew', which would have been her given name if she'd been born a boy. 'Kathleen' honored her father's favorite aunt. Inevitably, the tendency of 'Andrey' to turn up misspelled as the better known 'Audrey' became a constant annoyance, so the quickest solution was for the family to adopt [note-this does not mean a legal adoption, necessarily-Ed.] that name instead."</p>
<p>page 15: "The Rustons settled in a furnished maisonette at 48 rue Keyenveld in the Ixelles district, the most Parisian quarter of Brussels. Their daughter, Andrey Kathleen, was born at home, at three in the morning of May 4, 1929..."</p>

<p>Believe it or not, everything in that paragraph is all factually correct according to everything that's been documented about her. Worked for UNICEF, everyone liked her, no scandals, had a lot of quotes about kindness, charming in all of her movies.

However I have seen photos of Audrey and Mel at home dated 1957 with the fawn. My understanding is she adopted the fawn around the time she appeared in <i>Green Mansions</i> because she wanted to develop a rapport with the animal on screen in her role as Rima. BTW just following on from the above thread, mentioning her pets isn't too crufty because there was fairly extensive media coverage, especially of the fawn. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:34, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
