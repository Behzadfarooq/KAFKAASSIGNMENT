<p>Is the reputation for "extreme academic workload, a sink-or-swim social ethic, and a reputation for heavy recreational drug use" (<a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed_College_ce98.html" title="Reed College">Reed College</a>) accurate?

<dd>I think it is an excellent, if pretty tough school. The workload is still extreme, even if less than it was in past years; the claim about left-wing, like the claim about drug-use, is mainly a myth of past time - there is very little political action on campus, with some varient of libertarianism being probably the most active. The drug use thing is wildly overrated, and overdramatized. That's my short summary of the place. If you have more specific questions, feel free to ask. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 19:06, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Was the reputation for "extreme academic workload, a sink-or-swim social ethic, and a reputation for heavy recreational drug use" (Reed College) accurate when you were there? I don't mind a "reputation as politically left-wing," but were other viewpoints encouraged and welcomed? How did you get your parents to let you go to such a crazy place? And did you switch from Reed to Berkeley, or vice versa, and why?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Reed College is a good place for scholars and weirdos. One major drawback: somehow, it inculcates the message that academia is the highest aim to which one can aspire. An incredibly high proportion of the student body goes on to grad school and the professoriate. Given the dire state of things in academia these days (gross over-supply of PhDs, adjunctification), this is not a good thing for students. Are you a realist? An experimentalist? Can you think of careers other than the professoriate? If so, you may survive Reed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Why I ended up at Berkeley: money. After a year and a half at Reed, during which I studied fiercely and partied hard, my mother searched my suitcase, found the birth control pills, and demanded that I grovel at her feet and abjure my hippie ways or she would stop making the tiny contributions that she WAS making to my college education. I refused to grovel, she cut me off. That meant that I couldn't get any more student loans. I had to drop out of school for a year and establish myself as an emancipated minor to get my loans back. I went back to Reed for one more year after that, then looked at the mounting loan totals and transferred to UC Berkeley, which at California resident rates, was a damn sight cheaper.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I recommended Reed to my daughter and she ended up at Mills, in Oakland, where she has access to all the classes at Berkeley. As a friend said, "The mango doesn't fall far from the tree." Even if it thinks it is rebelling. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 19:08, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How do you like Reed? I'm thinking about applying. Is the reputation for "extreme academic workload, a sink-or-swim social ethic, and a reputation for heavy recreational drug use" (<a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed_College_ce98.html" title="Reed College">Reed College</a>) accurate? I don't mind a "reputation as politically left-wing," but are other viewpoints encouraged and welcomed?

<dd>Ooh, Reed!&#160;:-) In all honesty, I think going to Reed is the best possible decision I could have made. "Extreme academic workload" I think would describe my life right now very well. My first quarter here I managed well by cutting my Wikipedia usage to near-zero on the weekdays. Now I get by, constantly sleep-deprived and always behind, and, since I'm one of those that refuses to caffeinate myself, free time is severely limited. An I enjoy it. That's one of the things I think you have to understand to get this place; sure we all complain, but we love it. The conference-style classes really permeate the whole atmosphere here. In the beginning it was disconcerting for me, but once you get used to it, and engage yourself, it is difficult to imagine anything better. As for politics, I think any reputation of that kind is overrated. College-age is still the most underrepresented group in the vote, and so while most people are very good anti-Bush-ites, most of the people are indifferent and stuck in the Reed bubble most of the time. And the few genuinely conservative people I know (i.e. are often the international students) do fine. As for drug usage: a lot of it is blatant, but, if that is not your thing (as it is not mine), in my experience it's really something you have to seek out to get involved with anyway. And to be sure there are plenty of tame substance-free dorms, and substance free people, too.</dd>
