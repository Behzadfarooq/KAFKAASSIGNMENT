<p>This article isn't about auditing. It doesn't even define what auditing is or how it is done. No mention of why any auditing is done is mentioned either, except the sliver of information, "goal to become clear" and that isn't accurate. At one time, about 1950, the goal of auditing was to become clear. That it has no definition at all of auditing (except the one word, 'listening') would tell anyone why the article isn't about auditing.</p>
<p>So what is this article about? Well, it looks like it is a springborad for controversy. With the best of intentions Ronobop wrote what he could. But immediately on his heels along comes the possibility that anything you say in auditing can and probably will be used against you in a court of law. No parallel is made between auditing and the Catholic Confessional, which is closely resembles. Auditing is a bit more scientific perhaps. Certainly the persons who audit are much more finely trained to listen to confessionals than Catholic Priests. As one example, after doing the training routines a friend and his buddy went on a crowded street. One read a book and the other listened. They moved further and futher apart until they were a block and a half apart, crowded street. And still understanding each other. But this article is all serious and everything. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 03:13, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Terryeo, Agreed. This article needs major work and seems to address auditing mainly from the perspective of "what could be controversial about it", there is some valid data but a lot of confusion and misunderstanding about many things. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavenna_dcb1.html" title="User:Ravenna">Ravenna</a> 07:15, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did a massive cleanup on it. My problem with this is not the tone of the article but the lack of organization in it. What I've done is not nearly enough, there are multiple redundancies in the article, the "Discussion" section is too long, and a couple of those short paragraphs should probably be rejoined with the beginning. I got tired of trying to do it all, I might have a go at it later. Oh, and to whoever did this, I'd prefer you take your concerns here rather than cluttering up the edit space with them.

But it revolves around Hubbard's biography, it has maybe a paragraph or two in a large document which mentions "PC folders" which would apply to the subject of this article, Auditing. The court case (if you read through that) was about a man who was working on Hubbard's biography and the difficulty with documents and why he was bringing a case and so on. Auditing, the term "auditing" probably doesn't appear anywhere in it and it is about other topics. It doesn't say, as far as I can read, that the court made a decision about "PC folders" in general. Is there any reason we should leave that reference in there? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 16:57, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, it should stay. It verifies a claim made in the article--it isn't presented as a link to more info about auditing. The reason for mentioning it is clearly stated in the article: it documents the Church's use of "PC" files for their own, non-theraputic, ends. As long as that is included in the article, the citation should be, too. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 17:07, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This has the potential to lead to another long, crazy, point-counterpoint section. As you know, the GO was disbanded but the OSA was created, and there are no shortage of commentators who claim that the same activities--unscrupulous intelligence gathering, harrassment, etc.--continue under the auspicies of the OSA. I'd vote for keeping the mention of this brief and passing in the auditing article, and if the controversy is going to be hashed out somewhere, maybe the Scientology Controversy page is the place. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 17:37, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I ask you to understand. The G.O. was a suborganization within the Church of Scientology at one time. It created a good deal of trouble for the Church. It was disbanned, its orders no longer have force, etc. An example of the sort of trouble it caused is in this article, including the order number. However, that was some years ago. It is a historical sort of situation. Today things are done differently. The G.O. did quite a lot of harm to the public image of the church, but hey, what is published is true, isn't it? However, what is published <i>was true</i> at the time it was published. That does not mean it is in force today. Somehow, BTfromLA, I simply don't feel threatend by "the leading to a more elaborate set of explanations that will threaten to consume the article." That really needs to be confronted. If it is confronted now, here, in this article, then fine, good. If it is confronted by creating yet another article which traces the G.O. and the various grey sorts of things it caused to the Church's image, then that is fine too. But it would be unethical editor behaviour to allow the G.O. order in the article to be presented as being in force today, today when the G.O. has been disbanned for many years. It is simply inaccurate, long past, long dead information, the kind of information that newspapers will never give up because they think people give a damn about it. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 15:28, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While the OSA is not identical to GO, there are a number of Guardian Orders that were simply relabelled for OSA. Hard information on OSA is scarce because they haven't been the subject of police raids, investigation and docuemnts entered as evidence, so it's difficult to say how much OSA has changed. I have seen examples of posting of material obtained from culling auditing folders of an ex-member as recently as this year. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroidCat_71d5.html" title="User:AndroidCat">AndroidCat</a> 16:21, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I frankly don't believe that is the situation. You say that a number of G.O. orders were used verbatim and simply relabelled. Yet you can not say how much different the OSA is from the GO. Let me point out the most obvious, bald, blatent difference. Under the G.O. the Church of Scientology got a lot of bad Publicity. Under the OSA, it has not had that quantity of bad Publicity. Almost all of what people are carping about, quote Clambake and Xenu about were events under the G.O. You state something about orders AndroidCat, but you supply no verifications for your statement and you refuse to even speak of your own personal experience. Perhaps your reasoning about G.O. orders is as crystal clear as your reasoning about "patter drills" (either they are practical drills or they fall under chinese drilling, Neither of which is actually the situation). <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 00:17, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since I've never said anything about patter drills, I conclude that you must be talking to some AndroidCat from an alternate universe. However, when I do have a good set of references about relabeled GO orders, and OSA actions that have brought bad publicity, or even bad Publicity, I will add them when I have time, no worries. For example, I was surprised that there was no mention of Bonnie Woods on any pages until today. As for my personal experiences, I've never refused to speak of them. (Probably Skippy from the alternate universe again.) They might make an addition to the OSA article, but .. it would be a bit too much like Original Research if I added them. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroidCat_71d5.html" title="User:AndroidCat">AndroidCat</a> 02:21, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hey, my statement above is about the article and including or not including a long defunct G.O. order in <b>if</b> and only if that order is presented as being in force in present time. ok?

<p>The G.O. order happened one time, apparently. Apparently one person was effected by it. A court case mentions it. With a population of millions of readers of Dianetics and who knows, thousands of people having done auditing, I can certainly understand its importance in the daily life of your average Scientologist, or in the daily life of a person who is thinking of learning more about Scientology. Its significance could hardly be made more cricital, after all, the G.O. did some harm to the public image of Scientology. Of course that was some years ago. Of course the G.O. was disbanned. Of course its orders no longer have force within the church. Of course most of its memebers are no longer members of the Church because of their actions. Nonetheless, I understand, some editors simply <b>must</b> have this critical datum in the article. Okay, good. So, let us place that datum per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> which compares a widely published, well known datum to a narrowly published, narrowly used, historically accurate datum. If the single court case and use of someone's PC folders is to be in the article, put it in the controversy section, all right? Because there are hundreds, maybe thousands of pages about auditing, describing auditing and auditing procedures and what, 3 or 4 pages of court documents. And the court documents are published, ok, but not published widely, read by many, and so on. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 16:11, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On my talk page, Terryeo wrote me asking to communicate about "Your editing changes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Auditing_%28Scientology%29&amp;diff=48434668&amp;oldid=48434134" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Auditing_%28Scientology%29&amp;diff=48434668&amp;oldid=48434134" rel="nofollow">here</a> for which your edit summary states: "BTfromLA (tried to rectify some of the gross POV in the intro--somebody will need to do this for the whole article)". Terryeo says that my edit "mis-states, confuses and belittles the subject." He then proposes that just as a race car driver is the proper expert to write about car racing, so a scientologist is the expert qualified to write about scientology. (His whole note can be read on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BTfromLA#I_wish_to_discuss_with_you." class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BTfromLA#I_wish_to_discuss_with_you." rel="nofollow">my talk page.</a>) He suggested that I discuss changes on the article's talk page, so I am responding to Terryeo here, and I welcome the views of others.</p>

<li>Wikipedia, as it says in one of the policy guidelines, is not an instruction manual. Terryeo, you keep using the analogy of a first person "how to" account to defend your edits... the "parallel" articles you imagine are about <i>how to</i> drive a race car, graft fruit, hammer a nail, etc. Wikipedia articles are rarely if ever designed as "how to" articles--if "how to" is covered at all, it is within a larger context of the history of the topic. (See, for example, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto_racing.html" title="Auto racing">auto racing</a>). Wikipedia articles are overall descriptions of topics compiled, best as possible, from reliable third party sources. This has been explained to you many times by many editors, hasn't it?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I understand pefectly. If there were any third party source capable of understanding, duplicating, doing an auditing procedure without becoming themselves, Scientologists, that would be the source to use. The problem is, anyone capable of actually auditing has become a Scientologist. This is exactly the same problem in all of the Dianetics and Scientology articles. It takes some effort and some persistance to understand, by the time you do, you like and use it and declare yourself to be a Scientologist. An article can no more detail how to audit in a single page than a person can learn nuclear physics in with a single page. We can but try. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 00:13, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thank you for replying, Terryeo. I find your response rather disturbing, though. You completly skip over my main point that Wikipedia is not a "how to" manual, and conclude that "we can but try" to "detail how to audit." No, that is not the goal we are aiming toward, and if you can't get your mind around that, I despair that you can ever become a productive (as opposed to disruptive) editor. Your argument that there are no good third-party sources about scientology because anybody with any glimmer of understanding of the subject declares themselves a scientologist is painful to read. I don't know what to say in response without offending you. Perhaps I can ask you this--is there any other (non-Scientology related) topic for which you believe "if you understand it you'll join us, if you don't join us it is because you don't understand anything about it" holds true? <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 02:46, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for understanding I said in response. I agree with you, we can not present a "how to audit" manual here. I guess I have been a little misleading, I don't intend that such a thing happen and I know it is completely beyond what would be possible. I don't think it is desireable, either. However, I believe it is possible to introduce what auditing (withing Dianetics and Scientology) is all about. Now, now, BTfromLA, of course I am aware the "read it and you'll join" is a silly overstatement. There have been a number of people who have quit the Church, etc. Nothing is 100 %, but finding a disinterested 3rd party whom can "test" the concepts of auditing will prove to be difficult. Not 100 % impossible perhaps, but difficult. Of course I know what I've said isn't 100 % and I'm sure any sane individual would, I didn't mean to mislead anyone. I was pointing out the difficulty, not meaning to close discussion off. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 04:58, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Your assertion that being a practicing scientologist make you an expert in scientology is false. Certainly, knowledge of scientology from the viewpoint of a practioner can contribute valuably to the articles, but it is not the same as expertise in the subject as a whole. This is true for any topic--a good race driver would not necessrily be a competent editor, nor does their driving proficiency make them knowledgable about the history and philosophy of auto racing. If that driver/editor started to rhapsodize about how thrilling the g-forces are or how much they dig the feel of some new steering wheel or how auto racing makes the world a better place and everybody should try it, that stuff would have to be edited out of a Wikipedia article.</li>
<li>Your assumption that Wikipedia articles should be written by "experts" is also false. Expertise in the subject isn't needed with Wikipedia editing --the job is to clearly organize and present previously published facts and expert opinion, not to originate that material.</li>

<li>except for a single entry, I think it was in Dianetics, out of fustration because everyone is removing a reasonable introduction of Dianeitcs (probably with the same good intention you are doing here) I haven't attempted to insist on any portion of any article being created only by experts. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 00:22, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yep. That what I said to you. At least you read it and responded to it, even if you didn't actually understand the point I was presenting to you. Specifically the difference between the introduction which I wrote and the introduction which you wrote is an early word. "Therapy" You define it as a therapy. That is to say, you judge it to be a therapy, you apply that evaluation and you present your personal evaluation to the reader. Specifically and exactly your introduction reads, "Auditing is a theraputic procedure..." I am attempting to get into communciation with you about this subject, however, since you are not going to attempt to understand my objection to such a presentation, then of course, here is where it will be hashed out. Auditing is a procedure. It is an action, it is something that two (usually two but there are group auditing procedures as well), that people do. When it is presented as a "therapy" then that is an evaluation of a procedure. It is an evaluation that an editor <i>might</i> be able to support and find some reference to and be able to cite and state the reference to it, possibly. <b>BUT</b> what need is there to present this evaluation of a procedure early in the article, in its introduction. Why not present the procedure? These articles are full of emotionally slanted words and this is another exmaple of an unneeded, emotionally rich word presented with no rhyme or reason. And what, people who have never audited, never used it but have only read about it from sites like Xenu and Clambake feel Wikipedia should be a watered down clambake presentation? It really does not make good sense, people. It really doesn't.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 00:06, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is that what you get from this? Scientologists have, on and off, attempted to edit the articles of Dianetics and Scientology for some time. They have uniformly been driven off for various reasons. You too can read they "I'm leaving and here is why" user pages. If you know a subject and you want to see the subject introduced, and you know the subject is not being introduced, then what would you do? I have attempted to communicate. Often I communicate why, explicitly, the subject is not introduced. After the subject is introduced, I have little interest in the controversy that I know very well, many editors (read my Rfa) take great pleasure in muck raking in great detail. Almost all of such muck rakinig happened more than 10 years ago, but by golly, it just <b>has</b> to appear in these articles. I want the articles introduced. Once a reader understands the subject, they can understand the controversy. Until they do, they can not. They can understand there is controversy. This article, for example. BTfromLA is insistant that auditing is a "theraputic" procedure, the 4th word of the introduction says so. A person is not going to understand auditing when you tell him it is a "theraputic" procedure. Yet not only is a more clear, bold statement of it reverted, but other editors who have no clue of what auditing is also insist the misleading introduction stand. Which is why I used "race car" as an example, thinking perhaps you would understand the similarity. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 00:33, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Terryeo, is that your whole response to my list of comments? That I refused to understand that you were upset with the use of the word "therapy"? You didn't even mention that in your initial remarks to me! But, now that you bring it up, here's the reason to use some adjective to modify the general terms you favor like "action," "practice," or "procedure." It's because, taken alone, the reader is given scant idea what the heck the "action" is for. So, if it's not theraputic, maybe it's intended for self-improvement or to gain spiritual enlightment or make you wealthy or some other goal. But what you offer, consistently, is woozy, vague, bad writing. "Therapeutic" seems pretty fair, and hardly belittling. The first dictionary I looked at has this definition: "therapeutic /therrpyootik/ • adjective 1. relating to the healing of disease. 2. having a good effect on the body or mind." Isn't auditing claimed to a have a "good effect on the body or mind"? By the way, if you are serious about communicating, please respond to my points above: this "therapy" question was nowhere in your original set of complaints. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 00:37, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't like "therapy" because it implies that Dianetics <i>really is</i> therapeutic - it imbues a certain gravitas to it that it shouldn't.

<dd>Fair enough--my point (and I know you understand this, Wikipediatrix) is that the opening should attempt to classify the subject. I guess part of the deal with Hubbard was that he insisted that his work was <i>sui generis,</i> incomparable to anything before or since. That attitude itself is anti-scolarly and anti-encyclopedic: the encyclopedia classifies and compares things. And you're right, I thought referring to it as a theraputic procedure was offering Auditing the benefit of the doubt. It's disheartening to have that described as belittling the subject. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 01:06, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Honest, I didn't mean to be disheartening. Maybe we could keep it to "a communication procedure?" which would not attempt to evaluate whether it had worth or did not have worth.

<p>I would like to change any reference to "galvanic skin measuring device" relating to the e-meter. The e-meter is a resistance measuring device similar to a Wheatstone Bridge and serving the same function that device has since its discovery in 1860 by Sir Charles Wheatstone. It does not measure the skin nor galvanic reactions on the skin due to sweating or "unsweating". It does not measure tiny currents generated by the body and measured by galvanic instruments. It measures electrical resistance in the body and compares this resistance to a precision calibrating resistor (12,500 ohms) supplied with each meter. E-meters have been optimized for use in measuring and recording quantitatively the spiritual stress encountered in Scientology counselling. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpirit_of_Man_1688.html" title="User:Spirit of Man">Spirit of Man</a> 02:30, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Galvanic or <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galvanometer.html#History" title="Galvanometer">Galvanometer</a> isn't inaccurate, but it does seem archaic and imprecise and combining it with "skin measuring" does conjure up images of jumping frog's legs sans frog. (There is <a href="http://www.bio-medical.com/Gsr.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bio-medical.com/Gsr.html" rel="nofollow">one company</a> that does use "galvanic skin response" for their bio-feedback device, but others use galvanic for a number of other do-dads.) I will object to any POV description that states that it measures "spiritual stress"—the most important part of the circuit of unknown resistance is the contact area between the "cans" and the subject's hands. That resistance is altered by changes in sweat and the firmness of the contact. CoS may conclude that those changes in resistance are caused by "spiritual stress". (If they feel that sweat and firmness of grip are unimportant, they should try auditing tests with common skin-patch electrodes to eliminate those as variables.) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroidCat_71d5.html" title="User:AndroidCat">AndroidCat</a> 03:47, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good, galvanic skin response is widely known about but not used very much because, hey, what does it measure but skin resistance, anyway? But yeah, that is what an <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-meter.html" title="E-meter">E-meter</a> measures, that is what the dial reads out, that is what you view when you view the dial of an E-meter being used, you are viewing the meter's representation of the amount of resistance that human body is offering to a tiny electrical voltage. Actually the E-meter isn't even real accurate about how many exact ohms of resistance the human body offers. But it is real accurate about small changes in resistance. No, common dictionarys will define "galvanic" and police departments, the FBI, etc, all of those, they have some small amount of experience with "galvanic skin response" as a part of a lie detector. The E-meter is set up to detect very small changes, that's the main difference between it and a common ohm meter (which every electrical technician uses). <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 19:25, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we can bridge both definitions without causing offense, especially since the whole GSR/EDR/PGR/SCR field is currently kind of vague. Even *with* skin-patch electrodes, people who are stressed have different results than those who are calm, but the firm science backing all the reasons exactly *why* this is true is still a murky area, AFAICT. In any case, it's better than testing to see if witches float.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 05:13, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>golly, what a great contribution&#160;! But how is the common reader to access your Pocket Dictionary? Frankly it is okay with me however we present the subject, as long as we present it in a manner which a reader can understand it. The word "galvanic" first appeared as the direct result of an individual who noticed his frog muscles jumped and that was one of the pathways by which we have batteries today. So, how do you suggest we communicate this idea? Copper wire conducts electricity easily, Glass does not, the human body is somewhere in between the two. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 15:15, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, that's all true enough. I looked through the meanings of "galvanic skin response" and "galvanic" and "galvanometer" and I find there is simply no other disipline who uses this well enough to have really nailed it down to a single, well recognized term. I can tell you this, it is an experiment anyone can do with an ohmmeter (measures resistance) grasp the two leads right close together in one hand. It measures the same on the meter as grasping the two leads with two hands. The amount of resistance a skin measures seems to be the same whether the two connections are close together or far apart on the skin. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 18:03, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You see, there is no further documentation presently presented but a single court case, no indication of substance but a single order number, no text of that order, that order long ago lost its force, that organization was long ago disbanned, etc. etc. etc. So, since, obviously I have some experience vaugely in the area, I freely state it. Please do continue to recognize it as my POV, because it is my POV. And, on the basis of the scant information in the article, added together with my experience, I freely state my POV and request a citation per Wikipolicy. &lt;smile&gt; May I point out, your reply appropriately attributes my responsibility to me but does not reply to the issue I raised. It does not suppy a citation where I appropriately requested it, nor does your reply state your experience but instead (and perhaps this is a hint of bad faith that I am reading into and perhaps you did not mean it that way), but instead you attack my experience and somehow imply it might not be real world, valid, actual experience. But whether my experience is valid or is not valid, I have requested a citation for a poorly referenced statement within the article. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 14:09, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have not implied anything about your "real world, valid, actual experience" other than that it has no place in our articles. The "single court case" is sufficient for now, and is not "poorly referenced". However, more sources COULD be obtained if you really want that. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:19, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some sources state there are 8 million Scientologists world wide. I do not present this information to you so that you believe or disbelieve it, but to provide a context for my requested citation, and a background from which my "hundreds of scientologists" can be viewed. In 50 + years, one scientologist had some sort of altercation about his PC folders. Of course, what should I expect but that it would be found and exposed&#160;! heh. However, if there is another one, don't you want it found and exposed likewise? I am attempting to prevent the general, wide statement that inevitibly happens about these things. Then when I say, "whow, that was just one case" everyone chants together, and right on key, "POV&#160;! POV!" But in this case, not only is there only one guy complaining, but the organization he is complaining about, the G.O. does not exist, the G.O. order does not exist, etc. etc. Historicaly it is valid presentation (I guess), as a representation of what a parishoner could expect, it is completely off the wall. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 19:17, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What I am actually doing, though you don't choose to understand, is I am attempting to cause these articles to introduce the subject which they purport to be about. This might take 1 paragraph, it might take 3. It does not require a whole article to introduce a subject. Then, you have kilobytes and kilobytes to just chock the articles up with hot, invective controversy. My task is rather simple, I have stated it a number of times. If you actually consider that a subject should <b>not</b> be introduced because it sounds like "POV pushing" then I invite that you should read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> which together tell us the direction and purpose of Wikipedia. A POV <b>should</b> be presented if it is present, it should be presented by good verification and it should be presented in a manner which is not emotionally slanted, but as dry and encyolopedica as possible. The idea, you see, is that a reader becomes able to understand what the subject is about. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 00:29, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>BTfromLA, I would say that your rewrite of the introduction is not too bad. But "Patient" is misleading. Here is a dictionary link to definitions of "patient". <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=patient" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=patient" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> If you can point out any one of those 9 definitions which suits, please say which it is. Additionally, even the derivation of the word, "to endure" has little application in the context of a person who is sitting comfortably in a chair and happily telling their past thoughts to a trained listener. Here's another dictionary with more definitions of "patient",<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=patient" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=patient" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> again, if you can find one that fits a preclear's situation, please so say. The definition that comes closest might be: #5 (from the last link) "Capable of calmly awaiting an outcome or result" but that isn't what a preclear does. A preclear talks about what he's thinking, what he has thought, what comes to mind as a result of the auditor's quesiton. I submit that "patient" is at least a mis-leading manner of presentation and at worst causes misunderstanding because a preclear is not undergoing pain, is not enduring a procedure but is instead an active part, indeed, the most active part of the processing. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 13:37, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First off, Terryeo, I greatly appreciate that your objection here is stated very specifically. As to the definitions you ask about, "patient" is being used as a noun, so the first six definitions--"patient" as an adjective--are irrelevant. (By the way, the two dictionary links you provided seem to have exactly the same definitions. I'm surprised you don't try onelook.com: it offers links to a whole bunch of dictionaries, and it appears to be scientology affiliated, with a link to "study tech" at the bottom of the page. ) Clearly, the suggested meaning comes closest to noun def #1: One who receives medical attention, care, or treatment. I understand your objections to that--it's not really medical, the preclear is more an active agent than a passive reciever of treatment. (It might be noted, though, that Hubbard himself used "patient" in the early days.) "Preclear" alone makes no sense in an introductory paragraph--we have to have a roughly equivalent term to allow readers unfamiliar with the process to quickly grasp the basic situation. I'm happy to replace "patient" with a better term, if you can offer one. Do you have a better idea? <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 18:00, 18 April 2006 (UTC) Would "subject" work? I'm not sure that would be clear enough, but there might be a way to work it in. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 18:12, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First off, I appreciate your forthright and honest reply to my question. And your understanding of my reaction is spot on, I can't possibly get it that "one who receives medical attention" applies. Hubbard certainly did use "Patient" in 1950 and with Dianetics. When it became clear to him that people were remembering things of previous lifetimes *gasp* things changed, the relationship between the askor and the askee was no longer the same as before and the askee was no longer laying back on a couch as was popular in "treatments" and "therapys" of those years. Scientology hasn't ever used "patient" I don't think, but I could be mistaken, certainly it doesn't today. I have changed the introduction a little and removed the word "patient" but I'm willing to flex in the area. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 18:23, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When an organization makes a news statement or makes an announcement, then they might be making a "claim". However, when that same organization has publically published, and published for years, documentation such as the Church of Scientology does, then that documentation is not a "claim" but a "statement". For example, Feldspar recently edited the article to introduce "claims" in regard to Church policy which is spelled out in Hubbard Communication Office Policy letters, has been so spelled out for many years, is known to and adhered by every staff member in every Church and Mission of Scientology. Its not a "claim" it is a "policy". It is an opererational basis, about preclear folders. It is a day - to -day manner of treating preclear folders. Everyone within the Church who holds a preclear folder in their hand necessarily (might maybe be some exception somewhere, probably not) necessarily knows the policy for handeling PC folders. It is not a "claim" it is a manner of operating, a policy. One might present, "The Church operates by HCO Policy which includes the handeling of preclear folders, but some exception was found ..." A "claim" has less substantiation, it is less published than a long standing policy. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 18:23, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your definitions for these terms are bizarre, self-serving, and incorrect. A claim is a claim, whether it's couched in a "statement" or a "policy" or not. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:52, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To make a "claim": To state to be true, especially when open to question; assert or maintain: <i>claimed he had won the race; a candidate claiming many supporters.</i> <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=claim" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=claim" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> A "claim" presupposes the maker of the claim is making a statement of some doubt which is open to question. Whereas a "statement" is the broader catagory, it is "Something stated; a declaration." <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/statement" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/statement" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> All claims are statements, only some statements are claims. It introduces bias to the reader to present statements as claims, the reader should be allowed to judge for themselves if a statement is a claim instead of being educated by the editor that a statement is a claim. This approach is in keeping with dry, encyclopedic writing instead of emotionally biased writing. Also, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says we should present quotations and cite sources rather than present quotations as "claims" or "hints" or other emotionally biased presentations. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 17:15, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Church of Scientology has thousands of pages of text. To a reader not familar with a beginning point, it might all seem like many, many <i>claims</i>. This is not the actual situation. The actual situation, which occurs in probably every Scientology course rests on the simple statement, "if it is true for you, then it is true". That is, no person is ever expected to believe anything. No person is required, conjoled, urged or suggested to. The basic datum is like, "here is the statement, make what you will of it" and this is everywhere, all through Scientology. I see so many instances of "The Church claims...." but actually it is that the Church states. A claim is a statement by which the validity of the statement's subject is being commented on. Instead, the Church makes statements. The validity of those statements are purely up to the reader.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 18:36, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>and many former Scientologists have testified that this private information was used by the Church to harass or intimidate them, or that they themselves had used it in this fashion at the direction of the Church.</i> Yet the article does not reference to a list of <b>many</b>, instead the article constrains itself to 4 persons who have made such statements. "Many" would be a list of "many" people who have made that statement. In addition, if that actually did happen at all then it happened under the old Guardian's Office. That organization was taken apart and is no longer in force (for years now). The reason it was taken apart and the members comprising it removed, is because it got the Church into various kinds of trouble.

"Why is it," he would write, "that the critical person editors feel entitled to violate the non-negotiable Wikipedia policy of WP:NPOV? It is clearly a violation of WP:NPOV to devote half the words of the article to tediously repeating the accusations of people who obviously never understood the subject of Scientology (or else they would never have left Scientology) and therefore cannot be said to know anything about it, not even their own experiences in it.

<p>This is is built from bits and pieces of citeable statements, combined together to imply an auditor might read R2-45 and shoot himself. Heh, 2 funny. The article says, <i>There are many "auditing processes", some simple, some complex, that the auditor may choose to use when appropriate, such as Straightwire or R2-45. In some situations and with training, an individual reads the things the auditor would say, responds to them . .</i> Its either needs a cite (I know beyond doubt there is no such citation) or needs to come out.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 07:46, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll be completely specific. <i>There are many "auditing process", some simple, some complex, that the auditor may choose to use when appropriate,</i> is pure bunko original research. You won't find it anywhere in Church writings nor in Hubbard's writings. Because it is not the auditor who makes such choices. It is the Case Supervisor who makes such choices. I'm probably going too far by saying what is, rather than saying what is not. Every time I say what is, 150 editors scream, "is too!" and present dispersed, personal website opinion that attempt to prove they know better. The phrase I have specified does not exist, it is original research, conclusion drawn by <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">User:Wikipediatrix</a>. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 05:08, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>R2-45 is not a process that would ever be practiced by an auditor. In fact most of the processes in the 1954 COHA book have no place in Scientology as it is currently practiced. Secondly, there is no such thing as "remote auditing" (auditor need not be present in person).

<dd>I have looked at this thing for 2 days. It would take a Class IV case supervisor (my opinion) to respond adequately. Hubbard came up with "standard technology" as a "razor thin pathway" to lead a person through the bank and become clear. But I honestly don't know enough to tell anyone why in less than say 1000 words, Hubbard's standard tech procedures work many times better than the many things to audit which he defined in COHA and I don't have a quotation that could be helpful either. Sorry, it would take more familiarity with the tech than I have, to respond to that one. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 18:44, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The burden of proof is upon the editor who inserts information. The editor who states that an auditor has any choice whatsoever in the processes that auditor runs is required by wikipedia policy and guideline to provide proof by reference that an auditor has choice. He does not. His choices are very constrained. I am not going to attempt your suggeted game, Wikipediatrix. You suggest an editor can insert the <b>wildest</b> statement, "an auditor can run a lot of processes if he chooses to". That is an untrue statement. The editor who inserted it has the responsibity to reference it. I know better. The processes which an auditor can run are spelled out by his Case Supervisor in writing in a document which he is required to be familar with before he begins a session. You notice I am being very polite here. I am not saying, "what a pile of doo doo". The article makes false statement. You suggest I prove the statement false. I point out that wikipedia policy <b>requires</b> an editor to support his edit. You have attempted to create a challenge, "prove it wrong", while I, wisely passing your challenge by, re-state once again for your enlightenment, wikipedia policy.

<dd>I agree the reference to the controversial <a href="../../../r/2/-/R2-45.html" title="R2-45">R2-45</a> should be removed in that particular paragraph (there is no proof it was ever used, let alone presenting it as a usual auditing process.) But I don't see a problem with the rest. Can we just removed R2-45 and keep the rest?

<dd>It is another one of those mis-statements which are easily understood. "remote auditing" almost sounds like it might really exist but of course does not. "solo auditing" does exist. But an article which creates a new terminology for an established practice, well, could we expect a public person who wants to learn a little about Scientology to be able to understand when they are faced with editor-created terms like "remote auditing?" <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 18:24, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey Terry, that "remote auditing?" was my term but described something "practiced" by a famous character from the early days of ARS. I thought at first that the editor was describing something like that but I see now he was describing solo auditing, albeit poorly. ---<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 18:29, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And I'm not even the editor who put that text there, I was simply restoring it because you gave no good reasons for its removal. Now you admit you did all that edit-warring because of your own misconception. You even reverted my edit in which I removed the "auditor's choice" text that offended Terryeo.</dd>
<dd>I am, however, the person who inserted the link to <a href="../../../r/2/-/R2-45.html" title="R2-45">R2-45</a>, simply because at the time, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straightwire.html" title="Straightwire">Straightwire</a> and <a href="../../../r/2/-/R2-45.html" title="R2-45">R2-45</a> were the only articles specifically devoted to auditing processes I could think of. I'm well aware that R2-45 has (probably) never been actually used, but that's not really the point. It is still on the books as an editing process.</dd>
<dd>And my (ignored) challenge to Terryeo above still stands: if someone can find a valid source that specifically backs up his claim that most of the information in COHA is no longer used in Scientology today, I'd welcome its inclusion in the article. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 18:46, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now that I read your "challenge" a little more carefully I have to ask you which of my statements you refer to. Because even COHA information is valid information and will produce positive results if done by the book. I am not talking about exclusion of processes, but am talking about Hubbard finding more efficient processes which make the earlier processes (such as many of those in COHA) to become rarely used. Not "never", but not "every case spends time with those processes" either. So, which of my statements are you "challenging", Wikipediatrix&#160;?<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 00:27, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to admit, you have an interesting manner of posing a challenge. While I can "fill you in" by stating what I know is true, at this moment right now I don't have a 2 or 3 line quotation that would fulfill what you say. What I got is a rather large body of information which Hubbard introduced as "Standard Tech", the standardiztion of all auditing procedure for all auditors in all auditing situations. It is, when understood, obvious but it can't answer your "challenge". However, I consider your request worthwhile and will see what I can toward a simple, easy to understand one liner. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 00:18, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>wikipediatrix, I am an honest person and if I make a mistake I admit it. What was written said that no auditor need be present. That implies that the auditor is elsewhere. That could be termed "remote auditing" and does not exist in Scn. In solo the auditor is right there, he is present. So my misconception was in wrongly divining what the editor was TRYING to describe, not what he DID describe. Surely, you don't hold it against me that I could not read the editor's mind when his words said something different. Secondly, if you want to make the point that lots of different processes exist why do you think you are limited to what is found on wikipedia. How about doing a bit of work and finding a few that are not on wikipedia, like, oh for instance, objective processes, rudiments, listing and nulling, etc, etc, that can be easily found on both pro and anti-Scn sites. You show us proof that any auditor would seriously consider R2-45 and you have every right to put it there. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 18:59, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting stand to take, Terry. It is a critic's stand that if Scn works at all then it is because it is similar to older technologies such as self-hypnosis, religious confession, pschyotherapy, or newer ones like bio-feedback. Notice that the article you reference is a crtical article. The Scientologist would say that auditing works because it is a precise technology based in the laws of the human spirit as researched by LRH and that if those other technologies work at all it is because they mimic or predate Scn in some aspect.--<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 17:09, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pschyotherapy, I like that typo. Yotherapy for short. Terry, I see now that this analogy was your idea in the first place. I put that down to your not being a trained auditor?? But for the purposes of wikiediting I simply put that one must be really really careful with analogies, especially in the case of describing Scn.
