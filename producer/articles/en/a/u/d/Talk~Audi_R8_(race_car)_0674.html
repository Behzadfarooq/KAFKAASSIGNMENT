Audi have yet to confirm that the sportscar will be called R8, and since it won't be in production for at least 2 more years, i think the page for the Le Mans concept car should remain intact, perhaps with any coming detials abotu the production car. Once the R8 name is confirmed, and production has started, or a lot more info is made available, then it would be appropraite to merge the pages, but not yet. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 17:41, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>First of all, we're talking about two completely separate cars here:</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/u/d/Audi_R8_e2b7.html" title="Audi R8">Audi R8</a> is a historically-important racing car used mainly for endurance races. It is powered by a mid-engine twin-turbo V8. The R8 race car has won multiple <a href="../../../2/4/_/24_hours_of_Le_Mans_72ca.html" title="24 hours of Le Mans">24 hours of Le Mans</a> races, along with major road racing championships in Europe and the US. It is one of the most dominating and successful race cars in history.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/u/d/Audi_LeMans_e8d0.html" title="Audi LeMans">Audi LeMans</a> is a concept car that *may* be put into production. As a concept car, it was slated to use a V10 engine, but has only recently been said to use a 4.2L V8 to circumvent competition with another <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkswagen_AG_6c80.html" title="Volkswagen AG">Volkswagen AG</a> product, the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamborghini_Gallardo_fbda.html" title="Lamborghini Gallardo">Lamborghini Gallardo</a>. Recently, rumors have circled that this new roadcar, which may arrive as a 2007 model, will be called the R8.</p>
<p>Other articles have combined street cars and their racing car brethren into one (See <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corvette.html" title="Corvette">Corvette</a> and it's racing version, the C5-R and C6-R). However, the Corvette road car was produced first and modified in order to become the C5-R and C6-R.</p>
<p>The Audi R8 and Audi LeMans have nothing in common, other than the number of cylinders of the engine. The Audi R8 race car was developed first, in 1999, and has been used in racing for the last six years. The Audi LeMans was developed as a concept car in 2003 and shares <b>NO</b> similarity to the race car, other than what has already been mentioned. The two cars are not even similar in reverse of the Corvette situation. The R8 race car does not provide any similarity in design influence, bodywork shape/style, chassis design, powertrain design or suspension design to the Audi LeMans.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Like it or not, this car will be called <b>Audi R8</b>, not <b>Audi Le Mans</b>. We have to be factual and use the commercial name of the car, and not second-guess what Audi is doing.<a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 22:06, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Quote from Audi press release: <i>It is now official: the new Audi sports car will be called the Audi R8. Presented as the “Le Mans quattro” concept study two years ago at the IAA Frankfurt Motor Show, Audi has now taken the decision to build its new sports car. Everything is already being prepared for the series production of the R8 at Audi’s plant in Neckarsulm, due to commence in the fourth quarter of 2006. The market launch is scheduled for the second quarter of 2007.</i></dd>

<p>What if there were two articles, one for <b>Audi R8 Race Car (1999-2005)</b> and one for <b>Audi R8 Road Car (2006-)</b>. If a user searches for "Audi R8" it would bring them to a page with links to both the race car and the road car, and the user could choose from there. Right now, searching for simply "R8" brings you to a page for a railroad system in Pennsylvania, so that search term simply won't work for the cars.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Right now, there is only the race car - a very successful and famous one. It made the name "Audi R8" for itself. The road car is just an annoucement, noone can drive or buy it yet. So the link to the concept car is enough for now. Let's wait and see what Audi actually does, and how the mother can tell them apart. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthead_5c8c.html" title="User:Matthead">Matthead</a> 15:13, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I'll re-revert your unilateral decision to move to an unnecessarily complicted name for a car that appears in many result lists and other articles. You are yery busy with moving and editing, but I can't see any contribution of actual content from you to racing related articles. As soon as the road car gets known by a production code or some other distinction, you can move that one, but leave the race car at "Audi R8". --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthead_5c8c.html" title="User:Matthead">Matthead</a> 00:50, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are two cars called Audi R8 and I don't see any point to emphasize one more than the other one.

<dd>There is one car that already earned its fame, and an announcement. If you see both as equal then this is your problem. It does not justify your egoistic acts. BTW: anonymous user <a href="../../../2/0/8/User%7E208.46.78.226.html" title="User:208.46.78.226">208.46.78.226</a> had reverted my R8-related edits, including some that included other editing as in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro_Speedway_e81a.html" title="Euro Speedway">Euro Speedway</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roland_Asch_fb41.html" title="Roland Asch">Roland Asch</a>. His last edit was on 17:51, 4 February 2006, while your first on that day was two minutes later. Same story on 22:59, 3 February 2006, with you getting active 4 min later. Do you wear <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">socks</a> occasionally? Whatever: I'll hereby announce that an user-account Hektor (Wikipedia User) might be created in 2006 or 2007 or whenever appropriate. Following your own logic you'll rename your account immediately, do you? --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthead_5c8c.html" title="User:Matthead">Matthead</a> 16:23, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I forgot to connect. I will see to it that I don't forget again. Regarding <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro_Speedway_e81a.html" title="Euro Speedway">Euro Speedway</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roland_Asch_fb41.html" title="Roland Asch">Roland Asch</a>, I also apologize for being sloppy and not checking before reverting that other edits had been made. But I stand to my opinion regarding the titles of the articles. Judging that the Race car more important is POV to me. What is the criteria of importance&#160;? <a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 19:06, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Judging that the Race car more important is POV to me." Huh? It was very POV by you to move the article, based on a mere anouncement. Did or do you have any supporters for your move, at all? The Audi R8 were seen by millions of spectators on the race tracks, it was reported about in many newspapers, magazines and TV features - as Audi R8. On Wikipedia, it is in many race reports, result lists and driver biographies - and these are very incomplete yet. The road car is just an announcement, vaporware, "don't spend your money on a Gallardo or F430 yet, we'll have something nicer for you soon". Maybe some disguised prototypes will sooner or later drive around here, but will people care? If they can't even make up a name of its own, the car will hardly be very original either. Modified Gallardo with different engine, or whatever. The road car will probably get an internal production code or something that will distinguish it. The fans certainly will find a more elegant way to tell both apart. Time will tell - it's not your business to do it hastily in advance. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthead_5c8c.html" title="User:Matthead">Matthead</a> 03:15, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've had a stab at a template for racing cars (see <a href="../../../r/a/c/Template%7ERacing_car_72cf.html" title="Template:Racing car">template:Racing car</a>) to summarise the usual data. I've used the F1 templates as a starting point and applied it to the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brabham_BT46_47f0.html" title="Brabham BT46">Brabham BT46</a> article. If anyone's got an interest in this, please have a look at the template and modify or suggest changes as appropriate. After a few people have had a go at it and we have something we're happy with we could start to use it more widely. Note that it's not meant to be specific to F1, by the way. Cheers. <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 10:40, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
