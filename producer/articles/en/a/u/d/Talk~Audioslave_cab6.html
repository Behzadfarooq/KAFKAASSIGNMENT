<p>From the news reports I have read, the band hasn't broken up. Cornell has left the group - that isn't a break up. The band still exists without Cornell for the time being, surely?</p>
<p>PMBO 19:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Couldn't agree more. I believe Audioslave still exists, just without Cornell. (One can only hope this strengthens the possibility of Rage reforming permanently though!) Demonofthefall 11:11, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Agreed. Anyone disagree? The article now contradicts itself. It states that Cornell's departure is "leaving the band's future in doubt." - Yet the band can't have a future as the article states it has broken up, and there are no members in the group. PMBO 02:08, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I changed some of the "is" statements to "was" statements. the band is done. there will be no new singer. Clinch76 01:10, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

I would, but I don't know how. Also, saying that Cornell leaving doesn't constitute a break-up is just like saying that Zack de la Rocha leaving Rage wasn't a break-up either (note how the circumstances are exactly the same), and I think we can all agree that in 2000 Rage had indeed broken up. 14:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm moving funk rock further down the list. It should definately not come before Hard rock, Alternative rock and Post-grunge. It's just a minor part of Revelations. All their earlier albums feature no funk influence at all hardly. im not happy with the definition of post grunge either. Post grunge describes bands who were influenced by Pearl Jam, Nirvana, etc, as well as Soundgarden. And seeing as Cornell was in Soundgarden, he can't exactly influence himself.</p>

<p>The paragraph</p>
<p>"In 2006, video game company Vivendi Games announced that two songs from Out Of Exile would be featured on their upcoming racing game, FlatOut 2. The game is set for release August 1st, 2006 and is the second entry in the series which allows players to race in various environments at high speeds. The game is noted for having special destruction gameplay elements, including the ability of having the driver fly out of the windshield when hit head-on. The two songs to be featured are the second single, Your Time Has Come, and Man Or Animal."</p>
<p>really seems like an ad for the game. I nominate this for deletion.</p>

<p>It says in the article (in the intro) that the band only use guitars, bass, drums and vocals. I'm pretty sure that the latest album actually uses sythesisers in at least a couple of songs. Can someone find out??</p>
<dl>
<dd>ok i found where i read that about using synthesisers, it was in a review at popmatters.com, "The tune [show me how to live] even includes some synthesizer-generated computation going on in the background" but it must be wrong because the album inlay says "all sounds made by guitar, bass, drums and vocals." dodgy website --LeakeyJee 11:27, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Tom Morello is a professional guitarist who uses an effects pedal on his electric guitar to make killer obscure sounds. It is true that all sound on the album are made by guitar,bass,drums and vocals.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"all sounds made by guitar, bass, drums and vocals." appeared on every rage cd. they still used pedals and shit, just no keyboards or bagpipes.69.218.199.100 08:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Audioslave is a unique and bewildering force of nature. Made up of two of the greatest bands in modern history, although being from two distinct musical flavors. I would have to say that this unity of some of the greatest contemporary musicians has brought about one of the most significant musical collaborations of all times.</p>
<p>What is not present in their music? That is the question. Is evil, satan, God, 2012, purity, destruction death, life, or countless other themes not present? About every important subject that faces the people of our time can be summed up in one of Audioslave's songs. If not, look back at Chris' Catholic denial days and seek his inspiring words on Christ( C.C.C.? Is there a connection), or to be more precise, the Church, the state of humanity and SPOONS for all purposes!</p>
<p>Without overly subjecting my views of Chris Cornell as being a modern day prophet, The depth of Audioslave's meaning for manifestation will not be understood for a time, hopefully less of than more of.</p>
<p>The good fight will continue, all that sucks will be sucked and in the end, all that'll be is the last remaining light.</p>

<dd>Regardless, a Western band performing in Cuba has kinda been overdone. Anohther British band, <a href="../../../e/l/b/Elbow_%28band%29.html" title="Elbow (band)">Elbow</a> or somebody else toured the country recently. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 06:25, July 24, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Doesn't matter if it was outside or inside, had Castro there or not. The question is whether or not they "were the first Western band ever to play in Cuba since the embargo." Which Manic Street Preachers' concert was.

<dd>They were the first American band, not the first Western band.</dd>

<li>The word's used are "rock band", you think MTV would make an article on a fact that was not true or a band making an entire DVD stating somthing not true?</li>
</ul>
<p>"It has been disputed whether this band owes more to the sound of Chris Cornell's vocals, or the sound of the Rage Against The Machine instrumentalists." The answer is clearly Chris Cornell. The songs are all about quiet guitar and listening to Chris Cornell sing. It's amazing that two great bands could combine and make a worse band. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESensation002_14d6.html" title="User:Sensation002">Sensation002</a> 8 July 2005 14:06 (UTC)</p>

hey man i sing and i have sang on stage and i know what audioslave is and what it take to sing like cornell, to merely hit the right notes is like wtf and to sing with that kind of power is like serious talent and more than that .... u really have to burn your soul to fuel that kind of energy ... when he says show me how to live HE FUCKING MEANS IT punchdrunklovesick@gmail.com</p>
<p>i heard that their first album was written by the band and chris cornell just sang it. is that true? it kinda sounds true how the first album is all clashed.. and sounds more RATM. and it was in an article or somewhere. i dont remember where i heard it from...... 03:09 27, October 2005.</p>
<p>Just my thoughts but on the aol sessions dosent cornell's vocals sound forced...i wonder if the guys from rage really even want to be in this band or if they are doing it because ratm has a snowballs chance in hell of reuniting</p>

<dd>I really don't know why all of this discussion is under the synth area, but for one, I feel that, at least Tom Morello (Guitar) is probably enjoying the time away from Rage Against the Machine. They were a great band but released one after another, identical albums and songs. Different lyrics, same guitar and drum work (Though the Bass does change up a little bit from each CD). Morello was stuck in his role, play two notes during the chorus then go wild on the solo. He never could have performed songs like I am the Highway or especially Doesn't Remind Me, his guitar work is completely in a different direction, that means more artistic freedom. As a professional musician, who wouldn't want that?</dd>

<p>I tend to agree with the previous statement. The sound and style of this band are not what you usually hear on the radio; they have genuine originality; not a recycled pop punk sound or a standard hard rock feel like Nickelback. Nothing wrong with Nickelback; but they are by no means in the same league as Audioslave. Their previous influences from RAM and Soundgarden give them an inordinately wide variety of possible styles to explore and the skill to do so competantly.</p>

<p>I find the political bit on Chris Cornell a bit contradictory, as Doesn't Remind Me is an anti-war song in regards to the War in Iraq.

<dd>Wow. I find it absolutely amazing that this article and other Audioslave-related articles talk about the band in the past tense and speak definitively about their supposed "breakup" (particularly since this article says very clearly and very <b>correctly</b> "The other members have yet to make any public comment, surrounding Cornell's departure and whether they plan to continue the band with another singer as Cornell himself hinted."), in spite of the fact that the only thing we know is that Chris left the band. Nowhere does it say that the band as a whole has broken up, and I am yet to see anyone cite any sources that would indicate as much. Geez, people here need to realize that the whole point is to <i>synthesize</i> information, not make guesses and assumptions about it. At the very least, could people show a little patience and not go editing a half dozen articles every time a piece of circumstantial evidence pops up in the news?
