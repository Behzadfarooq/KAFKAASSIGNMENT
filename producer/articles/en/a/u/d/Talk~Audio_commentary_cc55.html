<p>The DVD release of series 5 of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dwarf_5cc5.html" title="Red Dwarf">Red Dwarf</a> features a commentary by fans. Should this be listed as well?</p>
<p>And there was also the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> comedy series <a href="../../../d/i/r/Director%27s_Commentary_6922.html" title="Director's Commentary">Director's Commentary</a>, which made fun of the whole concept of DVD commentaries.--128.243.220.21 15:57, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added a note about this as a variation on scholarly commentary. I also added a note about comedians as David Schmaeder on Showgirls or anythign with Joe Bob Briggs is essentially a variation on a film expert as well. Should we add somethign about real-life experts on the subject matter, like Jim Lovell on Apollo 13, the veterans on Black Hawk Down or the strippers on Showgirls? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 05:17, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Back when commentaries were just starting to become popular, most performers agreed to do them as part of publicizing the film. But when Arnold Schwarzenegger was asked to do a commentary for one of his films' DVD release, he asked for and received an additional payment. Since then commentary appearances and fees are negotiated like other contract items. Can someone with more details include this aspect in the article? <a href="../../../m/k/2/User%7EMK2_bdc2.html" title="User:MK2">MK2</a> 10:44, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not that it's a big deal, but one commentary track that might be suitable for the list are the first season of south park, which were not included on the actual dvd, but on a cd which accompanied the package. Also, it might be informative if there was a section on parody commentaries, such as "Wizard People, Dear Reader," which toy with the medium a bit, though a few of the "notable commentaries" cover that already.- A-man</p>

<p>I removed Moviecasts as "main article" to Alternate commentaries.

<p>He "recorded a commentary for all his feature films"? WOW THAT'S AMAZING <a href="../../../r/u/b/User%7ERubber_cat_0ae9.html" title="User:Rubber cat">Rubber cat</a> 09:02, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>By my count, he's done nine for movies he's directed (one for each, and a second one for Clerks, Dogma and Jersey Girl), three for things he produced (Vulgar, Drawing Flies and Clerks TV show) and two for movies he had nothing to do with (Donnie Darko, Orgazmo) for a total of 14. Does that qualify him as prolific? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 05:29, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added a bit that includes Smith. He's only done more commentaries since June 2006...within the realm of five, I think. Soon-to-be 20 commentaries when he's made 7 films is definitely "prolific". <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroidguy1119_aaa5.html" title="User:Droidguy1119">Droidguy1119</a> 02:12, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I changed the visual commentaries paragraph to be about Ghostbusters instead of Men in Black as Ghostbusters came out a year earlier. Perhaps there shoudl also be something abotu visual commentaries that incorporate actual video footage through alternate angles, seamless branching or other methods.

<p>I notice that <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_commentary.html" title="Audio commentary">Audio commentary</a> is simply a redirect to this article. With Blu-ray coming, and knowing that other high quality media will allow audio commentary to continue, is the (DVD) disambiguation tag not obsolete? Unless there is a use for <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_commentary.html" title="Audio commentary">Audio commentary</a> as something other than a redirect, I think this article should be moved there.

<p>I don't know how to incorporate it, or even if we should but sadly, he has passed.

<p>Does this put the spoilers on hiatus or not? I don't know. Something worth looking into.</p>

<p>I don't see the purpose of that section other than as a "wow that's sort of interesting" novelty.

<p>Anyone reading this discussion will know of DVDs that contain multiple commentaries. It would be worth noting a release that contains the most commentaries, if there is one.

<p>I see some vast changes have been made to the alternate area - it now only seems to include commentaries from the film-makers themselves. Just because you download a Kevin Smith commentary rather than experience it on the disc itself does not make it an alternate one. Alternate commentaries are made by the fan community. It has been mentioned that none of the alternate groups mentioned are "notable" enough. It could be argued that due to the relatively small nature of the alternate commentary community they are all small. But within the community they are active and noteworthy. It seems ludicrous to talk about alternate commentaries without actually listing one single alternate commentary group.</p>
<p>I would ask for a revert back to the original version which was truer to the spirit of what alternate commentaries are. I would even go as far as removing mentions of Kevin Smith's downloadable commentary and the Battlestar Galactica downloadable ones, as they are not true alternate commentaries. The alternate commentary groups need to be mentioned to show that there is quite a distinction between what they do and what the film-makers do. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.9.186.134_4ab8.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.9.186.134">203.9.186.134</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.9.186.134.html" title="User talk:203.9.186.134">talk</a>) 01:39, 23 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>If the section is going to be about alternate commentaries, then how can it not mention those that are actually doing the bulk of the work in the field? Alternate commentary creators/podcast creators are all equally valid inclusions on Wikipedia, some even seem to have their own page even though they appear to be only as notable as others. You do the section a dis-service by not including commentary teams with more prolific output than Mr Nelson. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.9.186.134_4ab8.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.9.186.134">203.9.186.134</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.9.186.134.html" title="User talk:203.9.186.134">talk</a>) 03:14, 23 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>I think the sticking point is probably the notability requirement that states topics must be "subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other" to be considered "notable." The thing is that alternate commentators, while fairly active in their small little field, don't tend to draw a lot of attention individually outside of it. There just don't seem to be that many people outside of die-hard film geeks who have any interest in downloading what some other random person said about a movie and listening to it. It <i>is</i> a notable topic in and of itself. It's just hard to find anyone practicing it who meets those notability requirements. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobomaster_55b2.html" title="User:Robomaster">Robotech_Master</a> 05:25, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Forgive me for being dim, but how can an alternate commentator be "independent of the subject itself and each other". And Just because we are a small field doesn't mean we should be excluded from Wikipedia. Taking a purely random stab in Wikipedia and searching for chickens, the external links have references to sites which just happen to have pictures of chickens on them! I mean for goodness sake! We are alternate commentators, doing valid and worthwhile work. The entries that are in the alternate commentators section now are not applicable, and at the very least it should be reworked to remove Kevin Smith and Co. It beggars belief that an article on Wikipedia about alternate commentators barely mentions them.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.9.186.134_4ab8.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.9.186.134">203.9.186.134</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.9.186.134.html" title="User talk:203.9.186.134">talk</a>) 00:40, 24 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I have heard Spielberg state in an interview on one of his DVDs that he is not a supporter of commentaries as he feels that a different soundtrack detracts from the viewing experience he tried to create. However, I can't remember which one! I've added a <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag until I (or someone) finds it. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_42_9144.html" title="User:Chris 42">Chris 42</a> 12:30, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed some of the types of commentary. The fact that commentaries can have more than one person on it and it could be the director, writer, producer, or cast is pretty "no duh" obvious, but I worked it into the header of the article in case anyone feels it is important. I was surprised to see nobody mentioned "screen specific" or "scene specific" since I was to understand those were the "official" terms for the types of commentary. I also expanded the definitions to mention teleststrator, video and silhouette commentaries.</p>
<p>I also listed Kevin Smith, David Fincher, David Cronenberg and Terry Gilliam amongst the list of prolific commentators -- how about a new section that is simply a list of directors who have shown considerable support/gotten considerable respect for the audio commentaries they've done? <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroidguy1119_aaa5.html" title="User:Droidguy1119">Droidguy1119</a> 02:28, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
