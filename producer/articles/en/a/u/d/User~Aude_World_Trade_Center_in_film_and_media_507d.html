<li><i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Streets_of_Rage_2ccb.html" title="Streets of Rage">Streets of Rage</a></i>, a game released in 1991 on the <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega_Genesis_7e9e.html" title="Sega Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> features the Twin Towers in the background of the final boss battle, which apparently, occurs in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriott_World_Trade_Center_%28hotel%29_58d8.html" title="Marriott World Trade Center (hotel)">World Trade Center 3</a> (otherwise known as the Vista Marriott). The towers can also be seen in Streets of Rage 2, in the second level, glowing in the background.</li>

<li>The 1994 action game <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_series.html#Urban_Strike" title="Strike series">Urban Strike</a></i>, the third in the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_series.html" title="Strike series"><i>Strike</i> series</a>, features the scene of a giant <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">laser</a> deflecting from a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite.html" title="Satellite">satellite</a> and hitting the World Trade Center's Twin Towers, thus marking the start of Mission 7, in which the player must accomplish three objectives before moving on to objective #4: rescuing 16 out of 20 <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement_7224.html" title="North American Free Trade Agreement">NAFTA</a> business leaders of the WTC (after hitting the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar.html" title="Radar">radar</a> building east of the WTC); and objective #5: disarming the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_bomb.html" title="Time bomb">time bomb</a> in the South Tower (being careful not to cut either the green wire, as one of the members says, or the red wire). It is ironic that, although the game takes place in a fictional 2001 timeline when it was released in 1994, it would be seven years (marking the same number of the game's mission in New York City) before the actual year 2001 (i.e. September 11) would mark the damage of the Twin Towers not by a laser or time bomb, but by the planes crashing into the buildings, with its destruction rather than its survival (as in the game).</li>

However, both towers are apparently portrayed as the South Tower; each of the towers featured a rooftop observation deck, but lacked the massive antenna.</li>

<li>The first map of the 2000 game <i><a href="../../../d/e/u/Deus_Ex_80b2.html" title="Deus Ex">Deus Ex</a></i>, set in <a href="../../../2/0/5/2052.html" title="2052">2052</a>, encompasses <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_Island_7843.html" title="Liberty Island">Liberty Island</a> and a bombed <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statue_of_Liberty_c55e.html" title="Statue of Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>. The section of the New York City skyline containing the Twin Towers is absent, to reduce memory requirements for the map. The reason that the developers gave, if anyone asked, was that they had been destroyed by terrorists. <i>"We just said that the towers had been destroyed too. And this was way before 9-11. Years.

The complex is depicted lacking the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriott_World_Trade_Center_%28hotel%29_58d8.html" title="Marriott World Trade Center (hotel)">Marriott World Trade Center hotel</a>, as it was only completed in 1981; the complex also features <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sphere_bdfb.html" title="The Sphere">The Sphere</a>, a 1967 <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_Koenig_ab50.html" title="Fritz Koenig">Fritz Koenig</a> sculpture, near the middle of the complex.
