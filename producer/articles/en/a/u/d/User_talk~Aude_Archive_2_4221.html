<p>Well, that's good news! There is a vague map on the article page courtesy of the National Forest if that may help you template it. I fear that even if I had the software you have, I would make a mess due to my limited graphics ability. There certainly is no rush, so whenever you have time and don't hesitate to ask if there is anything I can do for you.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 04:36, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I like your draft. Your biggest obstacle will be to activate the picture of the day.

<p>Where are classes defined? In .CSS files?</p>
<p>I've been going over the Italian main page source code, and I can't find the classes that are in there defined anywhere.</p>
<p>When you pull the Italian pages into the English WP, the boxes turn out rectangular instead of round. I'm thinking it's because the classes can't access their definitions. Is this correct?</p>

<p>Hey, cool map on the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2006">Canadian federal election, 2006</a> page! Just curious, would it be possible to make similar maps of the major population centers (e.g. Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal), since they are not displayed very well on the map? <a href="../../../i/k/h/User%7EIkh_d701.html" title="User:Ikh">Ikh</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/h/User_talk%7EIkh_d708.html" title="User talk:Ikh">talk</a>) 19:21, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Another thing. Could you please upload the map in PNG format and change the links pointing to it? JPEGs do not work well for diagrams, such as maps. If you could upload an SVG version as well, that would be even better (MediaWiki, the software that runs Wikipedia, doesn't support SVG fonts properly, so please link to the PNG version). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_pmk_ab75.html" title="User:Andrew pmk">Andrew_pmk</a> | <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_pmk_6096.html" title="User talk:Andrew pmk">Talk</a> 20:54, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The .jpg's have smaller file sizes, though I now have uploaded .png versions too. With other maps, I've tried uploading .svg format with no luck due to formatting problems and fonts. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 22:26, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cool map, I just have a problem with the key. The #'s should be between the boxes instead of on the boxes. Makes it very confusing. You should also use intrevals of 10 as it would be more detailed, and you would actually be using some of the colours in your key. -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 01:04, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay. I changed the legend. The colors are more of a gradient (0-100%), with not all colors explicitly on the legend. So, I got rid of the boxes and just put gradient bars.

<p>A little late to the praise party about the maps, but one late suggestion to add to your to-do list. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> did a phenomenal job in Canadian federal election, 2004 map gallery of doing maps based on each of the riding groups we agreed to carve the country into a few years ago (and, interesting, we've proved to be rather good when its come to guestimating politico-cultural fault lines. Um, go us!). Earl's maps have since cropped up on the pages linked to from the below template</p>

<p>Hi there. Would it be such a big deal to add a link to the BBC article? Since many of the hijackers have turned out to be alive and well, don't you think that is worth mentioning? Allow me to put it another way; Is there a reason it should not be mentioned?</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>

<p>The Wikiproject No Ads, created as a backlash against the <a href="../../../t/o/o/Wikipedia%7ETools_1-Click_Answers_172e.html" title="Wikipedia:Tools/1-Click Answers">Answers.com deal</a>, has served an important function in providing a space for users to express their disagreement with the Foundation proposal. While the current controversies about userboxes raise questions about political and social advocacy on Wikipedia, there should be greater flexibility regarding advocacy <i><b>about</b></i> Wikipedia in the Wikipedia namespace. Reported and linked by Slashdot and other press sources as a unique and spontaneous occurence in Wikipedia history, it has apparently had some impact as, despite being scheduled to begin in January, not a peep has been heard about the trial and proposed sponsored link since the deal's controversial announcement months ago. Currently, however, there is <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_No_ads_e460.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:WikiProject No ads">an attempt to delete the project or move it off Wikipedia altogether</a>. Since the Foundation has provided no additional information and has not attempted to answer the specific questions that participants in the project raised, it is unclear if the Answers.com deal has been abandoned or simply delayed. Until the situation becomes more clear, I believe the group should still have a place in the Wikipedia namespace.

<p>Hello Kmf164. You have done great work across a wide variety of articles, including the hard work of adding photos and maps, which helps to improve the overall appearance and usability of this great resource. I think the project benefits greatly from your participation. I think you could do even more good for the project as an administratior. As far as I can see in your contribution history and talk page history, you have always "played nice" with others - which is a very important consideration for the adminship, in my view. I think one of the most important roles of the administrator is to set a good example for other users, and I think we should recognize the fact that you are doing this today.</p>
<p>Administrators also have access to a few technical features that help with <a href="../../../m/a/i/Wikipedia%7EMaintenance_5144.html" title="Wikipedia:Maintenance">maintenance</a>. I don't know you well enough yet to know for sure how much use you would make of these tools, but I am very confident you would not abuse them, and you are quite likely to find them useful in your work here.</p>
<p>Please look over the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_reading_list_6f0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list">administrators' reading list</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_how-to_guide_237e.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' how-to guide">how-to guide</a>, as well as the <a href="../../../g/r/f/WP%7EGRFA_5f5a.html" title="WP:GRFA">guide to requests for adminship</a>. If this looks like something you are interested in, then please leave me a note on my Talk page and I will formally nominate you.</p>

<li>Hi Km, that is great news that you will consider adminship. I think the tools are handy and that you will make some good use of them from time to time. Even if you only use them a little, so long as you only use them wisely (which I am sure you will) then there is no harm in having the tools in your hands.</li>

<p>I was going over the list and tested it via ctrl-f to search for key pages. There are a lot of key pages missing. None of the VfD pages came up, RfA is not on there, no "three revert rule", no Signpost, nor "deletion process". Of the terms I searched for, I did find Village Pump, Featured Articles, and Featured Article Candidates. But since so many came up missing, I stopped and decided to write to you. I don't think we're going about this in the right way. Working on an incomplete list may be counterproductive. --<a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 09:23, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All those pages are in my complete index, (e.g. User:Kmf164/WPindex-s has signpost). The User:Kmf164/WPindex-alpha page just includes the most popular pages, determined by the page_counter variable in the database. I'm not entirely sure how this is calculated in the database, if/when it's reset, or what. There may be some issue with page_counter to explain why Signpost and some other key pages aren't in the 1000 most popular list. I'll look into it. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 17:43, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey there, thanks for responding in the discussion page. I agree that the st911 link should be on the alternative theories page, but i also think that if not the whole site at least the first major article on their site should be a link available here. As cluttered as the list of external links may seem to be already, there's, i think, so much support for the beliefs of the 9/11 commission in the article that readers might appreciate an easy and direct link to a rebuttal which seems pretty thoroughly researched. I'm not sure if you've seen it yet, but apart from a few places where i could have done without what i felt like were opinions it seeems bizarrely solid to me. Maybe you could have a look and see what you think? <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHoligopoly_cd0e.html" title="User:Holigopoly">Holigopoly</a> 11:53, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see you've spotted this person advertising on laptop-related pages. I have just removed a link from his user page. Is this kosher? Also, can you block him? He's had three warnings.

<dd>After I gave the user the one warning, they stopped. If they come back and keep spamming, despite warnings, then they could be blocked. As for removing links from their user page, I generally won't do that (especially, if it's an established user witha good track record). According to <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:User page</a> guidelines, "You are welcome to include a link to your personal home page, although you should refrain from surrounding it with any promotional language."

<dd>Your knowledge would immediately fit into the framework of the Chicago School, Environmental, Rational Choice and Left Realism because ecological/situational crime analysis (albeit by many different names) has always been the supposedly key policy that will enable better policing and structural design to reduce crime. Back in the 1980s I helped on several several spatial analysis exercises to measure burglar movement patterns, correlating police and court data. People were were all agog because of the new-fangled computer power that we could bring to bear, but the police on the ground thought it was all a big joke and, in a way, they were right because better maps did not help them find their way through an investigation. Useful as a policy-making tool though. I wish you the best of luck in adding to your knowledge. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">David91</a> 02:39, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, regarding the naming of station names:</p>
<p>I've been reading the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Talk%7EPort_Authority_Trans-Hudson_7fed.html" title="Talk:Port Authority Trans-Hudson">PATH talk pages</a> and I noticed that the only real reason that you did not change the station naming format from "<i>Station</i> (PATH station)" to "<i>Station</i> (PATH)" was for conformity to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_Subway_7c6e.html" title="New York City Subway">New York City Subway</a> articles. Lately, <a href="../../../n/y/c/WP%7ENYCS_17b2.html" title="WP:NYCS">WP:NYCS</a> has changed its policy to one that is similar to your proposal, partly in response to a post you left at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_New_York_City_Subway_1208.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject New York City Subway">Wikipedia Talk:WikiProject New York City Subway</a>. (Okay, the agreement was more or less between me and one other person, but we were the only ones discussing.) I have been going through subway articles, renaming them to the format "<i>Station</i> (Line)", without the unnecessary "station" suffix.</p>
<p>Just thought I'd let you know, in case you were still interested in renaming the PATH articles.</p>

<p>I don't think a range block is in order. This is small scale vandalism for the most part. Sometimes it takes awhile to detect their edits, but since they can't resist defacing our user pages, eventually we catch and revert them. I decided to just indefinitely block all the logged in users since they hadn't done anything but vandalize anyway. They've exhausted <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and haven't actually contributed anything, so blocking on sight should be the rule of thumb for them from now on. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 15:59, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I think we tried to stay away from much talk about surging glaciers as they don't seem to have much relationship to climate I don't think....at least that is what Peltoms stated...and they also don't have much to do with glacier advance or retreat on a climatological study.

<p>I've actually tried moving some of the more encyclopedic articles back into Wikipedia, but was met with harsh resistance. They were summarily deleted under the chant "Wikipedia is not a memorial". If the sept 11 wiki is ever closed (which is a big "if") I very seriously doubt the content would be deleted outright. At the worst, it will get archived into a big zip file. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 04:29, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
