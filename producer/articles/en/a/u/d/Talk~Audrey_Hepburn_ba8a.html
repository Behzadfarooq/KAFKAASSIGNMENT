<p>What a bunch of bullshit. There are all of these limits on fair use, so if you're trying to find pictures of a movie star, you are pretty much limited to screenshots. But only 1 is allowed. So instead you get nothing more than a page of text that no one will read. I for one think it's a lot more fun to read an article with visuals. Do you really think it would hurt anyone to use more than one screenshot? Would that be offensive? Would it disrupt the delicate balance of this fine website? 70.132.31.235 05:20, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I hear you, but unfortunately Wikipedia has really been cracking down on images. Even promotional shots are not necessarily allowed, and magazine images were declared taboo a few months back. This is the first I'd heard of the screenshot limits and I'd like the editor who removed the images to please provide a citation for this rule. Unfortunately when you have Jimbo Wales (owner of Wikipedia) making statements that he'd rather see an article with no images than run the risk of violating a copyright, there's not much you can do. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 05:47, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You can use more than one screenshot, as long as you make and upload it yourself. It's <i>only</i> the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Images" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> screenshots that can only be used once per page. If you go to the <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" title="Special:Upload">image upload</a> page, click on "Licensing," and scroll down to "fair use," it says "Screenshots (one per article)."

<dd>The "one per article" restriction appears to conflict with the current {Film-screenshot} fair use tag which states: "It is believed that the use of a <b>limited number</b> of <b>web-resolution</b> screenshots for <b>identification and critical commentary</b> on the film.....on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">English-language Wikipedia</a>,.....qualifies as <b><a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a></b> under <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_copyright_law_7d4d.html" title="United States copyright law">United States copyright law</a>." I also noted that many of the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Featured_article.html" title="Featured article">Featured articles</a> on films and TV shows have multiple fair use screenshots in them. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Smithee_7e0f.html" title="User:Alan Smithee">Alan Smithee</a> 09:26, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I noticed that too, I don't know the answer. The upload page seems fairly unambiguous about it, but you may want to ask someone to clarify. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner">Shannernanner</a> 09:38, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is one of the reasons why using images has become so frustrating on Wikipedia -- Wikipedia itself can't even make up its mind. And some of its wording is open to wide interpretation. For example technically speaking a film screenshot is only to be used "to illustrate a film and its contents". In my opinion, "contents" includes the people who appear on screen. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 12:58, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's frustrating. In my opinion too, "contents" includes the people on screen and judging by the number of editors who add screenshots to articles about people, a good number obviously interpret it that way too. The message on the upload page clearly says one per page, and yet <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use policy</a> says, "Do not use multiple images or media clips if one will serve the purpose adequately". I think that sentence suggests that if one will NOT serve the purpose adequately, multiple images are ok. Asking someone to clarify is a great idea, but who exactly would we ask? There are a number of people working hard to rid Wikipedia of potential copyright violations, and there are vast differences in what each of them will allow or not allow. As far as I can see, in the policy page I've linked to, and in the discussion pages for the various fair use templates, fair use and copyright pages, there seems to be no agreement that images should be limited to one. Many editors, including some very experienced ones, talk about a small number (but still more than one) of images as ok. The only place I can see where it straight out says one only, is on the upload page. I wonder if this is the anomaly then? Maybe it's a carry over from a previous policy, or perhaps was part of an intended policy that was never made official. I don't know, but I'd love a nice, clear policy to follow so that it's not left up to the individual interpretations of any number of editors.<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 13:34, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A dispute has erupted between me and another editor at <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Winslet_5b47.html" title="Kate Winslet">Kate Winslet</a> over this very issue. He says actors aren't contents so he removed the article's only image, which happened to be a screenshot. According to the Oxford dictionary, a content is "what is contained in something". That in my opinion includes actors. Sometimes I think a lot of bad feelings would be saved if Wikipedia simply decided to give in to Copyright Paranoia and ban images altogether. Probably save a lot of bandwidth in the process. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:14, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I took this discussion over to <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair_use</a> and asked for clarification of "one per article" vs. "limited number" regarding screenshots. I couldn't get anyone to defend "one per article" as the official absolute limit in Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_5c7e.html#Article_limits_for_screenshot_images" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use">Article limits for screenshot images</a>). There is also an earlier discussion about screenshots (see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_Archive_8_4f3b.html#Too_many_images_in_an_article" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use/Archive 8">Too many images in an article</a>.) For now the official policy is <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair_use#Policy</a> criteria #3 <i>The amount of copyrighted work used should be as little as possible. Low-resolution images should be used instead of high-resolution images (especially images that are so high-resolution that they could be used for piracy). Do not use multiple images or media clips if one will serve the purpose adequately.</i> So it seems that mutiple screenshots can be used in an article, but each image meet all the criteria especially #8: <i>The material must contribute significantly to the article (e.g. identify the subject of an article, or specifically illustrate relevant points or sections within the text) and must not serve a purely decorative purpose.</i> <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Smithee_7e0f.html" title="User:Alan Smithee">Alan Smithee</a> 19:25, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, it's just a mistake not to have more than one image. Most people skimming through wikipedia and going to a page on Audrey Hepburn aren't really interested in every detail of her life, they just want the general summary and mostly they want to see what she looked like. I like reading articles that have visuals for each section that in effect summarize what the section is about. In this case, pictures of Hepburn in iconic movie scenes and at different stages of her life. This article should be an exception because it is about one of those most photographed people in history. 70.231.227.12 23:58, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, it should not be "an exception". The rules should allow for more images to be used if the subject of the article warrants it, and Hepburn is one of many that warrants it. This is the shaky ground part of the discussion - everyone has their own favourite who they believe to warrant special consideration. Not that I disagree with you, but making exceptions on the basis of POV is dangerous. Better to have a uniform policy. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 00:18, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree. Just because there is no official limit doesn't mean editors can add as many images as they want here or elsewhere. For example, adding a screenshot from every film that Audrey Hepburn was in would clearly be over the line of acceptable fair use. Exactly where the line should be drawn is the subject of intense debate all over Wikipedia right now. Anyone adding a fair use screenshot or other image needs to clearly state the reasons the image should be in the article (Fair Use Policy pt. #8) and had better be prepared to provide a solid and convincing defense if challenged. If people can't excercise restraint in the use of fair use images, then it will eventually come down to a limit of one fair use image per article or no images at all. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Smithee_7e0f.html" title="User:Alan Smithee">Alan Smithee</a> 00:51, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

I merely wanted to point out the last line under the "Early Life" section appears to state that Ms. Hepburn's life was saved by UNICEF immediately after the end of the Second World War.

<p>The filmography is wrong. "Monte Carlo Baby" and "Nous irons a Monte Carlo" were made at the same time, with slightly different casts, after "The secret people". I have a copy of "One wild oat" and it has a copyright date of 1950, which means it was her first English speaking role (for all of 30 sceonds) to appear&#160;; whether it was made before "Laughter in Paradise" I do not know.

<dd>The filmography follows the imdb.com filmography. But imdb might be wrong, who knows. 67.161.26.190 01:08, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I concur with Audreyfan, and in fact if you check the wikilinks you'll see both titles are linked to the same article. It is possible that the two films, while made at the same time (as noted in the article on the film which I created a couple of weeks ago) might have been released at different times. In terms of the IMDb filmography, it shouldn't be considered the epitome -- filmographies should also be compiled from biographies and other sources. For example, the IMDb for about 2 years had Audrey listed as appearing in "A New Kind of Love" which she is not. We also have to be careful not to copy the IMDb style otherwise that's a copyvio; that's why I reversed the order of the filmography awhile back. Only the IMDb lists start with the most recent. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 01:37, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The IMDb is certainly incorrect as regards the order of the films and it is internally self-contradictory. Filmographies should be based on research not merely on the adaptation of somebody else's list. Audreyfan</p>

<p>I have no objection to the new image, however it should be noted that discussion at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_Use_d71b.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair Use">Wikipedia:Fair Use</a> has established that Wikipedia has basically prohibited the use of publicity shots of this type, since they are still copyright (at least in the US).

<dd>I think a picture like this is completely necessary. And I've noticed that in the <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivien_Leigh_c566.html" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a> (featured) article, there is a publicity still used. The rationale is:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"No free or public domain images have been located for this film, and the only free use image that has been located for Vivien Leigh depicts her much later in life. Image is a promotional photograph, intended for wide distribution as publicity for the film. As the role of Scarlett O'Hara is arguably one of the most significant film roles in history, and certainly the most widely seen and noteworthy role in the career of the actress, Vivien Leigh, it is appropriate that it be illustrated in a comprehensive article about the actress. The image reflects the way she is most remembered, and in addition to providing an illustration for the discussion of the role, it also accurately depicts her appearance at the time, which links to the various references throughout the article to her beauty. Image is of considerably lower resolution than the original, and is used for informational purposes only. Its use does not detract from either the original photograph, or from the film itself."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think we can make similar arguments in this case. 70.132.28.57 07:03, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not disagreeing with you, but unfortunately I've run into this problem before. The problem is - and yes, it sounds nutty - is that under the fair use rules, such images cannot be used "to simply illustrate what a person looks like". The fact the publicity shot at Vivien Leigh is still there probably just means they (the copyvio cops) haven't gotten to it yet. We ran into this problem at <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Ford_6ae7.html" title="Glenn Ford">Glenn Ford</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Winslet_5b47.html" title="Kate Winslet">Kate Winslet</a> and a publicity photo at <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Freed_a291.html" title="Don Freed">Don Freed</a> (an article about a singer) is going to be removed soon, too. I believe the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milla_Jovovich_1830.html" title="Milla Jovovich">Milla Jovovich</a> article has also had this trouble. The fair use rules have in my opinion gotten so far out of hand that last week I actually quit Wikipedia in disgust for a couple of days over this very issue until I was talked back into the fold by a fellow editor. The specific rule I'm citing is at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Counterexamples" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use#Counterexamples</a> (see No. 8). <i>That said</i> -- the rule specifically states that it applies to living persons, so it's possible that's a loophole for keeping the Audrey and Vivien Leigh images, since neither actress is still with us; but that doesn't explain why we ran into Fair Use problems with publicity images for the now-deceased Glenn Ford. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:45, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

Looks like there is a real tussle going on in the editing page. I agree with Irpen. If we can't use a publicity picture, is there some reason why we can't use a screenshot from an earlier movie?

<p>Perhaps the best way to avoid the continuous yo-yo-ing regarding the birth name is to add a section specificially discussing the fact that different sources give different birth names. The birth certificate linked -- which shows Audrey Kathleen Hepburn as her birth name and Edda Van Heemstra as <i>her mother's</i> name -- should be treated as definitive, but it is probably worth acknowledging that there is some confusion. (Just as you still come across sources that refer to Audrey as being a close relative to Katherine Hepburn (as opposed to being a 10th cousin four times-carry-the-two removed.&#160;;-) ).

Hi, I'm new and haven't made an account yet. I'm a longtime fan of Audrey Hepburn and have read all of her biographies.

<p>What evidence is there that she had a grandmother called Kathleen Hepburn.

<p>I like the paragragh very much. But in the sense of absolute clarity and accuracy, I wouldnt mind changing two things</p>
<p>1. making it clear that the dress auctioned by Christie's was NOT the dress worn by Audrey in the movie. This is clear from both photos of the dress <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/sp3lly/pic/00060bff" class="external autonumber" title="http://pics.livejournal.com/sp3lly/pic/00060bff" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and also by the description of the dress in the official Christie's auction catalog. <a href="http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/search/LotDetail.asp?sid=&amp;intObjectID=4832498&amp;AllObjectIDs=&amp;SRObjectID=&amp;AllSaleIDs=&amp;SRSaleID=&amp;RefineQueryURL=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/search/LotDetail.asp?sid=&amp;intObjectID=4832498&amp;AllObjectIDs=&amp;SRObjectID=&amp;AllSaleIDs=&amp;SRSaleID=&amp;RefineQueryURL=" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>2. I think the current reference (The Independent) given in this section should be changed, because it erroneously reports that the dress sold at the auction was the one worn by Audrey in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Although this is a common mistake (both AP and Reuters are also stating this), the BBC article correctly states that this is not the case. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6209658.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6209658.stm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> --<a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 17:24, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate whoever implemented the above suggestions. However, there is a further clarification that needs to be made. We really do not know where the dress that Audrey actually wore in the movie is. The version that was auctioned off is clearly not it - as plainly stated in the Christie's Catalog. However, the version of the dress in Madrid is also not it, because that dress also has a slit up the left side of the dress (this is also stated in the Christie's Catalog). This would seem to indicate that the dress held by the Givenchy Archive is "the" dress worn by Audrey in the movie. This could be the case, but we cannot automatically assume it is. First, it would definitely have to have no slit up the left side. Second, thanks to some brilliant thinking by a friend, if the one in the Givenchy Archive is the proto-type for the two others (both of which have slits) then the one in the Givenchy Archive would also have a slit-meaning none of these three dresses were worn by Audrey in the movie.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Instead, it could be that Audrey wore a version of the dress made by Edith Head. Indeed, the previous item in the Christie's catalog shows a sketch of the little black dress and the white sash; the dress has no slit and has a more square neckline, exactly like the one in the movie. The sketch is signed by Edith Head. (The photo of the sketch is not available on line, but it is posted on the audrey1.com forum - where this topic has been discussed at great length and detail.) We do not know for sure where the dress is that Audrey actually wore: it could be the one in the Givenchy Archive - but only if that one does not have a slit. It could be one made (altered) by Edith Head (assuming she did indeed make the dress as it appears in her sketch, which again is indistinguishable from the one Audrey actually wore.) In fact there were probably two or three of these "no-slit" versions made, since a couple of doubles would have been necessary while filming.</dd>

<dd>The statement regarding this is incorrect. The catalog states that the dress in Madrid has a slit just like the one sold at auction on December 5th 2006. It does NOT say it was used in the movie. There are no known publicity shots showing Audrey wearing a dress with the slit visible. The version of the dress won in the movie differs from the dress sold at auction and the dress in Madrid because it does not have a slit, period. It is not public knowledge whether the dress in the Givenchy archive has a slit. There seems to be a few incorrect assumptions here - Beaker. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.0.230.234_0713.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.0.230.234">86.0.230.234</a> (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.0.230.234.html" title="User talk:86.0.230.234">talk</a>) 01:41, 21 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>The cancer bit was summarized from Sean Ferrer's autobiography. I guess not everyone is as science inclined, but I find it all fascinating. 67.161.26.190 09:51, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Any citation for Joseph Ruston being half-Czech? I read the excerpt from Spoto's biography, and it just says that he was an Englishman. As far as I can tell, her mother was full Dutch and her father was English with some deep Scottish roots, so where did the French come from? 67.161.26.190 04:17, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. I like that whole section. UNICEF was a huge part of her life and it's interesting to see the progression of her descriptions. By the time she gets to Somalia, she realizes how awful the situation is, and from then on it consumed her. 67.161.26.190 09:53, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>This is a bit awkward for the leading sentence, how about just actress, and leave the Dutch-British part for later in his bio to describe her origins. Dutch-British? There's got to be a better way to summarize Audrey's notability in the first sentence.

<dd>The idea that we need to summarize a person's nationality in the first sentence is silly, but lots of people seem to like it. In this case, there's no way to say she was British, Belgian-born, of Dutch and British ancestry, and became famous acting in American movies without emphasizing nationality to a ridiculous degree, and it's al information already contained in the article. No need for a hyphenated summary in the first sentence. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 02:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
