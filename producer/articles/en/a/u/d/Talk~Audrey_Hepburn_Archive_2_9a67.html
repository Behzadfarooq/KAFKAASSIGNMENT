<p>The sentences: "Some believe Bogart and Hepburn did not get along, but this is untrue. Bogart got along better with Hepburn than anyone else on set. Hepburn later said, "Sometimes it's the so-called 'tough guys' that are the most tender hearted, as Bogey was with me."[20] and attributed to Note 20 seem to be about Katherine Hepburn, not Audrey Hepburn. ---- 6 October 2006.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Time to create a Name controversy section?</span></h2>
<p>Despite the presence of a link to Audrey's birth certificate which confirms her birth name, we're still seeing people putting in the other names associated with her. I suggest one way to handle this is to create a "Name controversy" section where all different variations can be aired out. Otherwise, the name on the birth certificate (which I believe is also supported by not only Sean Ferrer but also Audrey Hepburn herself) should be considered gospel on this matter. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:41, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re: the "<a href="../../../c/o/u/Count.html" title="Count">Count</a>" being repeatedly appended to his name, I believe I found the source of the confusion: according to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01469e.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01469e.htm" rel="nofollow">the "Catholic Encyclopedia"</a>, Andrea Dotti was also a 13th-14th century Catholic saint, and the brother of Count Dotto Dotti.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">GAP ads</span></h2>
<p>I have removed the following sections from the article:</p>
<p><i>"Hepburn's popularity endures to this day. She is currently featured in a <a href="../../../g/a/p/Gap_%28clothing_retailer%29.html" title="Gap (clothing retailer)">GAP</a> commercial that uses clips of her dancing from</i> Funny Face <i>with the tagline "It's Back -- The Skinny Black Pant." The commercial is part of the "Keep It Simple" Campaign and will air on all major networks from September 7 to October 5."</i></p>
<p><i>"The new Gap Ads for the Skinny Black Pant feature footage from "Funny Face" as Audrey Hepburn dances to "Back in Black" by ACDC."</i></p>
<p>This information does not belong in a "biography" about Audrey Hepburn's life. If someone wants to create an article discussing television commercials which use CGI/special EFX to edit film images of deceased actors/actresses into selling products for them, it could go there. 71.113.37.152 04:31, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, no need for the sarcasm. I put it in the trivia section, mainly to say that Hepburn is one of the more popular classic movie stars today. And GAP made a donation to the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund so I'm cool with them. 67.161.26.190 09:28, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The sarcasm wasn't intentional. I haven't seen the GAP ads. It's just most commercials using special EFX to make dead actors such as James Cagney pitch for Coca Cola or Fred Astaire dance with Dirt Devil vacuum cleaners were little more than crass commercialism to make money rather than a tribute to the individual. If the consensus is to keep the GAP info, that's fine with me. The AHCF donation is an interesting point that you might want to add to the trivia. 71.121.134.108 16:02, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also find distasteful and unappealing TV ads that appear to resurrect the dead and put them in scenes they were never in, in their movies. Such Audrey ads include one or two for a company in Japan that advertises <i>tea</i>. However, the GAP ads (which you can see on youtube) do not attempt to resurrect Audrey: rather they just use her dance moves straight from <i>Funny Face.</i> There is no implication in the commercial that she is being resurrected: rather it is the scene in FF that is being "resurrected". Given that, the use of AC/DC's "Back in Black" is a major turn off to a lot of people, including a lot of Audrey fans. We should also remember that the TV commercials are only part of the GAP campaign (variously called "Keep it simple" or "Hello Audrey") which also features large "cut out" posters of Audrey in GAP stores across the USA and Canada (literally from Toronto to Vancouver). Even though GAP apparently made a "generous" contribution to the AHCF, some have pointed out the possible hypocrisy of supporting a store that allegedly produces its products in third world sweat shops, although I think that goes far beyond the scope of mentioning the GAP ads. --<a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 11:55, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree about the ad. My family saw it and there was quite a bit of discussion as to whether it was her image from an old film, and if so which one. Having a mention of it in the article would have been helpful and would improve the article. It might lead someone to make the effort to rent the film. Somenone's distaste is just that: his personal taste, so there's no disputing that he finds it distasteful, but he is not the Official Wiki Arbiter of Taste. Is it distasteful to quote the words of a dead writer or poet, or to play the music of a dead composer or musician in an ad?

<p>The filmography box is great, but the list needs to be reversed. Too many Wikipedia articles borrow the IMDb's format of listing most recent film's first.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Notable roles</span></h2>
<p>A recent anonymous editor again added <i><a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabrina_%281954_film%29.html" title="Sabrina (1954 film)">Sabrina</a></i> to the list of notable roles in the infobox without the requested discussion, so I thought I would bring it up. I pared down the long list of notable roles originally there, using the text of the article as a guide; <i><a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Holiday_e13d.html" title="Roman Holiday">Roman Holiday</a></i> is stated as her "breakthrough film," and she was also awarded an Academy Award for her performance; <i><a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakfast_at_Tiffany%27s_8578.html" title="Breakfast at Tiffany's">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a></i> is stated to be "one of the most iconic characters in 20th Century American cinema," and she was nominated for an Academy Award; <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charade.html" title="Charade">Charade</a></i> is stated as being a "critically acclaimed hit," for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe and won a BAFTA Award; and <i><a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Fair_Lady_%28film%29_7282.html" title="My Fair Lady (film)">My Fair Lady</a></i> is stated to have been "the most anticipated movie since <i><a href="../../../g/o/n/Gone_with_the_Wind_%28film%29_6d15.html" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone with the Wind</a></i>," and speaks of the controversy of her being nominated for, but not receiving, the Academy Award. The editor who added <i>Sabrina</i> stated their reasoning as "Nominated for an Oscar for Sabrina + it's one of her most famous roles." She was nominated for Oscars, and other awards, for many roles, and I do not think they all should be added; however, if it is indeed verifiably "one of her most famous roles" I don't, personally, have a problem with it being there. I just don't want the infobox to include a reiteration of the filmography--I think the "Notable roles" section should be thought of primarily as a reference tool. Anyone else have any thoughts? -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner">Shannernanner</a> 07:04, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sabrina is considered one of her iconic roles. It's the film in which she was first associated with Givenchy, plus as noted she was nominated for her second consecutive Oscar. I support it being listed as one of her notable roles. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 12:40, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also think <i>Sabrina</i> is one of her most important roles. More important than <i>Charade</i> and less important than the others mentioned, <i>in my opinion</i>. I'm concerned that <i>any</i> selection of "notable roles" comes largely down to POV, the very thing we should be strenuously avoiding. We don't have a definitive set of criteria and a case could probably be made for others of her films too. Plus the infobox is too big. But yes, <i>Sabrina</i> is a notable role. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 13:16, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Personally I think the "notable role" category shouldn't be included in the infobox, for the reasons indicated above. It opens things up to a lot of POV. For example it could just as easily be argued that her roles in Nun's Story, Two for the Road, Wait Until Dark and Charade are as notable as Roman Holiday, Sabrina and Tiffany's. Once all these are listed you're pretty well parroting about a third of her total film output. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:46, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have had this discussion before re: other articles, and my opinion remains that the section has value as a reference tool if used properly. Yes, many roles can and could be considered "notable," but I think the section is for one's "most notable" roles--in general, the ones they could be recognized for, by someone not necessarily familiar with the particular actor. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner">Shannernanner</a> 20:05, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An objection was made at <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Jake_Gyllenhaal_2b4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Jake Gyllenhaal">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Jake Gyllenhaal</a> - "The information box currently has POV. It's not up to us to decide which of Gyllenhaal's roles were "notable". " I think that comment is absolutely correct. I understand that the infobox is a snapshot to provide quick, relevant details, and in theory having some notable roles seems like a good thing, but in practice we're interpreting information rather than performing the encyclopedic task of merely presenting the information. Also, the infobox for Hepburn is ugly, IMO. It's too big, and while we're on the subject of infoboxes - I can't imagine that anyone just wanting to skim Hepburn's article without reading it, needs to know how tall she was or who her husbands were. This is pointless trivia. How does everyone feel about the height and the husbands? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 20:59, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll take off height, since she's not an athlete and doesn't need a stat box, and husbands, since there is an entire section on that. As for Sabrina, any Audrey Hepburn fan will tell you that her most famous roles are in Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Tiffany's, and My Fair Lady. Charade may be critically acclaimed and in the imdb top 250, but Audrey Hepburn will always be known more for Sabrina than for Charade. Trust me, if you're picking 4, that's the 4 you want. I'll take off Charade. We already have a filmography. 70.132.1.97 01:38, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We're not "picking 4;" neither is this a unilateral decision. No, the "Notable roles" field is not another filmography, as I myself already pointed out, but consensus should be reached. If you want to remove her height or spouses per notability, take it up on the template page. As for this page, I think they're both notable as they're both verifiable and mentioned elsewhere on the page in context of the article. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner">Shannernanner</a> 07:38, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with your decision to restore this information. It has to be discussed more and it's being discussed at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_actor_0dbb.html" title="Template talk:Infobox actor">Template talk:Infobox actor</a>, which is where we should be talking, so that <i>all</i> articles can be assessed uniformly. But a couple of questions first&#160;: Do you think there should be any limit to the size of the box as a whole? (aside from discussing what should and shouldn't be in the box) I can't see the whole box - is it just me? I have to scroll down to get to the bottom of it and I think it makes the page look unbalanced. I can kind of see the reasoning in including a number of the fields - I'd be happier to see them gone but I can see both viewpoints. I don't understand the significance of height though. Why is Audrey Hepburn's height notable? She wasn't particularly tall or particularly short. And just because it's verifiable - there's a whole lot of stuff about her that's verifiable but that in itself doesn't justify its inclusion. (this is stuff to argue on the template page, I know, but I am just wondering). I can see no relevance for height, but if height is relevant, how about weight? Hepburn was a notable thin person, her weight is more notable than her height. I really don't get it, I'm afraid. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 07:53, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I've read parts of the discussion there. I do think it needs to be worked on, particularly (in my opinion) the parameters/phrasing of the "Notable roles" section. As to your questions, no, I can't see the whole box without scrolling, but the monitor I'm currently using is not very large, and I have to scroll to see the whole Wikipedia logo (okay, so that's a slight exaggeration&#160;;-) ). Anyway, it doesn't bother me. I don't think one's height necessarily has to be unusual to be notable; her height is specifically referenced within the body of the article, not as a footnote as in some articles, but in context of her ballet career. (Whether or not it should be in the infobox otherwise in other articles, I'll not take up here.) Weight is a different story, as one's adult height is generally constant and therefore potentially verifiable, whereas weight can fluctuate even day to day. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner">Shannernanner</a> 08:07, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>ok, fair enough. I still don't believe it should be in the infobox but at least I can understand what you're saying. I hope I didn't give the impression that I wanted her weight to be included - I think for an infobox it's equally irrelevant, which is what I was trying to say. I guess we'll have to see how this all pans out with further discussion. I think I'd be more able to accept the notable roles field if the parameters/phrasing, as you say, was more clearly defined. At the moment it's all too fluid. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 13:21, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>We could limit her notable roles to Princess Anne, Holly Golightly and Eliza Doolittle. I don't think we would find much disagreement that these are the "<b>most notable</b>" of her notable roles. --<a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 12:01, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As far as husbands being in the box, my first thought was why not include "significant other" Rob Wollers, who was probably more a husband to her than either Ferrer or Dotti. I'm not saying include him in the box (he is in the article), it is just that if we mention husbands, then it leaves the impression that they were somehow more significant than Rob--which is up to debate. --<a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 12:01, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If those three are acceptable to everyone else, they're fine with me.</dd>
<dd>If you don't want to include him in the infobox (which I don't think we should either, just because the field specifically says "spouses"), why exactly are you bringing it up? Not trying to be rude, I'm just not sure I understand your point.&#160;:-) -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner"><span style="font-family: Palatino"><font color="indigo">Shannernanner</font></span></a> 13:19, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think those 3 are the most notable and I think limiting the list to 3 is a good idea. <i>Roman Holiday</i> is mentioned twice in the infobox and the repetition is not exactly desirable. I also think the Academy Award field is inherently POV - why not Emmy, BAFTA, Golden Globe, Grammy and Tony Awards? She won those also. That's a discussion for <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_actor_0dbb.html" title="Template talk:Infobox actor">Template talk:Infobox actor</a>, which I'll be sure to start&#160;:-) If the Academy Award <i>must</i> be included, could it perhaps be put in brackets after <i>Roman Holiday</i> so that the film title is not repeated?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Robert Wolders, I think this demonstrates the irrelevance that the "spouses" field has for some biographies. We're recording the names of two men who had failed relationships with Hepburn, and ignoring the one who had a successful relationship that ended only with Hepburn's death. Because Hepburn was old and wise enough and had learnt from experience that a marriage document did not make a marriage, the person that she spent her life with is overlooked. I don't think Wolders should be added to the infobox, but it reinforces to me, how unnecessary the references to Dotti and Ferrer actually are. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 14:54, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay; does anyone else have input about the notable roles? I understand your point about the Academy Award, and I agree, it's another thing to bring up on the template talk page.&#160;:-) I'm rather ambivalent towards leaving it in the current field or appending it to the notable roles section, personally; the Academy Awards field should <i>probably</i> be changed to "Awards won" (for actors with too many, it could simply guide one to the "Awards" section), in which case the <i>Roman Holiday</i> win would be repeated anyway. I agree with you about the spouses for the most part, but that goes to POV. It's an infobox, not a "down with marriage" box.&#160;:-) -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner"><span style="font-family: Palatino"><font color="indigo">Shannernanner</font></span></a> 15:07, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sam Levenson quote</span></h2>
<p>Why include a Sam Levenson quote in the section of Audrey's quotes? This only perpetuates the misunderstanding that Audrey was the source for the words. Especially as currently written, it is even amibiguous to the casual reader what is attributed to Sam Levenson. I would say either take the quote out, or make it much more obvious that Sam Levenson is the source of the quote. It doesn't make sense in an Audrey quote section, frankly. If we just delete it, then we aren't perpetuating the misconception that she originated the words. --<a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 18:38, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It might be worthwhile to make mention of the poem in prose as being often attributed to her, though actually written by Sam Levinson, so as to help dispel the rumour. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner"><span style="font-family: Palatino"><font color="indigo">Shannernanner</font></span></a> 08:56, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's valid as an "Audrey quote" if it's associated with her, despite the fact that they were written by someone else. How many politicians write the quotes they become famous for? But yes, make it clearer that Levenson is the source. Can the quotes be worked into the text so as to give them context? If not, they could (and probably should) be moved to Wikiquote. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 09:06, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How it is valid as an Audrey quote when she never wrote it is beyond me. She may have referred to it a lot, even quoted it--but do we really know how often or even when?

<dd>I did say "if it's associated with her". I don't know how strongly associated it is - I'd never heard it before. The way it's currently framed is an improvement, though why we need a quotes section, when we have "Wikiquotes" is beyond me.</dd>

<dd>The difference (to me) between a politician's quote and "her" poem is that politicians don't normally specify they didn't write their speeches, etc., and they aren't usually published prior to their giving them. With the entire poem quoted, and only the footnote regarding the original author, it doesn't seem to make the matter very clear to the casual reader. I'd prefer a sentence simply saying it was a poem she enjoyed, and often quoted. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner"><span style="font-family: Palatino"><font color="indigo">Shannernanner</font></span></a> 13:19, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to Wikiquote:<br />
"Occasionally, the poem 'Time Tested Beauty Tips' by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Levenson_f6bd.html" title="Sam Levenson">Sam Levenson</a> is wrongly attributed to Audrey Hepburn. Properly read, it should be 'By <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Levenson_f6bd.html" title="Sam Levenson">Sam Levenson</a> Edited by <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audrey_Hepburn_bca7.html" title="Audrey Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a>, because the original format of the poem was as a letter to his granddaughter in case he was gone before she grew up. Audrey found the letter and edited lines of it into a poem."<br />

<p>The introduction currently states, "She has often been called one of the most beautiful women of all time, most recently in a 2006 poll for New Woman magazine." I'm not sure this is the most relevant sentence to put there; it gives the impression that her beauty is what is important about her above anything else. Kinda like putting in Albert Einstein's intro "And he sure had weird hair."&#160;:-) I think it should be moved, perhaps to the popularity section. Also perhaps the other sentence re: the AFI should be moved there.

<dd>Her beauty might not be the <i>most</i> important thing to say about her, and as it currently reads it puts too much emphasis on it and makes the lead section somewhat shallow, but it's worth mentioning in its proper context. (A <i>New Woman</i> poll is a very wrong context IMO) As the lead should be a summary I would suggest the first sentence identify her (as it does), then a paragraph about her career. Then a paragraph about what she achieved/how she is perceived. I think the 3 things notable about her would be the regard in which she is held as an actress (awards could be briefly mentioned), her style/beauty/fashion status (however you want to put it) and her reputation as a humanitarian. That should summarise the main points in the article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 13:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's a great improvement, and perhaps over time it will be fleshed out a little further without straying off the point. It's good. I removed the word "iconic". I agree that Hepburn was iconic but (each in her own way), so was the other Hepburn, Monroe, Dietrich, Garbo, Crawford, Lombard, Harlow, Loy, Bergman, Stanwyck, Garland, Grable, Bardot, Bette Davis, Elizabeth Taylor, .... etc. It's either a long or a short list depending on your POV and the description applied to Hepburn isn't attributed to anyone. I also added the date for the AFI ranking. I think it's good to show that it's relatively recent, and certainly demonstrates that her appeal has not diminished since her death, probably the opposite in fact. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 08:07, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
