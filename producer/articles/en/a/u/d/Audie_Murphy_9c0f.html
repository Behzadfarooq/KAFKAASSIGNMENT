<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/d/Audie_Murphy_9c0f.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
<p>Audie Leon Murphy was born to Emmett and Josie Bell Murphy (née Killian), two poor sharecroppers, and grew up near <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celeste%2C_Texas_8236.html" title="Celeste, Texas">Celeste, Texas</a> (<a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunt_County_8eaf.html" title="Hunt County">Hunt County</a>). Murphy went to school in Celeste until the eighth grade, when he dropped out to work and help support his family. He also lived in the rural area of <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmersville%2C_Texas_1730.html" title="Farmersville, Texas">Farmersville, Texas</a> and in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenville%2C_Texas_61c9.html" title="Greenville, Texas">Greenville, Texas</a>. Murphy was the sixth of twelve children, only nine of whom survived to see their 18th birthday.</p>
<p>During the 1930s, Murphy also worked in a combination general store, garage, and filling station in Greenville, Texas. In 1940, his father deserted the family and never returned. At 16, Murphy was working in a radio repair shop when his mother died on May 23, 1941. Later in the year in accordance with his older sister, Corrinne, Murphy put his three youngest siblings into an orphanage to ensure their care.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/d/Audie_Murphy_9c0f.html" title="Edit section: Military career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Military career</span></h3>
<p>Immediately following the Japanese <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor_c6a2.html" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> on December 7, 1941, Murphy — then just 17 years old — tried to enlist in the military, but the services rejected him because he had not yet reached the required 18 years of age. Shortly after his 18th birthday in June 1942, Murphy was finally accepted into the United States Army, after being turned down by the Marines and the paratroopers for being underweight and of slight build. He was sent to <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Wolters_74f2.html" title="Camp Wolters">Camp Wolters</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, for basic training. During a session of close order drill, he passed out. His company commander then tried to have him transferred to a cook and bakers' school because of his baby-faced youthfulness and apparent physical weaknesses, but Murphy insisted on becoming a combat soldier. His wish was granted; after 13 weeks of basic training, he was sent to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Meade%2C_Maryland_ac35.html" title="Fort Meade, Maryland">Fort Meade</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> for advanced infantry training.</p>
<p>Due to his fragile physical appearance, Murphy still had to "fight the system" to get overseas and into combat. His persistence paid off, and in early 1943 he was shipped out to <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casablanca%2C_Morocco_00e1.html" title="Casablanca, Morocco">Casablanca</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> as a replacement in Company B, 1st Battalion, <a href="../../../1/5/t/15th_Infantry_Regiment_%28United_States%29_6336.html" title="15th Infantry Regiment (United States)">15th Infantry Regiment (United States)</a>, <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._3rd_Infantry_Division_456b.html" title="U.S. 3rd Infantry Division">3rd Infantry Division</a>. Murphy saw no action in Africa, but instead participated in extensive training maneuvers along with the rest of the 3rd Division. His combat initiation finally came when he took part in the liberation of <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a> in July 1943. Shortly after arriving, he experienced his first encounter with death by killing two Italian officers as they tried to escape on horseback. Murphy contracted <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a> while in Sicily, and this illness put him in the hospital several times during his Army years. After Sicily was secured from the Germans, the 3rd Division invaded the Italian mainland, landing near <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salerno.html" title="Salerno">Salerno</a> in September 1943. Murphy distinguished himself in combat on many occasions while in Italy, fighting at the Volturno River, at the <a href="../../../a/n/z/Anzio.html" title="Anzio">Anzio</a> beachhead, and in the cold, wet, desolate Italian mountains. While in Italy, his instinctive skills as a combat infantryman began to earn him promotions, increased responsibilities, and decorations for valor.</p>
<p>Following its participation in the Italian campaign, the 3rd Division invaded Southern France on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>. Shortly thereafter, Murphy's best friend, Lattie Tipton (referred to as "Brandon" in Murphy's book <i>To Hell and Back</i>), was killed while approaching some German troops feigning surrender. Murphy went into a rage, and single-handedly wiped out the German machine gun crew which had just killed his friend. He then used the German machine gun to destroy several other nearby enemy positions. For this act he received the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Cross_%28United_States%29_b766.html" title="Distinguished Service Cross (United States)">Distinguished Service Cross</a> (second only to the Medal of Honor).</p>
<p>Just weeks later, he received <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Star_18bc.html" title="Silver Star">Silver Stars</a> for two more heroic actions. Murphy, by now a staff sergeant and holding the position of Platoon Sergeant, was eventually awarded a battlefield commission to second lieutenant, which elevated him to the Platoon Leader position. He was wounded in the hip by a sniper's ricocheting bullet 12 days after the promotion. Audie spent some ten weeks recuperating. Within days of returning to his unit he became the company commander (still wearing bandages, January 25, 1945) and suffered further wounds from a mortar round (which killed two others nearby).</p>
<p>The very next day--the high temperature was at 14 degrees with 24 inches of snow on the ground--the battle at Holtzwihr began with Murphy's unit at an effective strength of 19 out of 128. Murphy sent all of his men to the rear while he took pot-shots at the Germans until out of ammunition. He then proceeded to use a burning, disabled tank destroyer's .50 caliber machine gun to cut into the German infantry at a distance, including one full squad of German infantry that had crawled in a ditch to within 100 feet of his position. This nearly single-handed battle continued for slightly more than an hour. His focus on the battle before him stopped only when his telephone line to the artillery fire direction center was cut by either U.S. or German artillery. As his remaining men came forward, he quickly organized them to conduct the counter attack, which proved very successful. These actions earned Murphy the Medal of Honor near Holzwihr, France, on January 26, 1945.</p>

<p>The official U.S. Army citation for Audie Murphy's Medal of Honor reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Rank and organization:</b> Second Lieutenant, U.S. Army, Company B 15th Infantry, 3rd Infantry Division.</i></dd>
<dd><i><b>Place and date:</b> Near Holtzwihr France, 26 January, 1945.</i></dd>
<dd><i><b>Entered service at:</b> Dallas, Texas. Birth: Hunt County, near Kingston, Texas, G.O. No. 65, 9 August 1944.</i></dd>
<dd><i><b>Citation:</b> Second Lt. Murphy commanded Company B, which was attacked by six tanks and waves of infantry. Lt. Murphy ordered his men to withdraw to prepared positions in a woods, while he remained forward at his command post and continued to give fire directions to the artillery by telephone. Behind him, to his right, one of our tank destroyers received a direct hit and began to burn. Its crew withdrew to the woods. Lt. Murphy continued to direct artillery fire, which killed large numbers of the advancing enemy infantry. With the enemy tanks abreast of his position, Lt. Murphy climbed on the burning tank destroyer, which was in danger of blowing up at any moment, and employed its .50 caliber machine gun against the enemy. He was alone and exposed to German fire from three sides, but his deadly fire killed dozens of Germans and caused their infantry attack to waver. The enemy tanks, losing infantry support, began to fall back. For an hour the Germans tried every available weapon to eliminate Lt. Murphy, but he continued to hold his position and wiped out a squad that was trying to creep up unnoticed on his right flank. Germans reached as close as 10 yards, only to be mowed down by his fire. He received a leg wound, but ignored it and continued his single-handed fight until his ammunition was exhausted. He then made his way back to his company, refused medical attention, and organized the company in a counterattack, which forced the Germans to withdraw. His directing of artillery fire wiped out many of the enemy; he killed or wounded about 50. Lt. Murphy's indomitable courage and his refusal to give an inch of ground saved his company from possible encirclement and destruction, and enabled it to hold the woods which had been the enemy's objective.</i></dd>

<p>Audie Murphy was credited with destroying 6 tanks besides killing 250 German soldiers and wounding and capturing many others. By the end of World War II, he was a legend within the 3rd Infantry Division as a result of his heroism and battlefield leadership. His principal U.S. decorations included the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medal_of_Honor_1efa.html" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Cross_%28United_States%29_b766.html" title="Distinguished Service Cross (United States)">Distinguished Service Cross</a>, two <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Star_Medal_1b56.html" title="Silver Star Medal">Silver Star Medals</a>, the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Merit_56bc.html" title="Legion of Merit">Legion of Merit</a>, two <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze_Star_Medal_c027.html" title="Bronze Star Medal">Bronze Star Medals</a> with Valor device, and three <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple_Heart_4dee.html" title="Purple Heart">Purple Hearts</a> (for the three wounds he received in combat).

In addition, Murphy was awarded the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combat_Infantryman_Badge_4190.html" title="Combat Infantryman Badge">Combat Infantryman Badge</a> (a complete list of his awards and decorations appears later in this article). Murphy spent 29 months overseas and just under two years in combat with the 3rd Infantry Division, all before he turned 21 years of age and was eligible to vote.</p>
<p>In early June 1945, one month after Germany's surrender, Murphy returned from Europe to a hero's welcome in his home state of Texas, where he was showered with parades, banquets, and speeches. Murphy was discharged from active duty with the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant in September 1945.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a> broke out in June 1950, Murphy joined the 36th Infantry Division of the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_National_Guard_3337.html" title="Texas National Guard">Texas National Guard</a>. However, that division was not called up for combat duty, and Murphy remained in the United States during all his National Guard service. By the time he left the Guard in 1966, he had attained the rank of major.</p>

<p>Murphy suffered from <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder.html" title="Post-traumatic stress disorder">Post-traumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD) after his return from the war. He was plagued by insomnia, bouts of depression, and nightmares related to his countless bloody battles. His first wife, <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanda_Hendrix_38da.html" title="Wanda Hendrix">Wanda Hendrix</a>, often talked of his struggle with this condition, even claiming that he had at one time held her at gunpoint.

When he recognized that he had become addicted to the drug, he locked himself in a motel room, where he forced himself to stop taking the pills, and went through withdrawal symptoms for a week.</p>
<p>Always an advocate of the needs of America's military veterans, Murphy eventually broke the taboo about publicly discussing war-related mental conditions. In an effort to draw attention to the problems of returning Korean and <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> veterans, Murphy spoke out candidly about his own problems with PTSD, known then and during World War II as "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Combat_stress_reaction.html" title="Combat stress reaction">battle fatigue</a>" and commonly known as "shell shock." He called on the United States government to give increased consideration and study to the emotional impact that combat experiences have on veterans, and to extend health care benefits to address PTSD and the other mental health problems of returning war veterans.</p>

<p>Murphy married actress Wanda Hendrix in 1949. They were divorced in 1951, having produced no children. He then married former airline stewardess Pamela Archer, with whom he had two children: Terry Michael Murphy (born 1952) and James Shannon Murphy (born 1954).

Audie Murphy in 1967 Western movie, <i>40 Guns to Apache Pass</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>

But the next few years in California were difficult for Murphy as he trained to become an actor. He became disillusioned from lack of work, was broke financially, and slept on the floor of a gymnasium owned by his friend Terry Hunt (Murphy would later name one of his sons Terry out of respect for his friend). But he eventually received token acting parts in the films <i>Beyond Glory</i> and <i>Texas, Brooklyn and Heaven</i>. Murphy's third movie, <i>Bad Boy</i>, gave him his first leading role. He starred in the 1951 adaptation of Stephen Crane's Civil War novel, <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>. He expressed great discomfort in playing himself in <i>To Hell and Back</i>.In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, he starred in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_film.html" title="Western film">western film</a> <i><a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Name_on_the_Bullet_3fb8.html" title="No Name on the Bullet">No Name on the Bullet</a></i>. <a name="First_starring_role" id="First_starring_role"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/d/Audie_Murphy_9c0f.html" title="Edit section: First starring role">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First starring role</span></h4>
<p>After returning home from World War II, Murphy bought a house in <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmersville%2C_Texas_1730.html" title="Farmersville, Texas">Farmersville</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> for his oldest sister Corinne, her husband Poland Burns, and their three children. The idea was that Audie's three siblings, Nadine, Billie, and Joe, who had been living in an orphanage since Murphy's mother's death, would also be able to live with Corinne and Poland and would become part of a family again. Unfortunately, six children under one roof created too much stress on everyone. The arrangement didn't work out as smoothly as expected, particularly with Nadine and Joe, so Murphy came and picked them up.</p>
<p>Joe and Nadine wanted to stay with Murphy, but he was having a hard time surviving. Despite a lot of post-war publicity and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Cagney_83fe.html" title="James Cagney">James Cagney</a>'s help, Murphy's acting career had gone nowhere. Murphy's oldest brother Buck and his wife agreed to take in Nadine, but Murphy didn't know what to do with Joe.</p>
<p>Murphy went to James "Skipper" Cherry, a Dallas theater owner whom he had previously befriended, and sought his advice. Cherry was a member of a consortium of Texas theater owners who were part of Variety Clubs International and was involved with the Variety Clubs International Boy's Ranch, a 4,800 acre (19 km²) ranch near <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copperas_Cove%2C_Texas_6bdc.html" title="Copperas Cove, Texas">Copperas Cove</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>. Cherry arranged for the Boy's Ranch to take Joe in. Joe loved it there and Murphy was able to visit him, as well as Skipper Cherry, frequently.</p>
<p>During one of these visits, Murphy confided to Cherry that even with Cagney's help and acting lessons, he wasn't getting anywhere in Hollywood. In a 1973 interview, Cherry recalled, "He was discouraged and somewhat despondent concerning his movie career." Variety Clubs was financing a film called <i>Bad Boy</i> to help promote the organization's work with troubled children.</p>
<p>Cherry called Texas theater executive Paul Short, who was producing the film, and suggested they considered giving Murphy a significant role in the movie. Murphy looked good in the screen test, but the president of <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allied_Artists_b99b.html" title="Allied Artists">Allied Artists</a> did not want to cast someone with so little acting experience as a major character. However, by this time, Cherry, Short, and the other Texas theater owners had decided that Audie Murphy was going to play the lead or they weren't financing the film. Their money talked and Murphy was cast as the lead. He turned in such a fine performance that the Hollywood powers that be finally recognized his talent. As a direct result of this film, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Studios_23de.html" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a> signed Murphy to his first seven-year studio contract.</p>

<p>Murphy's 1949 autobiography <i>To Hell and Back</i> became a national bestseller. In this book, which Murphy wrote with the assistance of his writer friend "Specs" McClure, Murphy modestly describes some of his most heroic actions — without portraying himself as a hero. Not once does he mention any of the many decorations he received for his incredible combat exploits. Instead, he chooses to praise the skills, bravery, and dedication of the other soldiers in his platoon.</p>
<p>Murphy played himself in the 1955 <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Hell_and_Back_%28film%29_d14b.html" title="To Hell and Back (film)">Universal movie of his book</a>. The film grossed almost ten million dollars during its initial theatrical release, and at the time became Universal's biggest hit of the studio's entire 43-year history. This movie held the record as the company's highest-grossing motion picture until 1975, when it was finally surpassed by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Spielberg_f3a5.html" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s <i><a href="../../../j/a/w/Jaws_%28film%29.html" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i>. Universal gave Murphy latitude in choosing the various roles, as long as plenty of action was included. Terry Murphy, who played Joe Preston Murphy (at age 4), is in fact Murphy's oldest son (in real life, Murphy's brothers and sisters included Corinne, Charles Emmett (Buck), Vernon, June, Oneta, J.W., Richard, Eugene, Nadine, Billie, and Joseph).</p>
<p>Harold B. Simpson's 1975 comprehensive biography, <i>Audie Murphy, American Soldier</i>, covers the breadth of Murphy's life. The book emphasizes Murphy's military exploits, and includes photos, maps, and battle maneuver diagrams. Murphy's post-war career is also well-documented.</p>

<p>The tombstones of Arlington's Medal of Honor recipients are normally decorated in gold leaf, but Murphy had requested that his stone remain plain and inconspicous, as would be the case with an ordinary soldier. An unknown person maintains a small American flag next to his engraved Government-issue headstone, which reads as follows:</p>

<p>An Oak Leaf Cluster signifies a subsequent award of the same decoration.
