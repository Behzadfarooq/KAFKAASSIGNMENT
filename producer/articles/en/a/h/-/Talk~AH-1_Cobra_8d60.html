<p>I'd like to propose we change the AH-1 Cobra specs from AH-1S to AH-1W/Z. The specs for AH-1W can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/supcobra/index.html#supcobra8" class="external free" title="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/supcobra/index.html#supcobra8" rel="nofollow">http://www.army-technology.com/projects/supcobra/index.html#supcobra8</a></p>

<p>The reason for this suggestion is because the AH-1W represents a more modern model more than AH-1S.</p>
<p>-- Adeptitus 23:05, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I recommend having two models' specifications. For instance, the AH-1G and the AH-1W. This gives an idea of how the capabilities and qualities of the aircraft have changed since the original version was produced.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have added AH-1W to the specs, thought the figures need to be updated. We can change this to AH-1Z when that model is fully in service (several years). -- <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 00:53, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It soon became clear that the unarmed UH-1 troop helicopters were not able to make <b>unopposed</b> troop drops in the landing zones, but that heavy firepower would be needed to clear the Viet Cong and NVA troops out of the way first.</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Unopposed" keeps being changed to "opposed". At first glance, "opposed" seems to be correct, but it is not. I have checked the original source for this paragraph ((2004) International Air Power Review, Volume 12. AIRtime Publishing. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-880588-77-3</a>.), and it does read "unopposed". We may need to reword this sentence to make it clear what is meant. For now, I have put "unopposed" back in, as in the original source. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 04:35, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, but that is clearly a typo, if the source supports the "unopposed statement". What does the source state? What possible reason would render a helicopter unable to make unopposed landings that firepower would fix? --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 04:38, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It would be desirable for any helicopter to make an unopposed troop drop. It would be unable to do so if it were opposed, i.e. the enemy was firing at them. Firepower would clear the site, thus making it unopposed. Thus if the site had enemy gunners, the helicopter would not be able to make unopposed troop drops. I disagree that it is a typo.</dd>

<dd>If the site had enemy gunners, wouldn't that constitute an opposed drop? Okay, I see what you mean; that sentence does need to be edited.

<dd>I doubt there is enough information on the Sioux Scout out there to create its own article without violating the Wikipedia policy on original research. There is only one or two pictures on the web that I have seen over and over again in reference to the Sioux Scout. As far as a private industry endeavour, the aircraft and its associated program wasn't long-lived. I feel that, if created, it will remain a stub or start article. However, it is directly tied to Bell's development of the AH-1, and deserves credit here.

<dd>No. The Iroquois Warrier was a early-1960s Bell study based on the UH-1B with a tandem cockpit. It was a precursor to the Bell 209, but the rear cockpit was a lot higher than was used in the 209. Only mock-ups were ever made of the Iroquois Warrior. I've seen pics of it in books, and would love to find one we could use for this article. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 07:00, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not quite sure this meets the definition of a variant, either. Still, I think it needs more research if it is to be included in the variants list to establish what the designation was. My bet would be on the TAH-1S as there are also references to TH-1s that are UH-1 variants.

<dd>The TH-1G/TH-1S (sometimes refered to as the Cadillac, only deployed at Ft Rucker, AL) has a hydraulic assist on the front Cyclic (short joystick type) to give it a 3.2 to 1 ratio increase which allows the IP in the front seat to have the same mechanical leverage as the full size cyclic in the rear seat. This and some armament override switches in the front cockpit are the only real differences from the AH-1S. (Which all the newer Cobras were - AH-1S(MOD), AH-1S(PROD), AH-1S(ECAS) and AH-1S(FMC), these were later changed). Excobrapilot 15:06, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, issues I have are the claim that in 1965 the AAFSS was experiencing technical problems and that 1965 was the deadline for the AAFSS. The Source Selection Board (SSB) did not select Sikorsky and Lockheed as the winners of the Project Definition Phase until February 1965. Lockheed wasn't announced as the winner of the design competition until November 1965 and the Equipment Development contract wasn't awarded until March 1966. Comparatively, the Model 209 wasn't evaluated until late fiscal year 1965 (early autumn 1965) and wasn't awarded a production contract until April 1966. And, even though it had already flown, didn't enter theater until over a year later. There weren't technical problems as the author/editor suggests, but there was an impatience for something with more capability than a UH-1B/C and waiting for the AAFSS was going to take too long. Technical and political issues with the AH-56 began in 1967 as Lockheed attempted to adjust requirements to allow modifications to the design (reportedly increased rotor diameter) to meet performance requirements.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Additionally, the article claims, "In Vietnam, events were also advancing in favour of the Model 209. Attacks on US forces were increasing, and by the end of June 1965 there were already 50,000 US ground troops in Vietnam." Not quite sure that this makes a case. It doesn't even make the case that UH-1B/C aircraft were inadequate to the job. The shortcomings of the UH-1B/C were slow speeds because of design and gross weight, not inability to support troops.</p>
<p>The article mentions the Piasecki 16H being evaluated. Army documents<sup>1</sup> state that it was the H-16. The Piasecki website <a href="http://www.piasecki.com" class="external text" title="http://www.piasecki.com" rel="nofollow">(piasecki.com)</a> says that in 1964 the Air Force was interested in the turbine version and the Army was on board with that program. Since the Army was evaluating the CH-47 (and in fact, had test ACH-47s in theater), it is possible that it was the H-16 and not the 16H being evaluated for an interim aircraft. As it is, conflicting source documents suggest that somewhere else, another source needs to be introduced to validate one or the other.</p>

<dd>OK. Had I understood this from the beginning, I would have left the tag in. I simply misunderstood what you were asking to be verified. Anyway, we've confirmed that what is in the article is what was in the book.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the UH-1s being inadequate to do the job or not, I can see where slow speed and gross weight would hinder the abillity to support troops. The aircraft were slower than the slicks they wer escorting, which could certainly affect troops on the ground waiting for reinforcements. Low gross weight would limit the amount of weapons that could be carried, which would affect support, especially if they ran out of weapons. Small quibble that could go either way, as this is more of a matter of interporetation by various sources. Your other points definitely need confirming one way or the other. -- <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 04:26, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Piasecki PV-15 Transporter (YH-16) was a 15-ton helicopter which flew c. 1953, and was not put into production. It resembles a larger version of the YHC-1A/CH-46, and "may" be a direct ancestor. So I am inclined to think that the 16H may be correct, tho I do not know what it is either. Piasecki had sold Vertol to Boeing c. 1959, but continued to make helicopters, tho I have no info on what they were producing in 1964 that would have made an interim solution. -- <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 04:09, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I checked the Piaseki website you gave. At <a href="http://www.piasecki.com/yh-16.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.piasecki.com/yh-16.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, the first line states, <i>"In 1964, development of the H-16 was initiated in response to a U.S. Air Force requirement for a long range (1432 mi.) Rescue helicopter . . ."</i> Yet further down, it states, <i>"The first flight of the YH-16 was 23 October 1953."</i> My printed source also gives a early-50's date, so I believe the "1964" is a typo.</p>

<dd>I'm gonna have to agree with ANigg on the Argentina reference that I added as well. Like most Central/South American countries, helicopters are part of the Air Force and not the Army. The Air Force website<a href="http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/material/h_aereo.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/material/h_aereo.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> lists UH-1. The uswarplanes.net website<a href="http://www.uswarplanes.net/uh1ah1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uswarplanes.net/uh1ah1.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> shows that Chile received UH-1s, and the Argentine website also shows UH-1s in the inventory. What is likely, is that the CDI reference had misunderstood H-1 for AH-1, as it is the first H-1 one would come across alphabetically and it would fit the agenda of the article that was the reference for my addition. I think we need more than one independent reference to consider adding anything to this list of users. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorn2flie_33b4.html" title="User:Born2flie">Born2flie</a> 14:05, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He stated his reasons in the above section, tho I agree edit summaries would be helpful. Born and I agree the source for Argentinian use is somewhat questionable, given the "agenda" of the article and organization. As it's the only source we have, and given the article is 4 years old, I'm for leaving it out until we get more recent, independent confirmation. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 23:19, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The pound values are probably correct. It was most likely designed in US customary units. It appears the F data was copied and changed for the W with the metric MTOW unchanged, since the F table lists 4500 kg as well.

<dd>Oh my! I didn't realize it had gotten that big! I've gone ahead and cut it back to just the USMC. If you waat to put that list in the "More users" field in the infobox, that's fine with me. THe Lead is just supposed to be a summary, and the USMC is the primary user and developer of the type now. I'd like to see a good source on how many of the 202 AH-1Js Iran bought in the 70s are still operational, but the way everyone is caving into them politically, that's likey to be unknown for a long time. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 23:46, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
