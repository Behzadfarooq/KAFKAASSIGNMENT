<p>This article is about the Apache helicopter and its methods of deployment, the way that Israel uses the Apache can be included. However the nature of the targets themselves and their particular ideology is of no concern in this particular situation. The article is centred around the helicopter. It would be absurd to start discussing, and perhaps editorialising the nature of every target of every weapon system in the world. The SLR rifle is not described as being used by the British army against terrorist targets in NI in the 70s, the Abrams tank is not described as being put into action against the despotic and totalitarian republican guard in Iraq. As such i believe that this text</p>
<p>The Israeli Air Force uses the Apaches as a high-tech platform to perform percision strikes with guided missiles against various targets. The AH-64A attacked and destroyed dozens of Hizbullah outposts in Lebanon during the 90's, attacking in all weather conditions - day and night. During the al-Aqsa Intifada, the IAF used the Apaches to target senior Hamas figures, such as Ahmed Yasin and Adnan al-Ghoul with guided missiles.</p>

<p>The Israeli Air Force uses the Apaches as a high-tech platform to perform percision strikes with guided missiles against terrorist targets. The AH-64A attacked and destroyed dozen of Hizbullah's outposts in Lebanon during the 90's, attacking in all weather conditions - day and night. During the al-Aqsa Intifada, the IAF used the Apaches to target senior Palestinian terrorists (mainly those of Hamas, such as Ahmed Yasin or Adnan al-Ghoul) with guided missiles.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.213.227.181 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.213.227.181_eba2.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.213.227.181">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>The 2003 Iraq invasion showed the Apache vulnerable to dedicated AA vehicles in open terrain. This article appears to ignore that, attempting to make it seem more an issue of mountainous terrain, urban settings, and individual infantry with AA weapons. But the Apache appears to have failed in the very scenario it was designed for. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainhell_3ced.html" title="User:Brainhell">Brainhell</a> 05:18, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, not really. The Apache was designed to help stem a massive Soviet armored invasion of western Europe if the Cold War ever turned hot. Much like the <a href="../../../a/-/1/A-10_Thunderbolt_4a25.html" title="A-10 Thunderbolt">A-10 Thunderbolt</a>, just in helicopter form. It is, in other words, a tank buster through and through. When given that job to perform, like it was in the 1991 Gulf War, it was very capable of doing it's job. The AH-64, as well as the AH-1, were designed to be used in rugged and wooded terrain, where they could hide behind a hill, pop up (or stay behind the hill, using LOAL (lock on after launch) for their Hellfires), and destroy tanks. You see, Iraq lacks two things. One is terrain like Western Europe. Two is sufficient targets for Apaches. In short, no. It didn't fail the job it was designed for. Simply because it isn't doing the job it was designed for. (<a href="../../../u/s/m/User%7EUSMA_1671.html" title="User:USMA">USMA2010</a> 18:14, 19 June 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<li>I can't think of any aircraft that isn't vulnerable to any dedicated Air Defense system. That would be like saying that the <a href="../../../b/-/1/B-17_Flying_Fortress_15c9.html" title="B-17 Flying Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortress</a> was shown to be vulnerable to <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> fighters and German AAA in <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWII_688e.html" title="WWII">WWII</a>. The problem is that armoring aircraft to sufficiently withstand air defense weapons would actually negate their mobility, because they would weigh too much. Aircraft manufacturers do what they can within the design limits; make redundant systems, shield critical locations as much as possible without sacrificing too much power for weight, and create systems that can "absorb" battle damage to a certain extent. It is up to the leaders and the aircrews to employ the aircraft in such a way as to maximize its strengths and minimize its weaknesses. The 2003 Iraq invasion showed that the AH-64 was vulnerable to poor planning, or at the very least, poor tactics in the environment encountered. Not a single attack helicopter in the world could have completed the missions in question, with the same errors made, without sustaining similar damage/losses. The issue wasn't with the AH-64 helicopter. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorn2flie_33b4.html" title="User:Born2flie">Born2flie</a> 18:41, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Vulnerable?: The Apache is weapons platform that is meant strike outside of opposing AAA, and enemy radar. in 2003, there had been losses of the Apache to small arms and AAA; however, the support role that the helicopter was playing was not the intended role of this plaform.</p>
<p>And don't forget that even though this platform has its defensive short commings, the Apache was responsible for taking out all iraqi communications bunkers and radar stations in the first Gulf war, enabling the Allied powers to have complete air supremecy. [unsigned]</p>

I recommend that it stay as an "Apache" and that all the Longbow fans not have a cow that it doesn't specifically say "Longbow", just to put an end to pointless edit wars over a silly caption.

<dd>Longbow is the nickname for the AH-64D Apache, the radar (FCR) is referred to as the "Longbow radar" because it is <i>on</i> the Longbow helicopter. Longbow is always in reference to the helicopter, although I will agree that the name is descriptive of the FCR being <i>on</i> the aircraft.<a href="http://www.boeing.com/rotorcraft/military/ah64d/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boeing.com/rotorcraft/military/ah64d/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> However, within the U.S. Army (the primary user), it is almost always referred to as Longbow with or without the FCR installed; "Longbow" becoming the moniker preferred to describe the AH-64D airframe by the crews and mechanics to distinguish it from the AH-64A Apache. There is no question if you ask an AH-64D pilot what aircraft he flies and he responds, "Longbow." --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorn2flie_33b4.html" title="User:Born2flie">Born2flie</a> 01:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In its current form the article starts off with a brief history of the AH-64's development, and then it goes straight to a discussion on the differences between the AH-64A and AH-64D models, followed by a section about the AH-64's performance in the Iraq war. Apart from a set of statistics at the end of the article, there's very little about the helicopter itself. I have added a short paragraph of general information but I am not Greg Goebel, so it is very skimpy.</p>

An audience of people who are not helicopter enthusiasts would not know this fact. I can think of a few things that the article could cover. The famous helmet-mounted gunsight; the extent of its armour cover; its original intended role; the reliability and durability of its engines; its general performance; its performance compared to the Russian Hind; the 30mm chain gun; its stubby wings - do they provide lift?; its typical combat loadouts in theory and in practice; the use of AIM-9 Sidewinders; the avionics; lots of things.

<p>I agree. It seems like this article has a few technical facts and a laundry list of shortcomings as listed by CNN Headline News in Iraq. While the AH-64 wasn't <i>built</i> for urban battle, I think it's one of the best platforms we have going if you need to bring in some quick, heavy suppresion fire with an ability to loiter and risk taking some hits. I would hate for anyone to read this article and think that the Apache is anything less than what it is, which is, frankly, the best of the best. If we didn't have platforms like the Apache, I think you'd be reading about a lot more shot down Cobras and Blackhawks. --128.222.37.20 18:45, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
