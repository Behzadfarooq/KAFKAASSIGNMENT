<p>There seems to be little doubt that the <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutsches_Ahnenerbe_05cf.html" title="Deutsches Ahnenerbe">Deutsches Ahnenerbe</a> and SS Ahnenerbe existed, and that they were interested in the occult. But most of this article in its current form seems to take this to fanciful lengths -- can this be backed up with cites?

<dd>Hi, I remember seeing a 1 hour special on this on PBS. Also, here is a German encyclopedia about Nazi history: <a href="http://lexikon.idgr.de/a/a_h/ahnenerbe/ahnenerbe.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://lexikon.idgr.de/a/a_h/ahnenerbe/ahnenerbe.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. So, this is real for sure. But I can not check all the details. <a href="../../../a/w/o/User%7EAwolf002_16a4.html" title="User:Awolf002">Awolf002</a> 00:10, 21 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, that was the Michael Wood Channel 4 documentary. It seems the most-quoted references are</p>

<p>but they are not that much use to me as a) I haven't got them b) I have only a very basic knowledge of German. Are there any proficient German-speakers here with access to these books? -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 10:26, 21 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mainly restricted to Eastern Europe were the activities of the research council "Forschungs- und Lehrgemeinschaft Das Ahnenerbe", also subordinated to the SS. The academic members of the Ahnenerbe chiefly confiscated archaeological collections and specialist literature but also carried out excavations in occupied territories. Material of the Ahnenerbe can be found in record group NS21 "Ahnenerbe" in the Bundesarchiv Koblenz as well as in the record group Research Ahnenerbe in the Bundesarchiv Außenstelle Berlin-Zehlendorf. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> 06:33, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"When Germany overran the Caucasus in early 1942, they stationed 10,000 troops on Mount Elbrus. Three mountaineers believed to be from the Ahnenerbe held a ceremony in which they planted the Nazi flag at the peak, referring to it as a 'sacred Aryan mountain'."</p>
<p>I've a photo to hand of a group of mountaineers (at least 15) heading up a snowy slope, marked as</p>

<dd><i>In 1942, a combined group of men from two Gebirgs divisions conquered Mount Elbrus in Russia. This photograph shows the party moving off at the start of the operation, carrying the unit flags which they placed in the snow of Elbrus's summit; Adolf Hitler described it as the 'most pointless' operation in the war.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>There's a second photograph showing two flags at the summit; one is the same as in the Tibet photo, and the other appears to be a brigade flag; the two divisions appear to have been the 1st and 4th Gebirgs, judging by where they were. Could this be the origin of the "three mountaineers believed to be from the Ahnenerbe"? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 14:16, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow, sounds intriguing - I'd certainly love a scan of those photographs if you're able (or even photographing them with a digital camera). As per sources, I'm afraid I'm horrible at referencing, and don't remember where exactly that information came from. Looking online I find reference to</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>On Hitler’s order, Nazi Mountain Division Edelweiss was trying to hoist their symbols on Mount Elbrus</i></p>
<p><i>Units of the 1st motorized German division “Edelweiss” captured the southern slopes of Elbrus, the highest peak of the Big Caucasian Ridge...And on August 21st, 1942 they hoisted a Nazi flag on Elbrus peaks.</i></p>
<p><i>1942 August 23 A swastika banner is said to have been planted atop Mount Elbrus in the Caucasus Mountains by a special SS detachment. The flag they planted was allegedly blessed according to the secret, mystical rites of the SS inner circle.</i> (note the August 21/23 difference)</p>
<p><i>in 1942, Hitler, because of his occult ideas about Asia &amp; Tibet, was excited to plant a Nazi flag on the highest peak of the Caucasian mountains, Mt. Elbrus, at the specific time of 11 a.m.</i> (From a conspiracy theory website, though...and everything I've heard would suggest you're correct about Hitler's summary, not this website. People like to assume that because Himmler was wildly esoteric, therefore by extrapolation they can say Hitler was as well)</p>
<p>and finally, from <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shirer_2d0c.html" title="William Shirer">William Shirer</a>, one of the more definitive sources on the Reich, we have <i>German troops had reached the Volga just north of Stalingrad on August 23. Two days before the swastika had been hoisted on Mount Elbrus, the highest peak in the Caucasus Mountains.</i></p>
<p>So I'm thinking you're probably right, and they were not Ahnenerbe mountaineers, though it's confusing that it gets varyingly labeled "a special SS detachment", and such. There's still at least the suggestion of the Ahnenerbe organizing the flag-planting, but that it was likely just SS troops (and apparently more than a small number) who did the actual planting. Out of interest, do you happen to have a date/source for the cutline below the photo? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherurcij_4567.html" title="User talk:Sherurcij">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 14:34, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll try and get scans later, but there were no specific dates. I <i>have</i> read about it elsewhere, possibly in Shirer - but I certainly remember the Hitler quote from somewhere else; I'll have a quick flick through other sources and see if anything turns up. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 16:07, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These two scans are of pages from the <i>German Army Handbook 1939-1945</i> by James Lucas, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0753703335</a>. Image:Elbrus-p47.png and Image:Elbrus-p48.png (large files, feel free to scale them down). The images themselves <i>may</i> be out of copyright, but I dunno; I'll delete these scans in a week or so, since they're only of passing interest and are a bit iffy for fair-use, unless you feel it's essential to hang on to them.</dd>
<dd>It's probably worth nothing that these <i>aren't</i> described as SS units; indeed, as far as I can tell no SS Gebirgsjager units were active in this end of Russia at the time. They seem to have been regular mountain troops, with no SS connection, though perhaps if you look in detail you might find an attatched SS battalion somewhere. One comment I vaguely remember referred to them simply as sport-mountaineers, who had presumably ended up in a Gebirgs division through being especially suited, taking a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...</dd>
<dd>My guess is a bit like yours - it was a slightly weird thing for the Germans to do, so people assume There Must Have Been Complex Reasons. But, then, a lot of people would probably read the paperwork for a routine night-interceptor flight over Hamburg in 1944 and decide that it must have been to chase UFOs on direct order from Himmler's astrologer... <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 17:05, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well it's a good guess we could use {{GermanGov}} as a license for the images, I thought it was interesting that Gebirgsjager Edelweiss image was <a href="http://bundeswehr.kai-schoetteldreier.de/gebirgsjager/edelweiss.jpg" class="external free" title="http://bundeswehr.kai-schoetteldreier.de/gebirgsjager/edelweiss.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bundeswehr.kai-schoetteldreier.de/gebirgsjager/edelweiss.jpg</a> , not the star pennant in the photographs, yet another mystery I suppose.</dd>

Gebirgs Division, Mt. Elbrus, Caucasus 1942</i>, and the Edelweiss Division appears to have been the 6th, so I assume the "two divisions" mentioned would be the 1st and 6th? But battlefront.co.nz says that <i>4. Gebirgsdivision - On 21 August 1942, troops from this division stood on the peak of the 5,633 metre high Mount Elbrus in the Caucasus, one of the furthest penetrations of the German advance.</i></dd>
<dd>Frustratingly, I also found a reference saying <i>August 22, 1942 Meanwhile, elements of the 1st Gebirgsjager (Mountain) Division, raise a German flag on the peak of Mt. Elbrus, the highest point in the Caucasus Mountains.</i>, so that now gives a date of Aug 21, 22 and 23 as the possible dates.</dd>
<dd>In your one image, it's difficult to tell, but it looks like five of the figures are helmeted, so I'd discard the idea of them being just "sport mountaineers"</dd>

<p>Ah, think I spotted my own error, I assumed the "Edelweiss" referred to the the Gebirgsjager Edelweiss, although it actually references a Motorized Edelweiss, so perhaps that was a seperate support group.

<p>Okay, I have a law exam to study for, but since you mentioned it, I've been obsessive...so I finally found this thread, at the fairly reputable axishistory.com <a href="http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=28721&amp;highlight=elbrus" class="external free" title="http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=28721&amp;highlight=elbrus" rel="nofollow">http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=28721&amp;highlight=elbrus</a> <i>On 21 August 1942, a joint 23-man team from 1st and 4th Mountain Divisions (General der Gebirgstruppe Rudolf Konrad’s XXXXIX Mountain Army Corps), led by Hauptmann Heinz Groth and Hauptmann Max Gämmerler from each division respectively, scaled the 5,633-meter-high Mount Elbrus, the highest mountain in the Caucasus, and planted the Reich War Flag at the summit. Although an impressive feat, Hitler seemed to view the event as mere grandstanding</i></p>
<p>There's another summary however <i>18 Germans made the ascent on the mountain (14 from the 1st Mtn Div &amp; 4 from the 4th Mtn Div) and Oberfeldwebel Kümmerle planted the German battle flag, whilst the standards of both the 1st &amp; 4th Mtn Divisions were planted alongside on August 21st 1942.</i> which differs on which officer led the expedition, and whether it was an 18 or 23 man team <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherurcij_4567.html" title="User talk:Sherurcij">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 18:30, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

However, we also get the information <i>here's a pic in Signal 20/1942 of Oberleutnant Spindler during climb and caption says that he was in charge.However there's a lively chapter of that climb in Carell's Hitler Moves East and it says that Hauptmann Groth of 4.Gebirgs was in command</i>, then says <i>16 men from 4th Division under Hauptmann Groth , and 5 men from the 1st Division under Hauptmann Gämmerler</i></p>

<dd>In summary though, there does appear to be very little evidence (at least online) that the Ahnenerbe sponsored the expedition in any way <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherurcij_4567.html" title="User talk:Sherurcij">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 18:39, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The book had a short section on flags; a black-coloured-black triangular flag was of a brigade or divisional commander, IIRC, with the colour representing division type.</dd>
<dd>The 1st and 4th were both operating in the Caucasus, and were likely to have been the relevant units. No other gebirgs divisions, SS or regular, were operating in the area at the time so far as I can tell (they were mostly in Norway). I suspect the guess as to the 6th came from the flag looking like it had a flower on it - it's a bit wobbly in outline, like petals - but note that the <a href="http://www.feldgrau.com/GebDiv.php?ID=1" class="external text" title="http://www.feldgrau.com/GebDiv.php?ID=1" rel="nofollow">emblem of the 1st</a> was almost identical to <a href="http://www.feldgrau.com/GebDiv.php?ID=6" class="external text" title="http://www.feldgrau.com/GebDiv.php?ID=6" rel="nofollow">that of the 6th</a>. The history section of the <a href="http://www.feldgrau.com/1hg.html" class="external text" title="http://www.feldgrau.com/1hg.html" rel="nofollow">article on the 1st</a> is worth reading, in fact; it mentions fighting in the Elbrus area.
<dl>
<dd>"The second ad-hoc formation of the 1. and 4.Gebirgs under Le Suire fought in the highest positions held by any unit in all of German military history when the 4300 meter heights of Mt. Elbrus in the deep Caucasus region was held by the Gebirgsjäger against repeated Soviet attacks and the harsh high alpine elements."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>My reference to sport climbers, incidentally, was that IIRC the discussion I read suggested the instigators had been recreational mountain climbers before the war, conscripted, found themselves next to the highest mountain any of them was likely to see, and decided to take the opportunity to go off for a few days. After all, they had all this alpine equipment, they were being paid to be out there, there was a vaguely respectable military excuse for doing it...</dd>
<dd>On the whole, I think it's worth cutting out, as not an Ahnenerbe operation - maybe a short entry under the mountain article?

<dd>Looking at the Tibet expedition, I notice the summit was the Reichs War Flag, not the "normal" Nazi flag. It seems a bit odd that a 1938 SS/civilian expedition would put that up - I wonder if this is a misattributed Elbrus photo?</dd>
<dd>As for the others... well, yeah, Pravda these days manages to be an even less reliable source than it was when it was the mouthpiece of the Kremlin, which is saying something - if they announced the sky was blue, I'd double-check.

I've had a lot on my plate lately, but once I'm done with the revision of this article I can create that article if that sounds good.</li>

<li>Also, I think the German soldiers part should probably be removed. Ukraine said the skeletons were from German soldiers, and the Ahnenerbe would have had absolutely no reason to be doing experimets on German soldiers 1)outside of Germany and 2) in Crimea at the time - while Germany was occuping Ukraine the Wehrmacht was sieging Sevastopol, Stalingrad and Leningrad; the tide of the war was beginning to turn, and Hitler needed all the men he could get to fight. The unlikelihood of the Ahnenerbe carrying out experiments on Germans in the Ukraine combined with Pravda's track record and the lack of real substance in this part of the article makes me think it should be removed. Sorry if I want to cut too much, but I want to trim the fat in hopes of someday possibly getting this article featured.</li>

<p>I finished my Tibet writing today and moved around some pictures to make it look better. I'm going to be away from an internet hookup until Sunday night, but in the meantime I plan to work on articles for the Middleast expedition and probably Iceland if I have time since there's a lot to write about the middleast. Depending on what time I get back Sunday night I'll probably upload some stuff and put some more work into this article then.

<dd>I'm reinserting the copyedits, just as rewrite of the information since we strive to be an encyclopaedia, not a book&#160;:) By the way, just a question, you mention that they feared internment if caught in the British-controlled Yarlung Valley in Summer 1939, but earlier said that the British had never been allowed into the region. Any clarification possible? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherurcij_4567.html" title="User talk:Sherurcij">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Terrorism_01a1.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Terrorism">Terrorist Wikiproject</a>)</sup> 23:47, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If it's unclear it can be rewritten: <i>India</i> was a British colony, but the place the British weren't allowed in was a remote area in <i>Tibet</i> which was not part of Britian's Indian colony - as far as I know Britain had no reason to take over Tibet so they therefore didn't, but Tibet liked to appease Britain and normally did what the British wanted to avoid any problems. That may make it seem like they were actually under British rule in the area. Furthermore, if the team was in the region when WW2 started, Britain probably would've had the Tibetan military take the team captive and hand them over to British authorities.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the only plausible way to get back to Germany was to fly out of India or go home by boat. The team had a hair-brained idea to get back to Germany largely by foot or something like that, but either that or going through war-zone China were the only alternatives to leaving through British-India.</dd>

<p>I've had that world ice theory section on my mind for awhile, so here's what I've got about the topic to say: 1)there already is another wikipage on it, 2)the part on here is only three sentences long, and 3)the section on here doesn't cite a source <i>and</i> I googled hans scultetus and found four webpages talking about him and the ahnenerbe department he supposedly headed - two of those got their information straight from wikipedia, one didn't seem very credible, and the fourth simply cited a book at the end of the page (<i>The Occult Roots of Nazism</i>). Therefore I plan on taking this section out unless someone gives me a reason not to before I'm done with my rewrite of this article. If for no other reason, as far as I know wikipolicy is that if something does not cite a reference it is fair game for being deleted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today I inserted the Bolivia section of the article, and in it I made sure to talk about the Welteislehre, <b>so,</b> I got rid of the section in the article now.

<li>The IP address 128.255.18.XXX is me when I'm using an engineering computer, so any changes made by it are comming from me.</li>

<li>The "involvement of german soldiers" title is misleading and since it happened in 2002 it can easily be put under the post-ww2 section to better organize the article.</li>
<li>I've fiished all my expedition and planned expetion entries, but I'm still going to add to other parts of the article: I'm going to revise the medical experiments section with a lot of new information as well as augment the information on the trials of members of the Ahnenerbe. I'm not 100% sure I'll keep this format, but I'll do a few more people and see how it looks. I'm also going to add to the "other ahnenerbe activities" section with entries on the Thor's hammer project (when himmler wanted to make a super weapon), the skeleton collection of Hirt and Beger, and put information back in about the relocation of the ahnenerbe headquarters near the end of the war.</li>
<li>Sherurcij - in general I like your tweaking - I write a lot when I have something to say and in general I think you do a good job of condensing it without changing the information it conveys.

<p>The correct translation of "Forschungs- und Lehrgemeinschaft <b>das</b> Ahnenerbe e.V." is "Research and Teaching Community <b>The</b> Ancestral Heritage (registered association)" not "<b>of</b>". The german translation of "Research and Teaching Community <b>of</b> Ancestral Heritage" would be "Forschungs- und Lehrgemeinschaft <b>des</b> Ahnenerbe<b>s</b>" or "Forschungs- und Lehrgemeinschaft <b>vom</b> Ahnenerbe". "Forschungs- und Lehrgemeinschaft <b>das</b> Ahnenerbe e.V." sounds a little bit unusual even in german but it's no genitiv. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.133.55.72_80ed.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.133.55.72">84.133.55.72</a> (talk) 22:15, 13 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p><br />
The German Wikipedia entry says its"Forschungsgemeinschaft Deutsches Ahnenerbe e.V." so neither "des" nor "das" I will change the entry to that. Tash 4/4/200712.44.31.196 16:08, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>While important information to preserve on WP, is it clearly tied to the Ahnenerbe? Perhaps it should just have its own page? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherurcij_4567.html" title="User talk:Sherurcij">Speaker for the Dead</a>)</sup> 22:27, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
