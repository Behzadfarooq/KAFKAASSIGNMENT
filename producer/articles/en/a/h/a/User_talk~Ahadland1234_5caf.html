<p>Thanks for uploading Image:Titanic photo.jpg. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>

<p>Hi, I notice that you made some major changes to article on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, most of which was finding citations, which is great. However, in a couple of places you removed sizeable chunks of text, in particular the section dealing with the functionalism / intentionalism debate. I assume you did this because those sections were uncited (it would help if you provided <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEdit_summary_ca7e.html" title="Help:Edit summary">edit summaries</a>, saying why you are making a particular edit) but it is not generally a good idea to remove big sections without discussion on the talk page first. This is doubly true for sensitive subjects like the Holocaust. For this reason I have undone some of your edits, replacing the sections on children, functionalism / intentionalism, Klaus Barbie and ‎Aribert Heim. I've added {{fact}} tags to the latter two. Cheers, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESquiddy_b0de.html" title="User talk:Squiddy"><small>(squirt ink?)</small></a> 16:22, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry I didnt see the need for functionalism and intentionalism to be there, and if it was it should be much smaller, and i deleted the children thing because i wrote it first and worded it badly, i was re-wording it and then gonna put it in with sources that could be cited</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I sort of agree that the length of the functionalism and intentionalism section is excessive, since it's longer than the <a href="../../../f/u/n/Functionalism_versus_intentionalism.html" title="Functionalism versus intentionalism">Functionalism versus intentionalism</a> article, but still probably best to bring it to the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Holocaust_b53c.html" title="Talk:The Holocaust">article talk page</a> first. Something that long is likely to have been worked on by many editors over a period of time. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESquiddy_b0de.html" title="User talk:Squiddy"><small>(squirt ink?)</small></a> 10:19, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again, I'm not sure what's going wrong, but your 'cite web' templates seem to be malformed; They come out as:</p>

<p>Hi and thanks for creating the POTD for February 24. However, this image isn't going to be scheduled until much later. The PsOTD are selected from the Featured Pictures and are scheduled in order of promotion (the order is preserved on <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_pictures_thumbs_67d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured pictures thumbs">Wikipedia:Featured pictures thumbs</a>). You happened to come upon it in a weird point. The last "new" one in order was done on February 21 (trench warfare). Then I scheduled a rerun on the 22nd (we do 2 old ones a week to make sure we don't run out), then on the 23rd there's a bird which should have come earlier, but I delayed that one because we just had another House Sparrow on January 21. Thus, the one that's supposed to go on the 24th is the chipmunk picture. The Titanic pic is 61 places behind it, which is almost three months away.

<dd>Incisive means direct, not necessarily short. Some subject require extensive coverage to fully document them. If you are going to make major changes to an article, especially one as controversial as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, you need to discuss it first on the talk page. As noted above, the sub-articles you created have a number of problems: the references are broken, they don't cover just the subjects you have titled them for and by pushing some information out of the main article you may introduce bias into the coverage of the subject. For these reasons it is very important that you discuss your proposed changes. As you can see, you assumption that "people would have approved" isn't a good one in this case.

<p>...regarding Nazi-era photos of Jews being humiliated, have already been provided <a href="../../../r/d/2F/WP%7ERD_H_97dd.html" title="WP:RD/H">there</a> by myself and others. Have you followed up by reading the material suggested to you, before repeating your queries? The rapid posting of <a href="../../../d/e/b/User_talk%7EDeborahjay_0745.html#Question_about_the_Question_of_Jews_being_humiliated_on_the_reference_desk" title="User talk:Deborahjay">your query on my User talk page</a> indicates to me that you haven't.</p>
<p>More to the point, perhaps, are the nature of your assertions and speculations about the photographed spectators' motives and behaviors, and your stated difficulty in understanding such. These seem to me quite inconsistent with the information you've provided about yourself on your recently created <a href="../../../a/h/a/User%7EAhadland1234_72d6.html" title="User:Ahadland1234">User page</a>, particularly your being an <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazim.html" title="Ashkenazim">Ashkenazic Jewish</a> young adult residing in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">an English-speaking Western country</a>, a <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa.html" title="Mensa">Mensa</a> member familiar with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary.html" title="Contemporary">contemporary</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television programs</a>, etc. You evidently have Internet access and are literate, so any gaps in your education regarding knowledge of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_behavior.html" title="Human behavior">human behavior</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">society</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>, etc. can certainly be remedied.</p>
<p>If your questions are rhetorical, I would again refer you to factual sources already provided. If you're looking for discussion: while the proper venue in Wikipedia would indeed be on the User talk pages, kindly understand that I myself am not available to engage in such, beyond my replies on the Reference desk. <i>-- Thank you, <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeborahjay_6670.html" title="User:Deborahjay">Deborahjay</a> 00:45, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Im sorry its just that the topic really ticks me off, and I want to understand why people accepted what was happening, because Im Jewish, and naturally would like to understand why my people are being made to suffer --<a href="../../../a/h/a/User%7EAhadland1234_72d6.html" title="User:Ahadland1234">User:Ahadland1234</a> 11:56, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I read your questions: you seek to understand (a) why non-Jews (e.g. the onlookers in the photos) "accepted" [as you purport, which I contend can't be known from the photos) what was happening, and (b) why Jews (e.g. inhabitants of <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghetto.html" title="Ghetto">ghettos</a> being liquidated, or sent on transports to <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_extermination_camp.html" title="Nazi extermination camp">extermination camps</a>) acquiesced to what was being done to them. You will find the answers by reading the Wikipedia pages on these and related topics (accessible by internal links), along with the many books, both fiction and nonfiction, recommended to you in response to your queries on the Reference desk. Numerous users here have offered you helpful guidance and significant ideas; now I believe it's time for you to follow through by studying and learning. You may also find it valuable to talk with people in your community, such as a <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">rabbi</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a> <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teacher.html" title="Teacher">teacher</a>, or in Internet forums on these topics. <i>-- Good luck, <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeborahjay_6670.html" title="User:Deborahjay">Deborahjay</a> 12:41, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>On the other pictures i put up there are clearly people forming a ring, and smiling, this is, in my view, people supporting the events. And you misinterpreted my second question, I wondered why non-ghetto inhabitants didn't wonder why the ghettos had suddenly become quiet. Wouldnt it strike them as strange that one minute the ghetto's are crowded and full of hustle and bustle, and the next they are deathly silent? I know that that sort of occurrence would perplex me --<a href="../../../a/h/a/User%7EAhadland1234_72d6.html" title="User:Ahadland1234">User:Ahadland1234</a> 14:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think it would be fair to say that the ghettos' neighbors — people who had lived for years under Nazi occupation during the world war — would not be so perplexed as you seem to suppose. If you don't understand this yet, evidently your previous education has failed to provide you some very basic understanding of <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warfare.html" title="Warfare">warfare</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Europe_0f59.html" title="History of Europe">European history</a>. Fortunately, a great deal of information is available to remedy this. Your lack of comprehension is likely to be dispelled when you go read about <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWII_688e.html" title="WWII">WWII</a> as you have been repeatedly told. As for the smiling bystanders, let's think of some possibilities besides those that have <i>already been raised in previous, lengthy discussion</i>:
<ul>
<li>The picture was staged</li>
<li>The people are Nazi sympathizers</li>
<li>They are experiencing <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schadenfreude.html" title="Schadenfreude">schadenfreude</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I think the time has come to end this discussion, as I really have nothing more to add. Perhaps you should contact your local <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa.html" title="Mensa">Mensa</a> chapter for further academic guidance should you require any.<i>-- Hope this helps, <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeborahjay_6670.html" title="User:Deborahjay">Deborahjay</a> 15:08, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Forgive me but this script reads like you think I'm a moron, which I am not. Our history lessons didn't devote much time as to why people who lived near the ghetto's weren't shocked by them being liquidated, subsequently, you havent answered my question either regarding that. I am only sixteen and do not understand why citizens would just watch while people are being shot by the Einsatzgruppen, or persecuted. My question is simple, why do people let this sadism occur. And thus far, I've received only a limited number of adequate reponses. As to why the people in the pictures are smiling what you have said makes sense, but how would you stage something like that, and if it were staged that shows that Nazi policy had little widespread support, so the photographs wouldn't have been used. Other than that your answer is very nice. --<a href="../../../a/h/a/User%7EAhadland1234_72d6.html" title="User:Ahadland1234">User:Ahadland1234</a> 17:04, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all: staging photos with costumed actors is easy enough, and remember that the mass media in WWII-era Europe was by no means as developed as today's, and was controlled besides. By the time the ghettos were liquidated (1941 –1944), the Nazis' murderous practices aimed at civilian populations were familiar and hard to combat, resistance (incl. <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_partisans.html" title="Jewish partisans">partisan</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_Secret_State_e351.html" title="Polish Secret State">underground</a>) movements being the exception. I would say overall: simple (and fair) questions of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethics</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_nature.html" title="Human nature">human nature</a> have long occupied far greater minds than mine, and with no conclusive (or brief) answers. Please accept my apology for the exasperated tone you noted in my later remarks, and this explanation: I am deeply concerned at the prospect that an intelligent young person educated in a Western democracy nowadays would have such difficulty accepting the fact (as I and many see it, though not the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust deniers</a>) of apparent or actual failure to oppose the Nazis during their ascent and regime. Or perhaps you are expressing a form of moral outrage? We may consider <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warfare.html" title="Warfare">warfare</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> to be two major failures of the human race to behave humanely: the victimization of the weak by the stronger, brutalizes and dehumanizes both. For all the reasons and explanations given for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a>, none seem to help neutralize, let alone eradicate it. Studying the lessons of the Holocaust will confront you with untold horrors and terrors, but you will learn much. The difficult part is finding how to make a difference for good, but I can assure you that this is sorely needed, and worthwhile. For what it's worth, I think you're asking the right questions; I wish more people would. <i>-- Yours truly, <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeborahjay_6670.html" title="User:Deborahjay">Deborahjay</a> 21:22, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>Thats fine. I can see you've been editing since August 12, 2006, so even though you have a majority of wiki-space edits, I trust you know the quintessential basics of editing. With this in mind, do you know the basics of images? If not I'd suggest we start there. Otherwise, I'd suggest we start with Wikipedia process. Are you interested in learning about process? If not, do you JUST want to edit articles, or what? Just tell me about this, and then I can better understand what it is that we should start with.
