<p>Given that there are two shabti's in existance, "one in one of which resides in the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the other in the Khartoum Museum", I content that this is replacable and so fails to meet standard wikipedia criteria for fair use images <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 15:43, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>NB, per discussion in the Ahmose I article, I am obviously not suggesting the shabti itself be replaced. The shabti is obviously not copyrighted as this image itself notes (it was created several thousand years ago) and as far as I can tell, &lt;delthere are no limitations on taking photographs in either museum <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 16:18, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><del>No offense, but I <i>strongly object</i> to that contention. After reading the fair use requirements, I find the following.<br />
* The image stands on strong legal footing as fair use. There is nothing illegal about use of the image.<br />
* The image and all similar ones which are widely dispersed so as to get one's hands on them are copyrighted by the British Museum, therefore it is impossible to replace it with another preexisting image.<br />
* While the regulations for fair use on wikipedia say that in the case that the image can be rephotographed, that should be done, however I quote two of the following clauses on that same rule page,"but is also, in essence, not <i>reasonably</i> repeatable" and "If you see an image tagged as fair use that would appear to be <i>quite easy</i> to replace with a free alternative, add {{fairusereplace}} to the image description page."<br />
It is not quite easy or reasonable to just waltz into the british museum and take such a picture. The waltzing part on land would take about five months for me, followed by one heck of a swim. I think it perfectly reasonable to <i>prefer</i> a free image. I think it absurd to <i>demand</i> one given the amount of work and personal cost it would entail. If <i>and only if</i> wikipedia had a page dedicated to listing requested fair use -&gt; free image replacements for obscure images in all odd corners of the world, and therein locals could go get the requested images, I would agree with listing this image there <i>and only there.</i> However, the demand that one of us fly to britain by the 14th of january or this image will be deleted is absurd. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 20:35, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</del>

<dd>No offense, but you seem to have completely missed the point. The first criterian has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with our legal requirements. We only implement it because we believe free is better then fair use and we believe allowing fair use when it's resonable possible for a wikipedian to find or create an image that is free is a bad thing because it discourages users from taking the time to create free images. No one is saying you have to create the image by the 14th. We believe it's better to have no image then a fair use image when it's resonably possible to create or find a free image. The fact of the matter is, that given the shabti is located in a public museum Brooklyn which is part of NYC, a city of over 8 million people according to wikipedia, it is rather likely that someone can create an image. Perhaps it will take 1 month, perhaps it will create a year. It doesn't matter. If you disagree with the first criterion, well sorry this is not the time or place to discuss that. Until our policy changes, we still should obey it. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 13:13, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The tag you put on is <i>not</i> a "please find somthing better" tag. It explicitly read "Please replace or this will be deleted by the 14th of january". Free is good, I said that. However it is beyond reasonable to request that someone cross the globe to replace it within a week. I am afraid you also missed the point. If the tag guerenteed deletion (as it did), and if the image was not a flagrantly illegal image (which it was not) and if it is beyond absurd to expect that the image be replaced (which it may or may not be; depending on if markh can get one) then the request for a replaced image causes more harm than good. Free is better, but it doesn't mean delete the fair use if a free image can't be obtained, and that is exactly what that tag would have done.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 17:57, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While I've withdrawn my support, I think you've seriously misunderstood the policy. The policy requires that when photos are resonably replacable, they're not usable as fair use at wikipedia. They should therefore be deleted. If we don't come up with a photo for a month or year tough. While opinions vary on the reason for the policy, the policy is quiet clear. (I personally believe the policy is good because it encourages people to come up with free images) As I've stated above and as you will find out if you read, this has absolutely nothing to do with legal issues or anything of that sort. It's our policy and until and unless it's changed, many people think we should stick with it. The tag doesn't say the image needs to be replacable. it says it CAN be replacaed and therefore should be deleted if it isn't <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 13:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You might want to take a look at the proposed guideline <a href="../../../r/e/p/Wikipedia%7EReplaceability_of_fair-use_images_e12d.html" title="Wikipedia:Replaceability of fair-use images">Wikipedia:Replaceability of fair-use images</a>. <del>Under it, I think this clearly would be considered replacable and IMHO any sane definition of replacable would include a photograph of an object located in a public museum in Brooklyn <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 13:21, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</del></dd>
<dd>I temporarily withdraw my support for the deletion and choose to remain neutral while I consider the matter. According to the FAQ <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/faq.php#painting" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/faq.php#painting" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>
<ul>
<li>Photography is allowed in the Museum so long as the images are taken using existing light only (no flash) and are for personal, non-commercial use. Photography is often restricted in special exhibition galleries; please consult with the Visitor Center upon arrival.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As such, replacing this image with one from Brooklyn probably wouldn't solve the problem. One from Khartoum may or may not solve the problem <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 13:57, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've had the chance to look over the legal guidelines page. They are not in and of themselves onerous, but nevertheless this is a case of having to jump over a number of special flaming hoops in order to replace an image which would have certinly fallen under the old fair-use requirement. While this image certainly is replaceable -- just about any image of an extant artifact is -- it is hard to underscore how hard it is in this case. There are only two known likenesses (apart from the mummy head, which is also in dispute as to whether it is really him) of Ahmose I, and they are located geographically in places that are far from where Thanatosimii and I reside. The image in question is a scan from an exhibition at which I was <i>not allowed</i> to take pictures of the exhibits, and I also do not know whether this object is necessarily on regular display at the Brooklyn Museum (it is a rare likeness of the man, but shabtis in general are not, as common as can be really). When the image was scanned the fair-use criterion at the time appeared to be valid, and the image quality deliberately downgraded from the original. Am more concerned that as some museums are now limiting the use of even non-flash photography (most notably the Cario Museum) getting access to replacement for fair use images will become increasingly limited. I would ask for some form of flexibility in this particular case (though I hope Marhk can come up with a legitimate free use version, assuming the version the British Museum has is also on display -- when I was there last I don't remember seeing it).

<dd>As no one else came out in support and I've also withdrawn my support, I removed the request and provided an explaination. However I largely disagree with you reasoning. The fact is, the policy requires that we only allow fair use images when the image is not resonably replacable. It's generally agreed with if the image is of something or someone in a public place with easy access, that's resonably replacable. As I've said before, regardless of whether or not you or anyone else interested in this subject have easy access to the place is IMHO largely irrelevant. Brooklyn has over 4 million people as I noted somewhere and New York overall 8 million from memory. This is a lot of people and any one of these people could provide us a photo were it not for the restrictions. We don't allow fair use images of people and places even though people are often a lot harder to get access to and some of these places are in areas with a far smaller population. Indeed, the fact there are two shabti's (and perhaps a photo? in the British museum) is unique and just makes this easier. There is usually only one place/item and one person so only one set of people really have a chance to come up with a photo. In this case, it's two or three sets of people. While it may be more likely say for a person to have a photo of a distincitve landmark then of a shabti in a museum, my understanding and believe is that under the policy we don't expect people will already have a photo but that people can resonably go out and take a photo. The final issue is whether the shabti is only display. IMHO, we should assume the shabti is only display in the absense of info otherwise. If someone asks the museum or visits and says it's not, then I think most people would accept this as not resonably replacable but IMHO it's a mistake to say well it may not be on display, you never know.</dd>
<dd>So in conclusion, whilst given the onerous restrictions the museums have placed, I've withdrawn my request, I do think in the absense of these restrictions, the photo still is resonably replacable.</dd>

<dd>In such instances in the future, it may be more profitable for you to take steps to remedy the situation yourself instead of extorting the editors with threats of deletion. The spirit of the new enforcement of criterion 1 was to eliminate abuses where the image is easily replaceable by the uploader. In more complecated cases like these, you will achieve no actual progress under your current stratagy. The first maxim I was taught on wikipedia is, "If you don't like somthing, change it!" Go invest your time tagging such pages with somthing helpful like, "please replace if you can" and listing a request on the requested image page. I have seen the talk page for your criterion, and it appears that the only supporters it actually has to the extreme you are taking it are a group of high-falootin' beaurocrats who spend all their time pointing fingers instead of working on solutions. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 17:46, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I guess in the end for me the real outstanding question I have is not "should all fair use images should be replaced?" (they should where possible) but "what constitutes a genuinely fair use image in a case such as this?" It seems that far too much of the onus was placed on us to justify the use of a picture which could not (and possibly can not) be easily replaced. There was info on the original picture page stating its origins and stating that it was an arguable case of fair use given the circumstances. I also have no clear idea who in the grand hierarchy here on Wikipedia one could appeal to in these circumstances. I notice on Thanatosimii's page you mentioned that you had this discussion with others -- could you point to anyone in particular, as there are other such images that fall under this same situation and I'd like to come up to speed on the subject with the ackowledged experts. There was similarly an image that had been used on the <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepi_II_d98b.html" title="Pepi II">Pepi II</a> page which fell under a similar circumstance to the one used on the Ahmose I page that was similarly deleted.

<dd>Addendum: presumably <a href="../../../s/t/a/Template%7EStatue_69cd.html" title="Template:Statue">Template:Statue</a> should be invoked in this instance -- would you agree? <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptmondo_9b48.html" title="User:Captmondo">Captmondo</a> 22:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My understanding of policy is fair use is largely irrelevant if there image is resonably replacable. Even though you may not agree with this policy, from what I've seen the way things are at the moment any image that is resonably replacable is likely to be deleted regardless of fair use. However, really this isn't the best place to discuss this, check out <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_5c7e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use">Wikipedia talk:Fair use</a> instead. I should tell you however that my experience is that quite a number of people don't agree with policy and have argued against it, but so far no one has convinced the admins and those of us to support it to abandon it. Jimbo Wales is somewhat cryptic but appears to support the way things are heading so Given that I have gotten into a situation I wish to end with Thanatosimii, I don't really want to persue this matter much further but I think you will find you will be able to get more then enough feedback from that resource.</dd>
<dd>You might also want to take part in the development of <a href="../../../r/e/p/Wikipedia%7EReplaceability_of_fair-use_images_e12d.html" title="Wikipedia:Replaceability of fair-use images">Wikipedia:Replaceability of fair-use images</a>. Already mostly due to this case, the proposal has been amended so it now specifically mentions museums. For all the mess in this case, I think</dd>
<dd>Also, I don't <a href="../../../s/t/a/Template%7EStatue_69cd.html" title="Template:Statue">Template:statue</a>. Firstly, the 3D artwork isn't copyrighted anymore, it's several thousand years old. Secondly, the image is largely used to illustrate Ahmose II rather then the artwork/shabti. I.E. the page/section is discussing Ahmose II, not the shabti.</dd>
<dd>Finally, in response to Thana, I've largely said my peace with him/her. However I will point out as I've mentioned elsewhere that I disagree with his/her assessement. The reality is from what I can see, no one really bothered that much to consider replacing this image until I came along. When I did, people started to really make an effort, finding out who lived where etc. ANd although this image is not replacable, it was only when I came along that we took note of the museum policies and came to the conclusion it was not resonably replacable (a process which useless me started I should add since I was the one who first noted the Brooklyn Museum policy which at the time was the policy I thought that mattered). There have also been other similar cases IMHO when the image was replacable but not replaced until some 'useless beauraucrat' came along and forced matters. I'm also unsure whether there would have been as much as an effort were it not for the fact this image was going to be deleted (if I simply suggested the image should be replaced) since AFAIK, before we got so strict people were tagging images but far less of them were replaced... IMHO for better or worse, many wikipedians are only inspired to make the effort to replace an image when it's about to be deleted or when it has been deleted and the page is lacking in images.</dd>

You have no spectrum for degrees of ease of replaceability, and you assume bad faith on the part of the uploaders.

<dd>I don't know how to make this any clear. NO ONE IS WP:POINT ing. We are ENFORCING POLICY. The policy is clear. No one is threatening uploaders. We're simply trying to avoid wasting your and our time by helping you to understand policy. If you don't want to understand policy, there is nothing I can do. I'm sorry I've tried but sicne you refuse to accept that no one is singling you or anyone out, no one is trying to be mean, no one is trying to WP:POINT, but we're simply trying to enforce a policy, a policy which we strongly support perhaps, but a policy, there is nothing I can do anymore. I wish I didn't make the mistake of failing to read the Fair Use article better, since I'm very very stressed and really, really wish I didn't have to read this article again.

<dd>AFAIK, the British Museum is irrelevant since the Shabtis are located in Brooklyn (which doesn't allow commercial photos as I belatedly realised) and Khartoum (which we don't know about although perhaps it's a bit too out of the way for most wikipedians to be considered resonably replacable) not in the British Museum. The British museum simply has a photograph of the shabti. At least that was my understanding... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 13:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Apologies, it appears I was mistaken. I re-read the old paragraph and it was the same before. What happened was because it said "a single shabti, presumably from his tomb (which has never been positively located)" I presumed the shabti was missing and ignored it. I then went on to read the life size statues part and I presumed this image was of one of the life sized statues. Obviously this was extremely stupid of me. This was a shabti and I knew that but I had already forgotten about discarding the shabti earlier. And obviously it doesn't make sense that the shabti would be missing but still be listed to have survived. And it was pretty silly I guess to think that the British Museum would bother to exhibit a photo of a statue located in another museum. So yes, in this case I made a big mistake ooops. On the flip side, I have IMHO improved the article by mentioning where the shabti is held. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 15:33, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think I've made four mistakes in the way I handled this situation. Firstly, I should have checked out the Brooklyn Museum page better. I should point out here that although I didn't, I was the first one to point the BM policy, and upon noticing it, I immediately changed my comment. (It occured to me that many museums had photographic restrictions and I had even downloaded a PDF that I thought was helpful but unfortunetely as I didn't have a reader I couldn't read the PDF so I have up temporarily. I decided to look into it further when I was asking for advise and realised the PDF was sueless but the FAQ was helpful).</p>
<p>Secondly, I should not have added {{Replacethisimage}}. This template was superflurous and unnecessary. You may notice that only about 6 images are currently tagged with it.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I shouldn't have mentioned the part about encouraging editors to replace it. My intention here was to explain why I felt the policy was good. I want to make it clear at no time did I want to threaten anyone or whatever. My only intention was to enforce policy as I currently see it and still see it (which IMHO is a good idea for the reasons I've expressed). The behaviour in this case that I noticed continues to support my theory that the policy is a good idea but I repeat, it was only my intention enforce policy. I would not regret my actions even if the circumstances had been different, the museum policy had not existed and the article had remained without a replacament for 10 years.</p>
<p>Finally as I noted above, I made a serious mistake in regards to the location of the shabtis and what was located in Brooklyn. Although this didn't affect things that much, it does mean it was silly for me to concentrate on Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Anyway that's it. I've spent way more time on this then I ever wanted to and given what's happened I'm washing my hands for good.

<dd>Yes, we've learned that the current interpretation of Criterion 1 will destroy wikipedia just to make a point. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 16:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I missed this before. But if you check out<a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use#Policy</a>, you'd see fair use is in fact policy. It has been so for a while. Criterion 1 is clear. Always has been. It's not more or less important then the other criterion. They're all just as important and always have been. The policy makes it clear we have to obey all of them. Not just the legal ones. Not just all except criterion 1. All INCLUDING criterion 1. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 17:30, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That policy is dangerous. That's the simple fact. This exemplifies why it should be modified immediatly. It is inherently coercive, threatning, and a violation of POINT. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 19:44, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
