<p>What is the point in having Aegyptian instead of Egyptian? Shouldn't the more common English usage be used? I changed it but it was reverted and my edit was called 'arbitrary'. Also, what's with the strange character in monotheism? Monotheism is a common English word, and it has a normal 'i' in it. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJojojigamobo_c7de.html" title="User:Jojojigamobo">Joey</a> 09:14, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What you're asking is rather like demanding what is the point of using <i>X</i> English when <i>Y</i> English is available, where <i>X</i> ε {American, British, Canadian, Indian} and <i>Y</i> ε ({American, British, Canadian, Indian} \ <i>X</i>). If you wandered into an article in American English and changed it to some other English, you'd probably not be surprised to see it changed back. And it would be rather restrained for your changes to merely be deemed “arbitrary”.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“Ægypt” is perfectly legitimate English, albeït archaïc. Likewise, while <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diaeresis.html" title="Diaeresis">diæreses</a> aren't much used any more (with notable exceptions such as in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Economist_bbe2.html" title="The Economist">The Economist</a></i> and in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>), they may be properly be used in English to indicate that a vowel does not form a diphthong with the vowel before it. (They can also perform a similar function to that of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grave_accent.html" title="Grave accent">the grave accent</a>, which indicates that a vowel is not silent though is not stressed.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If someone comes along and turned this stub into a full-blown article, with different orthographic practices, well, that's one thing. But it is another to come along and do nothing but change orthography that was not wrong.</dd>

<dd>I think your argument is way off. First of all, you have no claim of ownership to this article. Secondly, you've admitted yourself that AT LEAST one of your constructions is archaic, and thus should not be used in this context. I am going to change it back and see if I can't get someone else to look at it since you don't want to compromise on these unnecessary characters. Nobody says 'Aegyptian' - not the article about Egypt, not the articles about Egyptian people. Furthermore, the article about Akenaton uses the more usual 'monotheist' as does every other article on Wikipedia. This isn't an American vs British English thing - this is a silly and overcomplicated archaic characters thing that doesn't belong here. It's fine to put those characters in things like place names or even words that we don't commonly have in the English speaking world, but to use them here just indicates a stylistic POV that is not supported here, or frankly anywhere else that is in the least bit contemporary. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJojojigamobo_c7de.html" title="User:Jojojigamobo">Joey</a> 18:19, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You asked for an explanation, and I made specific points in response. You've simply refused to address those actual points.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The <i>point</i> did not hang on the English being <i>specifically</i> British or <i>specifically</i> American. It hung upon it being specifically <i>correct</i> but not <i>uniquely</i> correct. And <b>just as</b> it would not be appropriate to take an article in Canadian English and make <i>no</i> changes to it other than to convert it to American English, it is not appropriate to change this entry <i>only</i> to change correct spellings into different correct spellings.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the hypothetical case of someone making changes to Americanize and article written by a Canadian, it would indeed in some sense be correct to say that the Canadian did not “own” the article, but that sense of <i>ownership</i> would be rather beside the point.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Meanwhile, you're absurdly porposing to establish a different sort of <i>ownership</i> when you declare that you'll “see if I can't get someone else to look at it”. You won't come to <i>own</i> the article <i>democratically</i> after a <i>Get Out the Vote</i> drive.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When you write
<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, you've admitted yourself that AT LEAST one of your constructions is archaic, and thus should not be used in this context.</p>
</blockquote>
you're either incompetent or dishonest. As written, it parses with <i>me</i> as the principal subject after the “and”; whereäs I certainly haven't admitted to your conclusion.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If, in fact, “Nobody says ‘Aegyptian’”, then just what are you doing here? Do you believe yourself to be hallucinating?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In case you hadn't noticed, most Americans regard British or Canadian spellings spellings as “silly and overcomplicated”, and those spellings are most certainly “archaic”.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>“POV” is, of course, a term of opprobrium in Wikipedia but your preference for spellings is no less a “stylistic POV” that anyone else's preferences.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The pretense either that <i>the Economist</i>, <i>the New York Times</i>, and even <i>Technology Review</i> are not “in the least bit contemporary”, or that they do not use some of the orthographic conventions that you would here undo, is absurd.</dd>

<p>This debate is not helping the encyclopedia to move forward. Gamahucheur, the encyclopedia is not a soapbox to promote your view of language. Your experience is appreciated however, and I respectfully suggest that your talents could be better used by editing articles on archaic language forms — this would be helpful and appreciated. I am reverting your edit, and request that you provide a reference to a current major English dictionary listing the AEgyptian spelling before you change the article in this way again. Here on Wikipedia you do not have ownership over your stub, please read the following: <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">Wikipedia:Ownership of articles</a>; also note the following comment at the bottom of the edit form: <i>If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.</i>. -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 04:42, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow, great job using 150 year old sources to justify your own weird obsession with bizarre characters that are not consistently used in English. You are mutilating English words to make yourself feel smarter, and really, I am done dealing with you. I will check back daily and make these changes. As a note - your implication that I am either ignorant or dishonest is grossly offencive, and a violation of more than one policy/guideline here. I've seen by your talk page that you've had many problems with anti-social behaviour here before. Please don't make a spectacle of yourself. If you want to be the sole authority here, make your own wiki and put this article on it. As it stands now, I am going to change these silly little marks every day that I see them here. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJojojigamobo_c7de.html" title="User:Jojojigamobo">Joey</a> 15:25, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Joey, you're simply engaged in a sort of <i>snobbishness</i> which simply reverses whom it would offer as an elite. The first of the sources that I cited is just a few years old. In any event, I provided sources when they were demanded of me. What have you provided besides insults, hypocrisy, and still-born arguments? What you find from my Talk page is that I don't yield to bad arguments, and <i>do</i> yield (almost immediately) to good arguments. Draw what perverse pleasure you may from you assaults; I understand that people such as you just come along with the wikiterritory. —Gamahucheur 16:42, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Joey— I made point-by-point replies to each of your substantive arguments. (<i>Eg:</i> “The first of the sources that I cited is just a few years old.”) Instead of addressing what I actually said, you've flailed around hoping that vehemence will be sufficient. In the case of <i>this</i> dispute, it is impossible for <i>either</i> side to <i>prevail</i> in the end, because it is exactly and only about the state <i>of the stub</i>, and the stub will not prevail in the end; it will be replaced by a longer article, and I'm not likely to write that article. So you will simply attack me until someone writes the article. (Whether you then start a <i>new</i> fight, attacking that next writer, remains to be seen.) —Gamahucheur 18:36, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for Comments</span></h2>
<p>As an editor who found this article while doing RC patrolling, I think we need many more comments on this debate in order to move forward. I encourage other editors to post their opinion to help obtain consensus on the question of the archaic spellings that were a part of the stub as created. Accordingly I've listed this article at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Media%2C_art_and_literature_a0ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Media, art and literature">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Media, art and literature</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 05:05, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Precison of Characterization</span></h3>
<p>The issue isn't whether the archaïc spellings should in all cases prevail. It is whether-and-when in this (or any other) article, changes should be made which are <i>no more</i> than replacing archaïc spellings. If a person who fills out this stub with a full article does so using modern British spellings or 1930s Canadian spellings or any such, that should be just fine. But I intend to revert pure impositions of dialect. —Gamahucheur 05:24, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your equation of this with spelling differences from different English-speaking countries is both confused AND confusing. This is completely incorrect, and I would further note that there is NO policy on Wikipedia saying I can't make minor CORRECTIONS (and that's what they are, corrections) to a stub. That's why we have the minor-changes check box. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJojojigamobo_c7de.html" title="User:Jojojigamobo">Joey</a> 15:30, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, Joey. You are confused exactly and only to the extent that you don't <i>want</i> to see the point: I don't care what the final dialect of the article is; I <i>do</i> care about changes that are exactly and only imposition of a different dialect. Your point about your being <i>allowed</i> to make minor changes is perfectly hypocritical: We <i>each</i> are <i>allowed</i> to make changes.</dd>

<dd>As to 3RR, I regard what you're doing as having become vandalism (though begun as something else); but, to avoid challenges, I'll be sure to watch the clock, and ask friends to do reversions when need be. —Gamahucheur 17:09, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The two novels you mentioned are from the 19th century. As for the Aegypt article - it is mentioned as an alternative spelling - Ægypt, in fact, has its own wikipedia article that has nothing to do with the way you are using it. Surely this would be confusing to many people who are not so attached to the funny inseperable AE I only see in words like vitae, and then only among a certain type enamored with all things Victorian.</dd>

<dd>He didn't claim that "Aegypt" wasn't an alternate spelling. What do you thing "alternate" means? He linked to the article on dieresises (which would include his "monotheism") way back. Darwin's book isn't a novel. The novel "Ægypt" is named for Egypt. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriticAtLarge_49d5.html" title="User:CriticAtLarge">CriticAtLarge</a> 20:28, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please be aware that I have no real desire to stick to your archaic conventions, and so won't paste Æ every time I want to refer to this. I will type AE or Ae, and you will please interpret it however you want. But I think it would be reasonable for you to assume what I meant. It can't have been that hard to make the logical jump. Since you are such a fan of semantics, you should probably have realized and noted that Ægypt is not a novel, but a series of such. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJojojigamobo_c7de.html" title="User:Jojojigamobo">Joey</a> 05:55, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether one uses the ligature or writes “Aegypt” is perfectly beside the point. The <i>point</i> is that for “Aegypt” to be an <i>alternate</i> spelling doesn't mysteriously make it a <i>wrong</i> spelling. cmh got a contemporary citation from me on “Ægypt”; I'd earlier given you one for diæreses, and didn't read him as requesting one. I met his demand. Sad but true: Contrary to the wishes of the author, a publisher of the novel <i>The Solitudes</i> gave it the title “<i>Ægypt</i>”; so it <i>Ægypt</i> is a novel, though it ought not to be by that name. —Gamahucheur 06:41, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Understandability</span></h3>
<p>I think one of the issues here is understandability (if that's a word...). Will the average user, when coming across this stub article, read "Ægypt" and think that it is a different place than "Egypt?" While I agree that the stub should be filled out, in the short-term we should still look at the bigger picture and make the right spelling, diction, and language choices that will be the easiest to understand for the largest cross-section of Wikipedia users possible. I would think that "Egypt" would be the better choice in that respect. <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainmonger_3b8c.html" title="User:Rainmonger">Tony</a><sub>(<a href="../../../r/a/i/User_talk%7ERainmonger_aa9c.html" title="User talk:Rainmonger">blah blah blah</a>)</sub><sup>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rainmonger_6ecb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rainmonger">look what I can do!</a>)</sup> 15:32, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually there is an alternative version of Wikipedia which aims to “be the easiest to understand for the largest cross-section of Wikipedia users possible”, <b><a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Simple English Wikipedia</a></b>, for which this stub obviously was <i>not</i> written. I won't say that ease of understanding is something to be ignored in the regular Wikipedia; but there would be a <i>balance</i> to be struck in any event, and the balance point was reset by the creation of SEW. (Perhaps Joey could be satisfied by copying his version of the stub to <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Osman" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Osman" rel="nofollow">a SEW entry for Ahmed Osman</a>.)</dd>

<p>I think that there is a difference between Simple English (or <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_English_33a0.html" title="Basic English">Basic English</a>) and choosing different spellings for clarity. Basic English is a variant of the English language that is intended to be easier to learn for someone who is a non-native speaker. Choosing "Ægypt" over "Egypt" invites a measure of confusion into reading and understanding the stub, no matter what dialect or version of English one speaks and reads. Searching on Google, "Ægypt" appears about 280 000 times vs. "Egypt" at 411 000 000. It seems rather apparent that "Egypt" is the preferred version in current English usage.</p>
<p>Further, it seems to me that you, Gamahucheur, are trying to get people riled up over something that, in the grand scheme of things, is a rather small issue. Why this one thing in this one small stub?

<dd>The <i>only</i> real difference between what Simple English Wikipedia is trying to do and what you want regular Wikipedia to do is where the balance point is seen. I noted the existence of SEW partly to draw your attention to its effect on <i>where</i> the balance point for the regular Wikipedia was to be found, but partly to have you consciously note that there <i>is</i> a balance point. Evenw without SEW, you surely don't want Wikipedia to sacrifice as much as would literally be necessary to reach “the largest cross-section of Wikipedia users possible”; <i>that</i> would truly be a Wikipedia for Dummies.</dd>

<dd>Right. Because anyone can see by reading this talk page that I am the unreasonable one. Hah. The person (and I STILL think it is you and only you) was lured here by you, has never used Wikipedia before, and does edits at your bidding. The very definition of a meat puppet if it is an actual person (with your same styles of insult and silliness), and of a sock puppet if it is you (which I think). The point is that you are completely unreasonable and completely in the wrong, and you know it. You're most likely just being a troll.

<p>As for claiming that I was going to 'wear you down' or 'pile on' is ridiculous and absurd, even from someone like you.

After telling me that I was being immature when you mistakenly thought that I was insulting someone for disagreeing with me (and that was indeed <i>point-by-point</i> shown to be a mistake), you did <i>exactly</i> that to someone else. If you'll read the 3RR entry, you'll find that it specifically <i>suggests</i> recruiting co-reverters. That may sound weird to you, but it's perfectly in keeping with the Wikipedia philosophy. Your assertion that you were going to revert to <i>your</i> limit, and your references here and elsewhere to things like majorities was <i>exactly</i> about piling-on and wearing down. And, while I don't know that you engaged in recruitment, some else certainly <i>did</i>. —Gamahucheur 06:24, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, I want to respond to your statement that you've satisfied my request for citations. I asked for a "current major English dictionary listing the AEgyptian spelling". You misinterpreted my request when you posted a modern dictionary which quotes archaic usages for the purpose of illustrating history or etymology. You told me you'd get back to me when you were in the room with an OED, but so far all we have are examples from Stoker and Darwin. I am looking for a reference to a modern edition of a major (in the academic sense) dictionary which lists Ægypt, Ægyptian and monotheïstic as in current usage, not as an example. That really means I'm looking for an <i>entry on</i> these terms.

<p>Due to curiosity reasons, I checked the <a href="../../../o/e/d/OED_54e7.html" title="OED">OED</a> online (I have access through <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_State_University_da5b.html" title="North Carolina State University">North Carolina State University</a>'s online library catalogue) for the word "Ægypt" and did not find it or any word that uses "Ægypt" as its root. If it were in the OED, it would fall between the words "<a href="../../../a/e/g/Aegrotat.html" title="Aegrotat">ægrotat</a>" and "aeipathy."

<p>Also drawn here from the RfC. I have a feeling that our "Aegyptian" champion is very emotionally invested in not being "proven wrong". It's not about being right or wrong, it's about a huge group effort to create an encyclopedia that is clear, accessible and understandable. Deliberately warping the spelling of "Egypt" to weird archaic and unused forms of the word contributes nothing to the encyclopedia. I find myself admiring the patience and tenacity of those editors that have passed before. Dude, 99% of the English-speakers in the world say, spell, and understand the word "Egyptian." A further 99% of that 99% will look at "Aegyptian" and think either "Is that a province or something?" or "what pretentious prat wrote this?" Neither outcome helps the encylopedia be clear, accessible and understandable.

<dd>It is rather perverse to make inferences about my emotional state. I've been chugging along logically in Talk, while wild accusations that <i>cannot</i> be substantiated have been made my the other side. Why in the world, then, would you be cincerned with <i>my</i> emotional investment? —Gamahucheur 06:36, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is fairly clear that Wiki should make information accessible and use commonly expected forms, which are not archaic or unusual spellings. The normal spelling is "Egypt" and this should be used in the main text. However, it may be viable to address variants and etymology in a separate section in the article, or elsewhere. This article is very poor on content, and I suggest editors spend their time on adding content to this article, rather than commenting on each other. I do not consider it appropriate for involved editors to make counter-arguments in this section of talk. It is for third party outside editors to make comments, as requested. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 04:21, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This debate is ridiculous. Egypt is the common usage. This isn't a matter of favoring American English over U.K. English; it's a matter of favoring current-day English over centuries-old English. Would there be a debate if someone had come into the article and replaced "aftirward" (Middle English) with "afterward" (modern English)? This is a waste of time. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_Carson_2138.html" title="User:Erik Carson">blahpers</a> 23:15, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Furthermore, what argument have you provided against changing Ægyptian to Egyptian, other than what many perceived to be your aversion to being edited? Others have provided reasonable arguments for making the change. What argument have you for keeping it as Ægyptian that outweighs the arguments for changing it? <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_Carson_2138.html" title="User:Erik Carson">blahpers</a> 23:22, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me that Gamahucheur is merely a troll. A clever one at that too. Hasn't anyone thought that his use of archaic english is trying to point out the pun in his user name? Gamahucheur is an obsolete word for a person who performs cunnilingus.
