<p>Ahmed ibn Hanbal was born in the city of <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merv.html" title="Merv">Merv</a> which was a north eastern city of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Khorasan_3eb9.html" title="Greater Khorasan">Khorasan</a> to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> parents from <i>Banu Shaiban</i> in <a href="../../../7/8/0/780.html" title="780">780</a>. He was a distinguished child known for his piety, cleanliness and asceticism. Once, his uncle sent him with several documents containing information about some people to the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliphate.html#Caliph" title="Caliphate">Caliph</a>'s office. Ahmad took those papers and did not see his uncle for a long time. When his uncle eventually met him, he asked him about the documents and discovered that Ahmad – who was then a boy – did not deliver them. When asked why, Ahmad replied: "I wouldn’t hand in those reports, and I have thrown them in the sea!" To this, his uncle replied: "This little boy fears Allah so much! What then of us?" Thus, Ahmad refused to act as an informant, even on behalf of his uncle, due to the fear of Allah that had been instilled in his heart from such a young age.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_ibn_Hanbal_8396.html" title="Edit section: Youth and Education">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Youth and Education</span></h3>
<p>He started his career by learning jurisprudence (<i><a href="../../../f/i/q/Fiqh.html" title="Fiqh">Fiqh</a></i>) under the celebrated <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanafi.html" title="Hanafi">Hanafi</a> judge, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Yusuf_031c.html" title="Abu Yusuf">Abu Yusuf</a>, the renowned student and companion of <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Hanifa_an-Nu%E2%80%98man_3b82.html" title="Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man">Imam Abu Hanifah</a>. He then discontinued his studies with Abu Yusuf, in the pursuit of <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a>, travelling around the Islamic <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliphate.html" title="Caliphate">Caliphate</a>, at the tender age of 16. As a student, he was held in awe by his teachers, to the same degree that they would respect their own. <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_al-Jawzi_16e1.html" title="Ibn al-Jawzi">Ibn al-Jawzi</a> states that Imam Ahmad had 414 Hadith masters whom he narrated from. <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Idris_ash-Shafi%60i_2045.html" title="Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i">Imam al-Shafi’i</a> was from the most beloved of Ahmad’s teachers, held in high esteem by him for his deep insight into jurisprudence. Al-Shafi’i equally admired Ahmad, for his expertise in jurisprudence and Hadith. He would often say to Imam Ahmad: “Tell us if you know of an authentic Hadeeth so that we may act on it.” What demonstrates Imam Ahmad’s love and admiration for al-Shafi’i is that when the latter would pass by him riding a mule, Imam Ahmad would follow al-Shafi’i on foot to enquire about various issues of jurisprudence. The great affect and regard between the two Imams is clearly reflected in the resemblance between the Shafi’i and Hanbali schools of jurisprudence.</p>
<p>Imam Ahmad did not suffice himself with seeking knowledge, but he also adorned it with actions, by making <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a>, performing the guard duty at Islamic frontiers (<i>Ribat</i>) and making <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajj.html" title="Hajj">Hajj</a> five times in his life, twice on foot.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_ibn_Hanbal_8396.html" title="Edit section: Expertise in Various Sciences">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expertise in Various Sciences</span></h3>
<p>The Imam spent 40 years of his life in the pursuit of knowledge, and only thereafter did he assume the position of a <a href="../../../m/u/f/Mufti.html" title="Mufti">mufti</a>. By this time, Imam Ahmad had become a leading authority in six or seven Islamic disciplines, according to al-Shafi'i. He became – unquestionably – a leading authority in Hadith, and left a colossal Hadith encyclopaedia, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musnad_Ahmad_ibn_Hanbal_e68c.html" title="Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal">al-Musnad</a>, as a living proof of his proficiency and devotion to this science. He is also remembered as a leading and the most balanced critic of Hadith (<i>Naqid</i>) of his time. Imam Ahmad became a principal specialist in jurisprudence, since he had the advantage of benefiting from some of the famous early jurists and their heritage, such as Abu Hanifah, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malik.html" title="Malik">Malik</a>, al-Shafi'i and many others. Imam Ahmad further improvised and developed upon previous schools, such that he became the founder of a new independent school, that was to be attributed to him as the Hanbali school. Some scholars, such as Qutaiba b. Sa’id noted that if Ahmad were to witness the age of <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufyan_al-Thawri_bc53.html" title="Sufyan al-Thawri">Sufyan al-Thawri</a>, Malik, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Awza%E2%80%99i_0bd9.html" title="Al-Awza’i">al-Awza’i</a> and Laith b. Sa’d, he would have surpassed them all. Despite being bilingual, he became an expert in the Arabic language, poetry, grammar. He gave great importance to the Arabic language, the proper application of grammar and correct pronunciation, such that he would often discipline his daughter for making a grammatical error in her everyday speech.</p>
<p>Imam Ahmad established himself as the Imam in the sciences of Quran, authoring works in exegesis (<i><a href="../../../t/a/f/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">Tafsir</a></i>), science of abrogation (<i>al-Nasikh wal-Mansukh</i>), as well as the different modes recitations (<i><a href="../../../q/i/r/Qira%27at.html" title="Qira'at">Qira'at</a></i>), preferring some modes of recitation over others, and even expressing dislike for the recitation of Hamza due to its exaggerated elongation of vowels. Imam Ahmad notably evolved into the most celebrated theologian, to be known as the ‘Imam Ahl al-Sunnah’, the leading authority on the Orthodox doctrine. Imam Ahmad personified the theological views of the early orthodox scholars, and in particular, the founders of the three juristic schools before him, Hanafi, Maliki and al-Shafi’i. This proved to be historically significant, since the Hanbali doctrine remained the only school representing the views of the founders of the other three juristic schools, that later became dominated by <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ash%27ari.html" title="Ash'ari">Ash’arites</a> or the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Maturidi.html" title="Maturidi">Maturidis</a>. What also gained him a resounding reputation was his vigorous refusal to accept the dogma of the <a href="../../../m/u/27/Mu%27tazili.html" title="Mu'tazili">creation of the Quran</a>, in spite of going through a protracted, arduous period of severe persecution. He is often likened to <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Bakr_b9a5.html" title="Abu Bakr">Abu Bakr</a>, as the lone champion of Islam during the wars of apostasy.</p>
<p>Imam Ahmad was equally considered to be a leading example in <i><a href="../../../z/u/h/Zuhd.html" title="Zuhd">Zuhd</a></i> (material and spiritual asceticism), for he lived a very simple life, detached from worldly pleasures. His work on Zuhd (<i>Kitab al-Zuhd</i>) is regarded to be the most profound contribution to the Islamic heritage. Abu Dawud, the famous compiler of Sunan, observed that sessions with Ahmad were sessions devoted to the Hereafter, for he would never mention anything of this world. His travels lasted several years. Upon returning home, he studied under <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Idris_ash-Shafi%60i_2045.html" title="Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i">Imam Shafi'i</a> on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_law.html" title="Islamic law">Islamic law</a>. Ibn Hanbal was very devoted to traditional views and was opposed to innovations in Islamic law. The strength of his views was tested under the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliphs.html" title="Caliphs">caliphs</a> <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Ma%27mun_b6ed.html" title="Al-Ma'mun">al-Ma'mun</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Mu%27tasim_12af.html" title="Al-Mu'tasim">al-Mu'tasim</a>. During the <a href="../../../m/i/h/Mihna.html" title="Mihna">mihna</a> period, a kind of "inquisition court" was created to deal with people who would not profess certain doctrines that the <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbasid.html" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> caliphs thought were correct. These doctrines were from the <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutazilite.html" title="Mutazilite">Mutazilite</a> school of thought, and held that the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> was created and not eternal. Ibn Hanbal was arrested and brought in chains before the court, and suffered a great deal. But he patiently submitted to corporal punishment and imprisonment, and resolutely refused to <a href="../../../a/b/j/Abjure.html" title="Abjure">abjure</a> his beliefs.</p>
<p>Caliph al-Ma'mun reportedly had Ibn Hanbal flogged. <sup><a href="../../../y/a/27/Ya%27qubi.html" title="Ya'qubi">Ya'qubi</a>, vol.lll, p.86; Muruj al-dhahab, vol.lll, p.268-270.</sup></p>
<p>Under the rule of <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Mutawakkil_f037.html" title="Al-Mutawakkil">Al-Mutawakkil</a> however, the policy of the government changed and Ibn Hanbal's trials came to an end. From then onwards he was accorded honor befitting his great knowledge and on several occasions he was invited to the court and granted a generous pension. Ibn Hanbal, however, turned down the offers due to his general dislike of being close to the rulers. <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Mutawakkil_f037.html" title="Al-Mutawakkil">Al-Mutawakkil</a>, knowing that Imam Ahmad would refuse his offerings, instead presented some gifts to his son, Salih b. Ahmad. When it came to his knowledge, Imam Ahmad showed strong disapproval and refused to consume anything from his son’s wealth.</p>
<p>Among the works of Ibn Hanbal is the great encyclopaedia of Traditions called Musnad, compiled by his son from his lectures and amplified by supplements - containing over twenty-eight thousand traditions. His other works include Kitab-us-Salaat, on the Discipline of Prayer and Kitab-us-Sunnah, on the Traditions of the Prophet.</p>
<p>Ibn Hanbal's fame spread far and wide. His learning, piety and unswerving faithfulness to traditions gathered a host of disciples and admirers around him. His teachings plus his books would lead his disciples to form the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanbali.html" title="Hanbali">Hanbali</a> school of jurisprudence.</p>
<p>He died in Baghdad on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_31.html" title="July 31">July 31</a>, <a href="../../../8/5/5/855.html" title="855">855</a> CE; according to the <i>Tarjamatul Imam</i>, over 800,000 men and 60,000 women attended his funeral.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_ibn_Hanbal_8396.html" title="Edit section: Ahmad’s Five Basic Juristic Principles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ahmad’s Five Basic Juristic Principles</span></h3>
<p>Despite being an exceptional jurist, Imam Ahmad detested that his opinions be written and compiled, fearing that it may swerve his students away from studying the sources of Law, the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quran.html" title="Quran">Quran</a> and the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunnah.html" title="Sunnah">Sunnah</a>. Yet, as Ibn al-Jawzi comments, Allah knew the sincerity in his heart and raised around him faithful students who would record his opinions, such that an independent school of jurisprudence and theology was formed and attributed to Imam Ahmad.</p>
<p>Imam Ahmad employed exceptional caution while formulating juristic opinions and issuing verdicts, and would frequently warn his students of speaking in a matter in which you have no reputable predecessor. This prudent attitude is clearly demonstrated in the thought process applied by Ahmad in extrapolation of laws from the divine sources, which is as follows:</p>
<p>1) Divine text (<i>the Quran and the Sunnah</i>) was the first point of reference for all scholars of jurisprudence, and in this, Ahmad was not an exception. Whenever he noticed a divine textual evidence for an issue, he never referred to other sources, opinions of the Companions, scholars or resorted to analogical deduction (<i><a href="../../../q/i/y/Qiyas.html" title="Qiyas">Qiyas</a></i>).</p>
<p>2) Verdicts issued by the Companions were resorted to when no textual evidence was found in the Quran or the Sunnah. The reasons for ranking the verdicts of the Companions after the Quran and the Sunnah are obvious: The Companions witnessed the revelation of the Quran, and its implementation by the Prophet – SallAllahu ‘alaihi wa-sallam, who advised the Ummah to adhere to the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliphate.html#rightly-guided_caliphs" title="Caliphate">rightly-guided caliphs</a>, hence, the Companions ought to have a better understanding than the latter generations.</p>
<p>Imam Ahmad, would likewise, never give precedence to a scholarly opinion or analogical deduction (<i>Qiyas</i>) over that of the Companions’, to the extent that if they were divided into two camps over an issue, two different narrations would similarly be documented from Imam Ahmad.</p>
<p>3) In a case where the Companions differed, he preferred the opinion supported by the divine texts (<i>the Quran and the Sunnah</i>).</p>
<p>4) In instances where none of the above was applicable, Ahmad would resort to the <a href="../../../m/u/r/Mursal_%28hadith%29.html" title="Mursal (hadith)">mursal</a> Hadith (with a link missing between the Successor and the Prophet – SallAllahu ‘alaihi wa-sallam) or a <a href="../../../d/a/27/Da%27if.html" title="Da'if">weak hadith</a>. However, the type of weak Hadith that Ahmad relied on was such that it may be regarded as <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasan_%28hadith%29.html" title="Hasan (hadith)">fair hadith</a> due to other evidences (<i>Hasan li Ghairihi</i>), not the type that is deemed very weak and thus unsuitable as an evidence for Law. This was due to the fact that, during his time, the Hadith was only categorised into ‘sound’ (<i><a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih.html" title="Sahih">sahih</a></i>) and ‘weak’ (<i>da’if</i>). It was only after Ahmad, that al-Tirmidhi introduced a third category of ‘fair’ (<i>hasan</i>).</p>
<p>5) Only after having exhausted the aforementioned sources would Imam Ahmad employ analogical deduction (Qiyas) due to necessity, and with utmost care.</p>

<p>As demonstrated previously, Imam Ahmad became the leading authority on the Orthodox doctrine of Islam, which represented the first three blessed generations of Islam, untainted with foreign dogmas. Ahmad’s doctrinal influence can be measured by the fact that, out of the <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madh%27hab.html" title="Madh'hab">four traditional schools</a>, the Hanbali school alone maintained its own theological view, unlike the Hanafi school which adopted the Maturidi doctrine, or the Shafi’i and Maliki schools that adopted the Ash’ari doctrine.<sup>[<i><a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutrality disputed</a></i>]</sup> The secret for this was the depth and length at which Ahmad spoke in matters of theology, due to the prevailing unorthodoxy in his age, headed by the <a href="../../../m/u/27/Mu%27tazili.html" title="Mu'tazili">Mu’tazilites</a>. Due to this it is noted that there have been, in comparison to other schools, very few Hanbalis who inclined towards unorthodox views, for the copious volume of narrations from Imam Ahmad dealing with specific issues of doctrine made it extremely difficult for his followers to adhere to any other, yet still remain faithful followers.</p>
<p>Imam Ahmad’s doctrine could be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>1) He would believe in the description that Allah gave to himself in the Quran, or inspired the prophet Muhammad with, and affirm them at their face value (<i>Dhahir</i>), while generally negating any resemblance between the Creator and the creation.</p>
<p>2) He would vigorously reject negative theology (<i>Ta’til</i>), as well as allegorical exegesis (<i>Ta’wil</i>), with respect to belief in Allah, which was heavily employed by the Jahmites, Mu’tazilites and the Kullabites (later to be known as the Ash’arites) to justify their philosophical approach to God.</p>
<p>3) He believed that Allah Speaks with letters and sound, for he believed every word and letter of the Quran to be the word of Allah, contrary to the Kullabites, who, in their opposition to the Mu’tazilites, affirmed eternal Speech for Allah, yet still agreed with them in that they believed that the Quran, which is composed of letters, was created.</p>
<p>4) He believed that Allah literally Hears and Sees; that He has two Hands with which He created Adam; that Allah has a Face.</p>
<p>5) He believed that Allah literally Rose over the Throne after Creating the heavens and the Earth in six days.</p>
<p>6) He believed that Allah is High above and distinct from His creation.</p>
<p>7) He believed that Allah is all Knowing, All Wise, All Power and All Able, and that Allah has His own Will, He Does what He likes out of His Wisdom. Whatever Allah has Written and Decreed upon His creation, must come to pass. Nothing leaves His knowledge, or happens without His Permission or Will.</p>
<p>8) He believed that Allah becomes Pleased when obeyed and Displeased when disobeyed.</p>
<p>9) He would regard the Jahmiyah (followers of <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahm.html" title="Jahm">Jahm</a> ibn Safwan), and the <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafidha.html" title="Rafidha">Rafidha</a> (the Imami Shias) who curse the Companions, to be disbelievers (<i><a href="../../../k/a/f/Kafir.html" title="Kafir">Kuffar</a></i>).</p>
<p>10) He held that the sinners amongst the Muslims are under the threat of Allah's punishment; that if He wishes He may Punish them or Forgive them; Contrary to the Khawarij. He would not declare a Muslim to be a disbeliever (<i>Kafir</i>) on account of his sins, nor would he exclude actions from Iman unlike the <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murji%27a.html" title="Murji'a">Murji'a</a>. He was once asked about those who declare their belief in the five pillars of Islam, yet refuse to perform them; he said, in reply, they are disbelievers (<i>Kuffar</i>).</p>
<p>11) He believed in the miracles that occurred at the hands of the <i>Awliya</i> (pious Muslims) as a favour from Allah.</p>
<p>12) He believed that <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Bakr_b9a5.html" title="Abu Bakr">Abu Bakr</a> is the best of the Companions, followed by <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a>, then the six companions chosen by the latter as Ashab al-Shura (members of Shura council): <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman.html" title="Uthman">Uthman</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abd-Allah_ibn_al-Zubayr_7b5d.html" title="Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr">al-Zubair</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talha.html" title="Talha">Talha</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abd-al-Rahman_ibn_Awf_5d30.html" title="Abd-al-Rahman ibn Awf">Abd-al-Rahman ibn Awf</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/%60/Sa%60ad_ibn_Abi_Waqqas_0513.html" title="Sa`ad ibn Abi Waqqas">Sa`ad ibn Abi Waqqas</a>; followed by the fighters of <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badr.html" title="Badr">Badr</a> from the emigrants (<a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhajirun.html" title="Muhajirun">Muhajirun</a>) and then the helpers (<i><a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansar.html" title="Ansar">Ansar</a></i>).</p>
<p>13) He prohibited discussions on the differences between the Companions or dislike of any of them; for the honour of Companionship with the Prophet – SallAllahu ‘alaihi wa-sallam – is sufficient a virtue to rank them higher than the entire Muslim <a href="../../../u/m/m/Ummah.html" title="Ummah">Ummah</a> until the end of time.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_ibn_Hanbal_8396.html" title="Edit section: The Trial">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Trial</span></h3>
<p>Imam Ahmad is remembered as a legendary figure in the Islamic history for his uncompromising stance and for withstanding immense pressure during the trial of ‘the creation of the Quran’. The Caliph at the time, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Ma%27mun_b6ed.html" title="Al-Ma'mun">Al-Ma'mun</a>, subjected the scholars to severe persecution, at the behest of the Mu’tazilite theologians who attributed themselves to Imam Abu Hanifa in jurisprudence. The Mu'tazilites were a heretical Muslim sect, who sanctified their intelligence above the revelation and espoused the belief that, even though, the Quran is the speech of Allah, He created that speech as a distinct entity and called it ‘the Quran’. This was in opposition to the orthodox belief that Allah spoke every word of the Quran, and indeed: ‘Allah spoke to Moses directly’, as Allah states in the Quran.</p>
<p>The Mu’tazilites were discredited throughout the Umayyad rule and never given the position of prominence and influence, until the Caliph al-Ma'mun came to power, during the <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbasid.html" title="Abbasid">Abbasid dynasty</a>, who took them into confidence and bestowed them with official positions within the state as judges. Bishr al-Marrisi and Ahmad b. Abi Du’ad were the two important figures behind the Mu’tazilite inquisition, which systematically placed many jurists and traditionists on trial until they were forced to acknowledge that the Quran is created, and their acknowledgement publicised in all major cities.</p>
<p>Nearly all the scholars of Baghdad from the jurists and the traditionists were tested, and all of them acknowledged the doctrine of the created Quran, with the exception of the two; Ahmad b. Hanbal and Muhammad b. Nuh. This greatly pained and angered Imam Ahmad, such that he boycotted some of the great traditionists for their acknowledgement, and often refused to narrate from them. Amongst those boycotted were a close companion and a colleague of Imam Ahmad, Yahya b. Ma’in, about whom, it is said that Imam Ahmad refused to speak to him until he died and composed the following lines of poetry censuring his acknowledgement of heresy:</p>
<p><i>Ya ibn al-madini al-ladhi 'uridat lahu</i></p>
<p><i>Dunya fa Jada bi dinihi li yanalaha</i></p>
<p><i>Madha da'aka li intihali maqalatin</i></p>
<p><i>Kunta taz'umu kafiran man qalaha</i></p>
<p><i>O Ibn al-Madini, to whom the world was offered,</i></p>
<p><i>So he strove to attain it at the expense of his religion</i></p>
<p><i>What made you embrace a dogma (about which)</i></p>
<p><i>You would impute disbelief on the one who adopts it!</i></p>
<p>Finally, Ahmad b. Hanbal and Muhammad b. Nuh were also put to the test on the order of al-Ma’mun, but they refused to acknowledge the creation of the Quran. Consequently, they were despatched in irons to be dealt with by al-Ma’mun himself. On the way, Imam Ahmad supplicated to Allah to prevent him from meeting al-Ma’mun. His prayer was answered in the sudden death of al-Ma’mun due to which they were both sent back. Muhammad b. Nuh passed away on their return journey, and there was none to prepare his funeral, pray over, and bury him, except Imam Ahmad.</p>
<p>He remained imprisoned in Baghdad until <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Mu%27tasim_12af.html" title="Al-Mu'tasim">Al-Mu'tasim</a> assumed power. Al-Mu’tasim, unlike al-Ma’mun, was a destitute to knowledge. Nevertheless, he continued the Mu’tazilite inquisition as explicitly requested by al-Ma’mun in his will. His rule was perhaps the most brutal towards Sunni scholars in general, and Imam Ahmad in particular who intransigently continued to resist all attempts by the authorities to force him to acknowledge the creation of the Quran. The frustrated Caliph finally ordered Ahmad to be flogged in public, which resulted in Ahmad falling unconscious. Imam Ahmad was released shortly afterwards, when al-Mu’tasim feared that the commotion caused in Baghdad due to mistreatment of Ahmad may reach an uncontrollable pitch.</p>
<p>After al-Mu’tasim’s death, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Wathiq_0f9c.html" title="Al-Wathiq">al-Wathiq</a> took over the office of Khilafa, and ordered his loyal Mu’tazili judge in Egypt, Ibn Abi al-Layth to press hard with the inquisition. This caused many to flee from Egypt, while the prisons became full of jurists and traditionists who resisted the government demands. In Baghdad, however, the general public had become enraged over the policies of the government, which made it difficult for al-Wathiq to pursue the inquisition with the same vigour. He therefore, instead of re-imprisoning Imam Ahmad, resolved on banishing him from Baghdad, saying: “Do not live with me on this earth!”, and henceforth, Ahmad b. Hanbal went into hiding.</p>
<p>Towards the end of al-Wathiq’s reign, a close student of al-Shafi’i, Ahmad b. Nasr al-Khaza’i was caught by the officials and charged for organising an uprising in Baghdad. When Ahmad al-Khaza’i was brought to al-Wathiq in chains, the latter, instead of asking him about his role in the uprising, questioned him about his belief in the creation of the Quran, to which Ahmad al-Khaza’i gave the standard Sunni reply. The enraged Caliph, upon hearing his response, personally decapitated him. His head remained in Baghdad, while his body remained on a crucifix in <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samarra.html" title="Samarra">Samarra</a> for six years, as a grisly warning to potential rebels.</p>
<p>After al-Wathiq’s death, his brother <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Mutawakkil_f037.html" title="Al-Mutawakkil">al-Mutawakkil</a> took charge of the office. Al-Mutawakkil, unlike his predecessors had the utmost respect and admiration for the Sunni school, and through him, Allah decided to put an end to the inquisition. Promptly after assuming the position as Caliph, he sent orders throughout the Caliphate to put an immediate end to all discussions regarding the Quran, released all the prisoners of faith, dismissed the Mu’tazili judges, and more significantly deported the chief instigator of the inquisition, Ahmad b. Abi Du’ad along with his family. He further ordered that the Mu’tazili judges responsible for the inquisition be cursed from by the pulpits, by name.</p>
<p>Al-Mutawakkil, on the other hand, showed his utmost reverence to the Sunni hero of the inquisition, Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal, and wished to take care of all his affairs. Ahmad, however, turned down the offers due to his general dislike of being close to the rulers. Al-Mutwakkil, knowing that Imam Ahmad would refuse his offerings, instead presented some gifts to his son, Salih b. Ahmad. When it came to his knowledge, Imam Ahmad showed strong disapproval and refused to consume anything from his son’s wealth.</p>
<p><a name="Illness.2C_Death_and_Funeral" id="Illness.2C_Death_and_Funeral"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_ibn_Hanbal_8396.html" title="Edit section: Illness, Death and Funeral">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Illness, Death and Funeral</span></h3>
<p>After Imam Ahmad turned 77, he was struck with severe illness and fever, and became very weak, yet never complaining about his infirmity and pain until he died. In spite of his debilitation, he would urge his son, Salih b. Ahmad, to help him stand up for prayer. When he was unable to stand, he would pray sitting, or sometimes lying on his side. After hearing of his illness, the masses flocked to his door. The ruling family also showed the desire to pay him a visit, and to this end sought his permission. However, due to his desire to remain independent of any influence from the authority, Ahmad denied them access.</p>
<p>Once during his illness, an old man entered upon Imam Ahmad and reminded him of his account before Allah, to which Imam Ahmad began to weep profusely. On another occasion, a man who partook in the beatings inflicted on Imam Ahmad, came to Salih b. Ahmad, the son of the Imam, and begged him to seek permission from his father to allow him to enter, for he felt the guilt of his involvement in the suffering of the Imam. When he was finally given permission, he entered upon the Imam and wept, begging for his forgiveness. Imam Ahmad forgave him on the condition that he would never repeat his actions. The man left the Imam, and all those present, in tears.</p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Ahmad b. Hanbal narrates, that while Imam Ahmad was on his death bed, he kept drifting in and out of consciousness, and gesturing with his hands saying: ‘No… No… No…’ When enquired about it, Ahmad replied: ‘The Devil was standing near me, trying his hardest to mislead me, saying: ‘Come on, Ahmad!’, and I was replying back: ‘No… No…’</p>
<p>On Friday, the 12 of <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabi%27_al-Awwal_300a.html" title="Rabi' al-Awwal">Rabi' al-Awwal</a> 241 AH, the legendary Imam breathed his last. The news of his death quickly spread far and wide in the city and the people flooded the streets to attend Ahmad’s funeral. One of the rulers, upon hearing the news, sent burial shrouds along with perfumes to be used for Ahmad’s funeral. However, respecting the Ahmad’s wishes, his sons refused the offering and instead used a burial shroud prepared by his female servant. Moreover, his sons took care not to use water from their homes to wash Imam Ahmad as he had refused to utilise any of their resources, for accepting the offerings of the ruler.</p>
<p>After preparing his funeral, his sons prayed over him, along with around 200 members of the ruling family, while the streets were teeming with both men and women, awaiting the funeral procession. Imam Ahmad’s funeral was then brought out and the multitudes continued to pray over him in the desert, before and after his burial at his grave.</p>
<p>During the trial of Imam Ahmad, he would often say: “Say to the heretics, the decisive factor between us and you is the day of funerals”; meaning, the adherents to the orthodox doctrine always have a good end, for they earn the love of Allah, as well as the affection of the multitudes, and their death has a great impact on people’s lives. This is exactly what took place in this instance, for it is estimated that about 1 300 000 people attended his funeral. One of the scholars said in relation to this that such a massive attendance at a funeral has never been equalled in the history of the Arabs, neither in the pre-Islamic era (<i><a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahiliyah.html" title="Jahiliyah">Jahiliyah</a></i>) nor in Islam. The masses were engulfed in the genuine popular emotion, while the scene of his grave became overwhelmed by such sentiments that the graveyard had to be guarded by the civil authorities.</p>
<p>Another scholar relates that when he attended the funeral of Ahmad, he wanted pray over him at his grave. But the crowds were so awe-inspiring that he didn’t reach the grave until after a week. The funerals of the famous opponents of Imam Ahmad, however, were in stark contrast, which where not attended by more than a handful. The funeral procession of the Ahmad ibn Abi Du’ad – the chief instigator of the inquisition – went largely unnoticed, with none willing to carry his funeral to the graveyard, except a few from the ruling family. Such was also the case with al-Harith al-Muhasibi – a theologian and an ascetic – who, despite being a bitter enemy of the Mu’tazilites, was still discredited by Imam Ahmad for his interests in <i><a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalam.html" title="Kalam">Kalam</a></i> (speculative theology). Only three or four people prayed over al-Muhasibi, and a similar fate met Bishr al-Mirrisi.</p>
<p>In the Islamic history, Ahmad’s funeral is noted as the day when the Mu’tazilite doctrine was brought to a decisive and a humiliating end, whilst the Sunni Islam and the Prophetic guidance were the order of the day. Ahmad’s death had proven the ineffectiveness of the Caliph’s role in defining Islam, and further unquestionably acknowledged that it were the scholars, rather than the Caliphs, who were the true ‘inheritors of the Prophets’. Ahmad’s funeral was marked by the multitudes flocking, and openly cursing al-Karabisi and al-Marrisi, the chief heretics. This became a frequent practise amongst the subsequent Hanbali funerals throughout Islamic history, where the masses would rally behind prominent Hanbali funerals proclaiming: This day is for Sunnis and Hanbalis! Not Jahmis, Mu’tazilis or Ash’aris!</p>

<p>The enthusiastic reader with a keen interest to inquire more about Imam Ahmad is recommended to read the most comprehensive biography of Imam Ahmad by Ibn al-Jawzi called <i>Manaqib al-Imam Ahmad</i>; followed by Imam Ahmad’s biography by al-Dhahabi in <i>Siyar al-‘Alam al-Nubula’</i>. Those seeking in-depth information about the Madhab are recommended to read the richest introduction to the Madhab by Dr. Bakr b. ‘Abd Allah Abu Zaid called <i>al-Madkhal al-Mufassal Ila Fiqh al-Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal</i> (A detailed introduction to the jurisprudence of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal). Equally recommended is another primer, albeit not so detailed, but still unique, titled: <i>al-Madkhal ila Madhab al-Imam Ahmad</i>, by Ibn Badran al-Dimashqi. <i>Ahmad b. Hanbal al-Sirah wal-Madhab</i> (Ahmad ibn Hanbal – the life and the Madhab) by Sa’di Abu Jaib is similarly recommended for a devotee of the Madhab, dealing with various aspects of the life of Imam Ahmad and his Madhab not addressed in the two aforementioned introductory books.</p>

<p>After the death of Imam Ahmad, his students travelled across the Muslim world along with the <i>responsa</i> (Masa’il) of Ahmad concerning theology, jurisprudence and traditions. From the foremost of his students are: his two sons, Salih and Abdullah, Hanbal b. Ishaq, al-Marrudhi, al-Kawsaj, Ibn Hani, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Dawud_c60e.html" title="Abu Dawud">Abu Dawud</a> (compiler of <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunan_Abi_Dawud_b4a3.html" title="Sunan Abi Dawud">Sunan Abi Dawud</a>), al-Athram, Abu Zur’ah al-Razi, Abu Hatim al-Razi, ‘Abdul-Wahhab al-Warraq, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Tirmidhi_8ab8.html" title="Al-Tirmidhi">al-Tirmidhi</a> and many others.</p>
<p>However, it was not until al-Khallal travelled the Muslim world, collecting the <i>responsa</i> of Imam Ahmad from his students scattered across the Caliphate, that the <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madhab.html" title="Madhab">Madhab</a> of Imam Ahmad was compiled in an organised form. This vast compilation became known as <i>al-Jami’</i>, which is still used in the 8th Islamic century by <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Taymiyah_c222.html" title="Ibn Taymiyah">Ibn Taymiyah</a> and his contemporary Hanbali jurists.</p>
<p>This collection was then summarised into a short treatise on the Fiqh of Imam Ahmad by the Baghdadi-Hanbali jurist al-Khiraqi, which became known as <i>Mukhtasar al-Khiraqi</i>. This treatise was the first <i>Fiqh</i> manual ever written in the <i>Madhab</i>, and its first ever commentary was also written by its very author, thus, making al-Khiraqi the first author of a Fiqh manual in the Madhab, the first one to write a commentary on a manual, and indeed the first Hanbali to comment on his own manual.</p>
<p>The summarised treatise on Fiqh by al-Khiraqi proved to be the most important contribution to Hanbali Fiqh, with over 300 commentaries, according to Yusuf b. ‘Abd al-Hadi, which even today remains an excellent introductory manual to the Hanbali school of jurisprudence. The famous commentaries to al-Mukhtasar include, but are not restricted to: a commentary by Ibn Hamid, then al-Qadhi Abu Ya’la, then <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Qudama_a495.html" title="Ibn Qudama">Ibn Qudama al-Maqdisi</a>, whose commentary, famously known as al-Mughni, is considered to be a timeless masterpiece.</p>

<p>Since Hanbalism is as much a school of theology as it is a school of Law, the Hanbali theologians have contributed several works, at various intervals in history, representing the doctrine of Ahmad b. Hanbal. Imam Ahmad himself played a leading role in authoring books on doctrine, such as the <i>Kitab al-Sunnah</i> (Book of Sunnah) and <i>al-Rad 'Ala al-Zanadiqah wa al-Jahmiyah</i> (The refutation of the Heretics and the Jahmis). Apart from these two works, Imam Ahmad wrote several letters addressed to some of his contemporaries, explaining the orthodox creed, found in the <i>Tabaqat</i> of Ibn Abi Ya'la, although not all of the letters are authentic.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the students of Ahmad in particular, and the rest of his followers, continued to contribute works in theology. Several Hanbalis authored books, in the footsteps of their Imam, with a common title: <i>Kitab al-Sunnah</i>, such as al-Athram, ‘Abdullah (the son of Imam Ahmad), Hanbal b. Ishaq (the cousin of Imam Ahmad), al-Khallal.</p>
<p>Some of the important manuals on doctrine accepted by the mainstream Hanbalis include: <i>Lum’at al-I’tiqad</i> by Ibn Qudama al-Maqdisi, <i>al-I’tiqad</i> by al-Qadhi Abu Ya’la, <i>al-Iqtisad fi al-I’tiqad</i> by ‘Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi, and various treatise written by Ibn Taymiyah, such as <i>al-Wasitiyah</i> and <i>al-Tadmurriyah</i>, as well as his close student <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_al-Qayyim_0901.html" title="Ibn al-Qayyim">Ibn al-Qayyim</a>, such as his famous <i>Nuniyah</i>, an ode rhyming in the letter <i>Nun</i>.</p>
<p>It is worthy to note that many works on theology by some Hanbalis were reactionary to the Hanbali-Ash’ari feud, such as <i>al-Radd ‘Ala al-Asha’irah</i> (Rebuttal of the Ash’arites) by Ibn al-Hanbali, and by Abul-Wafa Ibn ‘Aqil with the same title. Another example of such work is <i>Ibtal al-Ta'wilat li Akhbar al-Sifat</i> (Negation of the Allegorical Interpretations of the Traditions Pertaining to Divine Attributes) by al-Qadhi Abu Ya’la, which came is a rebuttal of the book <i>Mushkil al-Hadith wa Bayanuhu</i> (The Problematic Traditions and their Interpretations) by Ibn Furak, the Ash’ari theologian and a traditionist, who compiled the aforementioned book, giving allegorical interpretations to divine texts that seemed problematic according to Ash’ari principles; and <i>al-Munadhara fi al-Quran ma’a Ahl al-Bid’ah</i> (The Debate Regarding the Quran with Some Heretics), by the great Hanbali jurist, Ibn Qudama al-Maqdisi, where he relates his violent discourse with his contemporaries from the Ash’aris, whom he refers to as ‘Heretics’, about the nature of the Quran contained in a book-form (<i><a href="../../../m/u/s/Mushaf.html" title="Mushaf">Mushaf</a></i>), whether it is created or uncreated.</p>
<p>Other Hanbalis, although they did not author books dedicated to doctrine, they did, however, include sections of doctrine in books of <i>Fiqh</i> and <i><a href="../../../s/u/l/Suluk.html" title="Suluk">Suluk</a></i> (ethics). <i>Al-Ghunya</i>, by 'Abdul-Qadir al-Jailani – a famous Hanbali jurist and the founder of the Qadiri Sufi order – is for the most part, a manual in ethics and morality, yet it begins with a thorough presentation of the Hanbali doctrine, which paints al-Jailani as an ardent follower of the mainstream Hanbalism, and an avowed antagonist of the Ash’aris.</p>

<p>The first manual in Fiqh, as mentioned earlier was the famous al-Mukhtasar by al-Khiraqi, which has remained up until this day, from the most important introductory works on Hanbali Fiqh, with its commentary <i>par excellence</i>, <i>al-Mughani</i> by <i>Ibn Qudama</i>.</p>
<p>Al-Majd Ibn Taymiyah, who was the grandfather of the famous Hanbali theologian and jurist, <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Taymiyah_c222.html" title="Ibn Taymiyah">Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyah</a>, was considered to be one of the great authorities in the school, along with Ibn Qudama, such that if the two Sheikhs agreed upon an issue, it would be considered the reliable opinion (<i>mu’tamad</i>) in the school. Al-Majd Ibn Taymiyah authored his famous and reliable Fiqh manual called al-Muharrar fi al-Fiqh.</p>
<p>Ibn Qudama played a key role in developing a Hanbali curriculum of Fiqh for all levels of students. He wrote a preparatory manual for the beginners called <i>al-‘Umdah</i>, with the objective of developing an all-round surface understanding of jurisprudence, without confusing the student with difference of opinion within the school. For the students at an intermediate level, he authored <i>al-Muqni’</i>, aimed at training the students at exercising preference (<i>tarjih</i>) upon conflicting opinions (<i>ta’arudh</i>) within the school. For the next level, he authored <i>al-Kafi</i>, with the goal of acquainting the student with the sources of the Law, and the methodology for extrapolating rules from the revelation. <i>Al-Mughni</i> (lit. rich), which is a commentary on al-Mukhtasar by al-Khiraqi, was compiled for the advanced students, to familiarise them with the difference of opinion and the respective arguments, beyond the school, even surpassing the four traditional schools.</p>
<p>The aforementioned book, al-Muqni’ by Ibn Qudama had received two main important commentaries: al-Sharh al-Kabir (the Great Commentary) by al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudama’s nephew, Shams al-Din Ibn Qudama al-Maqdisi; and al-Insaf by the famous Hanbali jurist and judge, ‘Ala al-Din al-Mardawi. These two commentaries have remained popular amongst post-Ibn Qudama generations up until today.</p>
<p><i>Al-Muqni’</i>, also has a very popular abridgment by the famous Hanbali jurist Sharf al-Din Abu al-Naja al-Hajjawi called: <i>Zad al-Mustaqni’ fi Ikhtisar al-Muqni’</i>. This abridgement became particularly famous amongst the Hanbalis from <a href="../../../n/a/j/Najd.html" title="Najd">Najd</a>, where it is regarded as the primer to the Madhab. The most common and widely accepted commentary on Zad was written by the Egyptian Hanbali jurist, Mansur b. Yunus al-Buhuti called: <i>al-Rawdh al-Murbi’</i>, which was further commented on by the Najdi-Hanbali jurist, ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Muhammad b. Qasim. The latter commentary, which is informally known as <i>Hashiyat Ibn Qasim</i> is regarded to be one of the greatest contributions to the school in the modern times. Another invaluable contribution to the school has been <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti’ ‘Ala Zad al-Mustaqni’</i>, by the famous and profound Hanbali jurist, theologian, traditionist, linguist and a grammarian, <i>Muhammad b. Salih al-‘Uthaimin</i>. Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, originally, was delivered as a series of lectures over the years, which was then written, compiled and then published by his loyal students into volumes.</p>
<p>The aforementioned author of Zad al-Mustaqni’ – al-Hajjawi, is also the author of <i>al-Iqna’</i> which serves today as a major reference work for verdicts (<i>Ifta</i>) in Saudi Arabia, along with <i>Muntaha al-Iradat</i> by al-Futuhi. Both of these voluminous manuals have been commented on by several authors. The most famous of those commentaries are <i>Kashaf al-Qina’ ‘An Matn al-Iqna’</i>, which is a commentary on al-Iqna’, and Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat, both by al-Buhuti.</p>

<p>Many celebrated personalities in the Islamic history received their tutelage in the Hanbali school, in Baghdad, Greater Syria (<i><a href="../../../s/h/a/Sham.html" title="Sham">Sham</a></i>), <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and finally the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabian_Peninsula_3421.html" title="Arabian Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>. The following is a very humble list comprising of some of the notable Hanbalis – bar the direct students of Imam Ahmad:</p>
<p><a name="Increasing_Number_of_Hanbalis" id="Increasing_Number_of_Hanbalis"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_ibn_Hanbal_8396.html" title="Edit section: Increasing Number of Hanbalis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Increasing Number of Hanbalis</span></h4>
<p>Historically, the Hanbali Madhab has always been known for having fewer followers comparatively to the remaining schools. Some even argued that the small number of followers was indicative of an inherent weakness of the Madhab and its lack of popularity. Hanbalis often responded with the following verse of poetry:</p>
<p><i>Yaquluna fi ashabi ahmada qillatun</i></p>
<p><i>Fa qultu lahum inn al-kirama qalilu</i></p>
<p><i>They say of Ahmad’s followers: How few they are!</i></p>
<p><i>Thus, I said to them: The dignified are always few</i></p>
<p>The secret behind the spread of any particular Madhab, or lack thereof, has mainly been the authorities, responsible for bestowing the Islamic courts to one faction, at the expense of the other. In a land where courts were dominated by a particular Madhab, a student qualifying in a different Madhab had no future, and consequently, was forced to migrate, or embrace the native Madhab.</p>
<p>The Hanbalis, however, had an inherent tendency of declining lofty positions offered by the authorities. Hence, Abu al-Wafa Ibn ‘Aqil al-Hanbali remarks that the Hanbali Madhab has been ‘oppressed’ by none other than Hanbalis themselves. For whenever a Hanbali would excel in knowledge, he would submerge himself in worship and gratitude to Allah, embrace the ascetic life (<i><a href="../../../z/u/h/Zuhd.html" title="Zuhd">Zuhd</a></i>) and divorce himself from fame, status and worldly life. This was also confirmed by a prominent Shafi’i traditionist and a historian, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Dhahabi_ee80.html" title="Al-Dhahabi">al-Dhahabi</a>, in his book <i>Zaghl al-‘Ilm</i> where he describes the Hanbalis with similar distinguishing qualities.</p>
<p>The Hanbalis had remained an insignificant minority, and perhaps, close to extinction, until Muhammad b. ‘Abd al-Wahhab arose in Najd forming an influential revivalist movement, with the aim to purify the true understanding of Islamic monotheism (<i><a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawhid.html" title="Tawhid">Tawhid</a></i>), in a society stained with pre-Islamic pagan beliefs and practices. After a period of persecution and exile, he joined forces with Muhammad b. Su’ud and successfully revived the enforcement of the much-neglected Shariah laws.</p>
<p>It is solely to the credit of the <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahhabism.html" title="Wahhabism">Wahhabist</a> revivalist movement, that until today, the courts in the Arabian Peninsula are predominantly Hanbali, bar some areas to the south near Yemen, which still remain Shafi’i. The significance of the Wahhabist call is demonstrated in an undeniable fact that nearly all Islamic reformist movements in the 20th century, directly or indirectly, are influenced by the basic call of Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab. Egypt, for example, apart from being the centre for Ash’ari learning, with its political life dominated by a brutal socialist-dictatorship, has been historically at odds with the followers of Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab; yet, one cannot but notice that the majority of ‘The Youth of Awakening’ (<i>Shabab al-Sahwah</i>) are somewhat more inclined towards the Wahhabist thought than the dogma propagated by the local <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Azhar_ee7d.html" title="Al-Azhar">Azharites</a>. Hence, it comes at no surprise that ‘Wahhabism’ has been singled out as an ideological target in the so-called ‘War on Terror’.</p>
<p>A scant reading of the Islamic history illustrates that the Hanbalis are known for having an outstanding character, fearlessness and eagerness for <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hisbah.html" title="Hisbah">enjoining the good and forbidding the evil</a>, with Imam Ahmad setting the precedence by remaining steadfast during the inquisition. After the demise of Imam Ahmad, the Hanbalis grew stronger in Baghdad, and as Ibn ‘Asakir notes, they would patrol the streets, during which, if they noticed a man with an unrelated woman, they would report him to the police; or if they noticed a musical instrument or a bottle of alcohol, they would smash it. Al-Khiraqi, who was the first Hanbali scholar to write a Fiqh manual, died after being severely beaten while attempting to combat evils in Damascus. <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Taymiyah_c222.html" title="Ibn Taymiyah">Ibn Taymiyah</a> would likewise patrol the streets with his students, during which, if they noticed anyone playing chess they disrupt the game; or if they saw utensils of alcohol or musical instruments, they would smash them. Ibn Taymiyah was also greatly admired for his fearless encounter with the ruthless Mongolian invader of Damascus, <a href="../../../q/a/z/Qazan.html" title="Qazan">Qazan</a>; as he is also remembered for his frequent imprisonment for in defence of the orthodox doctrine.</p>
