<p>Ahmad came to power as a result of a plot against his brother <a href="../../../h/u/s/Husain_%28Jalayirids%29_c218.html" title="Husain (Jalayirids)">Husain</a>. In <a href="../../../1/3/8/1382.html" title="1382">1382</a> he departed from <a href="../../../a/r/d/Ardabil.html" title="Ardabil">Ardabil</a>, which he had been given control of, and took <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabriz.html" title="Tabriz">Tabriz</a>; Husain was captured and executed. Ahmad's other brothers, Shaikh 'Ali and <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayazid_%28Jalayirids%29_5ea6.html" title="Bayazid (Jalayirids)">Bayazid</a> opposed him; Husain's former amir, 'Adil Aqa, had Bayazid proclaimed sultan in <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soltaniyeh.html" title="Soltaniyeh">Soltaniyeh</a>, while Shaikh 'Ali prepared to leave <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> and march on Tabriz. To secure his position, Ahmad requested the assistance of the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sheep_Turkmen_0656.html" title="Black Sheep Turkmen">Black Sheep Turkmen</a>. Shaikh 'Ali fell in battle against the Turkmen; within two years Ahmad was also able to neutralize Bayazid (see <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayazid_%28Jalayirids%29_5ea6.html" title="Bayazid (Jalayirids)">Bayazid (Jalayirids)</a> for further details).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_%28Jalayirids%29_0b4d.html" title="Edit section: Conflict With Timur">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conflict With Timur</span></h2>
<p>In the spring of <a href="../../../1/3/8/1384.html" title="1384">1384</a> the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chagatai_Khanate_f57a.html" title="Chagatai Khanate">Chagatai</a> amir <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timur.html" title="Timur">Timur</a> attacked the Jalayirids. Although Sultan Ahmad was not captured, his subordinates in <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soltaniyeh.html" title="Soltaniyeh">Soltaniyeh</a> failed to defend the town and Timur took it with a minimum of resistance. Timur gave the town to 'Adil Aqa, who had defected to him, before retiring from the campaign. Ahmad then sent an army to retake Soltaniyeh, but 'Adil Aqa successfully defended it.</p>
<p>In the midst of Timur's absence, Sultan Ahmad had to deal with an invasion by <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokhtamysh.html" title="Tokhtamysh">Tokhtamysh</a>, khan of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Horde_f111.html" title="Golden Horde">Golden Horde</a>. Tokhtamysh's troops swept down into <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, devastating the land, and Tabriz was sacked in around the end of <a href="../../../1/3/8/1385.html" title="1385">1385</a>. This raid significantly weakened Ahmad's position; he consequently could not combat Timur when he returned in <a href="../../../1/3/8/1386.html" title="1386">1386</a>. Tabriz was taken by the Chagatais in the summer; its citizens had to pay a heavy tribute. 'Adil Aqa collected the tribute but was executed by Timur, who suspected him of corruption. Azerbaijan from this point on remained in the control of the Timurids, as Ahmad could not recover the province.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/3/9/1393.html" title="1393">1393</a> Timur renewed the war with Sultan Ahmad. Near the end of August, he arrived at Baghdad, where Ahmad was residing. Deciding that defending the city was impossible, Ahmad fled and traveled to <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mameluke.html" title="Mameluke">Mameluke</a> Syria, and was granted asylum by Sultan <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkuk.html" title="Berkuk">Berkuk</a>. Although Baghdad was forced to pay a ransom and many captives, including Ahmad's son Ala al-Daula, were taken with Timur when he left the city, most of the citizenry were left unharmed. A <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarbadars.html" title="Sarbadars">Sarbadar</a>, Khwaja Mas'ud Sabzavari, was given control of the city.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/3/9/1394.html" title="1394">1394</a> Sultan Ahmad returned to Baghdad; Khwaja Mas'ud withdrew his forces instead of fighting. As a result, Ahmad was able to regain control of the city for the next six years. He grew increasingly unpopular, however, and in <a href="../../../1/3/9/1397.html" title="1397">1397</a> or <a href="../../../1/3/9/1398.html" title="1398">1398</a> an unsuccessful conspiracy was hatched against him. Feeling unsafe in Baghdad, he left the city and requested the assistance of the Black Sheep under <a href="../../../q/a/r/Qara_Yusuf_283f.html" title="Qara Yusuf">Qara Yusuf</a>. The Turkmen arrived at the city, but Ahmad had a difficult time in preventing them from plundering Baghdad, and he eventually turned them back. In 1398 Timur's son and governor of Azerbaijan, <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miran_Shah_a446.html" title="Miran Shah">Miran Shah</a>, attempted to take Baghdad but Ahmad successfully resisted him. In <a href="../../../1/3/9/1399.html" title="1399">1399</a> a <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28country%29.html" title="Georgia (country)">Georgian</a> raised the siege of the town of Alenjaq, which the Timurids had been attempting to take for more than a decade. The leader of the Georgian army, one of Ahmad's sons, came to Baghdad, but rebelled and was killed.</p>
<p>When Timur returned from campaigns in the east in <a href="../../../1/4/0/1400.html" title="1400">1400</a>, Sultan Ahmad feared that he would be attacked and left Baghdad; he returned for a short while but then left again, taking refuge with the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottomans.html" title="Ottomans">Ottomans</a>. In May <a href="../../../1/4/0/1401.html" title="1401">1401</a> a group of Chagatais sent to Baghdad by Timur encountered resistance; although more Timurid troops were sent the city commander, unaware that they were Timur's forces, refused to give in. Timur himself soon arrived and Baghdad was subjected to a forty day siege; when it still refused to surrender he order the city stormed. Once it was taken, nearly all of the men, women and children were massacred and most of the public buildings were destroyed. The destruction was so widespread that Timur did not even bother to install a governor.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, however, Sultan Ahmad yet again returned to Baghdad and began to rebuild it. Although a contingent of Chagatais nearly captured him, he came back a few months later in <a href="../../../1/4/0/1402.html" title="1402">1402</a> with the Black Sheep Turkmen ruler Qara Yusuf, who had also sought refuge with the Ottomans. Their friendship, however, did not last, and Qara Yusuf expelled Ahmad from the city. Ahmad fled to the Mamelukes a second time, who however imprisoned him out of fear of Timur. In <a href="../../../1/4/0/1403.html" title="1403">1403</a> Qara Yusuf was driven out of Baghdad by the Timurids, and sought asylum with the Mamelukes, who imprisoned him also. Together in prison, the two leaders renewed their friendship and struck an agreement with each other; Ahmad would retain <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, while Qara Yusuf would take over Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>When Timur died in <a href="../../../1/4/0/1405.html" title="1405">1405</a>, the Mamelukes released Sultan Ahmad, who returned to Baghdad, and Qara Yusuf, who took up residence in Tabriz. In spite of their agreement, however, it did not last. Ahmad wanted to regain Azerbaijan; as a result he attacked the Black Sheep. He managed to occupy Tabriz for a brief time, but was defeated in August of <a href="../../../1/4/1/1410.html" title="1410">1410</a>. He was then captured by Qara Yusuf and executed; Ahmad's son Ala al-Daula, who had been released by the Timurids, was also killed. Ahmad's nephew Sultan Valad briefly succeeded him in Baghdad but the Black Sheep took the city a year later.</p>
