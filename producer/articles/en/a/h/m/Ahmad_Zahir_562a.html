Born to a royal <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court.html" title="Court">court</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physician.html" title="Physician">doctor</a> who was also a one-time <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_minister.html" title="Prime minister">prime minister</a>, his father-Abdul Zahir-was an influential figure in the <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahir_Shah_df9c.html" title="Zahir Shah">Zahir Shah</a> era. Due to his nobility of birth, Ahmad’s profession as a singer later became a point of contention between the singer and his <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elitist.html" title="Elitist">elitist</a> father. Still he loved to sing and pressured by his fan's also to keep performing.</p>
<p>The singer’s interest in music developed early on with his involvements in his high school’s band in the early 1960s. The <b>Amateur Band of Habibia High School</b>, as they became known, modeled themselves after such <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_world.html" title="Western world">Western</a> musical groups as the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatles.html" title="Beatles">Beatles</a>. The five-member band garnered notability with their performances in local <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert.html" title="Concert">concerts</a>. Most of these were on occasions of large celebrations (<a href="../../../n/o/u/Nouroz.html" title="Nouroz">Nouroz</a>, <a href="../../../e/i/d/Eid.html" title="Eid">Eid</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghan_Independence_Day_5449.html" title="Afghan Independence Day">Afghan Independence Day</a>, etc.) and were centered in or around <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a>.</p>

<p>Rising from the acclaim of the band, Ahmad Zahir branched onto his solo career by the late 1960s. Much to the dismay of his father who looked forward to a political career for his son, Ahmad didn’t follow his father’s footsteps in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statesmanship.html" title="Statesmanship">statesmanship</a>. Instead, he retained his political insight and later on integrated them into his music. Carrying his musical instincts to new heights, he began composing songs based on well recognized verses of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_poetry.html" title="Persian poetry">Persian poetry</a>. The meaning and depth of his songs quickly garnered him national attention as did the tenor voice that was complementary to a wide range of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_notes.html" title="Musical notes">musical notes</a>. This work earned critics’ commendation, marking him one of the few musicians who achieved this prestigious honor from the start. The release of his first album was celebrated on radio and newspapers across Afghanistan as jubilant fans fought for the remaining copies of the <a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_seller.html" title="Best seller">best seller</a>.</p>

<p>Earning such wide renown, Ahmad was quickly introduced to the best of Afghanistan’s <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_scene.html" title="Music scene">music scene</a> by the thrilled <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recording_studios.html" title="Recording studios">recording studios</a>.

His songs were noted for their mellifluous tone, poetic style, compelling depth, and passionate emotional evocation. Creating an aesthetic vocabulary in dealing with joy, love, pain, and loneliness in his music that is seen as unparalleled by other Afghan singers. Covering such wide range of subjects, his music had a multi-dimensional lure. Most of this songs were autobiographical.</p>
<p>After 1970, some years he released more than two albums; and by 1973 (<i>1352 of Afghan Calendar</i>), his popularity had developed into a national frenzy. Dominating all the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media.html" title="Media">media</a> of Afghanistan, the <b>Ahmad Zahir Subject</b> was the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headlines.html" title="Headlines">headlines</a> of magazines and radio stations.

After returning to Afghanistan following his well received Iran tour, Ahmad Zahir was conferred the national <b>Singer of the Year</b> award. In his acceptance speech, he advised aspiring singers that <i>"Ghorur shikast hunari bar mewarad…riqabati hunari bayad sahlim bashad nah hasahdat amiz”</i> (vanity brings failure to artistry…competition in arts needs to be void of envy).</p>

<p>With the rise of various <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_faction.html" title="Political faction">political factions</a> in the late 70s, Ahmad Zahir became conscious of the socio-political transformation of Afghanistan. Some of his radical songs such as <i>"Zindagi akhir sarayad"</i> conveys the views of a <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary.html" title="Revolutionary">revolutionary</a> artist. His next song <i>"Ilahi man namedanam"</i> played on the radio stirred controversy for its politically provocative lyrics. According to government insiders, the song's verse <i>"Tu padshah-e haft kishwar"</i> drew criticism from the government. The administration assumed Ahmad Zahir had denounced President <a href="../../../d/a/o/Daoud_Khan_e525.html" title="Daoud Khan">Daoud Khan</a> who was also minister of numerous cabinet positions. Soon radio stations banned the song due to the political pressure levied by the government.</p>
<p>Then in April 1978, the republic was replaced by dictatorship led by President <a href="../../../t/a/r/Taraki.html" title="Taraki">Taraki</a> and eventually by <a href="../../../h/a/f/Hafizullah_Amin_d6eb.html" title="Hafizullah Amin">Hafizullah Amin</a>. In recordings of his upcoming albums, he voiced his protest against the Taraki-Amin regime in at least three songs: <i>"Safar bih roshenahi"</i> and <i>"Chi mulk ra baad"</i> and <i>"Bigzarad bigzarad."</i> In the last song, he referred to Taraki as <i>Tariki</i> (<a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a>: darkness), making a mockery of the new political leader.</p>

<p>Ahmad Zahir's life came to an end on his birthday on the morning of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_14.html" title="June 14">June 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. Ahmad Zahir was on the Salang pass Highway when reportedly he was involved in a so called automobile accident that caused his death but soon after Ahmad Zahir's body was brought back to <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a> some of his closest friends said that Ahmad Zahir was accompanied with a man and a women when he left Kabul to head to the North. Many people say that it was his good friend who was with Ahmad that sad day and is to be believed to been involved in Ahmad Zahir's murder by being payed off by Army Officer Taloon who was assigned to (Get rid of Ahmad Zahir) by CIA, in order to give the newly formed communist regime a bad name. Others say that Hafizullah Amin killed him, because his daughter was in love with him, and Ahmad Zahir was someone who never stayed with one girl.</p>

<p>To this day, there is no solid agreement as to what exactly caused Ahmad Zahir's death. While some theorize the windy roads of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salang.html" title="Salang">Salang</a> as the main cause, others cite <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> as the culprit. However, a growing body of evidence accumulated suggest possibly <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foul_play.html" title="Foul play">foul play</a> on behalf of the antagonized political figures or possibly in-laws involvements. Some doctors, who later re-examined Ahmad Zahir’s body after <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autopsy.html" title="Autopsy">autopsy</a>, concluded he was also shot in the head. As to when he was shot, before or after the accident, could not be determined.</p>
<p>Theories have emerged as to possible suspects in Ahmad Zahir’s murder, if it was classified as such. They are 1) Taraki-Amin regime henchmen whom he had condemned in his songs, 2) the powerful family of his second wife who were unhappy with his liberal lifestyle.</p>
