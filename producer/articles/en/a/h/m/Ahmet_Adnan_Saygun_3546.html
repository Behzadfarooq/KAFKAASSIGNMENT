Ahmet Adnan Saygun is acknowledged as one of the most important 20th century composers in <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_music.html" title="Turkish music">Turkish music</a> history.</p>
<p>He was a master of the neoclassical form, and his works are rooted in Western musical practice; yet they incorporate traditional Turkish folk songs and culture. He usually adds this folk element by picking one note out of the scale and weaves a melody around it using a Turkish mode. His extensive output includes five symphonies, five operas, two piano concertos, concertos for violin, viola and cello, and a wide range of chamber and choral works. The London <i>Times</i> called him "the grand old man of Turkish music, who was to his country what <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Sibelius_d158.html" title="Jean Sibelius">Jean Sibelius</a> is to <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>, what <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manuel_de_Falla_edb5.html" title="Manuel de Falla">Manuel de Falla</a> is to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, and what <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/l/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k_5ab9.html" title="Béla Bartók">Béla Bartók</a> is to <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>."

<p>Ahmet Adnan Saygun was born in 1907 in İzmir, Turkey. There were frequent concerts given by the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_military_band.html" title="Ottoman military band">Ottoman military bands</a>, and performances of Western works by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamber_music.html" title="Chamber music">chamber music</a> ensembles at the time and this influenced Saygun to start his first music lessons in elementary school. He started playing the piano, the Ottoman short-necked lute and the <a href="../../../o/u/d/Oud.html" title="Oud">oud</a> at an early age and quickly found his passion writing music at the age of fourteen. His father who was a mathematics teacher and scholar of religions and literature taught him English and French as well as world religions at an early age. Through rigorous study Saygun was able to translate the music section of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grande_Encyclopedie_fb46.html" title="Grande Encyclopedie">Grande Encyclopedie</a> into a music encyclopedia in <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a>. While in high school, he continued his music lessons with lessons in school as well as from a private teacher and through a theory book which he was given at an early age. In 1926, only two years after his graduation from high school he was appointed as teacher of music at a high school in his native city of İzmir.</p>
<p>In 1928 he was recognized nationally and received a grant to study in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> by the Turkish state. He attended the Schola Cantorum in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> where he studied composition with <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_d%27Indy_ed6d.html" title="Vincent d'Indy">Vincent d'Indy</a>, theory and counterpoint with Eugène Borrel, organ with Souber Bielle and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_chant.html" title="Gregorian chant">Gregorian chant</a> with Amadée Gastoue. He was further introduced to late-romantic music and French impressionism. During this time his imagination flourished, enabling him to write his first large work for orchestra: <i>Divertimento</i>. This piece won him an award in 1931 in Paris and was performed with great success. In 1931 he returned to Turkey as a music teacher for a new establishment found by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk that aimed to train music teachers with respect to the new law of arts. This suggested that previous training standards had to be changed to meet Western musical standards. Musical education adopted Western musical practices as part of this new era in Turkey.</p>
<p>In 1934 he was appointed as the conductor of the prestigious Presidential Symphony Orchestra. That very same year Atatürk approached Saygun, asking him to write the first Turkish opera. As Saygun was a huge follower of Atatürk he accepted his offer with great warmth and in two months time finished writing the first Turkish opera, <i>Özsoy</i>. The opera's theme was how Turkey developed after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> and showcased Atatürk's teachings. Following <i>Özsoy'</i>s success Atatürk asked Saygun to write another opera suggesting the heroism of the Turks and Atatürk's devotion to his country and people.</p>
<p>Saygun quickly finished his second opera <i>Taşbebek</i> in that very same year. This was the year that marked Saygun's career as the "voice" of the newly founded republic of Turkey. He now was the musical symbol of his country and had dedicated his works and life for the people and his country, like his great admirer Atatürk.</p>
<p>Following the operas he moved to <a href="../../../i/s/t/%C4%B0stanbul_ce94.html" title="İstanbul">İstanbul</a> as part of the theory faculty at the İstanbul State Conservatory of Music. In 1936 <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/l/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k_5ab9.html" title="Béla Bartók">Béla Bartók</a> visited Turkey to research the native folk music. Saygun accompanied Bartók on his travels around the country, collecting and transcribing folk songs all through the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatolia.html" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> and <a href="../../../o/s/m/Osmaniye.html" title="Osmaniye">Osmaniye</a> regions of Turkey. Saygun gained immense knowledge of Bartók's style of writing during this trip and learned a great deal about string quartets: they became great friends.</p>
<p>In 1939 he was invited back to <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankara.html" title="Ankara">Ankara</a> to further promote Western musical activities and practices. A year later he formed his own organization, <i>Ses ve Tel Birliği</i>, which showcased recitals and concerts throughout the country, further developing public knowledge of Western classical music.</p>
<p>Saygun's international acclaim flourished with his <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oratorio.html" title="Oratorio">oratorio</a> <i>Yunus Emre</i> in 1946. This is an hour-long work written for four vocal soloists, a full chorus and full orchestra that sets a number of poems by the 13th century Anatolian mystic poet <a href="../../../y/u/n/Yunus_Emre_290f.html" title="Yunus Emre">Yunus Emre</a>. This work captures <i>Yunus Emre'</i>s legacy with the use of Turkish modes and folk melodies, although it is written in the post-romantic style. Since its premiere in Ankara in 1947, the oratorio has been translated into five languages and performed worldwide, including a performance in English at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> led by conductor <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_Stokowski_a59e.html" title="Leopold Stokowski">Leopold Stokowski</a> with the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_Symphony_Orchestra_3c9e.html" title="NBC Symphony Orchestra">NBC Symphony Orchestra</a> in 1958. This same year he won the Stella della Solidarieta and the <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Sibelius_d158.html" title="Jean Sibelius">Jean Sibelius</a> composition awards.</p>
<p>The success of <i>Yunus Emre</i> encouraged Saygun to compose further large-scale works. In the 1950s he wrote three new operas, his first two symphonies, a piano concerto, and several pieces of chamber music pieces, of which a Paris premiere of the first string quartet (1954) and a premiere of the second string quartet (1958) in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> performed by the <a href="../../../j/u/i/Juilliard_String_Quartet_6bc4.html" title="Juilliard String Quartet">Juilliard String Quartet</a> gained him further international exposure. There followed, amongst other works, three more symphonies, concertos for violin and viola and a second piano concerto, and a third string quartet. A fourth quartet remained unfinished at his death.</p>
<p>Saygun was known not only as a composer but also as a scholar as he wrote and published many books on the teaching of music. He was also an ethnomusicologist and a teacher. He greatly influenced the development of western music in Turkey and helped to establish several new music conservatories, and was also a member of the National Education Council and the board of the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Radio_and_Television_Corporation_498b.html" title="Turkish Radio and Television Corporation">Turkish Radio and Television Corporation</a>. Starting in 1972, he taught composition and ethnomusicology at the State Conservatory in İstanbul until his death in 1991. Following his death, the Ahmet Adnan Saygun Centre for Music Research at <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilkent_University_91be.html" title="Bilkent University">Bilkent University</a> in Ankara, Turkey, was founded where his original manuscripts and archives are also kept.</p>
