<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i><a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawful_combatant.html" title="Lawful combatant">lawful combatants</a></i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>To comply with a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_Information_Act_920f.html" title="Freedom of Information Act">Freedom of Information Act</a> request, during the winter and spring of 2005, the Department of Defense released 507 memoranda. Those 507 memoranda each contained the allegations against a single detainee, prepared for their Combatant Status Review Tribunals. The detainee's name and ID numbers were redacted from all but one of the memoranda. However 169 of the memoranda had the detainee's ID hand-written on the top right hand of the first page corner. When the Department of Defense complied with a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_order.html" title="Court order">court order</a>, and released official lists of the detainee's names and ID numbers it was possible to identify who those 169 were written about. Ahmad Tourson was one of those 169 detainees.<sup id="_ref-SummaryOfEvidence461_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SummaryOfEvidence461" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<li>Tourson acknowledged traveling to Afghanistan by way of Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan. He asserted that he had legal travel papers for all his travels. He traveled to Afghanistan in search of religious freedom. He asserted that there was no religious freedom in China. He pointed out that he brought his family with him.</li>
<li>Tourson denied ever stating that he was a member of any of the organizations of which he was alleged to be a member.</li>
<li>Tourson pointed out an error in the third allegation. Xinjiang is in China's Northwest, not an eastern region of China. Tourson acknowledged being willing to try to win independence from China for his people, but he disputed that his tied him to al Qaida.</li>
<li>Tourson acknowledged being captured near Mazar-E-Sharif <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup>. He and his traveling companion were passing through the area, as part of a movement of refugees. During a discussion whether fleeing as a refugee made him a member of al Qaida:
<dl>
<dd><i>"Everybody passed through on the streets and walked. Foreigners, bad people, good people, soldiers, fighters. Everybody walks through the street and I am passing through the road, then I am captured by General Dostum's troops. It does not explain that all those people are Al Qaida. It is kind of funny looking. Everybody walks in the street, everybody walks.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Tourson acknowledged he received some rifle training -- approximately two hours worth. He thought it would be useful if he ever fought against the Chinese government. He couldn't be sure whether the rifle was an AK-47, or some other kind of rifle.</li>
<li>Tourson acknowledged briefly passing through Konduz as he sought to flee Afghanistan. Tourson's Personal Representative quoted from his session with Tourson:
<dl>
<dd><i>"I never went to go and fight against General Dostum's troops. When I was captured and traveling to safety, I had no weapon, I am not a soldier. I had a family in <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a>, Afghanistan. I was trying to get to my family because the war started.

</dl>
</li>
<li>Tourson acknowledged being present when the riot took place, but denied any participation. He was injured with bombs were dropped on the prison:
<dl>
<dd><i>"I was not a soldier, I have nothing against the Americans. Why would I participate in the riot? Al Uighurs <sup class="noprint">[</sup><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>], have one enemy, the Chinese. We have no other enemies.</dd>
