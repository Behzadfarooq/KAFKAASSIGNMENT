<p>Most of the September 11th terrorist hijackers had planned to crash the planes into the World Trade Center and other important buildings. They wanted to kill Americans and were willing to kill themselves. They simply had the wrong idea about Americans. Some of the terrorists, however, were brainwashed into hijacking the planes, getting their demands, and paying the penalty. For what? They were very uneducated. The suicidal hijackers brainwashed them by saying that America is our enemy, they hate muslims, and they have their troops in middle east getting ready to attack us. With this thought, they dicided to hijack the planes and get the demands met, not knowing what the suicidal hijackers really had planned. Ahmed Alnami did not fight with the hijackers, in fact, after realizing or finding out what some of the other hijackers with him had planned. How? The passangers had found out in UA93 what had happened to the World Trade Center. Ahmed Alnami helped to fight the other suicidal hijackers. In the black box recordings, investigators heard voices in Arabic fighting.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What gives you the idea that these hijackers were uneducated? They had all gone to college and many had taken pilot training. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I would like to believe this is true...but some of the things I have read about Ahmed Alnami are definitely incorrect. On September 11, I watched in horror as did so many Americans as planes flew in to the World Trade Center. As I showered for work that morning I thought the first plane was an accident. As I dressed to leave my house for work the second plane had hit and I figured otherwise. As I drove to my job at a car dealership in Ohio, the Pentagon was hit. Before I sat at my desk I'd heard that a plane had been diverted to our airport 5 minutes from my office because they suspected a bomb was on board. Shortly thereafter, another plane went down in Pennsylvania. It did not take long to begin to think of a file I had thrown away just weeks before containing all the information I had once compiled on a young PILOT who had come in with others to buy a used vehicle and was having trouble convincing me to make an overseas phone call to verify a $15,000.00 wire transfer from the United Arab Emirates. Two weeks before his actual photograph came out in Time Magazine, I told my husband and my neighbor that this young man would look nothing like the other hijackers..that he would be very young, extremely good looking, with a very clean cut appearance. I remembered he first came in in the month of November of 1998 because when I had checked his Driver's License I had marveled at the fact that here was a young man of not quite 22 years of age and already a Pilot (in uniform..cap, name tag and all..very crisp)who had a driver's license listing an address to a Condominium in San Diego, California. He told me he was soon to be moving to Florida. I wanted to know why he was buying a used vehicle in Cleveland if he lived in California and was moving to Florida. He said it was to "make the move". I remarked that I guess being a pilot for a living, he had such an advantage to live from Coast to Coast. He presented a personal check to make the 1600.00 down payment for his "friend's" vehicle. The name on the top of the check was Ahmed A. Alnami. I remembered that name all this time because through the course of the day this transaction drug on for hours..it's not everyday you have to call Saudi Arabia to verify that the money is there..we ended up going through some exchange in London, England..to speak to someone in English to verify funds for this person and to make the arrangements for a wire transfer of $15,000.00 to be sent the following Monday. By this time, Ahmed Alnami had grown so impatient that I had dubbed him secretly in my head as "Animal" for Alnami. It's a nickname I never forgot. The following Monday as I came in to work I heard Mr. Alnami lashing out at a salesman in the front office about the vehicle he had purchased. It was everything they could do to restrain him..the salesman had the most stricken look on his face..and that car deal did not go through. However, in January of 1999 his "friend"..another Pilot did purchase a used truck with the same money from the 15,000.00 wire transfer. I saw both of these "Pilots" several times as they had this vehicle serviced from January thru March or May of 1999. If I am not mistaken, he once gave us a check with a name a mile long and a lot of hyphens in it. I laughed and said I could not take a check knowing it was not him and with this name I could not even pronounce..but I tried to pronounce it anyway because I am a good speller. The name ended with Binalshibh. The check was for a little over one hundred dollars in service work and he was mad and said "look, I just gave you over 16,000.00 and this is the man I work for or a relative or something like that and could I please take the check". After seeing his anger before as I had, I can't remember if I took the check but he paid somehow and left. That was the last I saw of him until his picture came up in Time. I found the old vehicle file on the truck in his friend's name which contained all the info and pictures and social security # and vehicle vin number number and registration along with a NAT/WEST Credit Card and current driver's license number and address and made 3 seperate reports to the FBI but I do not know if they were ever read by anyone at the FBI as no one ever tried to contact me. All I can say is I hope the friend is investigated before he ever pilots another aircraft because if his friend's name ever comes up as having been involved in any kind of hijacking or terrorist activity..I will be the loudest one in the front of the crowd saying "I tried to tell you who he was, where he was, what he drove and his obvious connection to Terrorists..and no one seemed interested". I hope that is never the case I have to make. By the way, Ahmed spoke very good English..but his friend did not say much and did not seem to be anywhere near as smart and heavily disciplined as Ahmed was. Ahmed was far, far beyond his years in the way he carried himself but his temper was one I will never forget. I am curious to know just exactly how the medical experts know if these hijackers are really who they suspect they are if no DNA or Forensics tests could be made if their remains were incinerated. And yes, they absolutly DO show up in groups of foreign men..cell phones handy..all talking on them in Arabic and noting there surroundings. They do not make friendly with others and all pile in the same vehicle to leave although only one is the main spokesperson conducting business. There tends to be a lot of money available to them but they have to "arrange" it and their credit cards tend to not have a lot of room to purchase. They do not carry a lot of on-the-spot cash. Someone is controlling them. Wake up America..Ahmed had the most clear skin and fine bone structure I have ever seen. He was very handsome in his pilot's uniform. He never looked like a Terrorist until after September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>In the black box recordings of the final moments of flight 93, Arab men were heard shouting at each other in their language...at this point, wouldn't they have been arguing with the english-speaking passengers over the controls? Why were they shouting amongst themselves if they were teamed-up? If they were fighting with the passengers over the controls, they wouldn't have been heard shouting in Arabic. The only reason they would shout amongst themselves in their language is that they were going against each other's plans. I don't kno if there is, but i did not see anything in any of the stories written about flight 93 that Ahmed Alnami did anything bad to the passengers or crew, or helped the other hijackers with their plan of crashing the plane in its target. I really think...that he realized the plan, and fought with the passengers against the other hijackers from letting the plane crash into its target.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why would he be the one you think may have done that? Why not one of the other Arab-named people? What makes you think that they didn't need to communicate to each other while there was fighting going on? Of course they would be speaking to each other in Arabic as they told each other what to do while the attack was going on. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not trying to prove a fact, but i read a lot of the stories about flight 93, and none of them state exactly how the flight finished off. I also didn't see anywhere exactly how the 4 hijackers had a role to play in the hijacking. I also read somewhere that not all of the hijackers knew that the planes were going to crash into targets. Ahmed Alnami was one of the hijackers, who the fbi doesn't seem to have much information about at all. Its a possibility that i want to find out about. Amazingly, i didn't see any fact that opposed it yet.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>It's nice that where you read that "not all of the hijackers knew that the planes were going to crash into targets" seems to have the ability to read their minds. Considering they all died, how can anybody know that? -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Someone copied a lot of the talk here, edited it a bit, appended some kind of article at the end and plunked it in the main page. I took it out. Though having read it more slowly, I must say you have an interesting story.</p>
<p>BTW, Zoe, I suspect that you've confused Al-Nami with his close mate Saeed Al-Ghamdi. Al-Ghamdi is largely a cipher; but Al-Nami is quite well-known. The Boston Globe wrote about him some months ago. He usd to be an oud player , and then got relogious and then fanatical on or about 1999. He eventually vanished on his way to Mecca - and then made his appearance on Flight 93.</p>

<p>a) Why is it always al-Nami that gets vandals? It seems odd, nobody ever picks on Hamza! b) <i>This guy is a fucking faggot who deserves to die</i> - it was my understanding he died at some point between the plane plummeting to the ground and leaving a large smoking crater, and today. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherurcij_4567.html" title="User talk:Sherurcij">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Terrorism_01a1.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Terrorism">Terrorist Wikiproject</a>)</sup> 12:46, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
