	    <p>The profile of Ahmed Yehya is prepared and written by me Dina Zulfikar the content manager of site: arab-celebs.com Ahmed Yehya himself verified the information.</p>
<p>Ahmed Yehya's Profile: His directing career started when he was very young, at the age of 21. He started as an assistant director to Hussein Kamal, Helmy Halim, Ashraf Fahmy, and Mouhamed Abd El Aziz.. His first film as a director was the hit film, “AL AZAB EMARA’AA”. The story of directing this film is in itself a story, a story of Ahmed’s love and passion to the cinema. The story started when his stepfather Helmy Halim, the great director and producer had passed away.. Ahmed has always known, and has been told, that he had the skills, abilities, experience, and talent to direct movies on his own. After Helmy Halim passed away, Ahmed decided to lead his own steps as a director, and to stop working as an assistant director.&#160;&#160; Ahmed had always fallen for the plays written by the Swedish writer Strindenburg, who wrote about 27 plays, all about infidelity, Strindenburg ended in seine.. Ahmed chose the play “EL AB”. Ahmed had laid eyes on a powerful script for story “AL AZAB EMRA’AA”; he could not get this script out of his mind. ِAs Ali Zorkani, was the best script writer at this time Ahmed handed the play to the scriptwriter Ali El Zorkany .Ahmed had to pay Ali 3000 LE, for writing the script. He sold the only apartment he had, to buy this script. Ali finally made the script in one year.. He then led the doors of the producers, who have previously encouraged him to direct, and have always believed in his talent. Disappointment,&#160;frustration, failure followed, as those who encouraged him before, feared to gamble or bet on this young fellow,. ……Despite his talent. After two years of complete frustration, he decided to produce the film. . He did not find any distributor to give him loan or buy the film. He even proposed to direct the film for free, and even give the script, which he had brought free to the producer &amp; distributor who agrees to make the film. No way, until by coincidence he met, Riad El Akad, the brother of international director Mustafa El Akad, who was establishing a production company in Egypt, and agreed to produce the film. Finally, Ahmed directed his dream film at last; he chose Mahmoud Yassin, and Nelly for the starring roles. Finally, the film was screened, at this time top stars and directors had their movies screened at the same time, film "AFWAH WA ARANEB", for the legend Faten Hamama, and the director by Henry Barakat was screened at the same timing… big big names!!&#160; Ahmed’s film hit the box office. Big surprise, announcing the birth of this big giant talent Ahmed Yehya.. The film gained respect of audiences and film critics, the film grabbed numerous awards. Ahmed Yehya became the rising super director of the season.&#160; &#160; We need not forget, that Mahmoud Yassin, have always believed in Ahmed’s talent, that he used to lead doors of producers, to offer this script of "ALAZAB EMRA’AA”. Most of the producers thought the story was not suitable, and may not contain the elements of the success in the market, as the story was about a woman trying to make her husband in doubt that he is the father of their only boy.&#160; After the success all producers went to congratulate Ahmed, offering him contracts. And giving him down payments for any project film he may think of. Ahmed Yehya followed his series of success; he directed film "REHLET AL NESYAN", produced by Mahmoud Yassin, as this film was the choice of Mahmoud Yassin who was the premier star. Mahmoud Yassin insisted that Ahmed Yehya would make this film, proving and pointing out to all that Ahmed is a great success. And string of successful films followed.&#160;&#160; Ali El Zorkani, was Ahmed’s favorite script writer, but he passed away, so he dealt with Mustafa Muharam. They made teamwork in the 80’s and 90’s.</p>
