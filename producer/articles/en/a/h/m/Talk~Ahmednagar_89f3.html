<p>Hello, I am Pushkar Deshpande, who lived in Ahmednagar for about 22 years after my birth. I did all my studies including graduation in the city of Ahmednagar. It was really a shock for me to read your information under "Where is Ahmednagar today?". I am not sure what is the basis of your statements like "<b>Most</b> people (including graduated students/professors/teachers/ politicians/public administration officials) in Ahmednagar cann't read/write/speak in English", or the comment about lack of understanding of zip code. Did you carry out any survey in Ahmednagar before making such statements authoritatively? You have also denigrated the birth of cooperative movement in Ahmednagar, by making only a reference. OVERALL THE INFORMATION IS NOT PRESENTED WITH A NEUTRAL POINT OF VIEW and is biased by someone's own views.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi <b>Pushkar</b>, It is a realistic view of the state of the city today. The citizens should improve the city by active participation (not sitting in front of computer) by understanding that state. Please don't waste time going through 'pick and choose' logic of defying my statements. Ignore them and focus on problems you like to solve. The whole idea of that paragraph is to improve city/district. Speak to kids/mentioned people in city/villages. Just pick a book of English grammar and teach them to speak English. I know that city for at least 3 generations (including rural towns). FOCUS ON IMPROVING CITY. SINCE YOU HAVE LIVED FOR 22 YEARS in the city, you must have found at least couple of problems to improve city. Solve them by ACTIVE participation, don't just sit and type whatever using computer. About surveys, you can walk in all parts of city/villages and do your own survey. I am sure you will come up with similar results. I would suggest you to focus on SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, VOLUNTEERING, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT by ACTIVE participation, CIVICS, global PUBLIC Administration and other GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT initiatives for the city. Don't carry too much burden of history. Preserving history as a citizen is all right, don't hang onto it like a rotten politician. Again, that is just a suggestion. (written in Oct 2006).</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Where is Ahmednagar today?</b> : Ahmednagar (sometimes misspelled as Ahmadnagar) is the largest district in the Maharashtra state of India. But it hasn't created LARGEST cultural, economic or social impact in Maharashtra state. Sugar, milk and bank cooperatives thrive here. Ahmednagar is home to 19 sugar factories and is also the birthplace of the cooperative movement. Due to scarce rainfall, Ahmednagar suffers from drought often. Ahmednagar district <b>seriously lacks</b> better infrastructure, schools/colleges, libraries and is mostly sleepy district. The population of the district is exploding but there are not enough public services to support this population. The city lacks good water management programme. Lack of industries creates dark cloud of economy on Ahmednagar. Most people (including graduated students/professors/teachers/ politicians/public administration officials) in Ahmednagar cann't read/write/speak in English. People are living in nearby towns (within 10 miles of Ahmednagar city) for 30+ years but haven't built roads there. There is a lack of enthusiasm in improving city/society with the help of citizens, civic bodies and government ministries. Lack of awareness of volunteering could be another problem. The city lacks knowledgable people and understanding of <b>global</b> development initiatives (most of the literature of these initiatives is in English.). Shortage of water and electrictiy is always a problem in Ahmednagar city and nearby towns. People still can not check and pay phone bill online using Internet. Few people still are not aware of why pin/zip codes are used in address. The city still hasn't created a map that travellers could buy in a bookshop and navigate the city.</p>
<p>Overall, in Ahmednagar, you will never see/hear about initiatives like starting a free library of academic, reference and fiction/nonfiction books in <b>English</b> in community, teaching people to <b>speak</b> in English for free, <b>volunteering</b> for a good cause, organizing science exhibitition, reading for blind children, bringing <b>new</b> industries/companies, reaching new frontiers of science and technology, starting research laboratory to study new <b>science</b> topics for children, putting Ahmednagar on map in <b>international</b> market, preserving history of city, visiting museums, solving water/electricity <b>shortage</b> problem, creating self-reliant sustainable enterprises(<b>eco-economy</b>), understanding of <b>ecology</b> (e.g. falling water tables, extinction of habitat, wind energy, solar energy, biofuels etc.) and how Ahmednagar is connected to world through ecology, building Ahmednagar city in <b>balance</b> with nature (ecology), being responsible <b>global</b> citizens, preparing and distributing a city <b>map</b>, road names/signs in English and Marathi. People living in Ahmednagar should <b>ask</b> themselves about these initiatives everyday and most importantly implement them. (written in Oct 2006).</p>
<hr />
<p>Why doesn't AHMEDNAGAR follow processes that are efficient in other part of the world/cities? This is not 18th century, that we cann't reach people in other part of the world. <b>Technology</b> (computers, phones etc.) is amazing to solve civic problems (village level to national/international level). Use it to keep track of issues at all levels. Most importantly, solve them with civic bodies. Make sure that you have ONLINE process that can track and make people responsible to resolve such issues. You can connect this process right from ground level (village) to state level (village-&gt;town-&gt;district-&gt;state-&gt;intra state-&gt;national-&gt;global). <b>Any citizen of Ahmednagar should be able to see, contribute, track progress of these issues online (on Internet). You may also add dedicated no-charge phone line for this.</b></p>
<hr />
<p>What is this fuss about cricket stadium? It is a fine example of Ahmednagar always working on wrong priorities... Wankhede stadium in Mumbai is the biggest (45000 capacity, <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58324.html" class="external free" title="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58324.html" rel="nofollow">http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58324.html</a>) cricket stadium in Maharashtra. Wankhede stadium will be expanded to accomodate 1.25 lakhs people. Why don't these people (in Ahmednagar) work on making Ahmednagar as <b>BIGGEST english speaking city</b> in Maharashtra? When is Ahmednagar going to understand they need <b>bright</b> minds who can improve city? The first step for that is to learn to speak excellent English (not just read/write it) so that they can understand the <b>ecology</b> of the world by interacting with people all over the world.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why does Ahmednagar need sports complex/stadium? Is it free? Can any kid schedule an appointment and play tennis/cricket free of charge (or minimum charge)? No average kid can afford to pay to go to such sports complex/stadium. Ahmednagar needs people/kids who can <b>play</b> sports, not spectators to see others playing. Sports should be played to build community spirit. They should be played in <b>open spaces</b> in community/neighbourhood. Build <b>open</b> tennis courts(clay courts), basketball courts, volleyball courts in <b>community</b>. It takes less space and effective for kids living in neighborhood. <b>Encourage to play outdoor games that are good for physical and mental exercise</b>. Playing tennis/basketball/soccer for 45 minutes gives that <b>better</b> physical and mental exercise than playing CRICKET for entire day. Ideally, I want to see at least a 2 tennis courts, 1 basketball court, 2 volleyball courts in open spaces per 500 kids in community. You can do this in <b>farms</b> in villages as well. Make sure that when you build such courts that <b>poorest</b> kid in your neighbourhood should be able to play there. Wake up, Ahmednagar!!!</p>
<hr />
<p>How to write proper address with pin/zip code?</p>
<ul>
<li>On First line, Write plot number/house number first then Write house name/complex name</li>
<li>On Second line, write road name, lane name or any other details that point out to your house</li>
<li>On third line, write village/taluka name (this line is optional)</li>
<li>On Fourth line, write city name, state name (in bracket), zip/pin code (Write country name at the end for International address).</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>123, Manor House,</li>
<li>MG Road,</li>
<li>Newasa,</li>
<li>Ahmednagar - 414 0001</li>
</ul>
<p>The fourth line can be written as</p>
<ul>
<li>Bangalore (Karnataka) - 423 0001</li>
</ul>
<p>or for International Address</p>
<ul>
<li>London, 232 2343 (England)</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't write any other junk in address. All kids should be taught this (or any other universal format) format in school itself.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ahmednagar - a bad town planning</b></p>
<p>India is a country that knows science of a good town plannning. Harappan settlements of the Indus Valley civilization (2600 BC) would be one example of this. Why Ahmednagar is still sleeping to understand basic town planning concepts? I haven't seen trees planted in city. The basic rule of planting (at least 5 trees next to your new house when you are constructing it) is not followed. Lack of understanding of ecology throughout administration, government and citizens could be a problem. Ahmednagar needs better <b>ecological town planning</b> that could sustain for future generations.</p>
<p>Here are few books to get started about town planning... We need bright minds who can develop city well, through shared town planning ideas. Can anybody in municipal corporation/government administration/citizen read these books?</p>
