<p>hey Mkweise</p>
<p>i think Ahmedabad is still known as Ahmedabad not Karnavati. Karnavati is a popular name though. can you confirm?</p>
<p>at least till february 2004 it still is Ahmedabad. see <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/468087.cms" class="external autonumber" title="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/468087.cms" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>could anybody confirm if Gandhiji returned to the Ashram before his death or not?</p>
<p>i think he did not return to the Ashram after the Dandi yatra. Also could anyone post pictures of the Ashram itself?</p>

<p>I visited Ahmedabad a year ago. I noticed that we made a good progress in many areas, traffic, transportation and economically.</p>
<p>But the air is dirtier and more poluted.</p>
<p>The water shortage is still the same or worse as was 30 years ago.</p>
<p>People still struggling to fill up their water tanks(dirty) for later use.</p>
<p>The sidewalk of a new main road is being used for bathroom.</p>
<p>Where is the Municipality? it's engineers? Corporators? They need to fund and create septic sewer system for homeless and other people. r</p>
<p>I can provide more information if City Officials or Gujarat State Government or someone interested and willing to take a first step in improvement.</p>
<p>Schematic</p>
<p><a name="Answer" id="Answer"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Answer</span></h2>
<p>You are absolutely right about the pollution and stuff. There are increased cases of asthma in the city, esp. among the young. But in the last two years, there has been a definative development of the city. The Modi Government (this is my personal opinion) is leaving no space for criticism this year, or so it seems. The Vastrapur lake has been developed, and has become another hub for recreation among the youth and the old.</p>
<p>The municipality is working like never before to remove the slum areas and rehabilitate people elsewhere. The sub-urban areas of the city have been developed. Most of the progress can be seen in Vastrapur-Bodakdev area. Multiplexes are coming up, the recent addition being the Red Carpet thetre. There are malls coming up within the next two years. The Iskon Mall, it is supposed that it would be the biggest of the malls over India. There are five malls due. And not to forget the Sabarmati River Front Project, which would include a skyline that would that would change the life people have been living in India.</p>
<p>Pollution is a matter, which has been dealt by the Government of Gujarat very seriously. They have issued a deadline for removal of all petrol run cabs (rickshaws), and CNG installed rickshaws are already plying on the road, having taken the majority in numbers.</p>
<p>The People of Ahmedabad have been getting richer and are much better of than people living in other parts of the country. Compared to Mumbai, there are lesser number of people living in poverty here. The New Court building of the Metropolitan Magistrate Court has taken shape in Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>More later, I will upgrade the Ahmedabad page...</p>

<p>i dont think there are any copyrights violations by copying the entire text. that is a promotional site by the government of india. mentioning the facts in wikipedia does not violate it in any matter. that is not any intellectual property. people need to know. maybe you could post the article again and then mention the webpage in the bibliography.</p>
<p>hey, and d-uh... i apologize for the spelling error, it creeped in by mistake... i am a student in gujarat national law university</p>
<p>thank you Anirudhsbh</p>
<p>Moreover, this is the excerpt from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a></p>
<p>If you find a copyright infringement</p>
<p>It is not the job of rank-and-file Wikipedians to police content for possible copyright infringement, but if you suspect one, you should at the very least bring up the issue on that page's talk page. Others can then examine the situation and take action if needed. The most helpful piece of information you can provide is a URL or other reference to what you believe may be the source of the text.</p>
<p>Some cases will be false alarms. For example, if the contributor was in fact the author of the text that is published elsewhere under different terms, that does not affect their right to post it here under the GFDL. Also, sometimes you will find text elsewhere on the Web that was copied from Wikipedia. In both of these cases, it is a good idea to make a note in the talk page to discourage such false alarms in the future.</p>
<p>If some of the content of a page really is an infringement, then the infringing content should be removed, and a note to that effect should be made on the talk page, along with the original source. If the author's permission is obtained later, the text can be restored.</p>
<p>If all of the content of a page is a suspected copyright infringement, then the page should be listed on Wikipedia:Copyright problems and the content of the page replaced by the standard notice which you can find there. If, after a week, the page still appears to be a copyright infringement, then it may be deleted following the procedures on the votes page.</p>
<p>In extreme cases of contributors continuing to post copyrighted material after appropriate warnings, such users may be blocked from editing to protect the project.</p>
<p>It clearly says that you should, before deleting any entry should bring it on the talk page of the article. Restoring the article, or intimating me now, would be a good idea.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Educational Institutes</span></h2>
<p>The list would be endless, and it does not seem that it is going to stop. I think, only those educational institutes should be mentioned that are major institutes of excellence in Ahmedabad, and not all of them. This page would become more like a propaganda page. I am removing Mount Carmel as of now, because I do not think that schools which are not of extraordinary excellence deserve a place here. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirudhsbh_d34a.html" title="User:Anirudhsbh">Andy123</a> 11:52, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is missing a lot of things. Some of the things I would like to see being added is an economy section (after all Ahmedabad is mostly an industrial city), maybe a separate section on the local restaurant scene as it is a big part of the city, brief description of some of the major projects coming up, and a section on some of the prominent ahmedabad personalities like Vikram Sarabhai (who already has a separate section dedicated to him in Wikipedia).

<dd>Why is this <b>Darpana Academy</b> listed on this page? Is it a notable institution (something which has national or even regional importance?) I have been living in Ahmedabad for the last 13 years of my life, and never ever even heard of the name. I think, such educational institutes should not have any place on articles of Wikipedia. Read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (What Wikipedia is not!) Wikipedia is not a personal propaganda site and should not be spammed like this. Is this some kind of Yellow Page? Then why are mentions such as these<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ahmedabad&amp;diff=44811297&amp;oldid=44800486" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ahmedabad&amp;diff=44811297&amp;oldid=44800486" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> allowed to remain on the page? I want to reach a consensus here, about which notable educational institutions should find a place here. I would be making changes in a week on this page, and I believe that is a fair time to reach a consensus. Please support or disagree with this, and cite your reasons as to why.

<dd>I don't know who added Darpana Academy, but I think you are wrong at that point. Though it is not an educational institution, Darpana is one of the most famous academies of Ahmedabad. It is run by the famous dancer Mallika Sarabhai and organizes drama workshops, classical dance classes, etc. It is located on Ashram Road behind Sabarmati river.</dd>

<p>I propose that we entirely remove the section on educational institutes to a list, and rename the section as Education, giving details about the boards, type of schools, etc. See <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html#Education" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> as an example. Also I do not see how we can apply <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> to this case. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi great</a> 12:07, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Our articles should not have a presence of list material. I've removed most of the stuff. The educational institutes linked to their respective homepages which is a gross misuse of wikipedia as a link farm. Only universities and nationally renowned institutions should be mentioned. The inclusion of multiplexes are basic trivia, and if notable, they should be added to a separate page.

<dd>I already looked at those pictures, but can't seems to figure out where to put them. There is going to be mention of the walled city somewhere. There also needs to be a mention of architecture of the city which could include a pic of the Jama Masjid mosque. Currently I am trying to find an image of either Uttarayan, Navaratri and Kankaria lake. See if you can find some free pics. I could not find any suitable ones on commons.

<dd>I removed the pol picture only for now. That pic is very good and informative, only that it does not fit where it was put. We need to find an appropriate place for that picture, probably under some section called "unique architecture" or something. I think the AMC structure image can be removed and put under an article called <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmedabad_Municipal_Corporation_df7e.html" title="Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation">Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation</a> when that comes into existence.

<dd>Specifically, the first paragraph itself, has only one reference, that is to the World Gazetteer and the rest of the part of the paragraph is unsourced. The History section only has a reference to Setu City Maps and a significant part of the paragraph does not have a cited source, viz. the one that begins from <i>Archeological evidence points out ...</i>. The Economy section does not cite its sources at all. The Civic Administration part is clearly unsourced, apart from an Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation link, which is a link to its members' names and pictures. The Culture section, like I mentioned above (that was me, I forgot to login), does not cite its sources. The first paragraph of the Education section remains unsourced. The Media section is again unsubstantiated. What I suggest here is that, if you cannot find valid sources over the Internet, you are free to use newspapers, magazines and books for sources.

<dd>Ok. I think I agree that there are some places where I may need to provide sources, but I don't agree that every paragraph and line needs a source. I have nearly written the complete article in the format of <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>. If you look at that article, then it too has the similar kinds of sources and in similar places. I don't find anything worth sourcing in the culture section - that is why I asked you to give a specific example. Ditto with the civic administration section. The history section is a bit different. I have added only a few sections there - most of it was taken from the previous version of the article (i.e. before Nichalp's uncluttering). But I will still try and find more sources. I found the exact same version of the history in this new book I got (Ahmedabad Chronicles). So I could add that too as a source, but it adds little value. I have sourced the economy section (had overlooked it). - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 14:31, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A couple of comments regarding the pics</p>
<ul>
<li>IMHO, I think for some of the pics, we need closeups, especially in the culture section (instead of the pic with the laaris, a pic with a single laari/paanipuriwala would be better).. ditto with the Law Garden pic - a pic showing a single stall..</li>
<li>Couldn't we get a Motera pic with some action going on?? An empty stadium pic conveys zero information.</li>
<li>Instead of the AIR tower, perhaps the Doordarshan tower would be more appropriate?? wouldn't you say??</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a>, perhaps you can get out of the B-block, jump the fences/b.s. the chowkidar/write false roll no. at the gate, and head towards Law Garden, camera firmly in hand, and get a few pics.. that would be good... click away..</p>

<dd>The first suggestion can probably be carried out. In light of recent scandals, photography is not allowed in many locations in Ahmedabad. I got the AIR tower pic as my mom works there &amp; that too was without permission. So I doubt if we will be allowed to take a good close up photo of the DD tower. As for Motera, I don't think it will be feasible. Firstly Motera will not be witnessing any action till October (Champions Trophy) which is probably too late. Secondly it is impossible to get a camera in Motera. I had gone there in December to see the India vs Sri Lanka match &amp; was not allowed to take even my cap, let alone anything like a camera. The security is just too strict. Even the Sports club snap was not allowed but I sneaked in past the inattentive security guard &amp; later was chased out by him&#160;;). <b><a href="../../../s/r/i/User%7ESrikeit_d1d6.html" title="User:Srikeit">Srik</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../s/r/i/User%7ESrikeit_d1d6.html" title="User:Srikeit">it</a></b><sup><b><span style="color:#800080">(</span></b><a href="../../../s/r/i/User_talk%7ESrikeit_6c22.html" title="User talk:Srikeit"><span style="color:#18186b;cursor:help;">talk</span></a> ¦ <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Srikeit_067e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Srikeit"><span style="color:#18186b;cursor:help;">✉</span></a><b><span style="color:#800080">)</span></b></sup> <i>18:00, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>seriously?? can't you just stand on one of the buildings opposite to the DD tower and use a moderately powerful zoom.. surely.. something can be done.. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERev.bayes_cd86.html" title="User:Rev.bayes">Rev.bayes</a> 18:03, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we can get the doordarshan photograph from drive-in road, but I agree with srikeit that motera would be nearly impossible. we can probably just get a pic taken from a mobile camera and that wouldn't be of good quality. and the next mtch isn't due till the champions trophy if I am not mistaken. A photograph of a laari would be fine. I don't like that swaminarayan temple image much. IMO there are much better architectural structures in Ahmedabad, especially all the mosques. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 19:39, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Change in civic administration</span></h2>
<p>There has been a major change in the civic administration of Ahmedabad in the past 2 months.
