Last night I attended the launch, in the "<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beehive.html" title="Beehive">Beehive</a>", of a book about him (promoted by members of two parties in Parliament) and was persuaded to buy a copy.

<p>Wow, this article REALLY needs a cleanup on both counts. As it stands, it might have well been written by Zaoui's lawyers. Just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Algeria sentenced him to death in absentia." -no cite, this was Zaoui's claim when in fact, the LEADERS of the FIS are alive in Algeria
<dl>
<dd>I've added a cite. Note that the Algerian referendum of September 2005 may have changed matters.
<dl>
<dd>Comment - the current situation does not change the fact he <i>was</i> sentenced to death in Algeria. No one's disputing that.
<dl>
<dd>As the article stated. The current situation however, offers an amnesty. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a>
<dl>
<dd>The amnesty does not offer any protection from the ongoing torture of disappearances of FIS members, information which you keep removing. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Tell me to get back to work!</a> 02:27, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"a military coup d'etat occurred in Algeria, with <b>French complicity</b>" -no cite, conspiracy theory
<dl>
<dd>The best source I could find was a book in French (which I don't read). This isn't important to the Zaoui article, so I've removed it
<dl>
<dd>The claim has been made by a number of parties (see here <a href="http://algeria-watch.org/en/aw/francalgerie.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://algeria-watch.org/en/aw/francalgerie.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for one such example), but it is contentious, and I don't think it has a place in the article. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Tell me to get back to work!</a> 02:27, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, which will not reveal its reasons" -they have
<dl>
<dd>Good point, although they didn't reveal their reasons for quite some time
<dl>
<dd>Comment - they've released a summary of allegations, and have not released any of the classified information. The only person outside the SIS who will see all the information is the Inspector General
<dl>
<dd>Which also means the RSAA didn't have all the facts. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a>
<dl>
<dd>You've contradicted yourself - either the SIS has revealed its reasons, or they haven't. As for the SIS, see below. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Tell me to get back to work!</a> 02:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"He went to Europe, where he lobbied for a peaceful solution for Algeria. European governments were unsympathetic." -because the armed wing of his party terrorised Algeria
<dl>
<dd>There is considerable doubt that Zaoui was associated with that armed wing.
<dl>
<dd>Comment - the GIA is not generally considered the armed wing of the FIS.
<dl>
<dd>No but the GIA splintered out of the FIS after the election. The FIS' armed wing (and it does have an 'official' one) is the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Salvation_Army_dbd7.html" title="Islamic Salvation Army">Islamic Salvation Army</a>.<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Immediately after the September 11, 2001 attacks, France convicted him in absentia for "associating with terrorists"" -implies 9/11 had something to do with his conviction when his case was already before the courts
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough, I've removed it.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"Following a declaration by the Refugee Status Appeals Authority in August 2003 that he was a <b>genuine asylum seeker</b>," -states that's what they found while ignoring the controversy surrounding the RSAA's declaring "unsafe" his convictions in democratic western countries.
<dl>
<dd>The decision by RSAA was a 215 page document. If we want to say more than those three words, then maybe we should quote their conclusion in full, which is:
<dl>
<dd>"The appellant has a well-founded fear of being prosecuted for a Convention reason if returned to Algeria."</dd>
<dd>"The Authority finds that the appellant is a refugee within the meaning of Article 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention. Refugee status is granted. The appeal is allowed."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I think the three words sums that up adequately. I've linked to a PDF copy of the document.
<dl>
<dd>Comment - the RSAA does not exclude convictions from comparable countries lightly. The reasons are too long to reproduce in full here, but can be found in para's 867 and 868. That said, the protest from these countries about the affront to their courts certainly deserves its place here. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Tell me to get back to work!</a> 10:31, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This section needs to be fleshed out in any case. Outside of Zaoui's supporters, the RSAA's decision is astonishing. We also need to add in the French and Belgian reactions. The cites are already in the references. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a>
<dl>
<dd>Armon, if you haven't already, I would really recommend that you read the RSAA's decision before you disparage it. There's a link on this page... It comes to over 270 pages and is extremely well referenced, and its decision is considered and measured. Your characterisation of the decision as 'astonshing' speaks for itself. The RSAA acknowledges that the SIS would not give it the classified evidence it claims to hold (the SIS is still soliciting for evidence to use against Zaoui), but was highly critical of the very poor standard of unclassified evidence offered against Mr Zaoui. I don't actually hold an opinion on the guilt or innocence of Zaoui, but I _am_ highly critical of the process so far, because of the violations of fair trial principles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a general lack of any skepticism or links critical of Zaoui and his supporters' claims
<dl>
<dd>Please add some. I went look for them. The best I found were a number of sections of David Farrar's blog (<a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz" class="external free" title="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz" rel="nofollow">http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz</a>), but they're scattered over several years worth of moderately prolific blogging. He gave a couple of links he thought summed up the case rather well: <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/archives/010932.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/archives/010932.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, but on examining the links, one comes from the Green Party, and the other is from a blog called NoRightTurn, so I didn't think those links would satisfy you.
<dl>
<dd>Comment - one thing to be careful of is lumping all those concerned for the welfare of Mr Zaoui into one group. While groups like Amnesty International have serious concerns about the nature of the process, and human rights abuses, they don't assert his innocence or guilt of criminal acts.
<dl>
<dd>See <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_international.html#Criticism_and_response" title="Amnesty international">Amnesty_international#Criticism_and_response</a>. When I was a member, AI only supported <b>non-violent</b> prisoners of conscience. If they've slipped into advocating on behalf of people who may be guilty of violence themselves, the criticisms are warranted, and central to a case of a possible terrorist being granted refugee status in NZ. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a>
<dl>
<dd>Did you even read what I wrote? Let me state it again in clear and simple language. Amnesty explicitly does not consider Zaoui a prisoner of conscience, and takes no position on whether he has engaged in violent or terrorist activity. Amnesty's sole concern is for the rights of Mr Zaoui. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Tell me to get back to work!</a> 02:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I've made some comments that I think are relevant. I don't subscribe to a position on whether Mr Zaoui is guilty of the claims against him, but I am disturbed at the large amount of mis-information and confusion surrounding his actions and circumstances. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Tell me to get back to work!</a> 10:31, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK, but you haven't actually pointed to any mis-information and confusion in this article, just slapped the NPOV tag back on. Your biggest beef seems to be too much information re: the SIS summary. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a> 12:44, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That the majority of the article consists of the position of one of the two main actors in this dispute (the other being Zaoui and his counsel) means that it certainly isnt NPOV <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Tell me to get back to work!</a> 02:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/h/m/Talk%7EAhmed_Zaoui_5ed9.html" title="Edit section: SIS Summary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">SIS Summary</span></h2>
<p>I am concerned at the inclusion of the full SIS summary in the article. Firstly, this summary now takes up the bulk of the article, which unbalances it.</p>
<ul>
<li>That's a fair point but it's only temporary. As I said in my edit notes I'm "chipping away at it" -the article will be much longer in the end and will include a "cause celebre" section which will present his supporters critiques of the case against him.</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, assuming we have the right to republish it, it is a source document, and should go in WikiSources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe it should go in both places? If the government has released a document publicly don't WE have the right to publish it? (That's not a rhetorical question)</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedia is not a suitable place for very lengthy quotes, and certainly not a place for the complete text of documents. I would prefer to see a summary of this document, and some of the information in it moved to the main part of the article detailing Zaoui's life before arriving in New Zealand.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 18:55, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I see your point here too, but I think it succinctly describes the issues surrounding Zaoui and the case against him as well as the reasons for the lengthy legal battles surrounding his case. It's a bit long but, ironically, already a summary, and I think anyone coming here to find out about his case needs that information as a starting point.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This brings up a question though -should I not "chip away" at the article but rather submit a full re-write at once? Cheers, <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a> 11:37, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think "chipping away" is a good way to approach it. I don't know what the copyright status of the SIS summary is. There are a number of copies freely available on the web but that means very little. The problem with using the SIS summary as an account of Zaoui's life is that it shouldn't be edited by anyone. If we take the exact same information, but put it in our own words and put it in the "Background" section of the article, with links to the original document, then others can expand on it. As it is, we have much of the same information in both sections. I have no objection to quoting individual paragraphs of the SIS summary, as appropriate.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 18:43, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I put those tags on the article and plan to remove the Disputed tag once I think all the factual errors are gone. I don't however feel I should remove the POV tag until I get at least a second opinion once I think it's neutral -is that the right way to do it? <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a> 11:50, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well I stuck it on in the first place but I admit I haven't done as much on this article as I should have. I don't have a problem with that so I'll take it off.

<dd>I'm putting the tag back on because the SIS summary of allegations is still far to large in relation to the rest of the mans life, and any contrary assertions. It hasn't been chipped away at, which was the rationale for keeping it there.

<dd>Fair point about me not continuing to chip away at the article, but the SIS summary doesnt need it -it's already a summary. His case in NZ is the reason he's notable and therefore even in WP. As for you edits tonight, some are good, some aren't, but none of them cite sources so you'll need to put them in. Please keep in mind though, that claims by Zaoui himself, or via his lawyers, don't meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<dd>The reference to the scars on his arm being caused by the 1986 torture is accepted as true by a court of NZ, after verification from an independent medical expert. As far as I know no-one has contested this except you.

<p>While I didn't add the Amnesty position in the first place, I think something is necessary to balance that paragraph. Otherwise, there is no reason to believe that Zaoui can't go home anytime he wants now that there is an amnesty. Clearly, it isn't as simple as that. The cite for the AI position isn't hard to find: <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/algeria/document.do?id=ENGMDE280052006" class="external text" title="http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/algeria/document.do?id=ENGMDE280052006" rel="nofollow">crtiticism of amnesty</a>, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/algeria/document.do?id=ENGMDE280152006" class="external text" title="http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/algeria/document.do?id=ENGMDE280152006" rel="nofollow">continued torture</a>.

<dd>I would favour the paragraph on the amnesty being rewritten to explain that although there is now an amnesty, and Zaoui is therefore presumably no longer under a death sentence, there are good reasons why he cannot be expected to return to Algeria.

I can't always log in to edit (wikipedia is often extremely slow to load on my connection (up to 10 minutes per page); despite having broadband, meaning logging in can take another 20 minutes).

<p>Cleaned up an egregious bit of misinformation just now -the claim that Zaoui in under a death sentence in Algeria. This is wrong.

<dl>
<dd>Nope, wrong again. He was sentenced to death at his 1993 trial, and then to life imprisonment in 96 and 97, which is where some of the confusion arises. (RSAA para 468). We should also note the serious contravention of the norms of justice (ie these were kangaroo courts) (RSAA paras 466-502) and that no serious legal system in the world would consider these convictions safe. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Tell me to get back to work!</a> 02:03, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The paragraph you refer to states:
<blockquote>
<p>[468] Convictions and sentences were routinely entered in absentia, including the majority of those sentenced to death. This is illustrated by the rather stark figures that exist for the relevant time: between February 1993 and June 1994, 10, 194 people were tried by three Special Courts. Of these, 1127 were sentenced to death (964 in absentia, including the appellant) and 6507 to terms of imprisonment (including life). 2500 were acquitted. Before executions were suspended by moratorium at the end of 1993, 26 people had been executed.</p>
</blockquote>
It not about Zaoui -it's about cases that may be similar to his. The RSAA's inquiry to Interpol produced the <b>two</b> convictions as stated in the text I will restore. As for quoting the paragraphs of the RSAA document -good idea, but you might want to make sure it says what you think it does. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a> 05:43, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm very sorry, but I have a printed copy right in front of me and it states

He was sentenced to death by the Special Courts operating in Algeria at that time</p>

<p>Actually, the pertinent paragraphs are (sorry this will be long):</p>
<p><i>[365] On 14 March 2003, the Authority wrote to the chief executive, invoking his further assistance under section 129P(4) of the Act. Inter alia, we sought:<br />
a) all Interpol and Police communications regarding the appellant since his arrival in New Zealand; and<br />
b) all information about the appellant held by the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (the SIS).<br />
<br />
[366] The material received from Interpol and the Police was reports regarding the appellant's travel and use of a false South African passport and information from Interpol Algeria, setting out warrants against him, issued by the Algerian authorities, namely:<br />
a) Warrant 727/01-p and 160/01-INS, issued on 10 November 2001, for "belonging to and setting up a terrorist group abroad";<br />
b) Criminal conviction No 89.96, dated 26 May 1996, for "establishing a terrorist organisation to destabilise state institutions and terrorise the population";<br />
c) A sentence of life imprisonment, No 173.1997, dated 2 February 1997, for "plotting against the state, criminal conspiracy, inciting armed rebellion and assassinations and destruction of property";<br />
d) A sentence of life imprisonment, No 263/96, dated 12 December 1996, for "acts of aggression to destabilise state institutions and inciting armed rebellion to carry out assassination and destroy property".<br />
<br />
[367] The information received from the SIS was:<br />
a) A report by the Belgian Security Service to the SIS, recording the appellant's conviction in that country;<br />
b) A report by the Swiss Security Service (the SAP) to the SIS, recording the appellant's time in that country;<br />
c) An SIS-compiled chronology of the appellant's background;<br />
d) SIS-compiled reports on the both the GIA and the FIS.<br />
<br />
[368] On 8 April 2003, the Authority wrote again to the chief executive, under section 129P(4) of the Act. Inter alia, the Authority sought:<br />
a) Copies of all communications between Interpol Wellington and Interpol Algeria regarding the appellant;<br />
b) Confirmation that the only outstanding warrants against the appellant are those issued by the Algerian authorities.<br />
<br />
[369] On 9 April, the New Zealand Police confirmed that the appellant is the subject only of the four arrest warrants, all issued by the Algerian authorities, as above and that he is not wanted by any other jurisdiction.</i></p>
<p>See also:</p>
<p><i>[416] That the appellant has been convicted in Algeria of a number of offences is without doubt. What is less clear is the nature of the charges and, in particular, the penalties imposed.</i></p>
<p><i>[417] It is the appellant’s evidence, corroborated by independent material, that he has twice been sentenced to death – at the beginning of August 1993 and in November 1997.</i></p>
<p>The RSAA's belief in his death sentences consisted entirely of Zaoui's testimony:</p>
<p><i>[123] Not long after his return, the appellant learned through friends that, on 27 July 1993, he was convicted in absentia by the Algerian courts of, inter alia, carrying arms, attacking national security and forming armed groups and was sentenced to death. He had been unaware of the charges. In view of the convictions, which he knew were specious, he realised that it would be dangerous for him to remain and he returned to Morocco on 1 August 1993, travelling on the Zenati passport.</i></p>
<p>...for the 1993 sentence, and...</p>
<p><i>[235] On 25 November 1997, Arabic News reported that the appellant (and 19 others, including Anwar Haddam) had been sentenced in absentia to death for "belonging to armed groups and for weapons trafficking". The date of those convictions is uncertain but was, presumably, shortly before the Arabic News article.</i></p>
<p>...for the 1997 one. The RSAA took the view that Zaoui's claims were credible <b>despite</b> the evidence to the contrary. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, you're not entitled your own facts. The "death sentence" issue is a only a (possibly self-serving) claim from Zaoui, and the RSAA's opinion, is only that, opinion. Other democratic governments have been far more skeptical of Zaoui, as have other branches of the NZ government.</p>
<p>Mostlyharmless, please re-read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in order to understand why I am reverting your edits. It is not acceptable to write the article from the RSAA's POV and present opinions as facts.</p>
<p>BTW, the paragraph numbers are from the PDF. Is there any reason to believe that it's non-canonical if it's different from your printed version? If so, we need a better reference. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a> 13:43, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>NO! <b>You don't get it</b>. The information received against Mr Zaoui refers to <b>outstanding</b> warrants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[417] It is the appellant’s evidence, <i>corroborated by independent material</i>, that he has twice been sentenced to death – at the beginning of August 1993 and in November 1997.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis added.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[419] The communiqué from Interpol Algeria to Interpol Wellington refers to the imposition of two sentences of life imprisonment but it is clearly not a complete record of the penalties recorded against the appellant. (We doubt, for example, that he escaped punishment on the May 1996 conviction.) Further, it is reasonable to rely on the information provided to the appellant while he was in Burkina Faso that there were six life sentences. Accordingly we find that the appellant has been convicted of a number of serious terrorist-related offences and sentenced to life imprisonment on six occasions, and on two occasions to death. All convictions were entered in absentia following trials before either the Special Court or the Military Tribunal.</p>
</blockquote>

<dd>I reject those allegations entirely. I came to this article, and then went to Algerian Civil War for more information (being both an FA and something I'd used earlier in the year for research). When I was there I tried editing, as there were significant POV and reliable source issues with some of the information you were contributing. I was reverted without talk after trying to change things, behaviour you're repeating here. In my opinion the debate there remains unresolved, but after realising I didn't have the tenacity to stick it out over you, I gave up. Then I came back here, and haven't touched any of the pages you've edited. I research thoroughly, which is why I looked at your contributions (the contributions link is there for a reason!). This is about content. But it's also about your constant reversions. 210.86.85.138 02:48, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In other words, you went trolling for "ammo" against <i>me</i> -rather than looking up the proper citations you were "too busy" to provide. Also, given the expansion of this talk page since you've arrived, your repeated claim of "I was reverted without talk" is more than slightly dubious- spare me. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a> 03:10, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've just called me a stalker and a troll. Since I realised that you require a much higher standard of proof than any other article I've edited for anything you don't like to stay, I've referenced to as high a standard as possible. But you're right - I have 45,000 words of uni to write in the next 6 weeks, and there is no way I should be here. I would appreciate comment from Deville as to what course of action to take.

<p><i>European lawyers deny Zaoui 'flaws'<br />
23.04.2004<br />
By CATHERINE FIELD<br />
PARIS - France and Belgium, and defence lawyers in those countries, have bluntly rejected allegations made by the Refugee Status Appeals Authority that convictions handed down by their courts against Ahmed Zaoui were flawed.<br />
Those allegations lie at the foundation of the RSAA's decision to classify Zaoui as a man fleeing persecution and thus deserving of refugee status in New Zealand.</i> <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=549&amp;ObjectID=3562202" class="external text" title="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=549&amp;ObjectID=3562202" rel="nofollow">continued</a></p>
<p>From the same article:</p>
<p><i>The note from the French Foreign Ministry followed a request for information regarding Zaoui's trial and conviction in 2001. A French diplomatic source noted that the request for information had come from the New Zealand Government <b>after the RSAA ruling had been handed down</b> - and not while the case unfolded.<br />
In that light, France viewed the Zaoui affair as a turf battle, the source implied.</i></p>

<dd>It is possible to quote sections that are UNCONTROVERSIAL, and NOT OPINIONS, without any comment at all on the convictions in the French and Belgian courts, and the SIS security risk certificate. A large portion of the judgement falls into this category and this is what I've quoted from. I could have gone much further than I have.I could also have quoted from the many sources that go futher still - had I tried to present the position of Mr Zaoui and his counsel, which is still absent, is unlikely to be presented while you are editing this article (and don't you dare accuse me of being a supporter of him! I most certainly am not!) But you seem determined to reject <i>anything</i> the RSAA says as counterfactual. And that disturbs me. But thank you for not reverting me immediately. 210.86.85.138 03:09, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure, there are some facts of the case in the document which are usable without qualification, but not the RSAA's opinions (i.e. their <a href="http://www.tfd.com/judgement" class="external text" title="http://www.tfd.com/judgement" rel="nofollow">judgement</a>) of them. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a> 04:38, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To Deville - the RSAA is an investigative body that is widely regarded as one of the most comprehensive refugee bodies in the world. It is not a soft touch, and rejects around 80% of applications. Until the Zaoui case the NZ Government spoke very highly of it. 210.86.85.138 03:09, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Armon, your emphasis would seem to an uniformed observer to be meaningful. However,the fact that they contacted the French Government <b>after</b> the RSAA judgement is actually irrelevant, as the SIS is entitled to gather information on Mr Zaoui until the end of the SRC process, as they are indeed doing. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Tell me to get back to work!</a> 03:21, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the RSAA presumed to pass judgement on the French case, and they did, finding it "unsafe", then it's highly relevant to note that they hadn't bothered to contact the French authorities themselves. Given his convictions and failed refugee and human-rights claims in 3 different western countries, one would have assumed they would have contacted those governments to begin with.</dd>
<dd>As for how "tough" NZ is on refugees, Zaoui gave his reasons for showing up here as follows:</dd>
<dd><i>[284] The appellant went into hiding. He discussed his situation with X who counselled against going to Australia, where he would be held in detention and recommended that he come to New Zealand. The appellant had read of the New Zealand Prime Minister's humanitarian response to the Tampa crisis and felt encouraged to approach the New Zealand authorities.</i> <a href="http://www.freezaoui.org.nz/docs/rsaa.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freezaoui.org.nz/docs/rsaa.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>
<dd>Turns out he was wrong about being detained...but he did become a cause célèbre, and after years of legal wrangling costing millions of dollars, he's still here. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a> 03:52, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sick of this. Armon miscontrues the truth once again. He's just gone on a POV rant which shows how it's not about getting the most accurate article, but disliking a refugee who has publicity. The opinion of Mr Zaoui about whether NZ was a safe country for asylum doesn't prove anything, so I'm not sure what your point is. The vast majority of the $1.4 million cost so far is the Crown's spending on appeals and the SRC. The reason the legal battles of Zaoui are not over is because of continued delays from the crown. The latest delay to the review of the risk certificate was not due to any fault of Zaoui or his lawyers, rather, the SIS asked for more time so they could try and find more evidence and put together a case, <i>three and a half years after issuing the risk certificate</i>. Incompetent, or just lacking in evidence required to pass by a retired high court judge? I don't want to know.</p>
<p>I'll come straight out and say it - I'm far better informed about Ahmed Zaoui than you are. I've spent much of the last two months researching this case, and have read thousands of pages and dozens of documents, written by all sides. You only ever take things out of context, ignoring the smear campaign launched against Zaoui and the FIS. He might well be guilty of serious criminal acts. But the RSAA was right to disregard the European trials as unsafe. Irrespective of the guilt of Zaoui, the trials were based on hearsay, confusion, unreliable sources, and hyperbole. Much of the evidence they accepted was just plain wrong.</p>
<p>Given the way you're treating anything I put in this article, I have no confidence that waiting this out or going through processes will have any effect. I really don't think that any editors of this encyclopedia have the competence to assess the respective claims of truth of the evidence we're presenting without doing extensive research themselves. Those who can reliably comment on parts, like <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafa_0a95.html" title="User:Mustafa">User:Mustafa</a>, you're just going to reject out of hand.</p>
<p>So, with that, I'm leaving.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, the encyclopedia where truth doesn't matter.</p>

<p>I asked before that the SIS summary not appear in full here, because it's a source document. Source documents do not belong in encyclopedia articles. It also still is unbalancing the article. Please remove it, or I will do so myself. I first asked this in February, and desisted because the article was a work in progress.

<dd>OK I don't actually know how to put it in wikisource -can you do it? <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a> 12:29, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it's not appropriate to include the full summary here. It probably can't go on wikisource either, though, since all content there has to be under a free license.<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Copyright" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Copyright" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> -- <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAvenue_4731.html" title="User:Avenue">Avenue</a> 13:25, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>My feeling is that it doesn't have to go on Wikisource, since we can link to it elsewhere on the web. However, although I have no experience with Wikisource either, I'll figure out how to add this document if someone can show me that it was released under a suitable licence.</dd>
<dd>In the meantime, I have removed the summary from the article in favour of a link to it, and also linked to Zaoui's lawyers' response to it.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 20:50, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
