<h2><span class="mw-headline">Honorifics</span></h2>
<p>First off, I'm deeply sorry if I offended anyone by removing the honorifics (the Peace be upon him references) associated with the prophet Muhammad (I too wish peace upon him). I just don't think it is appropriate to use these in encyclopedia entries. If I am wrong about this, please forgive me and revert the article back to its previous form. Maybe there is a way to do this in a more respectful manner while being neutral. Look at the main entry for <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><b>Who is actually Muslim&#160;?</b></span></h2>
<p>I think there is a dispute first of all to clear who is actually Muslim, there is alot talking over Main stream Muslim but if some one ask them just define first who is Muslim&#160;? they even can not settle on the defination of their own belief&#160;!! it is well known that people of Shia faith do not consider other sects of Islam Muslim and Sunnies and other do not belief the Shiaa's are Muslim, Wahabi consider them Muslim and rest non Muslim, in order to declare Ahmadies non Muslim, first they should consider their own status in the eyes of their own "Brother Muslims" and then declare them Non Muslim. It was a mistake for a National Assembly of a country to decide the faith of a peace full movement, but they all forget the nature of charector these people who were sitting in the Assembely then. All kind of people, with all kind of sins in thier pockets and you expect them to decide about some ones faith, I think people should also read the white paper published by General Zia's Government about the charactors of Assembly members, I think they will be satisfied, if not, then it is just their hate with close eyes you can not do any thing as their is no cure for blind hate. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">Phippi46</a> 00:22, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thats all their is. If you believe in these, you're a muslim, no matter what other muslims say.In the end , just say "what does it matter what they think of you?" its there opinion. --<a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeomMai_464d.html" title="User:AeomMai">AeomMai</a> 18:02, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok fair enough, but Shia Muslim do not belief same way as you do, are you consider them Muslim as well, what about Ahmadies, if some one say that I belief all of these principals, then.. are you willing to take Ahmadies in these context, as Muslim. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 18:52, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I have no right to say who is not a muslim. No more than you or anyone else does.It is for that reason im involved in making these articles more POV --<a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeomMai_464d.html" title="User:AeomMai">AeomMai</a> 21:48, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think 'Invitation to Ahmadiyyat' by Hadhrat Mirza Bahirudin Mahmood Ahmad should clear up the differences between the sects and their differences.</p>
<p>I guess the biggest objection on Ahmadies is their faith on Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as a prophet. Thus they differ in one of the articles of faith namely "Prophets of God" (in which there is no difference between Sunnis and Shias). <a href="../../../y/a/s/User%7EYasirniazkhan_f59d.html" title="User:Yasirniazkhan">Yasir</a> 12:04, 14 Aug 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is the same belief as you may have that Prophet Isa (Jesus) will returned and remain "Prophet", tell us, what you will consider in the days of Isa when for example lets say you are in a time when Isa has return back from Heaven, would you consider him a Prophet, as your belief says that no "Prophet" what so ever can come after Muhammad (PBUH), or you will take him not a Prophet, but some thing else. In this case, this will be the first case, where God gave Honour some one to be a Prophet, but because your belief demands that who ever will say that there is no Prophet after Muhammad (PBUH) he should leave is status of Prophet. What you belief is more dengrous, because you can not belief on Arival of Isa that he is the true Isa, untill he claimed that is not Prophet any more. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 21:47, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Main-Stream Muslims":</p>
<p>According to a consensus of Clerics / Scholars belonging to The Islamic Republic of Pakistan, to be considered a Muslim you need to declare Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as an Apostate.<a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 15:23, Feb 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It did not until 1974!!! Purely motivated by political ambitions of the so called Religious parties. An indication of the prevailing extremism at the time than anything else. An analogy is with the concept of militant Jihad. Up until 9/11 militant Jihad was everywhere inline with the "consensus" of Mullahs. Now many of the same Mullahs can not stop ranting how peaceful and tolerant Islam is - ironically at the same time also accusing Ahmadis of being reluctant towards militancy etc. etc. Bottom line: do not confuse politically motivated edicts issued in a particular time with established believes. This is no justice to Islam and in-fact is giving it a bad name in terms of the tolerant religion that it really is.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is what one has to sign to be considers a Mulsim in Paksitan:</p>
<p>"I am a Muslim and believe in the absolute and unqualified finality of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) the last of the prophets. I do not recognize any person who claims to be a prophet in any sense of the word or of any description what so ever after Muhammad (peace be upon him) or recognise such claimant as prophet or religious reformer as a Muslim. I consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani to be an imposter nabi and also consider his followers, whether belonging to the Lahori or Qadiani group, to be non-Muslims".</p>
<p>Pakistani Muslims are considered "Main Stream" by the rest of the Islamic world.<a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 08:05, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Not meaning that the rest of the 1 billion or so Muslims agree with everything they do in Pakistan. Because if that were so Ahmadis would be banned everywhere by law etc. etc. Are Shias considered "main stream" by Sunnis? If yes why don't Sunnis agree with all Shia beliefs? If not then why don't Sunnis force Shias to Sunni believes? Do not confuse "mainstream" with agreement or the fact that not being “mainstream” takes away anyone’s rights to consider themselves what they want. You are taking a very selective view regarding Ahmadis.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Fact is Pakistan isn't a good example of anything these days and many Pakistanis themselves are ashamed of being Pakistanis. I think we should avoid considering Pakistan a standard of anything let alone a serious item like religion and Islam for that matter. Every 4-5 weeks a church, temple or a Shia mosque or person is attacked in Pakistan. If we take the “mainstream” example then all Muslims everywhere should be doing that. Please do not confuse these extremist acts against anyone as “mainstream” Islamic views - even though there is considerable support for these in current Pakistani society. None of these are according to the spirit of Islam.</li>

<dd>It is a historical fact that Mian Mahmud Ahmed, the son of Mirza Ghulam Ahmed, soon after the father's death declared non-believers in Mirza Ghulam Ahmed's prophethood to be out side the fold of Islam. This was one of the reasons resulting in the split in the movement.<a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 09:01, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad [Mian Mahmud Ahmad], son of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and the editor of a magazine Tash-heezul Azhan wrote and published an article in April 1911, under the title, "Muslim is he who accepts all the Mamurs (those appointed by Allah)." In this article he categorically stated that all Muslims who do not believe in Mirza Ghlam Ahmad's cliam were our side the fold of Islam. Following is a translation from the article:</dd>
<dd>" ... so not only that person who does not call the Promised Messiah a 'kafir' but does not accept his claim to be "Promised Messiah", has been declared a 'kafir', but even that person also, who secretly considers the Promised Messiah as true in his claims, and even does not openly deny it but is reluctant to give a pledge (Baiat) has been shown as a kafir."

<dd>The explaination given in the above audio clip by Mirza Tahir Ahmad for members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community calling other Muslims "<a href="../../../k/a/f/Kafirs.html" title="Kafirs">Kafirs</a>" hinges on attributing a *unique* meaning to this term. According to him this term when used for other muslims refers to their being Kafirs only in the context of their non-belief in Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. However Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad did not make any such distiction in his original statement when he declared main stream Muslims Kafirs. <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 17:55, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The above link shows that the Ahmadiyya Community does believe Muslims to be Kafir in the sense of unbelievers and more importantly they are not non-Muslim. If you read any Ahmadi literature (www.alislam.org) you will see that Non-Ahmadis are referred to as Non-Ahmadi Muslims. Ahmadis believe in the fataw given by Allah in which it is not in any man's authority to declare someone non-Muslim, many Sunnis choose to follow the Fatwa of the 1974 Muslim league instead.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is welcome to speak for themselves, not at the expense of sacrificing a neutral point of view. The use of the term "Kafir" when referring to a certain sect is of great concern and interest to both main-stream muslims as well as Ahmadis. Hence it would be unfair not refer to its usage by Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad. <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 09:07, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look here. I am an Ahmadi, born and raised and we were taught to believe that NO ONE can call another person a kafir. We do call people NON-AHMADI because, if someone is Sunni or Shia then their beliefs are different to ours, but we would NEVER, EVER say that they are non-Muslims. Many decent Sunni and Shia people would obviously say that we are not Sunni or Shia, but would still consider us Muslim. Sadly, many others believe that they nauzobilla have the right to say that we are NON-MUSLIM. Anyway, I'm sick of this inaccurate propoganda about us. Why don't you ask Ahmadis what we believe. Oh no, I forget, many of your leaders tell you not to speak to us in case we infect you with our hertecism. As an Ahmadi I am open to listening to other points of view, I have Sunni friends, Shia Friends, Ismaili friends as well as friends who are of other religions. I do not feel threatened that by talking to them my religion will become somehow tainted - so why are so many other Muslims convinced that by talking to us they will lose their religion - is their religion really so weak?</p>

<dd>Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad [Mian Mahmud Ahmad], son of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and the editor of a magazine Tash-heezul Azhan wrote and published an article in April 1911, under the title, "Muslim is he who accepts all the Mamurs (those appointed by Allah)." In this article he categorically stated that all Muslims who do not believe in Mirza Ghlam Ahmad's cliam were our side the fold of Islam. Following is a translation from the article:</dd>

<dd>Depending on your personal preferred interpretation of the two terms that may be the case. However the Mirza Mahmood Ahmed did use the term "kafir" for non-Ahamdis and that is what the main article alludes to - the issue is not whether the two terms, "Kafir" and "Non-Muslim" are equivalent, but rather: if and how the term "kafir" was used by MMA to describe non-Ahmadis. <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 12:04, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Qur'an 49:15</span></h2>
<p>Translation of Qur'an 49:15:</p>
<p>By YUSUFALI: "Only those are Believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and have never since doubted, but have striven with their belongings and their persons in the Cause of Allah: Such are the sincere ones."</p>
<p>By PICKTHAL: "The (true) believers are those only who believe in Allah and His messenger and afterward doubt not, but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah. Such are the sincere"</p>
<p>This verse may serve as a basis for defining a Muslim. However different sects may want to interpret the term "messenger" differently. Also some may want to add the other conditions mentioned in the verse to the definition in addition to the traditional Kalima Shadat.</p>
<p>The issue here however is not the interpretation of 49:15, but rather, What is the official stand of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Does it consider people who call themselves Muslims and profess the traditional Kalima Shahdat BUT do not believe in the prophet hood of Mirza Ghulam Ahmed and consider him to be an apostate, to be within the fold of Islam? <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 04:41, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reason for split was not what Nazli cites,no Ahmadi Authority has officialy declared any body 'non muslim'. In fact never before 1974 any group or sect has been declared out of pail of Islam. But one should be aware of difference between 'Kafir' and 'Non-Muslim'. it had been common practice between different sects to call each other 'Kaffirs' meaning non believer. In fact it will not be far from fact to say that every sect of the '72' has been called kafir by another sect. It is unique in the 1400 year history of Islam that a government used its highest 'democratic' institution i.e National assembly (House of Commons) to deny the basic right of religious freedom to a section of its population and then denied access to the proceedings by putting a ban on the publication by any party. As for who is considerd muslim by Ahmadis they follow Prophet Muhammads injunction i.e who ever calls himself a muslim is a muslim. What is most important for an Ahmadi is to be muslim in the sight of Allah.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for the split(1914Ad) it was because a group of people in the community maintained that a committee of people will act as the supreme authority of the community.This committee would be called 'Anjuman Ahmadiyya'.One can look back at the history of both communities and where they stand today to see who was right in 1914.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Maulvi Mohammad Ali believed Ahmad as prophet of God</span></h2>
<p>There are several evidences that Maulvi Mohammad Ali believed him as prophet of God for example “Maulvi Muhammad Ali’s Testimony in the Law Court” Witness of Maulvi Mohammad Ali in a law-court:</p>
<p>1. "In regard to a man who claims to be a Nabi (Prophet), where a man denies this claim, he becomes, thereby a `Kazzab '. The Mirza Sahib claims he is a Prophet." 2. "The Mirza Sahib, in many of his works, puts forth this claim which is to the effect that he is a Prophet from God, though he is not the bearer of a new Sharia. Where a man denies a claim of this kind, he becomes, thereby, a `Kazzab '." (File of the law-suit, page 362)</p>
<p>This witness of Maulvi Mohammad Ali in a law-court, under solemn oath.</p>
<p>The Review of Religions, Maulvi Mohammad Ali had a controversy, in writing, with Khawaja Ghulamussaqalain:</p>
<p>1. "Four principles have been laid down by Khawaja Ghulamussaqalain, from his own mind, and he desires to assess the position of Hazarat Mirza Sahib on the basis of principles hammered out by himself. In forging these principles as a valid criterion, he has made a great and a very serious error." (Review of Religions, Vol. 1V, page 395)</p>
<p>2. "I am surprised to find that when they are raising objections, the Christians, and other opponents of the Ahmadiyya Movement, display a remarkable talent for making subtle distinctions; but on the other hand, they fail to perceive an all too potent a point as to what is the distinctive feature which must be found in a man who claims to be a Prophet from God." (Review of Religions, Vol. IV, page 464)</p>
<p>3. "Khawaja Ghulamussaqalain has sought to make four points in rejecting the meaning of my interpretation of the Quranic verse: a. Shaitan swore by the grandeur and glory of the Lord God that he would mislead all. In this Shaitan shows himself as having been successful. b. The people of the Pharaoh used to kill their (of Bani Israel) male children. c. Masih was nailed to the cross. d. The four Khalifas, and the grandchildren of the Holy Prophet Mohammad, five out of six, were slain by the enemy. The point at issue was: what basis has the Quran laid down for knowing a true claimant of Prophethood from another who is false in this claim. Now Khawaja Ghulamussaqalain himself would be highly welcome to explain how he applies his principles validly except in the third point where Jesus Christ comes into the picture, and let us know who and where are the claimants of Prophethood, relevant to the matter under discussion and dispute. Is Shaitan one of the claimants? Were the children of Israel claimants of Nabuwwat? Were the four Khalifas and the sibtain such claimants? If not then where lies the relevancy of his principles to the matter under dispute?" (Review of Religions, Vol. V. page 432)</p>
<p>Now in this discussion Maulvi Mohammad Ali did not bring in the Ahmad as Mohaddath&#160;; nor in the capacity of a Mojaddid . He brought the Ahmad as a Nabi, a Prophet. He bracketed the Ahmad with Jesus, who was a Prophet; beyond that, the three Khalifas, and the Sibtain were not claimants to Nabuwwat (Prophethood) therefore, reference to them was irrelevant. The point here is that Maulvi Mohammad Ali is presenting the Ahmad in his capacity of a Nabi (a prophet). At the time under reference here, Maulvi Mohammad Ali interpreted theSura Fatiha in the light of another Quranic verse "Who so ever rendered obedience to Allah, and His Messenger, indeed these are the people on whom Allah has showered His blessings. in their capacity as Prophets, Siddiqeen, Shohada and Salihin saying: We have here been ordered to offer this prayer, in its broadest base. The acceptance of this prayer is a foregone conclusion, no matter how an opponent understood, and applied it, and its implications. In any case we stand on the point that Allah can raise a Prophet whenever and where ever in His wisdom He might choose to do so. Also He can confer the rank of Siddiq, Shaheed and Salih on whomsoever He likes. The only thing needed was a sincere supplicant." (Address by Maulvi Mohammad Ali, as reproduced in the AI-Hakam, July 18, 1908, page 6)</p>

<dd>On reading this book it is clear that at no point in his life did Maulana Mohammad Ali ascribe the terms "nabi" and "rasool" to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in the manner used for the previous prophets.

<p>Whenever and wherever I have refused to be called a Prophet or Messenger it is only in the sense that having been spiritually benefited by my Great and Noble Master and having been able to acquire his name, I have been endowed with the knowledge of the Unseen. but I repeat it again, that I have brought or introduced no new Law, and have never denied to be called a prophet of this kind. Rather in this very sense God has called me by the names of Prophet and Messenger. So even now I do not deny to be called a Prophet and Messenger in this sense of the word. My saying: MAN NAISTAM RASOOL-O-NIYAA WARDA AMM KITAAB i.e., I am not a Prophet and have brought no book has no connotation other than that I am not a law-bearing prophet. Of course this should also be remembered and never be forgotten that in spite of my being called a Prophet and Messenger, God has informed me that I have not been the recipient of all these spiritual blessings and favours independently and without the mediation of anybody. No; there dwells in heaven a holy being (the Holy Prophet Muhammad) through whose spiritual patronage all this Grace of God has descended on me. It is through his mediation and after having completely merged my whole being into that of the Great Prophet and after having been known as Muhammad and Ahmad that I am a RASUL (Messenger) and NABI (Prophet), that is to say, I have been sent with a mission and have been endowed with the knowledge of the Unseen. In this way my claim to prophethood does in no way interfere with the Holy Prophet's status of KHATAM-AN-NABIYYIN (Seal of the prophets), because I have been able to acquire this name only by reflecting in my person all the excellences of the Great Prophet and by annihilating myself in his consuming love………………………… (Ek Ghalati Ka Izala (The Removal of a Misunderstanding)</p>

<p>If anybody takes an exception to my being called a NABI (Prophet) and a RASUL (Messenger) in my revelations, he is but a fool because my prophethood and messengership do not infringe the divine seal in any way.

But my contention is that there is nothing objectionable in my being called NABI (Prophet) and RASUL (Messenger) after the Holy Prophet who was KHATAM-AN-NABIYYIN (Seal of the prophets) in the true and full sense of the word nor does this fact in any conceivable manner interfere with his status of KHATAM-AN-NABIYYIN.

He who says he is not a follower of the Holy Prophet Muhammad, peace be on him, and claims that he is like one who has been carried away by a fierce flood and is thrown aside and cannot recover himself till he dies."

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"I am with My messenger" (Revelation of Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahamd Qadiani)</span></h2>
<p>As He says [in revelation to me]: "I am with My messenger, standing by him. I put the blame on those who blame him. I shall give you that which lasts forever. For you is a rank in heaven and among those who see. For you We shall show signs and demolish what they build. And they said: Will you make in the earth one who will cause mischief in it? He said: I know what you know not. I will disgrace him who intends to disgrace you. Fear not, surely the messengers fear not when I am with them. The command of Allah has come, so hasten it not, a glad tiding which came to the prophets. O My Ahmad, you are My aim and are with Me. You are from Me like My Oneness and Singleness, and you are from Me at a point which none of the people know. You are honoured in My presence, I have chosen you for Myself. When you are angry I am angry, and whatever you love I love. Allah has preferred you over all things. All praise be to Allah Who made you the Messiah, son of Mary. He (Allah) is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned, and it is a promise ever fulfilled. Allah shall protect you from the enemies, He will attack all those who attack. This is because they disobeyed and transgressed. Is not Allah sufficient for His servant? O mountains, repeat praises (of Allah) with him, and so also birds. Allah has written down: 'I shall certainly triumph, I and My messengers'. And they, after being overcome, shall be triumphant. Allah is with those who are righteous and who do good to others. Those whobelieve, for them is advancement in truth with their Lord. A word from the Merciful Lord. And this day, you become distinct, O guilty ones!" I pray a third time: O my Gracious, Powerful Lord! O my Forgiving, Merciful God! Let only those people have graves in this place who have true faith in this Your messenger, who entertain no hypocrisy, personal ends or suspicion* within their hearts, who show faith and obedience as these ought to be shown, who have, in their hearts, sacrificed their life for You and Your path, with whom You are pleased, and whom You know to be utterly lost in Your love and to have with Your messenger a relationship of fidelity, complete respect, love along with open-hearted faith and devotion. Amen, O Lord of the worlds!</p>

<dd>The fact that Ahmedis are reffered to as Qadiani's is not an issue. As you can see the usage of this term is clearly mentioned later on in the article.

<dd>This is not correct. Both sects have same basic believes. They only differe on "prophethood" of Mirza Qadiani. Both sect have been technically declared as non-Muslims because they both did not believe finality of prophet <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad.html" title="Mohammad">Mohammad</a>.</dd>

<dd>Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement uses a different interpretation of prophethood as compared to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Comunity. The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movementbelieve Prophet Muhammad to be the last prophet. The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement also does not declare other muslims to be "kafirs". Please visit their official websites (<a href="http://www.aaiil.org/index.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.aaiil.org/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.aaiil.org/index.shtml</a> and <a href="http://www.muslim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.muslim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.muslim.org/</a>) for confirmation and further details. It is ufair to group them together with the Lahore Ahmdaiyya Movement and violates the NPOV policy. The fact that BOTH parties have been declated as kafirs (despite their differences in beliefs) by the the majority of muslims is already clearly stated the article.<a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 05:47, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please note that the facts are crystal clear as you can see in the tabular part of the article. The sects have widely different views. It would would be unfair to group both sects together.

<dd>Qadianism is also the accepted name of this new religion. The insistenece by Qadianis to call themselves as <i>Muslims</i> must be balanced by the Muslim counter argument that Qadianis are non-Muslims. This view is repeateddly being censored and removed by Qadianis. It must be emphasized that this is not a Qadiani website and both Qadiani and Muslim arguments must be presented. Muslims are not claiming to be Qadianis but it is Qadianis that claim to be Muslims while following their non-Muslim beliefs.</dd>

<dd>siddiqui: Please check your facts before reverting. The following issues are easily verifiable:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad did not himself declare other muslims as kafirs. His son did so AFTER his death.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. The two Ahmedi sects are seperate entities with widely differing points of views</dd>

I have started to rewrite the section by correcting spellings and cleaning it up. Reverting anymore could get both sides blocked.

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for stepping in. Firstly, the article in its current form is perfectly acceptable. I believe there are five issues here:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad did not declare "main stream" muslims to be non-muslims - his son did so after Ghulam Ahmad's death. An easily verifiable fact by visiting the website of any of the two Ahmedi sects (one link in this regard: <a href="http://www.aaiil.org/text/books/mali/splitahmadiyyamovement/splitahmadiyyamovement.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.aaiil.org/text/books/mali/splitahmadiyyamovement/splitahmadiyyamovement.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.aaiil.org/text/books/mali/splitahmadiyyamovement/splitahmadiyyamovement.shtml</a>). Siddiqui has been insisting in his reversions that it was Mirza Ghulam Ahmad who did so.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2. The two Ahmedi sects have widely differing beliefs, specially in regard to the core issues of the finality of prophet hood and declaring other Muslims as "kafirs". Again easily verifiable facts. Siddiqui has been insisting on grouping both sects together in this regards.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3. The two Ahmedi sects like to refer to themselves as "Ahmedi Muslims" not as followers of "Qadianism". Certain Muslim groups like to use this term (Qadianism) when referring to Ahmedis. Both these facts have been clearly mentioned in the article. However Siddiqui has been insisting on removing all references to this naming issue and using the term Qadiani and Qadianism only.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4. Ghulam Ahmad's proper name is not Mirza Qadiani, it is Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Mirza Qadiani is a colloquial term used by some Muslim groups with derogatory connotations. Siddiqui has been insisting on using the term Mirza Qadiani for all references to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5. All of the above would be non-issues if the a sensible discussion could take place with some effort to verify the facts. <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 20:27, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

All articles dealing with Ahmadis clearly state that they are considered non muslims by the majority of muslims while they themselves consider them selves muslims. This is a NPOV. Stating that they are Kafirs is not NPOV.</dd>

<p>1. The article already referernces the Pakistan constitution. It also clearly states that Ahmadi's are considered Non-Muslims. It clearly gives the reason that they are considered Non-Msulims. It also clearly references and links to sites that provide further detail regarding the Ahmadi's Non-Muslim status.</p>
<p>2. Nowhere does it state that Ahmadi's ARE Muslims. It only states that the Ahmadi's like to refer to themselves as Muslims.</p>
<p>3. Not only this, but these issues are given prime importance by being dealt with at the head of the article.</p>
<p>4. The article clearly states the differences in faith between Ahamdi's and Muslims.</p>
<p>5. In imparting information about the Ahamdi's (since this is wikipedia and not an Ahmadi or Islamist site) a neutral point of view is maintained throughout.</p>
<p>If there are POV issues in the article please highlight these rather than deleting the text and redirecting the page. <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 12:26, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Qadianism was originally fostered by the British imperialism. Hence it has been flourishing under her flag. This movement has completely been disloyal to and dishonest in affairs of the Muslim Ummah. Rather, it has been loyal to Imperialism and Zionism. It has deep associations and cooperation with the anti Islamic forces and teachings especially through the following nefarious methods</p>

<dd>Without doubt the term "Qadiani" has come to be used in a derogatory fashion. There is no contention in this regard. The article already states that this term is considered derogatory. The issue is that this term is widely used. The constitution of Pakistan uses this term to refer to Ahmadi's belonging to the Qadian branch to distinguish them from Lahori Ahmadis: “Quadiani group or the Lahori group (who call themselves `Ahmadis` )”<a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/amendments/2amendment.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/amendments/2amendment.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reversion of multiple Small changes</span></h2>
<p>1. The sentence "Mainstream Muslims consider both Ahmadi sects to be heretics for a number of reasons, chief among them being the question of finality of prophethood, since they believe members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community do not regard the Islamic prophet <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> to be the last prophet", refers to the orthodox Muslim point of view, not the Ahmadi point of view. Hence giving details of Ahmadiyya Muslims Community interpretation of finality of prophethood is in appropriate at this point.</p>
<p>2. Deleting the sentence "He claimed to have fulfilled the prophecy of the return of Jesus" would also be inappropriate since the controversy surrounding Mirza Ghulam Ahmad stems from this claim.</p>
<p>3. The Ahmadiyya Muslims Community does believe Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be a non-law bearing prophet. Deleting references to this does not make sense.</p>
<p>4. The sentence "They do not believe that he is a prophet and this is what mainstream Muslims do not understand. The Ahmadiyya Community believes that the Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) was the final prophet." is inaccurate unless the issue of the of a "non-law bearing prophet" is also presented in the same context.</p>

<p>I do not think its correct, in all major religions, Islam is the last one.

<p>I think the NPOV would be to state, "final, law-bearing Prophet of Islam", at least from the Islamic perspective. All Muslims can agree that he was the last law-bearing Prophet, no?

<dd>With reference to Test01's edit summary. I agree that most Muslims may not be aware of the issues involved in declaring Ahmadi's non-muslims. I also agree that even though Paksitan, Bangaladesh et al are muslims nations they are not representative of ALL muslims. I also agree that the fact that some national assembly declared someone non muslims does not necessarily make them so. However that facts need to be stated to clearly to maintain a neutral point of view. Also Ahmadis are widely known as Qadianis. This fact need to be stated in the article. The fact that this term is considred by some as derogatory also need to be clearly stated to maintain a neutral point of view. Both these issues are referenced.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recent Changes</span></h2>
<p>Changes in the following areas were reverted:</p>
<p>1. Ahmadi's refer to themselves as muslims. The fact that they are considered non-muslims by many other muslims is clearly stated. Removing the term 'muslim' is absurd and against the npov policy.</p>
<p>2. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's legal name does not include the term 'Qadiyani'. The usage of this term is already clearly mentioned. However insisting on adding this term to this name does not make sense.</p>
<p>3. Than fact is that there are a number of Muslims sects with sometimes widely differing and conflicting beliefs. Hence the term 'Muslim' needs to be qualified with 'mainstream'. Also if a qualification is not used it implies that wikipedia considers Ahmadi's to be non-muslims - a violation of npov.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clarification on Appointment of Caliph of Ahmadiyya Muslim Community</span></h2>
<p>I feel there is a misrepresentation of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community's leadership and the means of their appointment.</p>
<p>The article states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question of "Khilafat" was also an issue in the split of the Ahmadiyya movement. The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement believes that an "Anjuman" (body of selected people) should be in charge of the Jamaat. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, however, believes that Caliphs are appointed by God and they are in charge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More accurately, the Ahmadi Muslim Community's Caliph is appointed by an electoral college.</p>
<p>The following is stated in "Welcome to Ahmadiyyat, The True Islam" by Dr. Karimullah Zirvi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Islamic teaching regarding appointment and status of a Khalifa is that the office of Khilafat can under no circumstances be inherited. Rather, Khilafat is a holy trust which is entrusted to a pious member of the Jama'at through election. Islam further teaches that although the Khalifah is appointed through elections, in fact, God Almighty is guiding the members towards election of a righteous and able person as Khalifa. THis is such a subtle and spiritual system of appointment of a Khalifa that it might be difficult for the worldly people to understand. Once a person is elected as Khalifah, then according to Islamic teachings all of the members of the community are required to fully obey him. At the same time, it is required that the khalifah carry out his duties as Khalifah through consultation and taking into consideration the views of the members. However, it is not incumbent upon him to always accept the views and recommendations of the members.<br />
<br />
The Khalifatul Masih (successor to the Promised Messiah and Mahdi) is elected to the office by voting by the members of the Electoral College, which was established for this purpose by Hadrat Musleh Ma'ud, Khalifatul Masih II. During the life of a Caliph, the Electoral College works under the supervision of the Caliph. However, after the demise of the Caliph, the Electoral College becomes completely indepndent and elects the next Caliph. During the election of the Caliph, names are proposed and seconded by the members of the Electoral College, and then they vote for the proposed names by raising their hands.<br />
<br />
(Q/A Session with Hadrat Khalifatul Masih IV<sup>aba</sup>, August 24-26, 2001, Mannheim, Germany)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe the article should allude to or clearly state a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the AMC's Caliph and his election, rather than just stating that the Caliph is "appointed by God and they are in charge".</p>
<p>To this end, I wish to make a small edit to the article indicating that the Caliph is elected by an Electoral College and that the Caliph governs all operations of the community (as their spiritual leader).</p>
