FROM NEWSPAPERS IN WORLD PRASS</p>
<p><br />
The unfretted Oud may be the hardest of all instruments to play, with its delicately flattened intervals, but Mukhtar extracts magic: he can make it dream, gallop, or thunder, and he uses silence to great effect. Michael Church (the Independent on Sunday 23 March 2003)</p>
<p>Ahmed Mukhtar's blessed fingers fashioning shades and shapes from his instrument that most people can only dream of. Veering from sprightly melodic segments to passages of innovative strokes and strums, the effect is a unique excursion to the heart and soul of sensual acoustics. (People Sound, Music Company)</p>
<p>The album from Baghdad, played significantly here by two exiles, comprises more contemporary and better-recorded pieces by an Oud and percussion duet. The percussionist, Alsaadi, either has extra hands or some tasteful overdubbing has been used to give richer percussive backdrops. These textures seem to free up Mukhtar to do some really spacious playing, much of which is a delight. Taplas Magazine (April/May 2003) Rob Smith</p>
<p>FROM NEWSPAPERS IN ARAB PRASS</p>
<p>Al-Hayat newspaper</p>
<p>“The concepts of the great Arabic philosopher, Al- Kindy, are the foundation on which Ahmed Mukhtar has developed his skills in playing the Oud. He practices Al- Kindy theoretical concepts, by using music liberated from clinched predictable styles, music based on the rich wonderful musical traditions, but at the same time enriched by spirit of contemporary music”.</p>
<p>AL Quds Newspaper</p>
<p>“Ahmed Mukhtar uses techniques from all over the world but does not dilute his music with western elements. Mukhtar is an Oud player and composer from Iraq. He has studied Arabic music styles in depth and is concerned to preserve the complexities of the traditions”.</p>
<p>Asharq Al-Awsat Newspaper</p>
<p>“Mukhtar works outside the area of songs and does not limit himself to merely making musical entertainment. His music is rooted in the traditional Iraqi style and he uses the different playing techniques, adding tremolo to distinguish his playing. He also has unique style of harmony”.</p>
<p>Azzaman Newspaper</p>
<p>“Ahmed Mukhtar did not perfect his skills merely to play and study but to embrace the whole culture and emotion of the music and the instrument. He was captivated at an early age by the sound of the instrument and he has devoted his life to exploring and mastering its potential. In concert he develops a mystical intensity full of emotion and imagination. Taking the listener with him as he explores his soul through his playing”.</p>
<p>Baghdad Newspaper</p>
<p>“Ahmed Mukhtar is product of the Iraqi school of Oud playing. His music reflects its history, its sadness and its mysticism. His playing takes you to the cafes, alleys and minarets of Baghdad. An evocation of exploring your soul on the bank the Tigris”.</p>
