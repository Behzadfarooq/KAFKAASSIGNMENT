<p>Professor Ahmed Ali was born in Delhi in 1910, and educated at Aligarh and Lucknow universities, standing first-class and first in the order of merit in both B.A. (Honours), 1930 and M.A. English, 1931. He taught at leading Indian universities including Lucknow and Allabbad from 1932-46 and joined the Bengal Senior Educational Service as Professor and Head of the English Department at Presidency College, Calcutta (1944-47). Professor Ahmed Ali was also BBC's Representative and Director in India during 1942-44. He went to China in 1947 as British Council Visiting Professor of English at the National Central University at Nanking. There, he learnt Chinese and translated from Chinese poets, and gathered material for his book <i>Muslim China</i>; his house became a gathering of friends and China his second home. A year later India was divided and he came from China to Karachi in 1948; becoming Director of Foreign Publicity, Government of Pakistan. He joined the Pakistan Foreign Service at the insistence of Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan, and the first file he received was marked "China" but was blank. He successfully established diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic of China in record time and the Pakistani embassy in Peking in 1950; and the Embassy in <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, in 1958. With Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Surahwardy he visited China again in 1956.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Ali_574d.html" title="Edit section: Literary career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Literary career</span></h3>
<p>Professor Ahmed Ali started his literary career at a very young age and became co-founder of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Writers%27_Movement_588c.html" title="Progressive Writers' Movement">All-India Progressive Writers' Movement</a> and Association with the publication of Angare in 1932, a collection of short stories by four young friends, which was later banned by the British Government of India in March of 1933. Shortly afterwards Ahmed Ali and Mahmud-uz-Zaffar announced the formation of a "League of Progressive Authors", which was later to expand and become the All-India Progressive Writers' Association. Ahmed Ali presented his paper Art ka Taraqqi-Pasand Nazariya in its lnaugural Conference in 1936. A pioneer of the modem Urdu short story, Ahmed Ali's works include collections of short stories: <i>Sholay</i> (1934); <i>Hamari Gali</i> (1940); Qaid Khana (1942); and <i>Maut Se Pahle</i> (1945).</p>
<p>Ahmed Ali achieved international fame with his novel <i>Twilight in Delhi</i>, which was first published by The Hogarth Press in London in 1940. It was widely acclaimed by critics, and hailed in India as a major literary event, and took the English speaking world by storm. It has since acquired the position of a legend. The reviewer <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Collis_1b83.html" title="Maurice Collis">Maurice Collis</a> wrote in <i>Time and Tide</i> (London): "It may well be that we may not understand India until it is explained to us by Indian novelists of the first ability as it was that we understood nothing of Russia before we read Tolstoy, Turgenev and the others. Ahmed Ali may well be the vanguard of such a literary movement." This judgement was echoed by the <i>Oxford History of India</i> in 1958 when it said in reference to Ahmed Ali, Mulk Raj Anand and R.K. Narayan: "... it can be said that they have taken over from E.M. Forster and Edward Thompson the task of interpreting modern India to itself and the world." <i>Twilight in Delhi</i> has been translated into many languages including French, Spanish and Italian. Its exemplary Urdu translation, <i>Dilli ke Sham</i> (1963), by Ahmed Ali's talented wife, Bilqees Jehan, in the opinion of some critics restored the natural language to the book, but those who read it in the translation said it could not have been written in English while those who had read it in the original English said it was untranslatable. This curious controversy was put to an end by the American critic, Dr. David D. Anderson, when he said: "the novel transcends language as any substantial work of art ultimately must do…".</p>
<p>Ahmed Ali's other works include two novels, <i>Ocean of Night and Of Rats</i> and <i>Diplomats</i>; <i>The Prison-House; Purple Gold Mountain; Selected Poems; Mr. Eliot's Penny-world of Dreams; Muslim China; Ghalib: Selected Poems, The Problem of Style and Technique in Ghalib</i>; and <i>The Flaming Earth</i>. Professor Ahmed Ali translated from Urdu, Persian, Indonesian, Chinese and Arabic. His translation of classical Urdu poetry, The Golden Tradition<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> makes an important contribution to the study of comparative literatures, and surveys in depth the literary and philosophical background of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Al-Qur'an: A Contemporary Translation <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_Press_e6ea.html" title="Princeton University Press">Princeton University Press</a>, <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_Press_e785.html" title="Oxford University Press">Oxford University Press</a> &amp; Akrash&lt;/ref&gt; is Ahmed Ali's most outstanding contribution in the field of translation. Approved by eminent <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_scholars.html" title="Islamic scholars">Islamic scholars</a>, it has come to be recognised as the best of existing translations of the holy <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>. In the words of Dr. <a href="../../../f/2E/_/F._E._Peters_c8d0.html" title="F. E. Peters">F. E. Peters</a> of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">New York University</a>: "Ahmed Ali's work is clear, direct, and elegant - a combination of stylistic virtues almost never found in translations of the Qur'an. His is the best I have read."</p>

His creative writings draw wide interest and are an enduring contribution to international letters.
