	    <p>Man, this whole article is a mess, Qadianiat has been referred to as a sect of islam in a place or two, where it isn't a sect. Muslim Ulamas have declared Qadianiat as an anti-muslim religion, the article isn't even neutral, did you just copied and pasted stuff from their so-called holy books? (which they won't even let ppl translate into english and other foreign languages.</p>
<p>BTW i did read that the Qadiani so-called prophet died while vomitting, in his latrine, having cholera, ... anyway he deserved it, a new prophet huh.. why don't these fools just study the Qur'an first and read what it says .... there can't be any prophets after the prophet Muhammad (PBUH)</p>

<dd>I agree. Sentences like "Under his guidance the Ahmadiyya Community progressed at a remarkable speed in the propagation of Islam throughout the world building and running schools, colleges, hospitals, preaching centres, mosques, especially West Africa, also translating and publishing of Holy Quran in many languages. The Ahmasdiyya Community made tremendous in roads against the expansion of Christianity in West Africa from which it has never recovered." or "He successfully thwarted the designs those wishing to re-setablish the institution of Khalifat." are clearly POV, as are references to "Hazrat", "His Holiness", etc. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 18:42, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi guys! I am an Ahmadi of the dallas Jamaat. I was very furious when I saw those two Anti-Ahmadhi sites! We really need to respond to those guys directly and try to sort out the facts from fiction!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it's important that we represent different points of view, even those we disagree with. I sympathize, but as it stands we already have far more pro- than anti- sites, and people might say we were biased if we removed them. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:19, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem is that the original article was just a plain copy (not even restatement, just copy-paste) of official Ahmadi information. We need to get to a more neutral statement--the aim, as I see it, is to have a complete picture, without just mouthing the offical Ahmadi line, but without badmouthing just for badmouthing sake on the Ahmadiyyah movement and any Ahmadis.

<p>Firstly, of course, the official numbers on this page need qualification. We can't just be repeating what's on the official website. Especially when the numbers at <a href="http://www.alislam.org/introduction/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.alislam.org/introduction/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alislam.org/introduction/index.html</a> contradict some of the leadership's own statements like at <a href="http://www.askislam.com/People/Caliphs/Answer_151.html" class="external free" title="http://www.askislam.com/People/Caliphs/Answer_151.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.askislam.com/People/Caliphs/Answer_151.html</a>.</p>
<p>What do folks say we do about this?<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer"></a>—<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer">iFaqeer</a> <a href="../../../i/f/a/User_talk%7EIFaqeer_6379.html" title="User talk:IFaqeer">(Talk to me!)</a> 03:59, Dec 4, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>i think by boosting the number we can't justify our statement.you may contact me yousaf_air@hotmail.com</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the way to do this is to simply put down what different people say. So, the official website lists the number at so many millions, but other sources give different numbers. <a href="../../../i/b/n/User%7EIbnRushd_e246.html" title="User:IbnRushd">IbnRushd</a> 04:02, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also keep in mind that the link you give to the leadership's statement about the numbers is from 1984 whereas the one from the official website is the most recent. This would explain the apparent discrepancy.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The current figure of 100-200 Million isn't right. The site itself says 10's of Millions on one page and mentions millions in say <a href="http://www.alislam.org/introduction/intro.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alislam.org/introduction/intro.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I'm going to use <a href="http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#ahm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#ahm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> where it has "10 Million". I'll leave it for a day to stay within 3RR. Would have been nice for the other editor to focus on facts instead of adding that <i>ridiculous</i> word to the article. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 17:19, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One thing however you might not have noticed is like the 10 million figure that non-Ahmadis state, the Q&amp;A you've cited states in the link that it is 20+ years old; currently it is acknowledged by Ahmadi leaders that the numbers are around 200 million.

<p>Under the description of persecution the article says "Under the guidance of Khilafat the Ahmadiyya machinated, intrigued and started campaigns of derision against the Pakistani Government which were met with fortitude, reminiscent of the early Muslims in Mecca." I do not know exactly what this means, but whatever it is it is very biased. <a href="../../../i/b/n/User%7EIbnRushd_e246.html" title="User:IbnRushd">IbnRushd</a> 04:19, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the contrary. It is one POV trying to correct (or maybe sabotage) another. This might explain it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Ahmadiyya_Muslim_Community&amp;diff=8011154&amp;oldid=7997109" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Ahmadiyya_Muslim_Community&amp;diff=8011154&amp;oldid=7997109" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer"></a>—<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer">iFaqeer</a> <a href="../../../i/f/a/User_talk%7EIFaqeer_6379.html" title="User talk:IFaqeer">(Talk to me!)</a> 06:01, Dec 7, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the numbers issue is incredibly delicate for ahmadis. The fourth khalifa affirmed very forcefully that all doubts over the huge numbers of converts were unfounded. Nevertheless, the numbers of converts seem to have fallen suddenly and dramatically under the very stringently accurate administration of the fifth khalifa. My own feeling is that we should avoid the numbers issue entirely unless we have some unbiased source which can present empirical data to us. Moosa Qureshi.</p>

<p>You missed a major issue: Jihad and how Ahmadiyyat has presented the Jihad of a new age. The Jihad of this age is through the pen, not the sword. In other words, we are to educate others about Islam through books and lectures, not violence. Let it be know that the Ahmadiyyat Jamat is one of peace.</p>
<p>However, I'm not sure if this page really should be made anyway. Hazoor did not want amateures to make articles and what not on the internet. Such work should be left for Jamat officals for they know how to correctly deal with these situations. If someone questions Ahmadiyyat simply refer him or her to the offical website, which I'm quite sure you're aware of but those who are not- the URL is <a href="http://www.alislam.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alislam.org" rel="nofollow">Alislam.org</a></p>

<p>The term Ahmedi is used for people following the teachings of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. This applies both the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement as well as the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. The term Qadiani is used to reffer to people living in the Qadian reagion of India. this term has come to be used in a derogatory fashion by some mainstream Muslim sects. Both Ahmedi sects calim to be followers of Islam not the recently concoted term Qadianism. <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 14:08, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I feel all general history of the Community should fall under the History section, whereas only a summary of the Community's history under a particular Caliph and their personal lives/history as individuals should be filed under their sections. - Sohail Mirza 09:28, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1. The official / legal name of the movement is 'Ahmadiyya Muslim Community'. It is absurd to remove the term 'muslim' from the name of the movement. The fact that they may or may not be considered within the fold of Islam by some other Muslims is clearly mentioned.</p>
<p>2. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's legal name does not include the term 'Qadiyani'. This term has acquired derogatory connotation over the years.</p>

<p>There's still much POV in this article. For instance, the section "Organization and Size" talks about "Ahmadiyyat the true Islam". In general, this paragraph seems to have been written by a person who doesn't have perfect command of the English language. It says "jammat" instead of "the Jamaat", and also mispells "satellite".

<dd>Agreed about non-NPOV here. Also, many of the articles that are anti-Ahmadiyya are against both Ahmadiyya groups, and are duplicated in both this page and the <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahore_Ahmadiyya_Movement_dce5.html" title="Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement">Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement</a> page. Really, they should all be moved to the general <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmadiyya.html" title="Ahmadiyya">Ahmadiyya</a> page, unless they specifically relate to teh AMC presented here. I think this article and hte LMC article can be substantially cleaned up so that they define the differences between the two, and the main ahmadiyya page can deal with all of the groups as a whole, in context with the rest of Islam and other religions with which they interact, etc. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristianEdwardGruber_f5cf.html" title="User:ChristianEdwardGruber">Christian Edward Gruber</a> 21:13, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had created a draft page, but the problems on this page are so egregious, adn so easily solved (a lot of duplication with <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmadi.html" title="Ahmadi">Ahmadi</a>) that it doesn't seem even wroth doing up a draft. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristianEdwardGruber_f5cf.html" title="User:ChristianEdwardGruber">Christian Edward Gruber</a> 22:38, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't quite know why but the section comes off as a bit one sided in tone and appearance. If someone does want to show the view of the orthodox Muslims more so than how it was mentioned in the introduction and later references to persecution, someone who is better (and less biased) with it should word it better. And just a thought but it should probably also have a better placement, maybe in the history section or right after; the latter consideration would be good because it would be in place with the other actions taken against the Movement and why. <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJedi_Master_MIK_fbed.html" title="User:Jedi Master MIK">Jedi Master MIK</a> 15:20, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
