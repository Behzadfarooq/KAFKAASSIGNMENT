<p>Prior to entering politics, Ali enjoyed a distinguished career as an academic. He was initially a high school teacher and later joined the University of the South Pacific as a lecturer in History and politics. He obtained a doctorate at the age of 37 years, then held senior positions at the University. He was Senior Lecturer and Reader in history and politics, and was the Head of the School of Social and Economic Development. He also was Dean of Academic Affairs, acting Deputy Vice-Chancellor as well as Director of the Institute of Social and Administrative Studies.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ali published numerous papers and books on Fiji Indians and the indenture system that brought Indians to Fiji.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Ali_%28politician%29_7efe.html" title="Edit section: Pre-coup political career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pre-coup political career</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, Ali accepted the invitation of the leader of the Alliance Party, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, to enter politics contest the Lau/Cakaudrove/Rotuma national seat as Ratu Mara's running mate. He easily won the safest Natioanl seat for the Alliance and was appointed the Minister of Education. In his effort to upgrade facilities in ethnic Fijian schools, to staff them with better trained teachers and to provide better opportunities to Fijian students at University, he closed down the Nasinu Teachers College and turned it into a dormitory for University of the South Pacific’s Foundation (mostly Fijian) students to provide them with more tutorial help and an environment more conducive to studying. Ali's policy of large-scale arbitrary transfer of teachers brought together the two teacher's unions for the first time to oppose Government policy. There was also a hunger strike by final year students from the University of the South Pacific after the government refused to guarantee them jobs as teachers. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, he was appointed Minister for Information, responsible also for broadcasting and the negotiations of the introduction of television in Fiji.</p>

<p>Ali was an early supporter of Sitiveni Rabuka's 1987 coup and served in his first administration as Minister for Information. He was Minister without Portfolio in the Interim Military Government from October to December, 1987. He then took on a career in the public service becoming Permanent Secretary for Youth, Employment Opportunities and Sports, Foreign Affairs and External Trade and Information and Communications. He also served in the diplomatic service as High Commissioner to Malaysia and earlier as Consul-General in Auckland.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_election_of_2001.html" title="Fiji election of 2001">parliamentary election</a> held in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> to restore democracy following the <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_coup_of_2000.html" title="Fiji coup of 2000">coup d'état</a> the year before, Ali was appointed to the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate_%28Fiji%29_f72b.html" title="Senate (Fiji)">Senate</a> by Prime Minister Qarase. (9 of the 32 Senators are appointed by the Prime Minister). Ali was subsequently chosen as Vice-President of the Senate, a position he held until <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_20.html" title="December 20">20 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, when he was appointed Minister for Information and Media Relations in the Qarase cabinet. He was to hold this portfolio till his death.</p>
<p>Following a short illness, Ali died at the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Wales_Hospital%2C_Sydney_9154.html" title="Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney">Prince of Wales Private Hospital</a> in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">8 June</a> 2005. His funeral was held the next day at Sydney's <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakemba_Mosque_d80e.html" title="Lakemba Mosque">Lakemba Mosque</a>.

Time constraints made it impossible for any Cabinet colleagues of Ali's to attend the funeral, which had to be held the day after his death in accordance with <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> protocol.</p>
<p>Ali was survived by his wife, <b>Bessie,</b> and their two sons, <b>Usman</b> and <b>Hashim.</b> Supporters and opponents alike praised Ali for his love and loyalty to Fiji, and for his willingness to serve his country in a multitude of capacities.</p>
