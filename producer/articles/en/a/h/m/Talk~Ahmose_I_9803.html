<p>I'm all for this, but I'm very busy in real life. I'd like to take a straw poll to see exactly what our various opinions are, so we can fix things, and/or pick a good time to nominate this during which we can defend our work. Therefore...<br /></p>

<dd>It is quite unreplaceable. First of all, the other images are of colossal statuary, what we need is that shabti, that's only in brooklyn I believe (or perhaps it was in the british museum). Second, that tag says "It should be possible for someone to create or find a freely licensed replacement for this fair use work". Find; no. All such images are copyrighted. Create an adequate replacement; also no. Any replacement is likely to be a cruddy duplicate at best. It is not practically possible to replace that image. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 18:04, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Er you seem confused. Given that the shabti is in a public museum in Brooklyn, there is absolutely no reason why someone can't photograph the one in Brooklyn museum and freely license the image rather then use using a photo taken from some British museum under fair use as we currently do. No one is talking about replacing the shabti itself, there is absolutely no need since the info we have suggests there are two shabti's in exitance, publicly viewable and we assumeable photographable... The shabti itself can't be copyrighted since it was create several thousands years ago and thankfully even with the current insane copyright laws on the US, they don't consider such a work copyrighted <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 16:08, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is only one shabti, and it is in the british museum, now that I check it. The other two are colossi. I am not <i>certain</i> that any of them are publically viewable at any given time. We would love a free image replacement, however the chances that it can be done are very low. That is, unless wikipedia wants to finance a several thousand dollar trip to britain for either myself (A native minnesotan), a <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">Portlander</a> or a <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptmondo_9b48.html" title="User:Captmondo">denzien of Toronto</a>. My objection is that the fair use argument stands on sound <i>legal footing</i> – the statement that the image should not be replaceable is wikipedia's requirement, not the law's, and recall that one of the highest rules is ignore most of the rules if they interfere with wikipedia's best interest. With no legal qualms, while a free image is better, no such image is avalable <i>within reason</i>. The tag you wish to put on says that the image may be deleted if progress is not made within a reasonable amount of time, and the demands being asked of us are unreasonable; yet some delete-happy admin is surely going to come in and delete the image anyhow, if you put that tag up. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 20:12, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wait, there's more apparently.

<dd>Ah okay now I understand what all this <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Museum_7dce.html" title="British Museum">British Museum</a> stuff was about. Anyway as I've explained all over the place, I withdrew the tag because of the museum restrictions. But no image is in fact better then fair use when the image is resonably replacable and even if you don't agree, policy dictates it is as does precedent so it should have been deleted were it not for the museum policies. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 13:59, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'll probably leave this for ever after this. But I just wanted to point out that this case perhaps illustrates why the policy is effective. Although this image is not replacable, this FA went on the main page with a picture of a mummy with from what I can tell, limited or nor consideration for replacament of the fair use photo which would have been better on the main page were it not fair use. Only when I pointed out it was in violation of policy and suggested it be deleted (which I know realise was wrong) did anyone really start to consider to replace it. I don't think this is unique either. I'm pretty sure there have been other cases when we've survived with fair use photos for a long time. Only when they were deleted or tagged for deletion were they replaced. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 14:05, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your "policy" - which as I read more, the way you are implementing it does not exist - almost got a vital image deleted because the a group of deletionists obstinatly refuse to actually do themselves what they want others to do. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 14:52, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason for the layout change is due entirely to someone adding the replaceable fair use image request in the pharaoh infobox, which screws up the layout.

<p>Has this connection ever been entertained? certainly a Pharoah under the name Ahmoses, leading nearly 100,000 semites thru the desert to Canaan might possibly have lead an impression on later generations? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.215.154.31_3e3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.215.154.31">71.215.154.31</a> (talk) 05:12, 13 January 2007 (UTC).</small> --71.215.154.31 05:12, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The new photo of Ahmose's statue looks great now, however the location where it says it comes from is not one of the three places which have statues according to the article. I have to wonder, is it the source which is incorrect, and has the wrong locations, or is it simply out of date and this is a fourth piece of statuary? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 21:05, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hard to say. The plaque that accompanied the display of the statue head at the Metropolitan mentioned that it was a "recent acquisition" from 2006. I have no idea if this is a coincidence or not, but the Brooklyn Museum's example was not there, and there was no sign explaining its absence. Perhaps the two museums did a deal recently? (Though the plaque mentioned it was a gift from a particular donor). Can't say with any certainty either way however, as I haven't seen any pictures of what was/is in the Brooklyn Museum. And of course it could also be a recently identified piece by the Met as well. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptmondo_9b48.html" title="User:Captmondo">Captmondo</a> 02:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see you've changed the reference on the page with regard to the number of statuary images, yet I suspect it still to be true. While at the Metropolitan in NYC I also picked up the catalog to the recent Hatshepsut exhibition (which had already come and gone from that particular venue). However there is an updated piece by the same author cited in the original reference who talks about the statuary of the early 18th dynasty, and the image of the Ahmose I statue which is now in the Met is listed in the illustrations as a privately owned piece. I <i>suspect</i> that the piece currently on show at the Met is in fact a loan from the Brooklyn Museum and/or the individual who owns the piece. The book also mentions an additional statue currently in a Scottish museum as quite possibly representing Ahmose I as well, which would add another to the known total. Will track down that section in the book and will post the info accordingly. (Did you want a scan of the section in question for reference?)</dd>

I looked up both references, and it turned out that earlier one referenced the statue head in the Brooklyn Museum, and also had a black and white illustration of it. And voila! it is the same one I saw at the Metropolitan Museum and took the photo of. So either the Met has fully acquired it from the Brooklyn Museum, or it is simply on loan. I would guess the latter, since it was evidently part of the touring Hatshepsut exhibition, but playing things conservatively, have identified its location where I actually saw it, at the Met. It is, however, the same statue, so the <i>confirmed</i> number stays the same. I also mentioned another possible 3D representation of him currently residing in a museum in Scotland as well. Everything is referenced, so we're good. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptmondo_9b48.html" title="User:Captmondo">Captmondo</a> 03:12, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
