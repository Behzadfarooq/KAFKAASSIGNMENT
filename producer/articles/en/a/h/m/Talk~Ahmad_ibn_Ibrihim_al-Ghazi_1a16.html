<p>The article is well written, congrats to the author (assuming its his/her own research), just a note of concern however, exactly what does this line in the 5th paragraph mean?</p>
<p>"While the Portuguese expedition were victorious in most of their engagements with Ahmad's forces, da Gama allowed himself to be trapped by Ahmad somewhere north of the Tekez√© River, where he was killed along with all but 140 of his troops."</p>
<p>perhaps its just me but the sentence suggests the Portugese general da Gama ALLOWED himself to be captured. Does it assume the Somalis were unable to capture him? or was this some selfless act by an invading European, giving up his life so that his troops may be saved? Both seems doubtful and strage at best, kindly clear it up.</p>
<p>franz fanon</p>
<dl>
<dd>The source I had at the time stated in vague language that da Gama was maneuvered into a poor tactical position by Ahmda Gragn, who was then able to decimate his troops and kill him in the process. Since then, I've gotten my hands on a translation of Castanhoso's account of the Portuguese expedition (which is commonly accepted as the best account of these events), &amp; learned that what actually happened was more complex. My intent in the next few weeks is to contribute this material to Wikipedia under the relevant articles. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:33, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, it wasn't. It is presumed these confederated large clans (that is the four major ones) that exist now actually came at that time or later. No one knows his true Soomaali clan. Many different clans claim, with absurd assertions. Soomaali March 13, 2006</p>

<dd>I'm pretty sure that's false.

<p>There's evidence that he was actually Afar (but he could be either), and the quotation has little to do with him, being relevant for the article at <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adal.html" title="Adal">Adal</a> instead, so I've removed the information, and added relevant info to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adal.html" title="Adal">Adal</a>.

<p>Ahmed Ibrahim Ghazi was from the Dir clan is an agreed fact amoung Somalis. However, the real dispute that remains is was he a Gadabuursi Dir or Madahweyn Dir(Akisho or Gurgure). Their is a plenty evidence that this Somali hero is from the Gadabursi whose present day homeland is called Awdal (Adal) which is the kingdom Gurey ruled. Futhermore, it is in the Gadabuursi Mandaluug Dir region which the Christian Ethiopians always targeted in the attacks against Ahmed Gurey and today in the Amuud region you will find the ruines of buildings where the ancient Samaroon used to live and it was the hometown of the Somali saint and general Imaam Said Samaroon who was the defender of the western flank of the Somali nation from Amhara intrusions.</p>
<p>Imam Ahmed Gureey could not be from the Darood clan since he lived in the 1500's before even the Yemani ancestor of the Darood(Darood Ibu Ismail Jabarti reached the shores of Somali. Therefore, Gurey was from the Dir Mandaluug or Madahweyn clan. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.219.199.169 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.219.199.169.html" title="User talk:68.219.199.169">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.219.199.169_06a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.219.199.169">contribs</a>) 13:03, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Though the article isn't big enough to warrant a split right now, I think that we should have two separate articles. One for the Ahmed Gragn, and one for the invasion of Ethiopia by Adal.

<p>There is sufficient evidence to note that he may have been Afar, and this I believe deserves its own section. Franz-Cristoph Muth calls him Somali, but notes that it is not mentioned in <i>Futuh</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"A. was of Somali origin, later called Guray, which is deliberately ignored by his Muslim chronicler." (Franz-Cristoph Muth, "Ahmad b. Ibrahim al-Gazi" in Siegbert Herausgegeben von Uhlig, ed., Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C (Wiesbaden:Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003), pp.155.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is noted by Ewald Wagner, however, that: "The main population of `Adal may have been of `Afar stock." (Ewald Wagner, "`Adal" in <i>ibid</i>, pp.71.)</p>
<p>It is also noted by Didier Morin as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Although the exact influence of the `Afar inside the Kingdom of `Adal is still conjectural due to its multiethnic basis..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Pankhurst further notes that Ahmad Gragn may have been Afar himself. I can't find the exact link right now, so give me a little time to find it. Still, do not revert without addressing my comments.</p>

<dd>Reading the <i>Futuh al-Habasha</i>, I've noticed that there is some evidence in this primary source -- although not conlcusive -- that Ahmad Gragn could have been of the <i>Belaw</i>, a Muslim people who currently live in Eritrea. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 04:00, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you mean the <i>Belew</i> (modern pronounciation - the vowels would be pronounced <i>Balaw</i> in Ge'ez). The name seems to refer to Arabized Beja groups or Beja-ized Arab groups who ruled in NE Sudan (in Beja areas) and parts of western Eritrea (i.e. Kunama and Nara lands). This is the definition given by the <i>Encyclopaedia Aethiopica</i>. However, it also seems to refer to Christianized rulers of northern Ethiopia (Tigray and Eritrea) of Beja stock during the <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagwe_dynasty.html" title="Zagwe dynasty">Zagwe dynasty</a> (version supported by Taddesse Tamrat). Their origins seem to be diverse, though, so the rulers may have been members of a group similar to the Tigre (who came about later) of nomadic Tigrinya (-related language) speakers (? some conjecture on my part). ‚Äî <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">·ãÆ·àù</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> ‚Ä¢ <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 18:36, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>zeila the birth place of ahmed gran is in present day somalia and was also inhabited by somalis 500 years ago</p>
<p>afars were part of the kingdom just like the harari's but doesn't make ahmed gran a harari evendo he made harar the capital of Adal</p>
<p>the imam was supported mainly by his own people the somalis</p>

<dd>Rene Basset doesn't address why he calls him Somali, though. Calling someone Somali in passing isn't evidence that it's more likely than being Afar. Harari back then probably didn't exist as an ethnicity, though. Maqrizi notes that Ifat, for instance, spoke Amharic. If you read what I said before, Afars were probably the predominant ethnic group in the kingdom. Either way, being born in Zeila doesn't make him Somali. Zeila was a port city with many ethnicities living in its borders. The current version makes it clear that the common consensus is that he was Somali, though. ‚Äî <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">·ãÆ·àù</font></a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="green">(Yom)</font></a> | <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">contribs</font></a></small> ‚Ä¢ <small><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a></small> ‚Ä¢ <small><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ethiopia_7101.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ethiopia"><font color="red">E</font></a></small> 22:00, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree there is the possibility that Ahmed Gurey could have been a Afar and i have no problems with that being mentioned. from the added info:</p>
<p><b>He has a nephew Muhammad bin Ali, whose mother was the Imam's aunt; Muhammad was the Sultan of the Somali tribe of Zarba.</b></p>
<p>if the Mother of a Sultan of a Somali tribe is the sister of Ahmed Gurey's Mother or Father how is this not a Somali connection?</p>
<p><i>The Futuh mentions one Ibrahim bin Ahmad as a ruler of the Adal Sultanate for three months, whose name suggests that he may be the Imam's father. This Ibrahim is described as one of the Belew people and previously having been the ruler of the town of Hubat.[8]</i> <b>The possible connection between the two is strengthened by the fact Hubat is later mentioned as one of the power bases of Imam Ahmad (the other being Za'ka).</b></p>
<p>^^to claim this part regarding the connection between the Belew people and Ahmed Gurey and then at the same time claim the following</p>
<p><i>Then there are numerous occasions where the Futuh supplies evidence for an argument from silence. There are numerous passages in the Futuh where Imam Ahmad and the Somali people are mentioned together, and</i> <b>never once does 'Arab Faqih mention the ethnic connection.</b></p>
<p>which ethnic connection was made in Futuh between Ahmed and Adalites that justifies the isolation of the Somali people?</p>
<p><i>Further, the Somali warriors are described as having fled during the Battle of Shimbra Kure;</i> <b>had the Imam been Somali, would the Futuh which otherwise praises the Imam at every turn, would this embarassing detail have been mentioned?[10]</b></p>
<p>Pure speculation and personal interpretation of the text, the Futuh also mentioned the amount of destruction Ahmed's army caused and that's not praising someone's legacy, not to forget the many times these Same warrior were praised in Futuh</p>
<p><i>Somali forces contributed much to the Imam‚Äôs victories. Shihab ad-Din, the Muslim chronicler of the period, writing between 1540 and 1560, mentions them frequently. (Fatuh al-Habasha, ed. And trs. R. Besset Paris, 1897.)</i></p>
<p>it looks very POV to me <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERoboRanks_fe0b.html" title="User:RoboRanks">RoboRanks</a> 04:18, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
