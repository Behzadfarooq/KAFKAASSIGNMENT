<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Kathrada_deb1.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Kathrada was born in the small country town of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schweizer-Reneke_2189.html" title="Schweizer-Reneke">Schweizer-Reneke</a> in the Western <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvaal.html" title="Transvaal">Transvaal</a><sup id="_ref-AKM373_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AKM373" title="">[1]</a></sup>, to <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asians_in_South_Africa_afbf.html" title="Asians in South Africa">Indian</a> immigrant parents.</p>
<p>Due to the apartheid policies of the time, he could not be admitted to any of the "European" or "African" schools in the area and thus he had to move to <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannesburg.html" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> to be educated. Once in Johannesburg, he was influenced by leaders of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvaal_Indian_Congress_45b6.html" title="Transvaal Indian Congress">Transvaal Indian Congress</a> such as Dr. <a href="../../../y/u/s/Yusuf_Dadoo_a10f.html" title="Yusuf Dadoo">Yusuf Dadoo</a>, IC Meer, Moulvi and Yusuf Cachalia, and JN Singh<sup id="_ref-AKM373_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AKM373" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Consequently, he became a political activist at the early age of 12 when he joined the Young Communist League of South Africa. He took part in various activities such as handing out leaflets and performing volunteer work in the individual passive resistance against the Pegging Act in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>. During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, he was involved in the anti-war campaign of the Non-European United Front.</p>
<p>He obtained his <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matric.html" title="Matric">matric</a> at Johannesburg Indian High.</p>
<p><a name="Political_activist" id="Political_activist"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Kathrada_deb1.html" title="Edit section: Political activist">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political activist</span></h2>
<p>At the age of 17 he left school to work full-time for the Transvaal Passive Resistance Council in order to work against the "Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act", commonly referred to as the "Ghetto Act", which sought to give Indians limited political representation and defined the areas where Indians could live, trade and own land.</p>
<p>Kathrada was one of the two thousand volunteers imprisoned as a result of the campaign – he spent a month in a <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durban.html" title="Durban">Durban</a> jail<sup id="_ref-AKM373_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AKM373" title="">[1]</a></sup>. This was his first jail sentence for civil disobedience. Reportedly, he gave an incorrect age to the police so that he would not be treated as a juvenile, but sent to an adult prison instead. Later, he was elected as secretary-general of the Transvaal Indian Youth Congress.</p>
<p>While Kathrada was a student at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_the_Witwatersrand_f622.html" title="University of the Witwatersrand">University of the Witwatersrand</a>, he was sent as a delegate of the Transvaal Indian Youth Congress to the World Youth Festival of <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a><sup id="_ref-AKM374_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AKM374" title="">[2]</a></sup>. He was elected as the leader of the large multi-racial South African delegation. He remained in Europe in order to attend a congress of the International Union Students in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> and finally travelled to <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a> and worked at the headquarters of the World Federation of Democratic Youth for nine months.</p>
<p>As result of the growing co-operation between the African and Indian Congresses in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, Kathrada came into close contact with African National Congress leaders such as <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Mandela_1695.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Sisulu_7eb2.html" title="Walter Sisulu">Walter Sisulu</a>; he was one of 156 accused in the four year <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason_Trial_8f1d.html" title="Treason Trial">Treason Trial</a>, which lasted from <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>. Eventually, all of the accused were found not guilty.</p>
<p>After the ANC and various other anti-apartheid organisations were banned in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, Kathrada continued his political activities despite repeated detentions and increasingly severe house arrest measures against him. In order to be free to continue his activities, Kathrada went underground in early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_11.html" title="July 11">11 July</a> 1963, Kathrada was arrested at the South African internal headquarters of <i><a href="../../../u/m/k/Umkhonto_we_Sizwe_1ab4.html" title="Umkhonto we Sizwe">Umkhonto we Sizwe</a></i> ("The Spear of the Nation" - the military wing of the ANC) in <a href="../../../r/i/v/Rivonia.html" title="Rivonia">Rivonia</a>, near <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannesburg.html" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>. Although Kathrada was not a member of <i>Umkhonto we Sizwe</i>, he became one of the accused in the famous Rivonia Trial, which started in October 1963. He was charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government by violent means.</p>
<p>The trial ended in June <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>; Kathrada was sentenced to life imprisonment along with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, <a href="../../../g/o/v/Govan_Mbeki_dbc8.html" title="Govan Mbeki">Govan Mbeki</a>, Andrew Mlangeni, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elias_Motsoaledi_58b3.html" title="Elias Motsoaledi">Elias Motsoaledi</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Mhlaba_037b.html" title="Raymond Mhlaba">Raymond Mhlaba</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Goldberg_8059.html" title="Dennis Goldberg">Dennis Goldberg</a>.</p>

<p>For the following 18 years, Kathrada was confined to the Robben Island Maximum Security Prison along with most of his Rivonia Trial "colleagues". In October <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, he was moved to Pollsmoor Maximum Prison near Cape Town to join others such as Mandela, Sisulu, Mhlaba and Mlangeni who had been moved there a few months before.</p>

He resigned from the latter position when he was elected to the ANC National Executive Committee in July <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>.
