<p>Added Ahmad Zahir's picture.</p>
<p><br />
I wana add some more info about him, but she has blocked me. I have some good info from Ariana TV.</p>
<p>About the recent changes ...Ive worked hard to bring alot of accurate information through out the months so please do not erase or change my info...becuase this is wikipedia everyone is welcome to ADD info but not change information when they have no idea them selves. alot of the changes that have been made are info from Ahmad zahir.com which is someone elses work ..so no copy and pasting here and the person who made these changes dosnt realize that there was no telivison during half of Ahmad Zahir's career becuase telivision was released in Afghanistan in 1975 so Ahmad zahir's first album was long out before tv's became a regular house hold item . The Album info has been changed plz agian do not touch other peoples works ...someone has added&#160;?'s on the years of the album to my best of knowlege those years are accurate or close enough becuase Ahmad zahir has 3-4 albums out in the late 60's. Ahmad zahir's music videos were recorded in 1976 and 1977..Khuda buwat yaaret was recorded at the time of Daud Khan in 1977. Also I beleive the same person changed the paragraph about some of his personal life like during 1976-1978 he had marriage problems with his second wife and he also was arrested a couple of times 1) becuase of Daud khan and some socalist politicians were doing purges on upper class people and anyone they saw a threat to the republic which Ahmad Zahir was a threat in thier views. 2) Ahmad Zahir was arrested also on speculation of having to be involved in the murder of Khalida Gulpar in 1976 or 1977..but he was cleared of any wrong doing becuase someone from his second wifes family murdered Khalida and forged a letter saying that khalida was killed by Ahmad Zahir becuase ..It was rumored that Ahmad Zahir and Khalida were having an affair.</p>
<p>the topic of Mabubillah Pacha is a rumor also so we can not speculate or blame him unless there is proof becuase there was a girl at the scene of the crime who witnessed Ahmad Zahir's death but till this day she has not said anything about it for reputation purposes. See like some of these things should not be put in the article or to replace accurate information unless who ever did this wants to make a seperate section or paragraph to ADD to the article. So I will not block this article becuase some people might have some good information about Ahmad Zahir..but if I see any HUGE changes or other peoples work's changed then I will block the Article from being edited by other users. <a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdul916_61ca.html" title="User:Abdul916">Abdul916</a> 18:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>to who ever changed the article with poor and untrue facts do not touch the article evr again ...i will block this article becuase time and time after people are vandalizing my work. Most of the info is factual nothing based on assumptions and for the person who went buck wild on my discography info ... you have no clue on what you are talking about the album shab-e hijran Afghan music #14 was recorded in 1973 before the fall of the Shah of Afghanistan my father brought the original recording of Afg #14 in 1974 when he came to the United States so you are completely inaccurate with your info on that one son <i>saying it was recorded in 1978</i>.. listen ppl Ahmad Zahir was pretty much not active in music through most of 1978 becuase of the death threats and his troubles with the law , the only factual info was Ahmad Zahir recorded his last album which was TOO BAA MANEE Music Center # 5 which was recorded though 1977 and completed in 1978 and was released after his death that and 1 or 2 private recorded songs for the radio even though he had a very entertaining majliss in feb or march of 79 and had said that he was going to make another album which would have been in Music Center also he was going to make 1 or 2 music videos too this is from his long time friend Amanallah Amanyaar who was head of radio kabul during the khalq times ..Masoor jamal was the head during parcham times which Ahmad zahir was already dead at that time...Farhad music there was no farhad music when Ahmad Zahir was alive ... dont base Ahmad Zahir's info on underground pakistani recording companies becuase that is what you are doing ...for example they list the original Ahmad zahir Afg music album #2 as javed music center #32 so which is fake and is not the original recordings.so sure whats next Ahmad zahir was going to record an album for Zabi music center or even Virgin records come on plzz give me a brake.. I can tell that you live in pakistan also if you want to add info on Ahmad zahir plz get the facts right and learn how to type proper english...but srry i will block this article becuase of made up and untrue asumptions. <a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdul916_61ca.html" title="User:Abdul916">Abdul916</a> 18:26, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
