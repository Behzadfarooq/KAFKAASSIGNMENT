<p>I cant find in this page how he got into the hamas. the article says he reassumed the leadership of hamas after his release, but it doesnt tell how he assumed the leadership. I wonder wich where his motivations, and why this important part of this man´s life was supressed from the article. I will research it and come back when i have the information, and ask my fellow wikipedians to help me in this. there is a good obituary at <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1175854,00.html?79%3A+International+news+-+guardian" class="external free" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1175854,00.html?79%3A+International+news+-+guardian" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1175854,00.html?79%3A+International+news+-+guardian</a> , can it be added to the external links? Manco</p>
<p>I Thought id let you all know that Ahmed Yassin never studied at a Midrasa (an islamic religious school) and therefor is not a Sheikh. While he may have been at one time a religious leader for some, he never studied to achieve the title of "sheikh"- a fact that has been overlooked by the media. To call Ahmed Yassin "Sheikh" is to assign a negotive, and inaccurate conotation to the realm of Islamic religious leadership. -Your Average Jewish Private School Activist</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yassin both studied at a Madrassa, and founded several. you are wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, he is wrong. Why Yassin is called sheikh is explained here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh</a></dd>

<p>How can he be a "founder" if the group existed for three years before he took it over? Surely there must be a better way to say whatever is being said here, but I don't know what that is. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 19:34 13 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The way I read it, He ws a founding member, there was another leader, then after three years there was another leader.. Yassin.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is there any truth to his being born near the town of Labbikudikadu near Tiruchi in India. (This keeps getting reverted on the entry.) Would that be in Tiruchirappalli District? If that were true he'd be neither an authentic refugee of the '48 war nor an authentic "sheikh." He turned up first in Egypt, right?<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 18:30, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What the hell's wrong with Sharon!??? It's too bad that we don't get to add to this article that this colossal blunder might've been the result of Sharon either being senile, irrational, or simply in a bad mood because he's been having trouble going to the bathroom or something.

<dd>Probably its a result of Sharon's last stall tactic (the so-called Israeli one-sided retreat from Gaza) failure to hold the public's interest long enough, and people starting again to take notice of the many police investigations regarding corruption and bribery related to the Prime Minister and his close family. Sharon needed a quick distraction. --Noop</dd>

<dd>A smart move IMHO. Is there any doubt that Hamas would have hesitated to kill Sharon or any other Israeli if they had a clear shot?

<p>I deleted the information that the helicopter gunship was American made and added that it was an Israeli gunship. If I shoot you with a Colt 45 it is more significant that I shot you than that Colt manufactured the weapon. Guns don't kill; people kill.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Opening of Hell gates.</span></h2>
<p>Well, guys..I am a professor from ulu ulu university...according to my intellect...i made some educated forecast on what will happen and it definitely does, lead us to the Hell...Why would i say that?</p>
<p>Let's conclude things. 911 started the war against terrorism and then Afghanistan, Iraq war. Saddam Hussein captured. North Korea on the nuclear and Japan down on economics and deployed 1000 troops to Iraq. Spain changed government bcuz of the sudden attack. Taiwan's president sworn in and the stocks felled 10%. Now Yassin fell.</p>
<p>Now, let's predict. Hamas will strike Israel and America, that's for sure. Another killing, namely Saddam Hussein, might start Jihad. Then Islamic fighters will attack European countries. Then, with two countries down, and America suffering a biological attack, the stocks markets will plunge into the next financial crisis. Japan and North Korea, will wage war due to economics downturn and will probably attack Taiwan and China.</p>
<p>Then, with the outburst of all the sudden changes, America is set to split due to George and Kerry. Phillipines, Indonesia will be under terrorist control while Singapore and Malaysia fight against it. Israel might fall, yet again, to Islam fighters. The firing of the nuclear weapon from NOrth Korea and start havocs all around and most probably at America. America Falls. And thus come a King who call for peace, the third and final antichrist(most probably Islamic) , who calls himself the God.</p>
<p>Well, if u think this prediction is logical enough, then prepare yourself.</p>

<dd>Ooops, I put it on the wrong talk page (<a href="../../../h/a/m/Talk%7EHamas_7d89.html" title="Talk:Hamas">Talk:Hamas</a>). Here 'tis:
<dl>
<dd>He was both a spiritual leader and a political leader. The extent to which he controlled the organization in its daily business is disputed, though it is clear that he gave it the general direction. It is not only "the supporters of Hamas" who use the phrase "spiritual leader", unless you think that the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and the New York Times are Hamas supporters. (I guess some people do.) Even the Israeli government description goes somewhat in this direction by calling him "the <i>godfather</i> of the suicide bombers" rather than the father.</dd>

<p>Regarding Yassin's date of birth: it does not seem to be known, but in my searching I find it is variously given as 1936, 1937 and 1938, with 1936 the most common. Two sites are more precise: June 1936 and December 18, 1936. So I think we should at least not give the date flatly as 1937, unless someone else has better info confirming '37. Perhaps simply a question mark after 1936? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:31, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also: It seems his passport listed his DOB as January 1, 1929, but Yassin himself said he was born in 1938. Who knows? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:37, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>What are those two English speaking democracies?</p>
<p>And, how could he/she have managed to relate those three: speaking English, being a democracy and defending the assasination?</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure this is accurate.

<p>Answer: More than Yasser Arafat but not as many as Ibn Saud. Speaking of Arafat I wonder what his relatives think of his wife now secrety going back to Christianity (she has pictures of Christ in her home) and his daughter having the possibility of marrying a European when she gets older.</p>

<dd>Wasn't his wife always Christian? AFAIK she never converted...

<p>As far as I can see, all of these are covered in the article. The article may possibly be insufficiently sourced and referenced, but that's not the point.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ahmed Yassin should not be labeled a terrorist.</span></h2>
<p>I read over the histroy of edits on this page. I totally agree with Freiheit94 and that other user that Ahmed Yassin should not be labeled a terrorist. You explicitly state that the definition of terrorist is YOUR own, Mr. Wassell. Wikipedia is not about OUR views, it's about objectivity. Terrorism itself is a realtive term, and there should not even be a category for terrorists. Ahmed Yassin in other cirlces is viewed as a resistance fighter. Second, according to YOUR definition of terrorist, Nelson Mendalla would have fit the bill some 30 years ago. Do you dare call Mr. Mendalla a terrorist? I am not trying to attack your personal views, for you are entitled to regard anyone as you please. However, this is not the place to share our POVS. This is a place to showcase knowledge objectively. Thanks Aljazzera44 16:39, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To Palestinians he's a hero, to Israelis he's a terrorist. Wikipedia should not side with one view, and disregard another.

<p>I will concede that he was anti-Zionist. There is nothing wrong with that, most learned people with a true sense of justice will be anti-Zionist, considering it is a racist ideology based on religious exclusivity. Now, let's talk about the terrorist label. Ahmed Yassin never himself engaged in terroristic acts. He attempted to liberate the Palestinians from Israeli oppression. Therefore, the means he used justified the end. I do not condone terrorism. But Israel's war is not one against terror, it is one against the liberation of the Palestinian people and their right to self-determination. Aljazzera44 18:01, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

What constitutes a terrorist is realtive, personally I think Al-Qaeda are full-fledged terrorists, but I respect Hezbollah and Hamas as legitimate resistance movements, since they are fighting for a specific national cause with a local, not a global, agenda. Second, the The Haganah and the The Irgun engaged in terroristic activities in order to establish the State of Israel and they are designated as National Liberation movements while Hamas and Hezbollah are designated as terrorist organizations on wikipedia. That is absolute and blatant bias on the part of some editors here. Aljazzera44 18:59, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"<a href="../../../t/e/r/Category%7ETerrorists_ec32.html" title="Category:Terrorists">Category:Terrorists</a> or not?" – revisited</span></h2>
<p>Now that <a href="../../../t/e/r/Category%7ETerrorists_ec32.html" title="Category:Terrorists">Category:Terrorists</a> has survived <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_August_20#Terrorist_categories" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_August_20#Terrorist_categories" rel="nofollow">another CfD</a> (albeit with a result of <b>"no consensus"</b>), I think we should re-examine the arguments for and against Ahmed Yassin's inclusion in that category.</p>
<p>I reiterate my arguments <b>for</b> his inclusion in this category:</p>
<ul>
<li>He obviously and verifiably fits the five criteria stated in <a href="../../../t/e/r/Category%7ETerrorists_ec32.html" title="Category:Terrorists">Category:Terrorists</a>, and as far as I can see in the discussion above, nobody has disputed this.</li>
<li>He was the founder and leader of a group that is classified as a terrorist organisation by numerous states and supernational organisation. This is also undisputed.</li>
</ul>
<p>My interpretation of the arguments <b>against</b> his inclusion (paraphrased from above):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>"The term 'terrorism' is subjective, relative or illdefined"</b> — Irrelevant. This is not about the colloquial usage of words. This is about the applicability of a Wikipedia category, and that category is sufficiently objective and well defined.</li>
<li><b>"Many regard him as a hero"</b> — Irrelevant. It is quite possible to be both a hero and a terrorist. It is even more possible to be <i>regarded</i> as hero and still be a terrorist. Some people think of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_McVeigh_0621.html" title="Timothy McVeigh">Timothy McVeigh</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andreas_Baader_f01a.html" title="Andreas Baader">Andreas Baader</a> as heroes, but they are, nevertheless, terrorists.</li>
<li><b>"With a strict adherence to the definition, others (like <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Mandela_1695.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>) would have to be included"</b> — Utterly irrelevant. This is <i>not</i> a kindergarten fight. The <i>only</i> relevant question here, is whether the character string "[[Category:Terrorists]]" should be place on <i>this</i> particular page, or not. If you think that it should also be added to some other page, then go ahead and add it there.</li>
</ul>
<p>My conclusion is that that Ahmed Yassin <i>must</i> be included in <a href="../../../t/e/r/Category%7ETerrorists_ec32.html" title="Category:Terrorists">Category:Terrorists</a>.</p>

<dd>Whatever -- Yassin is not a Wikipedia editor, and I did not include the language in an article, or propose that it be included in an article. The reason I used the language was to make it crystal-clear that I regard Yassin as an evil man who perverted religion to support his hatreds -- yet I'm not convinced that he can fairly be called a "terrorist". If he sits in his corner and acts as a pro-terrorism ideologue and incitement propagandist, then he's undeniably a fairly worthless excuse for a human being (in my opinion) -- but it's doubtful whether he can be called a "terrorist", unless he had a fairly direct and personal operational, logistics, or command role with respect to specific terrorist acts.
