<p><br />
Regarding your advice that I not edit until I become an expert on these topics, I completely agree. My intent is to provide a reader's viewpoint until I can find articles worthy and eligible for citation.</p>
<p>Do you think my questions to you on Active and Passive systems could help improve clarity in wiki definitions of those systems? The definitions seem to be oriented to large buildings and the classical implementation of those systems. I've seen statements from CPSC hearings and the Fire Safety Council that those systems are morphing because of smart homes and smart devices.</p>
<p>I think the article on <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounding.html" title="Bounding">bounding</a> could be strengthened.</p>
<p>As someone who came to Wiki hoping to see a review of the regulatory landscape, I want to improve the definition of bounding to be more generic. While you've contributed a great deal of detail regarding firestops and fire safety, it seems to weight the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounding.html" title="Bounding">bounding</a> article at the expense of other industries where bounding applies. I predict ultimately the article will get refactored to get that balance. Would you agree?</p>
<p>Here's one example sentence which I think needs strengthening</p>
<p><i>Safety related products generally have to undergo product certification to enable their use by the public.</i></p>
<p>On improvement, I hope the reader gets a clear picture of what products are required by law to be certified. I realize how difficult that is for an article which attempts to discuss a legal term which is regulated differently in different countries. What a challenge. <i>Safety related products</i> is a fuzzy term too. I think we need a lawyer in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fire_Protection_8245.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fire Protection">Wiki Fire Protection WikiProject</a>. &#160;:)</p>

<p>I have already responded to you in private e-mail and will leave it at that, except to say that absent bounding, I do not think you will be successful selling the product you have patented, which appears to be your aim here - not that there is anything wrong with that, mind you. If I were you, I would focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. getting a standard written</li>
<li>2. getting it into applicable codes</li>
<li>3. seeking distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Really, what you're after is to sell your patented idea and circumnavigating product certification. That is very difficult indeed and I think your time may be better spent in easier pursuits that make money. The construction industry is very conservative and its products are driven by <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underwriters_Laboratories_8030.html" title="Underwriters Laboratories">Underwriters Laboratories</a> labels - not exclusively, but for easiest acceptance and sales for you. Go to UL, young man, I say.--<a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a> 04:45, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Ahering, I joined Wiki in order to ask you some questions regarding your fire safety articles. I have read the articles and many linked websites regarding fire safety, product certification and bounding. I have questions the articles don't answer so I'm asking here in hopes of building robustness in this topic. I am not sure this user talk page is the right place to ask you questions so please direct me if there's a better message vehicle in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>My questions are best asked in the form of a fictional example.</p>
<p>My son wrote a software program he wants to sell on Ebay. He has a microphone attached to his PC. His software recognizes the sound of a smoke detector. When the smoke detector sounds, the software sends a signal to an electrical latch on the doggie door so our dog can escape the smoke.</p>
<p>Here are my questions:</p>
<p><b>Active Protection Systems</b>: If he sells the software without the doggie door, is this software an active protection system? He wants to sell the electrically controlled doggie door too. Does it now become an active protection system?</p>
<p><b>Fire suppression systems</b>: The software also turns off the attic fan to limit oxygen to the fire. Is the software a fire suppression system?</p>
<p><b>Bounding</b>: What laws prohibit him from selling this software and the electrically controlled door latch without certification? NFPA? UL? (<i>Comment</i>: The bounding article seems to be written more from a liability perspective, not a prohibition perspective. Small electrical device manufacturers may be willing to bear liability risk, but unwilling to break laws prohibiting the sale of uncertified products. I'm hoping for more understanding of how small manufacturers do business until they can bear the cost of product certification.)</p>
<p>Thanks for your contributions to Wiki on this topic. I hope my questions are received as I intended, to learn more and improve the articles.</p>

<p>Response:</p>
<p>I will respond to you by e-mail, since we're both accessible that way within Wikipedia. You can gather the intellectual framework for what you're asking right on my website: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/astximw.--" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/astximw.--" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/astximw.--</a><a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a> 01:30, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Further Response:</p>
<p>I can see that you have a patent: <a href="http://www.freshpatents.com/Power-strip-with-smoke-detection-auto-shutoff-dt20050804ptan20050168901.php" class="external free" title="http://www.freshpatents.com/Power-strip-with-smoke-detection-auto-shutoff-dt20050804ptan20050168901.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.freshpatents.com/Power-strip-with-smoke-detection-auto-shutoff-dt20050804ptan20050168901.php</a> for a device and I conclude that you cannot afford the testing and certification, which is what makes it difficult for you to get to market. The need for <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounding.html" title="Bounding">bounding</a> is just one of those buggaboos that you cannot get round. Many have tried and it is simply not worth the effort. It's sort of a pity, as good idea often go absolutely nowhere, but we're talking about safety, which gets into constitutional rights. So, as I outlined in my e-mail to you, you can find further information on <a href="http://www.geocities.atsximw" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.atsximw" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.atsximw</a> as well as many other sites on the topic of fire protection, but that is the long and short of it. In a case like yours where quite possibly no standard exists to test your product and no code calls for it, you have to start with lots of money and right at the bottom. You need to get someone like UL to come up with a standard or accept your first draft, run a test and get a listing. With that in hand, you MAY have a chance along with other data, like you mentioned about barn fires in your country, and see about getting something written into a fire code or a building code. But all of this is a long and hard road and unfortunately, there are no shortcuts. Likewise, if you picked up a toaster at Walmart and your son got zapped and suffered ill health effects, you would also not be interested in any sob story from a manufacturer about how he could not afford the testing and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Product_certification.html" title="Product certification">product certification</a>. You'd sue and win, guaranteed. That's why Walmart would not carry that product and that's why you're not getting anywhewre with your widget, novel and nifty though it may be. I too wish it were easier, but remember that I did not invent this status quo, I merely uploaded it. It is not hard to find independent verification of all that I have written here. So, before you start editing, I suggest you become an expert on the matter yourself.--<a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a> 02:06, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;unblock| OK, I need a generic solution here. I KEEP GETTING BLOCKED, because of this other person ACADEMENORTH, who has been banned. Apparently, there is some autoblocking happening. So, simply unblocking me does not work, quite apparently. I need something more permanent. As you can see below, there is something afoot that keeps autoblocking this person and then I keep getting blocked and unblocked - this fluctuates from one minute where I CAN EDIT, to the next, where I cannot do so any longer. One moment I'm blocked and the next moment I'm not. If we both have the same IP address, I need some sort of other permanent solution so I don't get affected by that person. Single unblocks have been done now by more than one administrator. That does not appear to do the trick. I request assistance. Next, I have pasted the latest block I have encountered: Your user name or IP address has been blocked from editing. You were blocked by JzG for the following reason (see our blocking policy): Autoblocked because your IP address has been recently used by "Acadamenorth". The reason given for Acadamenorth's block is: "Vandalism, harrassment, general pointlessness.". Your IP address is 216.221.81.98. --<a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a> 23:40, 6 August 2006 (UTC) &gt;&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>Autoblocks now lifted. I'm sorry that you were caught in the collateral damage of another user being blocked. This is because the MediaWiki software automatically blocks vandal's IP address - otherwise a blocked vandal would just log-out and resume vandalising. We have new versions of the software becoming available which allow us to selectively block an IP address without blocking logged-in users. But it will take time for these tools to come online and be picked up. Until then, there isn't a permanent solution, but please rest assured that there will be soon. Unblocking someone blocked in error isn't easy - privacy issues mean we can't see all the relevant facts and must do some unblocking by slow guesswork. It can often take <i>hours</i>. As I say, I'm sorry you've been caught up in this but your reputation on Wikipedia is fully intact and we honestly do value your contributions. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 19:07, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>unblock|Apparently, another user by the name of ACADEMENORTH, who was blocked for apparently good reasons, has the SAME IP ADDRESS as I do. So, as he was blocked, so was I. I am not that person. I don't know this person. His former page was written in another language that I don't speak.

Okiedokie: I copied and pasted this, after attempting to edit a random page just to bring this message up:</p>
<p>Your user name or IP address has been blocked from editing. You were blocked by JzG for the following reason (see our blocking policy): Autoblocked because your IP address has been recently used by "Acadamenorth". The reason given for Acadamenorth's block is: "Vandalism, harrassment, general pointlessness.". Your IP address is 216.221.81.98.</p>
<p>Also, just like yesterday, when I went over this same thing with administrator "friday" (whom I've e-mailed on the topic, as well as JzG), my block went off and on repeatedly. Same thing today. Even after this block, I was temporarily able to edit and now it's off again.

<p>Ahering, you seem to be relatively new at this. Regarding your contribtution to the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endothermic.html" title="Endothermic">endothermic</a> page, in which had to clean for you, a couple of rules to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Link a word only one time in a section (e.g. you linked the word <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a> 5 times in one paragraph).</li>
<li>Bold a word only one time per page (e.g. you bolded <b>endothermic</b> 4 times in one paragraph.</li>
<li>Don’t link header titles (note how the header "endothermic" above is not linked.</li>
<li>Break your paragraphs up into readable chunks (online tension eye-strain requires this).</li>

<p>I've rolled back a whole slew of your edits placing a whole bunch of topics under a few categories. Such placements like you did seem to defeat the purpose of having categories in the first place, as it makes our category system "flat". Please be careful which categories you place things in, and find the best category for each article. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 03:49, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Instead of arbitrarily rolling it back, you may have enquired as to my reasons. As it is, the categories concerning items related to fire, fire prevention and fire protection do not make sense. Also, the links to the German Wikipedia go to the wrong place, fire prevention, when most of the good stuff on fire protection does not appear. For instance, since you remove the fire protection category from fire protection products, just exactly what reasoning is behind that??--<a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a> 21:05, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is because there are much more appropriate subcategories under the main "Fire Protection" category that these articles belong in. Listing them in both that category and their parent category defeats the purpose of categorizing. The idea is to find the <i>most appropriate</i> place - not just smear it all over the landscape. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 03:01, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes. I can't find the mention in policy, but I believe it's common practice to not list an article in both a category and its parent category at the same time. If an article covers fire generally, then put it in Category:Fire. If it covers one or two more specific topics, put it only in the more specific category, not in Category:Fire as well. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 03:40, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>MI cable is approved by Canadian and other codes for use in explosion hazard areas. No, it's not "explosionproof" in the sense of remaining intact in any arbitrarily-large explosion, but wiring in MI cable will not trigger an explosion in a hazardous area. Similarly, "fireproof" is in the pragmatic sense that the MI wiring would survive typical building fire scenarios to keep essential services such as fire pumps or alarm systems working. The wiring need not survive longer than the structure it is in. True, when the Sun goes nova, everything burns...but the reasons for use of MI cable are for much better bounded conditions. I'm surprised someone who worked in the test and cerficiation business would delibrately confuse two senses of "explosionproof" like this. --<a href="../../../w/t/s/User%7EWtshymanski_3fd9.html" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> 17:35, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nothing deliberate. The difference is that there are products out there, typically marketed to hard target applications like military, which improve explosion resistance of assets. I was involved with this. "explosionproof" is a common misnomour for that unfortunately. Fireproof is just as wrong. It's particularly inapplicable to a product with fixed ratings like MI cable, which fails some of its tests and leaves junction boxes unprotected (not that this is the fault of the manufacturer, rather than a welcome oversight by the electrical engineers)...--<a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a> 23:14, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Moving those images to a gallery didn't improve the article. Look at the whitespace at the top now; that's not an improvement.</p>
<p>If you think you can clean it up, feel free, but I am inclined to revert back to the pre-gallery version if you aren't able to improve the gallery.</p>

<dd>I use a slightly wider than "normal" browser window, but I haven't had the problem of the images there tailing off the end of the article. If that's what you're trying to fix, I'd say resizing the images and fixing the caption on that second one, to be more appropriate, would work better. Is that what you were getting at?

<p>Hey, I notice you were the one who originally added the mitigation section to the article a few months ago. It's not quite in the right tone for wikipedia (a little too advice-phrased and opinionated), but I figure you'd have the knowledge on the subject to rewrite it. I changed a couple of things in the intro of the article, and perhaps we could get the rest up to a higher standard. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 20:25, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have seen your removal of text that indicates that an electrical circuit that must remain operable during accidental fires is required to be equipped with fireproofing along its whole length. That is very very very basic doctrine in Nuclear Power and any lapses in the past have led to reportable events, for obvious reasons. If you leave a junction box completely unprotected and this is exposed to ETK fires or worse, then you have an obvious weak spot. It is for this reason that all testing to Supplement 1 as per USNRC encompasses both raceways and boxes. If you think you know better than the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, The National Building Code of Canada and every operating nuclear power plant on the planet that has to answer to a federal regulator or local building authority, or both, as is the case in Germany for instance, then I would invite you to state your reasons before simply removing such text. I would further invite you to state your personal experience in fire test design and execution to support such a claim.--<a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a> 04:54, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The application depicted has nothing to do with fire protection, the USNRC, nuclear reactors, Germany, etc., as I've tried to explain repeatedly. A long and peripheral discussion of fire protection methods is not appropriate in a photo caption. I make NO claims about fire test experience - but it's not relevant to the picture! The installation in the picture uses MI cable for purposes entirely unrelated to fire protection. --<a href="../../../w/t/s/User%7EWtshymanski_3fd9.html" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> 16:30, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I beg to differ. The whole <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purpose.html" title="Purpose">purpose</a> of MI Cable is <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_integrity.html" title="Circuit integrity">circuit integrity</a>. There is no way on God's green earth that anyone would put up with the extra labour and expense of using MI cables, comparted to ordinary cables, if the goal weren't circuit integrity. If you think that fire protection is peripheral to circuit integrity cables, then just what do you consider to be pertinent? That's like saying that smoking is <i>peripheral</i> to ashtrays. So, for what purpose other than circuit integrity, which is a function of fire protection, do you suppose anyone anywhere installs MI cables then?<a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a></p>

<dd>See above. It turns out not to be the case that MI cable is installed only for circuit integrity during a fire. MI cable is used for purposes entirely unrelated to circuit integrity. The photo shows a 120 V panelboard at a spillway control structure - the circuits involved are ordinary lights and plugs, nothing to do with fire resistance at all. Not a nuclear reactor, not for a fire pump or fire alarm - just a rugged cable system where the extra labor cost is traded off for long cable life. Apparently in the UK they like to install MI cable because it is inconspicuous against stone work - not anything to do with fire protection. --<a href="../../../w/t/s/User%7EWtshymanski_3fd9.html" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> 00:37, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are absolutely right. Take a look at this page, which is from the leading vendor of such wiring: <a href="http://www.tycothermal.com/usa/english/fire_performance_wiring/" class="external free" title="http://www.tycothermal.com/usa/english/fire_performance_wiring/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tycothermal.com/usa/english/fire_performance_wiring/</a> . You will notice that all they talk about is fire safety. Certainly, this does not prevent anyone from using this product for ordinary wiring, or even to whip non-obedient farm animals. Perhaps there are Englishmen, who enjoy it for its great looks. I'm sure the manufacturer is really into it or anything that moves a lot of their product off the shelves and into buildings. But the fact remains, as is clearly self-evident to anyone who has ever seen the price list and labour factors, that the general purpose for which this product, as designed and advertised, is <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_integrity.html" title="Circuit integrity">circuit integrity</a>. Even the UK website for the same vendor clearly demonstrates the obvious: <a href="http://www.tycothermal.com/uk/english/fire_performance_wiring/products/pyro_mi/default.aspx" class="external free" title="http://www.tycothermal.com/uk/english/fire_performance_wiring/products/pyro_mi/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.tycothermal.com/uk/english/fire_performance_wiring/products/pyro_mi/default.aspx</a> . That is why it is called PYROtenax. Pyro means <b><a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">Fire</a></b>. Still, there is no legislation that would prevent the use of this product for other purposes, like roping cattle, looking cool next to brick, towing cars or inflicting pain. So, I wont revert your text removal, even though I believe it to be harmful. I'm just tired of fighting over it. Using your argument, I could also argue that there must be someone out there who uses spray <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fireproofing.html" title="Fireproofing">fireproofing</a> as hairspray. Why limit the stuff to reducing heat transfer? Come to think of it, in the movie "White Chicks", one of the Wayan brothers informs his Co-Star that in his upcoming date with a large male ("Anaconda Man"), if he runs out of condoms, he can always use the shower curtain. So, you might want to rush over to the definition for shower curtain and remove any offensive statements that shower curtains are used merely to keep water spray in your bathtub right? Pyro is for circuit integrity. Any use outside of that is incidental and not the rule. Also, if you're concerned about looks, you conceal wiring. Otherwise you have to dust it, don't you? Enough said.--<a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a> 03:03, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
