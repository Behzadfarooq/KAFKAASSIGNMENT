<p>Hai <b>Ahrvojic</b>, there are intresting articles about <b>Ayyavazhi</b>, a new religion on both mythology and religiosity. Wikipedia is rich with this topic in English, but poor in other languages. Since french is a leading language in Wikipedia it is better to translate the contents on this <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayyavazhi.html" title="Ayyavazhi">AYYAVAZHI</a> family to french. - <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj">Paul Raj</a></p>

<p>So you're second generation, mm? I salute you for learning your language. It is far too scarce a habit.</p>
<p>About Croatia and "ethnic cleansing," you are essentially right, in the following complex way, I think: if the Croats "ethnically cleansed," then the Bosnian Serbs committed genocide. --<a href="../../../v/k/o/User%7EVKokielov_dc04.html" title="User:VKokielov">VKokielov</a> 19:11, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you! Yes, I was born in Toronto, but most of my family resides in Croatia and so my ties there are very strong. As for recent Croatian history, war is war. I acknowledge that individual crimes were committed in the liberation of the country as they have been in every war on every side throughout history, but there's a huge difference between that and a state policy of genocide, which is what I felt was being implied by the recent edits. I was concerned my revisions would be interpreted as whitewashing, but Wikipedia is one of the few places where we can actually defend ourselves in the Anglosphere, which is traditionally unsympathetic towards Croatia and the former Austro-Hungarian Empire in general. --<a href="../../../a/h/r/User%7EAHrvojic_06cf.html" title="User:AHrvojic">AHrvojic</a> 17:23, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just want to inform you that a number of name-changing Serbian propagandists (the above "Purger" &amp; similar folx) are spreading virulent anti-Croat hatred on the en wiki, spamming/heaping unverified material (lies, half-truths and ordinary calumny one easily finds in Serbian propagandist stuff). Not to be confused with valuable Serbian contributors (Millosh, Pokrajac etc.), there is no point in arguing with these psychos.

<p>You didn't have <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croats.html" title="Croats">Croats</a> on your watchlist, lol.&#160;:D</p>
<p>Anyways, I would like to inform you that <a href="../../../c/r/o/Portal%7ECroats_c9a1.html" title="Portal:Croats">Portal:Croats</a> has just been created - and it's nothing more than a mere shell, so desperate help is needed.</p>
<p>I would dispute your Chetnik intervention. I know that the Chetniks were a right-wing Serbian guerrila corps in World War II, but they cannot be blaimed for the Bleiburg massacre or the several similiar massacres. The Partisans, on the other hand, are claimed to have executed between 50,000 and 250,000 Ustashas and those acused to be connected to them. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 19:59, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Concerning Ante Starcevic, do you honestly think he liked Jews and Serbs?

<dd>Ah, ok, you should've mentioned that's the article you're concerned about. I'm reverting those edits simply because even if he did espouse those views, they shouldn't take up the vast majority of the article. It's just too disproportionate and one-dimensional. I'm definitely not against including them if they're well documented--the article should be honest after all--but a situation where less than a third of the article is about the man and his life in general and the rest focuses on his alleged anti-semitism and anti-Serbism isn't very fair (Starcevic wasn't Hitler, after all). Look, aside from some obvious trolling by a certain user and his numerous sockpuppets, the regulars working on the Croatia-related articles are very reasonable and I'm sure some sort of compromise can be achieved. --<a href="../../../a/h/r/User%7EAHrvojic_06cf.html" title="User:AHrvojic">AHrvojic</a> 04:20, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that info about his anti-semitic writings shouldn't take up the majority of the page. But the way to solve the problem is to add more text about his life in general, and not just delete <b>all</b> of the text containing info about his political ideology. I also agree that we should reach some sort of compromise about the article instead of just reverting each other, so I changed the part of the article where his political ideology is described. Even though it <b>is</b> confirmed he was very anti-Serb and anti-Jewish, now the article states that most Historians <b>claim</b> he was all of those things (even though he wrote books about all of that himself). So, in order to ease tensions, I did hide some facts that are 100% true (don't take my word for it, go to any library) in order to stop the reverting war which is really getting on my nerves.

<p>Serb vandal Bormalagurski has asked his pro-Serb admin friends to help him, spamming talk pages with trolling and personal attacks, protecting the page and contrary to all rules blocking users who revert such Serb vandalism and personal attacks on their own talk page. He posted a "warning" threatening me with being "blocked for disruption" because I voted against his admin candidacy, and he and others have engaged in revert war to keep the Malagurski trolling on the user talk page. For example he also wrote on the talk page "Allow me to make an impersonation of you: <i>Serbs are guilty for everything. All Croats are saints. I love my pope, who let's me get away with everything. I'm so Serbophobic that I can't even allow Serbian posts on my user page. That's why I voted for the deletion of the article "Serbophobia", because it doesn't exist.</i>" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACroatian_historian&amp;diff=45794077&amp;oldid=45793314" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACroatian_historian&amp;diff=45794077&amp;oldid=45793314" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. They are also conspiring to enforce their POV.

They use large numbers of sock puppets. I don't know what to do. Admin candidacy of Bormalagurski failed for obvious reasons, but it seems some people like him were able to get enough votes. This is a very serious problem for those who oppose the massive Serb nationalist vandalism on dozens of articles and Greater Serbian anti-Croatian propaganda articles.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and also, say hi to Croatian historian for me. Even though I'm half Croatian, and personally have nothing against Croats, I do have something against Croatian nationalists like "Croatian historian". He claims that I want to block him just because he voted against my admin. candidacy, even though I didn't warn anyone else who voted against me (all 16 people). Obviously, he hates my guts because I'm a Serb (actually, half-Serb, half-Croat... which makes it even more absurd to call me a nationalist). Also, I want to deny that I write Greater Serbian anti-Croatian propaganda articles, if you look at my contributions, I mostly leave messages on talk pages and discuss articles, instead of editing them. So, just before you believe everything he told you, I would like to paint a more realistic picture of the situation that he is in (warned and blocked several times), so my advice is to distance yourself from him, trust me, you'll be glad you did. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 04:40, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would you please be so kind not to resort to personal attacks and to work on improving the article on Tudjman, rather than reverting. It is highly biased article - stating things which are contraversial as facts, speaking of pan-Serbism etc. Removing quotes hardly helps. Please work on the article, you seem to be more reasonable than users like Mir Harven or Croatian Historian, I am sure a satisfactory version can be worked out. Mylan 07:51, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, I haven't made any personal attacks and reverting an article does not necessarily imply that I think it's fine the way it is. The Tudjman article does need work, but unfortunately it's also among the most difficult to work on here, especially considering that it deals mostly with relatively recent (and sensitive) history. As for your edits, I'm sorry but they aren't exactly neutral either and therefore do not improve things. This is an article that one needs to be conservative with if it's to move forward. --<a href="../../../a/h/r/User%7EAHrvojic_06cf.html" title="User:AHrvojic">AHrvojic</a> 02:34, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>calling people vandals when you have different POV is a personal assault. I was certainly not vandalising the page (see <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html" title="WP:Vandalism">WP:Vandalism</a>) - in fact, I have added quite a few quotes. The only POV thing that is there in my edit might be his holocaust denial - or perhaps there are some other things that you disagree with - but instead of reverting, you can change those things like I did when I changed and NPOV-ed panSerbian statements. Anyway, I agree it is a contraversial topic, but then it is a reason to work on article, and those who do and disagree with you are not to be called vandals. Mylan 03:15, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I see what you're talking about--I'm pretty sure the 'vandalism' part of my 'rv vandalism' message was auto-completed by my browser since that's not what I intended, though I still stand by the revert. Unfortunately there's simply been too much trolling on the Croatia-related articles over the last few months, meaning that new contributions have to be that much better for other users to accept them. You can't simply rewrite entire paragraphs with such heavily controversial claims--that's why your edits are being reverted. --<a href="../../../a/h/r/User%7EAHrvojic_06cf.html" title="User:AHrvojic">AHrvojic</a> 06:43, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a short note to let you know that <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiMB_79fc.html" title="User:WikiMB">User:WikiMB</a> is, in all likelyhood, another account that has been opened by <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">User:Bormalagurski</a>.

<dd>Thanks! I suspect little is happening on the admin front since a lot of outsiders seem to believe that no one associated with the ex-Yu can be trusted to present anything even remotely impartial and so they take a hands-off approach and tolerate even the most ridiculous stretching of reason in the name of "balance". --<a href="../../../a/h/r/User%7EAHrvojic_06cf.html" title="User:AHrvojic">AHrvojic</a> 03:35, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a question for you referring to the article about Alojzije Stepinac. The edit war is going on, but I would like to know more facts. I know that he is often called martyr (mučenik). I also know that technicly speaking his death was "natural", but there was a suspission of poisoning and it was also reasonable to suspect that lack of proper medical treatment accelerated his death. But I am interested in an official statement of the Catholic Church. Do you have any information on this? Any links, sources etc. Regards, <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasra_3f4f.html" title="User:Jasra">Jasra</a> 21:38, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../i/v/a/Image%7EIvan_Zajc.jpg_5a17.html" title="Image:Ivan Zajc.jpg">Image:Ivan Zajc.jpg</a></b>. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be a justification explaining why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media meets the criteria at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.
