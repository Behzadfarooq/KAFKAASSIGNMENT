<p>Mary Alice thought that she knew everyone, but had she looked further, she would have realized that she was never looking deep beneath the surface. Had she realized this, she would have known that <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabrielle_Solis_8823.html" title="Gabrielle Solis">Gabrielle Solis</a> was a "drowning woman" and she would have offered to help her. Mary Alice only saw the side of Gabrielle that most of the others saw: her expensive <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewelry.html" title="Jewelry">jewelry</a>, her fabulous designer clothing, and her diamond watch. Gabrielle knew that she was lonely since her husband <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Solis_7250.html" title="Carlos Solis">Carlos</a> was constantly away but knew that if she lost him or they separated she would be less happy than she already is. This is perhaps the reason that John Rowland is not only Gabrielle's personal gardener but also her current lover. As the two relax in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathtub.html" title="Bathtub">bathtub</a>, Gabrielle hears a noise from outside. When she looks out the window, she finds Carlos getting out of his car and checking the mail. Gabrielle panics and quickly devises a plan to get John out of there. The two race down the stairs and Gabrielle throws John out a window. John falls into the shrubs and quickly puts his shirt on. Simultaneously, Carlos enters the house oblivious of what is going on. Carlos asks why Gabrielle took a bath in the afternoon which she explains by saying that she just worked out. When Carlos asks where John is, Gabrielle quivers until John pleasantly greets the two from the window while trimming the shrubs. Carlos reminds John to finish work on the ficus tree which he will get on when he is finished. Carlos smiles and the scene ends with John trimming with only his shirt without pants on.</p>
<p>The women gather the following evening at <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Mayer_d071.html" title="Susan Mayer">Susan</a>'s to discuss the mysterious note that was used to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackmail.html" title="Blackmail">blackmail</a> Mary Alice. Susan thinks that they should share the letter with Paul since it could be used as evidence to find the writer. Gabrielle thinks that he would break down. <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bree_Van_De_Kamp_0cd5.html" title="Bree Van De Kamp">Bree</a> agrees but <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynette_Scavo_f643.html" title="Lynette Scavo">Lynette</a> scoffs at the suggestion since it would only make matters worse. The four leave without a resolution and decide to talk about it in the morning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bree tries to save her marriage with Rex by going to couple counseling with Dr. Albert Goldfine, supposedly Fairview's number 1 therapist. Dr. Goldfine has handled cases such as <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_abuse.html" title="Domestic abuse">domestic abuse</a>, affairs, and marital disputes but has never met anyone as eccentric as the Van De Kamps. At their first few sessions, Rex manages to get his complaints about the marriage out in the open but when it's time for Bree to talk she rambles on with small talk. Dr. Goldfine tells her to think about herself and Rex sometimes other than always obsessing about the housework or the children. As Dr. Goldfine gives Bree these suggestions, Bree focuses on a button that is torn on his suit. Later, Bree returns privately to Dr. Goldfine where she offers to re-sew his button. As she does him this favor, the two talk about how Rex always exaggerates and that the marriage is not entirely her fault. Dr. Goldfine agrees but he believes that the blame be put on both parties. At their next session, Rex talks once again and Dr. Goldfine manages to remind him that he should be thankful that Bree does all the nice things that she does because it is not mandated of her to do so. Rex feels shut down as Bree smiles back at Goldfine.</p>
<p>Susan decides to make her move on Mike by inviting him to one of her "annual" welcome dinners for the new neighbors. Mike accepts her offer. However knowing that her cooking is bad, Mike agrees to cook and hold it at his house. He also invites Julie to come as well. As they talk, they are interrupted by Edie who asks what is going on. Mike tells Edie that Susan has just invited him over for one of her traditional welcome dinners. Edie asks why she did not get one and Susan replies that it is a new tradition. Edie decides it will be fun and wants to join in. Mike says that it is up to Susan and feeling guilty decides that she can come. Susan definitely decides to bring Julie since she will save her from doing something awkward in front of Mike and Edie. Susan tries to get at Mike's early to help him but Edie has arrived unexpectedly before her.

Susan decides to butter up the dog by putting drops of gravy on her face. Susan successfully manages to get Bongo to like her but he accidentally swallows her earring and begins to choke. Mike rushes out of the house with the dog to drive it to the hospital. Julie and Edie stay behind to clean up as Susan follows Mike in her car. At the animal hospital, Susan apologizes to Mike which he also offers his apology since the dog was originally his deceased wife's. Susan realizes that Mike still has feeling for his dead wife and that he will not be available for a while. Susan quietly hugs him as they get the news that Bongo is alright.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Mike</b>: Edie isn't a vegetarian, is she?<br />
<b>Susan</b>: Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Edie's definitely a carnivore.</li>
<li><b>John:</b> This is great, I got tons of homework tonight. It's always easier to concentrate after sex.<br />
<b>Gabrielle:</b> Well, I'm glad I could help. Education is very important.</li>
<li><b>Gabrielle</b>: <i>(to Carlos)</i> Do you know how bored I was? I came this close to actually cleaning the house!</li>
<li><b>Mary Alice</b>: It is a rare man who truly understands the value of a single perfect rose.</li>
<li><b>Albert Goldfine</b>: I'm sure Freud would strongly disapprove of this.<br />
<b>Bree</b>: Oh, who cares what he thinks? I took psychology in college and we learned all about Freud. A miserable human being.<br />
<b>Albert Goldfine</b>: What makes you say that?<br />
<b>Bree</b>: Well, think about it. He grew up in the late 1800s. There were no appliances back then. His mother always did everything by hand. Backbreaking work from sun-up to sun-down. God only knows the other sacrifices she made to take care of her family. And what does he do? He grows up to be famous for saying that something wrong with a person can be traced back to something awful their mother has done. She must've felt so betrayed. He saw all the things she did for him. Did he even think to say "thank you"? I doubt it.</li>
<li><b>Julie</b>: <i>(imitating Susan)</i> Dear diary, Mike doesn't know I'm alive.<br />
<b>Susan</b>: Shut up.</li>
<li><b>Officer Hayes</b>: License and registration please.<br />
<i>(Lynette pulls it out)</i><br />
<b>Officer Hayes</b>: Ma'am, are you aware why I pulled you over?<br />
<b>Lynette</b>: I have a theory.<br />
<b>Officer Hayes</b>: The kids are standing up, playing. They should be sitting down, wearing their seat belts.<br />
<b>Lynette</b>: I yell at them but they don't listen. It's very frustrating.<br />
<b>Officer Hayes</b>: Well then, you should find a way to control them. After all, that's your job.<br />
<b>Mary Alice</b>: <i>(narrating)</i> Although Officer Hayes has been a policeman for 6 years, he's never been in a truly dangerous situation. He's also never told a mother how to raise her children.<br />
<b>Lynette</b>: <i>(after stepping out of her car, seething)</i> Are you saying I'm a bad mother? I have no help. My husband is always away on business. My babysitter joined the witness relocation program. I haven't slept through the night in 6 years, and for you to stand there and judge me.<br />
<b>Officer Hayes</b>: OK, I'm not gonna give you a ticket. I'll just let you off with a warning.<br />
<b>Lynette</b>: I accept your apology.<br />
<i>(takes her license back and goes back in the car)</i><br />
<b>Officer Hayes</b>: Buckle up!</li>
<li><b>Mary Alice</b>: The world visible to the dead is also visible by the living, but no one has the time to look. It's a shame, really. There's so much to see.</li>
<li><b>Lady</b>: Listen, it seems to me that you have some anger management issues.<br />
<b>Lynette</b>: I have four kids under six. I absolutely have anger management issues.</li>
<li><b>Lynette</b>: Run, boys, run!</li>
