<p>If there's any debate about the nature of the British Ahwazi group, perhaps we should create a page for the organization and lay out the arguments for both sides, instead of trying to delete links or add editorial comments.</p>

<p><b>Zora</b>,</p>
<p>We agreed to have a separate page for the Ahwazi separatist debate. We will then paste all your favorite pro-Ahwazi links there.</p>
<p>I dont know why you insist on pasting those links here.

<dd>I care when people are being oppressed, no matter who they are. I don't agree with separatists of any kind -- or nationalists of any kind. IMHO, nationalism is a nasty primate attitude that we should learn to transcend. Thus I'm unlikely to "sympathize" with people trying get their way through violence. However, I think we ought to tell it like it is, rather than pretend that unpleasant things don't exist. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:52, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We can "tell it as it is", by making a special page for it, instead of dragging the debate to the Ahvaz page itself. Im OK with the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_conflict_in_Khuzestan_af14.html" title="Ethnic conflict in Khuzestan">Ethnic conflict in Khuzestan</a> link you posted.</li>
<li>Im not OK with the section on the "origin of the name Ahvaz" that you have almost blanked out to 3 to 4 sentences. That information is very pertinent.</li>
<li>Arabs arent the only people in Iran who are having it rough. Iran's prisons of political dissidents are almost entirely filled up with Persians. Scenes like <a href="http://www.isna.ir/Main/PicView.aspx?Pic=Pic-517730-1" class="external text" title="http://www.isna.ir/Main/PicView.aspx?Pic=Pic-517730-1" rel="nofollow">this</a> are quite ubiquitous in the heartland of Persia.

<p>I've written an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_conflict_in_Khuzestan_af14.html" title="Ethnic conflict in Khuzestan">Ethnic conflict in Khuzestan</a> page.</p>
<p>As for the etymological analyses -- the writing in the section was extremely confusing, randomly jumping round the centuries. Citations from medieval etymologists are suspect, given that etymology (East, West, anywhere) used to be a matter of "Well, they sound similar to ME, I see a link". You can get from anywhere to anywhere by that method. Modern etymologists are much stricter in their methods. In fact, I'm thinking that the section should be cut down even further, eliminating the Elamite etymology, which is unsourced, and many of the alleged city names. I found citations only for Tarieana, Hormuzd-Ardashir, Suq-al-Ahwazi, Nazeiri, and Ahvaz (which I presume is the Persianized form of Ahwaz). Attempts to argue that Ahwaz/Ahvaz is actually a Persian name strike me as nationalist fantasies. The origin of the name, if it is Arab, doesn't alter the fact that the city seems to have been founded by people who were arguably "Persian" and that the city has been part of Persia for much -- but not all -- of its history.</p>
<p>I'd defer, of course, to any properly sourced citations from modern etymologists. Lacking those, cutting out the debatable material seems like the only honest course. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:27, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reply to Zora. Ahvaz <i>IS</i> Iranian.</span></h2>
<p>I will now debate you, not as a westerner, but as an Iranian who speaks the southern dialects prevalent in territories claimed by al-Ahwaz, where I was born, and as a native tongue.</p>
<ul>
<li>You said: <i>Citations from medieval etymologists are suspect, given that etymology (East, West, anywhere) used to be a matter of "Well, they sound similar to ME, I see a link". You can get from anywhere to anywhere by that method. Modern etymologists are much stricter in their methods.</i></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Modern etymologists being more strict doesnt make the medieval ones wrong.</li>
<li>Modern etymologists in fact base their conclusions on the collection of medieval accounts and studies. Without them, there is nothing to study.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You said: <i>In fact, I'm thinking that the section should be cut down even further, eliminating the Elamite etymology, which is unsourced</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is far from that in fact. I can give you as many sources as you like. That you dont find them acceptable is simply your POV.</p>
<p>If you studied Old Persian, you would realise that the cuneiform used was not an alphabet, but a cross between an abjad and a syllabary. U-W-J, also U-W-J-I-Y, U-J, U-J-I-Y is read /Hūjiya/; R. Kent (1953) writes that it appears incessantly in the cuneiform inscriptions, which explicitly equals "(h)altamti, (h)alamti". he also notes that the early middle persian form of the same word as /xuuź/, which appears in the arab traveler's writings when describing xuuzii - the language or dialect of xuuz. with the usual ethnonymic addition of the ezade and -staan, c.f. siistaan 'saka-land' etc., we get modern persian Khouzestan /xuz-e stan/. The index of Kent lists UVJ as <b>Elam</b>, but also lists in the *dictionary* section Hū(w)jiya "'Elamite, Susian'; derivation of preceding"; the preceding being Hū(w)ja "'Elam, Susiana', a province of the persian empire; also as ethnic, 'Elamite, Susian': Elam. hal-tam-tu, Akk. e-lam-mat, cf. MPers. Huź".</p>
<ul>
<li>You said: <i>Ahvaz (which I presume is the Persianized form of Ahwaz).</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Your presumption is simply and firmly incorrect. It's the other way around. Would you like me to give you another analysis for that?</p>
<ul>
<li>You said: <i>Attempts to argue that Ahwaz/Ahvaz is actually a Persian name strike me as nationalist fantasies.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The facts remain however, in spite of your opinion. The text you deleted is in fact derived from the publication of The Khuzestan Office of The Governor, held by Arabs by the way. I can give you Arabic citations for that.</p>
<ul>
<li>You said: <i>the city seems to have been founded by people who were arguably "Persian"</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not "arguably". But <i>Factually</i>. There are more archeological ruins in Khuzestan proving this than you can muster. The entire region was in fact Persian until the conquests. And the Persians never moved out. The Arabs came in.</p>
<ul>
<li>You said: <i>and that the city has been part of Persia for much -- but not all -- of its history.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm curious, can you give me relaible sources for this claim? This is one example of a day-light fallacy.</p>
<ul>
<li>You said: <i>I'd defer, of course, to any properly sourced citations from modern etymologists. Lacking those, cutting out the debatable material seems like the only honest course.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Granted.</p>
<p>Resources I have (grabbing randomly from the top of the pile): Khačikjan Margaret (1998): Elamite Language. Deshpande &amp; Hook eds. (1979): Aryan &amp; Non-Aryan in India (article: McAlpin, "Linguistic Prehistory: The Dravidian Situation"). Webber &amp; Belcher (eds.) (2003): Indus Ethnobiology: New Perspectives from the Field. Hole Frank (1987): The Archaeology of Western Iran: Settlement &amp; Society from Prehistory to the Islamic Conquest (Smithsonian Series in Archaeological Inquiry).</p>
<p>I hope those will allay any concern you have over my resources.</p>
<p>Also,</p>
<p>Whereas your arguments simply have no academic merit, I'm putting back the section. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 02:09, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Your insistence on seeing "Persianness" millenia into the past is the usual nationalistic distortion of history. I imagine that if you were sent in a time machine back to ancient Elam that you'd find it completely alien. What are the salient features of "Persianness"? What makes the Elamites Persian? That's why I said that they were "arguably" Persian -- it's a debatable point.</p>
<p>As to the region ALWAYS being Persian -- well, centuries of Arab rule rather counts against that, unless you've managed to convince yourself that the Ummayads and Abbasids sere Persians.</p>
<p>Several of the books you've cited have nothing to do with Hormuzd-Ardashir/Ahvaz. India? Dravidians? The fact that you have a book about the Elamite language doesn't prove that the derivation of Ahvaz from Ooksin is plausible, unless you cite something to that effect from the book. Ditto the archaeology book. Does it discuss the etymology of Ahvaz? I'll give way happily to the experts.</p>
<p>The quotes you give above re UWJ - xuuzi - Khuzi seem like a plausible etymology for Khuzestan. (Not that I could really tell without knowing the historical sound shift patterns.) But I fail to see any connection between Ahvaz/Ahwaz and Khuzi. It's Ahvaz that's in question, not Khuzi.</p>
<p>As to accepting medieval etymologies -- one has to distinguish between a dated citation showing that a city name was in use at a particular time, and a pre-scientific etymology, which is always a guess to be proven by more scientific methods. Linguists will always accept citations, and may choose to investigate pre-scientific etymological theories. But they may not. I have a number of older sources re Polynesia. One hundred years ago, authors who knew very little about the subject felt quite free to speculate about the derivation of Polynesian words and place names. No one even BOTHERS with Fornander and Reiter's etymologies any longer; they're just too bogus. You haven't shown that your medieval writers are any more trustworthy.</p>
<p>You've restored the section in all its garbled English glory. I'll let it sit for a day or two while I figure out what to do. Right now, I'll just point out that you seem to have misused the word "anagram". Perhaps you meant "acronym"? Do you have any evidence that the ancients used anagrams or acronyms to name their cities? I'm wondering if you may be thinking of modern terms like SF and LA, and extrapolating into the past. But without some citation of intermediate forms, it's just speculation.</p>
<p>The earliest use of an acronym that I know (just off the top of my head) was the Christian uses of the fish (ichthys in Greek) as a Christian symbol, because it stood for something like (Iesu Christo ... I forget the rest). But that was in the context of persecution, and picking a 'secret sign'. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:04, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Wrong. Read them before giving me an answer. The books in fact talk about the non-semitic, hence non-Arabic language of the Elamites.</li>
<li>The Khuzi language was in fact used in the courts of the Persian Empire, as is reported in the Al-fihrist, quoted by Ibn Moghaffa', Richard Frye, and many others. Where do you think <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susa.html" title="Susa">Susa</a> was?</li>

<dd>Look, if you can't come up with cites from the books you have confirming your derivation, then you don't get away with just telling me to read the books, it's in there.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The derivation of the town name is of antiquarian interest only; not knowing where the town's name came from doesn't detract from the article in the slightest, from the general information point of view. You want the derivation to prove that Ahvaz was Persian first, Persian forever, Persian in name always, rah rah rah. That's just silly. There are many towns in England, frex, with names that were Roman or Danish in origin. Does pointing that out mean that I want Italy or Denmark to conquer Britain? I don't think so. I don't know Arabic, so I don't know what Ahwazi might mean in Arabic. For all I know, it's a nasty ethnic slur that the Arab tribes used for the traders whom they believed were fleecing them. Maybe it means "penny-pinching rascal". Maybe they called the city "Suq al-Ahwaz" BEFORE the conquest, and once they were in charge, kept on using the name, the conquered being in no condition to object. If that's the case, so what? Does it mean that the city rightfully belongs to Iraq? I don't think so.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>Given that you can't cite anything concrete re the derivation of the name, why not just leave out the whole discussion?

<dd>As for arguing that the Abbasids were "Persian" -- well, all the scholars agree that Islamic civilization was heavily influenced by the Persians -- and also by the Arabs, and the conquered Greeks. The influences went in all directions. That's part of what made it a "Golden Age". My Persian literature text says that Modern Persian (post-Islamic-conquest) was heavily influenced by Arabic, and contains not only imported vocabulary, but imported syntax. So it seems rather beside the point to point to the influences going from Persia to the caliphate, and ignore the influences coming into Persia from the caliphate.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Historical debate</span></h2>
<p>I am of the same opinion as Zora. However, this is meant to be an encyclopaedia and all sides have to be represented. The historical debate is an important one and has to be reported without bias. I therefore think that we should work together to bring both sides of the argument - as there evidently is a dispute over Ahwaz - instead of acting divisively and unilaterally, deleting text and links without discussion or adequate reasoning. Perhaps we can have a short section for either side of the argument, accompanied by links to relevant sites.<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">Ahwaz</a></p>

<p>I've read the debate several times but I couldnt figure out what do you want to say.Well I've been to Ahvaz and lived there for like a month. I had alot of interaction with people there as I have many both Khuzestani persian and minority arab friends. ( I've studied its history in depth from Elamite Empire to now for one of my projects about historic city of <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susa.html" title="Susa">Susa</a> ) So I would want to ask some questions about its ethnic arab population&#160;:</p>
<p>1.Do you know where and when did they come to Khuzestan&#160;?</p>
<p>2.where did they historically settle&#160;?</p>
<p>3.What have been their main profession&#160;?</p>
<p>4.When and why did they settle in Ahvaz&#160;?--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmir85_75f5.html" title="User:Amir85">Amir85</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>You seem to assuming that Arabic-speakers are necessarily of Arab descent and thus recent arrivals, settlers, in a historically Persian area. Not necessarily so. People adopt the language of their conquerors. Most of the population of the Middle East isn't of pure Arabian descent. Over time, many of the dhimmis converted to Islam and as was the custom of the time, were taken into one of the Arab tribes as a client. So it is very likely that many of the Arabs that you clearly see as "them" are in fact descended from the same stock that lived there during Achaemenid and Sassanid times.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given that the borders of the area now known as Khuzestan have been shifting back and forth for centuries, it is not at all surprising that the population of the area should form a continuuum with the rest of the population of the lower Mesopotamian valley, rather than there being a sharp discontinuity at the current border. That can be so without the Arabs being "interlopers" and recent immigrants to the current province.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the rest of your questions -- based only on my current reading, the Arabs in Ahvaz immigrated from the villages to work in the oil and steel industries, and they are concentrated in the lesser-skilled, manual labor jobs. Given that Ahvaz had become a mere village before it grew again to its present size, just about everyone in Ahvaz is an immigrant. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 17:28, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact, it's a straight steal from the website of the Khuzestan Province Governor Generalship, which was clearly written by someone who didn't know English well and couldn't organize his/her thoughts.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In a province where separatism or ethnic discontent is rife, where failure to toe the party line is personally dangerous, of course the website is biased.

<p>Is Ahvaz derived from the Arabic Ahwaz, or is Ahwaz the Arabic pronunciation of the Persian word Ahvaz? <i>[what a stupid question. It only shows the ignorance of its author. Ahvaz and Ahwaz are merely different pronunciations of the same word. The real question is where does the name originate from]</i></p>
<p>This apparently minor question <i>[if it was minor, it wouldnt be blanked out in the first place]</i> has provoked some online controversy, with Persian nationalists <i>[oh? And what about Pan-Arab Nationalists?]</i> insisting that "Ahvaz" was the original Persian name, and that Ahwaz is just an Arabic version. They say that a 12th century Arab named Abu-Mansoor Javalighi wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ahvaz is the name of an Iranian city which its Persian name has been Arabicized and the Arabs have accepted the Persian dictation of the word.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The translation is clumsy <i>[oh really? So you know Arabic?]</i>,</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is BAD UNGRAMMATICAL English. I don't have to read Arabic to know that the English is messed up. It should be something like "Ahvaz is the name of an Iranian city whose Persian name has been Arabicized". The rest of the sentence is nonsensical and must be a mistranslation of some sort. "Accepted a dictation" is just wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<p>no verifiable source is given <i>[unverifiable? Says who? YOU?&#160;:) ]</i>,</p>
<dl>
<dd>Without a proper Arabic name and a reference to a particular printed version, I have no way of knowing whether or not the source is a complete fabrication.</dd>
</dl>
<p>and the name of the source seems to have been transcribed by a non-Arabic speaker <i>[Hence his Arabic name!]</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>But that is not how Arabic is transliterated into English. I've been reading enough Islamic history over the last year to know darn well what Arabic looks like. What you've got there is a Persian version of an Arab name transliterated into English.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why a historian writing five hundred years after the adoption of the name should be a trusted source is unclear. <i>[For the same reason we dont outright dismiss herodotus or any other historian of antiquity.]</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>We don't accept Herodotus without checking his statements, for anything OTHER than matters he observed with his own eyes -- and even for those we have to figure out how his culture and upbringing would have affected what he saw, and how he reported it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Arab Ahwazi separatists <i>[ah, notice the label "nationalist" does not appear here!]</i> have argued that Ahwaz is a version of the Arabic Ahawaz.<i>[verifiable source is not provided for this claim]</i></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>... the word of Alahwaz is ploral of the word of the HOZ and in arabic the root of the HOZ is HAZ that means "To own and to pessess in the same time," as it's used in Alahwaz during the people's conversations (dialogues) as they say "This is the hoz of such as a person and the other is the hoz of some one else, that mean the land with the known border belonges to that person".</i> <a href="http://www.alahwaz.org/618.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.alahwaz.org/618.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.alahwaz.org/618.htm</a>]</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>[Ever thought why people say "Akhmed" instead of the correct "Ahmed"? It's because the letter "ح" (deep throated h) and "خ" (kh) are quite similar sounding letters. Since Khuz-i was the langauage conversed by the Persian royalty of Susa, as has been verified in multiple Arabic sources beyond doubt, therefore the word "خوز" easily takes the pronunciation of</i> Hoz<i>, hence both the word "Ahwaz", "Hoveizeh", and "Khuzestan", with the Persian "-stan" suffix appearing at the end.]</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Your idea of what is plausible doesn't convince me in the least. I've seen too many junk etymologies. Real linguists demonstrate an overall pattern of sound shifts, instead of making them up on the spot. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 12:14, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, an etymology triumphantly put forward in a political argument, without historical citations or any support from a trained linguist, is also suspect. <i>[as is true about its counter claims]</i></p>
<p>Apparently, there are no citations of any use of the terms Ahwaz or Ahvaz before the Arab conquest in 630 C.E. Before that, the city was known as Hormuzd-Ardashir, or shortened versions thereof. Arab histories describe the newly conquered town as the Suq-al-Ahwaz, the Bazaar of Ahwaz (referring to the destruction of part of the city, and the survival of the commercial section). Lacking any citations or contemporary inscriptions, it seems to yet other observers that there is not enough evidence, one way or another, to decide whether Ahwaz/Ahvaz was originally an Arabic or a Middle Persian word <i>[of course there is. You just have to accept the word of the historians]]</i>... nor is it clear why the name's etymology is so important that nationalists and separatists should quarrel about it.</p>
<p>[Because some Bengali from Hawaii gives herself the authority to decide that Ahwaz does not belong to Iran, ignoring 7000 years of Iranian history in the region, instead of writing about subjects of her expertise, such as Hindi films.]</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's quite amusing that you think I'm a Bengali. I'm half Swedish and half Texan, I grew up on the U.S. mainland, I speak French and Tongan, and a smattering of Hawaiian, Japanese, and Hindi; I'm a cultural dilettante. I am by no means an expert on Persian culture, but I may be one of the few Westerners you know who has read large chunks of the Shah Nameh and the surviving Zend Avesta in translation, has edited two volumes of English translation of Persian literature (Khayyam, Hafiz, Saadi -- available through Project Gutenberg), and listens to Jamshid and Axiom of Choice. I would <i>defer</i> to you and to Zereshk on matters of Persian culture and history if it weren't so painfully clear that in addition to what you guys DO know, you also "know" a great deal that isn't so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Arguing with you two reminds me of a year or so I spent in a Usenet discussion group arguing about Tibet with a few ardent Chinese imperialists. The same labored historical arguments -- "the Yuan Dynasty (i.e. the Mongols) conquered Tibet therefore Tibet belongs to China by historical right". I point out that if that claim were carried to its logical conclusion, China would be claiming most of Russia and the Middle East, and it doesn't. Point ignored, return to claiming Tibet. How come you guys aren't claiming the very broadest extent of the old Persian empires?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>IMHO, ethnic and linguistic nationalism doesn't work very well for former "empires". The Ottoman, the Russian, the Chinese, and the Persian empires were unabashedly expansionist and managed to grab chunks of all sorts of territories inhabited by people who weren't Turkish, Russian, Han, or Persian. The Ottoman and Russian empires have fallen apart, but the Chinese and the Persians are still trying to hang onto the old imperial possessions even if the the outlying regions aren't culturally or linguistically Han or Persian. It's a basic confusion about the justification for the state.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other thing that you and Zereshk don't seem to get is that I'm not a nationalist. I don't BELIEVE in ethnic and linguistic nationalism. Abolish the U.S.! Abolish the Islamic Republic of Iran! Abolish Ahwazistan! Abolish everything! I spit on all flags impartially! Explaining what I do believe would take too long; perhaps I ought to put it up on my web page. Yes, this gives me a POV -- but it also allows me to see that many things that other people accept as perfectly "natural" and "obvious" are in fact POV, just a particularly pervasive one.

<dd>Greetings to you too, Zora. Your opinions concerning the issue of old empires and the modern 'nation-state' aside, what you have to keep in mind that modern day Iran formed the core of what was the Persian Empire, which acquired many territories from ancient times up until the 1700's when the empire fell into decline under the Qajar dynasty. However, none of these territories were ever part of Iran itself. The Persian Empire was not Iran - Iran was only the centre of this empire. And all the provinces of modern day Iran, including Khuzestan, had been part of Iran since it's foundation under Cyrus the Great, though this goes back even further to the Elamite Empire, who really were the architects of what was to become Iran as we know it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You also have to realise that Iran, like Israel, is more than just a nation, it is a concept founded thousands of years ago with it's origins going back to the Elamite era. Iran is not a modern nation, but an ancient civilisation, and the people of Iran do not think the same way that Westerners do as far as ideas concerning nationhood are concerned. The same goes for people in India and the tensions they have with Pakistan. Similar tensions arose when Russian imperialism led to the separation of Azarbaijan from Iran, and these tensions continue to exist today. And one thing you are forgetting about Iran is that the vast majority of the population - Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Gilanis, Bakhtiaris, etc. - are all related. That is to say, we have the same origins. Kurds, for example, were known as Medes in ancient times and were one of the founding peoples of Iran, along with with the Persians and the Parthians (and the Elamites before any of them). <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 12:51, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because what you and Zora have been promoting IS historical revisionism. No historian worth his salt would give these sort of views the time of day. On top of which, Zereshk has also done his research on the subject and provided more than enough references. It is obvious that you don't like the truth for political reasons, and that you state there is a campaign to 'ethnically cleanse' the Arabs from Khuzestan is ridiculous and absurd and carries no weight, as there is no evidence. There is, however, plenty of evidence to support the fact that there is a campaign, begun by the British during the height of their empire, to separate Khuzestan by force in the name of liberating the Arab minority - and yes, before the war, the Arabs were most definitely a minority group in the province. And as for ethnic cleansing, these fringe 'Ahwazi' groups you seem to support so strongly, were not only pro-Saddam, but were also involved in the genocide of both Persians and Iranian Arabs. And now that Saddam is gone, they are attempting to get the Western world on their side.

<dd>Nonsense? You know, I originally had some empathy for you in regards to anti-Arab prejudice, which does exist to some degree, and also in regards to Arabic-speakers being marginalised politically, since I have many Arab friends and acquaintances in Khuzestan and Bandar Abbas, and not only that, but because Iranian Arabs (and not illegal immigrants or workers from Iraq or Persian Gulf states) are just as Iranian as anyone else, be they Persian, Kurdish, Azeri, Lori, or any of the other Iranian groups. But you are promoting revisionist views which are not only historically incorrect and false, but also incendiary. I don't know you, and I don't like to make assumptions since you may very well be truly misinformed and mislead through your involvement with these anti-Iranian 'Ahwazi' groups. Maybe you are not involved with such groups, but have bought into their views. I really don't know. What I can say with absolute certainty is that these views are indeed revisionist and false, and the references are all there for you to check out for yourself. You will recall that Persian-speakers have the oldest heritage in Khuzestan, since Arabic=speakers only entered the scene after the Islamic invasion.</dd>

<dd>As for your other comments, such as the alleged 'confiscation' of Arab land - what Arab land? Is there Persian land as well? Khuzestan is Khuzestan, and there is no land allocated for just Persians or just Arabs or for whoever else. Like most other Persian Khuzestanis, my family bloodlines have always been firmly established in the province. My ancestors did not 'immigrate' to Khuzestan. I am not an ethnic Persian from Fars province or Mazandaran or whatever. You may not like this fact, but Persian Khuzestanis are Khuzestani and this heritage is not in dispute, except by these radical pan-Arabist groups.</dd>

If the regime does something against a certain group, do you think most Iranians support that? Are you so ignorant and biased that you cannot see what you are saying? Are you not able to see for yourself that in Iran, in Khuzestan, most Persians and Arabs live side-by-side peacefully and without incident? This regime is anti-Iranian Arab, but certainly not anti-Arab since the Khomeinists funnel countless amounts of cold hard cash to Arab terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. The regime, like the British colonialists of old who tried and failed to conquer Khuzestan, feed and thrive upon conflict.</dd>

<dd>Yes, Zereshk, Arabs are the source of all evil in the world and have no right to live in Khuzestan. They must be eliminated, root and branch and wiped out of Khuzestan's history so they become aliens. After all, this is what IRNA is saying, so it must be true. Have you seen the living conditions of Khuzestani Arabs? While the Iranians pump oil wealth out of the region, the Arabs are left with nothing. Even the Palestinians are better off than the Arabs of Khuzestan. Do you think that this is fair payment for the crimes of history?</dd>

<dd>This is becoming even more ridiculous. Iranians spending the oil wealth elsewhere? Do you think the oil wealth benefits any Iranian or any province?

Instead you continue to attack the facts and established history and try to change the subject and make all these unfounded and false accusations as you have done once again above.

<dd>Zereshk: I can't see how you can claim to have a neutral position when you blame all Arabs for the actions of Saddam Hussein. I have stated that I am and always have been against Saddam. I have never glorified those groups supported by him - see what I wrote on <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_conflict_in_Khuzestan_af14.html" title="Ethnic conflict in Khuzestan">ethnic conflict in Khuzestan</a>. There is no denial of Saddam's crimes and how he tried to hijack Arab issues in Khuzestan. Remember, chemical weapons do not attack races, only people and Arabs were also killed by Saddam in Khuzestan. But that does not excuse the persecution of Khuzestan's indigenous Arab population by the regime in Tehran, both before and after the revolution. According to the regime's own statistics, 80% of Khuzestan's Arab children suffer malnutrition, 50% of Arabs are illiterate, the majority are unemployed or under-employed and their culture is subjugated by ethnic Persian hegemony. The facts are facts. You cannot change them. I am less interested in the historical arguments than the current realities, in which the Arabs are far more deprived than ethnic Persians. Yes, this is caused by the bastards in power, but the Iranian monarchists are not any better. The denial of the identity of Khuzestan's Arabs is a classic example of Persian chauvinism.</dd>

<p>Southern Comfort, you reverted to a version that contains quotes from an OLDER version of the Encyclopedia Iranica, in preference to more recent quotes. You also insist on including a chunk of prose, in garbled and substandard English, copied directly from a Persian government website, without attribution -- a copyright violation. You have censored any mention of the etymology advanced by Ahwazi separatists. You also reverted all the edits that I made to the rest of the article, without even engaging with them -- even though they were taken from the Encyclopedia Iranica, which you and Zereshk otherwise seem to trust.

<dl>
<dd>The version that is online is significantly different from the one you cite. The online edition is much more likely to be current -- 1985 is old, for academic works. As for the copyvio -- Zereshk, own up. When I found the website, I figured out where you'd gotten your text, in all its garbled glory. Word for word. That can't have been a quote from the Encyclopedia Iranica, even an older edition, because the Encyclopedia is edited by English-speakers who would not make such mistakes. As for including someone's opinion being POV -- I think you've missed the point of Wikipedia. It's not to exclude views that make you uncomfortable, it's to present all the viewpoints. Please note that my version did NOT take sides on the origin of the name. There is a controversy (however minor) and presenting both sides is not POV. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:04, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Zereshk states below, there is only one edition of the Encyclopedia Iranica, and there was nothing wrong with the quotes he was using, since they came from this scholarly source. And let us say, for instance, purely for the sake of argument, that the print version is 'older' than the online version, or that certain data which is in the print version may not be available online - which also would not be unusual. What difference does that make exactly? Is established historical fact (that 'Ahvaz' originates from the root 'Avaz') subject to change? As for 'excluding' other so-called views, what you are promoting is revisionism, pure and simple. You can call it what you like, it's revisionism. You did not take sides, that much is true, but by including revisionist speculation by a fringe movement (which is not even popular amongst Iran's Arab minority, just like how the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq Organization has no popular support amongst the Iranian populace as a whole - both movements having been pro-Saddam), you are debasing the nature of Wikipedia as being a source of facts, rather than speculation, especially speculation from a virulently racist anti-Iranian political group (based in Britain) which wants the expulsion of Persian Khuzestanis (who have always been in Khuzestan since ancient times) and the formation of a chauvinist Arab state.</dd>

<dd>Whatever controversy exists is in your mind and in the mind of these pan-Arabists. The academic community has never given the revisionism that these groups promote the time of day, and you will not find one academic or scholarly source who will back up such claims. Search for yourself if you don't believe me. Find every single book on Iranian history (and there is plenty in the English language) that is out there and find one iota of evidence that Ahvaz is not of Persian origin. Please, by all means, go forth and reveal to us the truth - but be sure to back up your claims without relying upon political propaganda. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 23:04, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I deleted (for now) all the stuff from other sources, and just kept the Encyclopedia Iranica stuff, which she accepts. That all by itself is enough, as it clearly states the origins of Ahvaz.

<dl>
<dd>I have to say that Zora appears to have some problems and issues with Iranians and Shi'a. My opinion is that we keep the original version you had put up, which was fine as it was and the sources were all verifiable. Zora appears to think that only online sources must be referenced, which is not the case. If this was so, then Wikipedia would not be possible. Zora can complain and beat her chest all she wants, as loud as she wants, and complain to admins as often as she wants. But facts are facts, and when the facts are as clear and emphatic as they are here, there is no disputing them. The fact that she has to resort to referencing fringe 'Ahwazi' groups to support her claims proves her POV and potentially bigoted nature. I hate making accusations like that, but what else is one to surmise from the endless problems and conflicts she initiates in regards to Shi'a and Iran-related pages? Her actions are not dissimilar to neo-Nazis trying to reference their own online sources (i.e. racist propaganda) to 'prove' that Nordics are indeed 'Aryans' or using the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to 'prove' that there is a global Jewish conspiracy. On top of all this, as I've stated before, as evidenced by her previous edits on this page and the 'Ethnic conflict in Khuzestan,' her lack of knowledge concerning this subject is painfully obvious and one doesn't go storming in and making changes when they have no idea what the hell they are talking about.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Iranian history cannot be denied. There are some things which are open to debate, such as census numbers, but established historical facts are not open to idle speculation and revisionism. Zora's complaints have literally no foundation whatsoever, and the section you had presented was NPOV because it was 100% factually accurate, with references to boot. It's true that the recent changes you've made should be enough as it is, but I feel the previous section was also very good. The fact is that the Encyclopedia Iranica is the 'end-all, be-all' of Iranian history, and there are other very good texts around with the same information, but the most complete texts are generally from the 30's-60's, and of course, Zora has a problem with 'old' history books, despite the fact that they are still used and accepted in current university curriculum. But she isn't the dictator of Wikipedia, and Wikipedia is a sourcebook of facts - and as we've both stated countless times again, all this information is very well documented and established as fact. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 23:04, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Zereshk's latest edit cleared out the copyvio (which he won't admit was a copyvio) but it mangled the Encyclopedia Iranica references. What is there now is a mixture of the 1985 version and the online version, faithful to neither one, and still attributed to the author of the 1985 article rather than the online version.</p>
<p>I don't think it's accurate to say that I "accept" the Encyclopedia Iranica as the the final arbiter of all things Persian. It seems to be a good, sound, well-meaning academic source. It gives the names of the authors, and references to further reading. I would trust that everything in there is something that a reasonable person might believe. This is not to say that its conclusions will never be overturned by further study ... of course some, or even many, of them will be revised. Nor is it to say that all academics and/or experts would accept all of its conclusions ... I'm sure that they don't. It's just it's MORE trustworthy than many of the sources I've seen.</p>
<p>It's also just completely WRONG to insist that any references to sources with which you don't agree should be deleted. Wikipedia does not handle controversy by declaring one side or another right. We try to step back and present both sides of the case. In my rewrite, I tried to do that. But evidently anything that mentions an Arab origin for the town name must be suppressed ... <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:23, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Read my comments above, as I've responded as clearly as I possibly can to this insane level of ignorance. As I've said, political propaganda is not a legitimate reference. I've challenged you to find one, JUST ONE, factual, scholarly source to back up this alleged claim of Arab origin, without relying on political propaganda websites. If what you say is true, it shouldn't be difficult now, should it? I daresay that you will find, as others have, that 'Ahvaz' is derived from 'Avaz' - all very much Persian and Iranian. It just doesn't get much clearer than that now, does it?

I have presented the challenge to her - if she truly wants to 'prove' that Ahvaz has possible Arab origins, without relying on a political propaganda website. I mean it's really, truly absurd. It's one thing to reference an academic and scholarly source to back up one's claims. It's quite another to reference blatant revisionist propaganda - off a website, no less.

<p>I see that Zereshk has incorporated my link to the Behistun inscriptions into the controversial etymology, but where the link transliterates the old Persian as uvja, Zereshk has added ahvja as a possible reading. Where does this come from? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:11, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I actually put in <i>avâja</i>, not "ahvja". The word appears in the text <a href="http://www.livius.org/be-bm/behistun/behistun06.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.livius.org/be-bm/behistun/behistun06.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. <i>Ûvja</i> appears in both.</li>

<dd>And when this issue of the Iranian origins of 'Ahvaz' has been settled, despite the fact that it was settled so long ago and documented so thoroughly in the annals of history, what will Zora attack next, I wonder? I again bring up the example that discussing these issues with her is akin to debating whether or not the earth is round with a 'flat earthist.' None of us should have to justify legitimate, established history with this ignorant user. This is like debating 'Holocaust revisionism' - the facts state that six million Jews died - period. To state otherwise or to debate this issue is to enter into historical revisionism. Likewise, Iranian history has been well established and thoroughly researched. To debate this history is to enter into historical revisionism. Zora should be ignored, so as not to encourage her revisionist tendencies. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 23:49, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Zereshk, you are claiming that avâja is a reasonable reading of the cuneiform text that the livius site reads ûvja. It is not at all clear to me that this is so. I did more #@$%@#$% research. I couldn't find a copy of the cuneiform original of the Behistun inscription, so I went to the inscription on Darius' tomb, also at livius <a href="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DNa.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DNa.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. That page has the original cuneiform, their version of the Persian, and their English translation, and the disputed word occurs on the page. I found the relevant line in the inscription, 22, and copied down the cuneiform. I then found a site that gives an Old Persian syllabary: <a href="http://www.ancientscripts.com/oldpersian.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ancientscripts.com/oldpersian.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and puzzled out my own translation. Since the script uses ja or va as consonants, and there's no reinforcing vowel signs after the ja and va, it's reasonable to read the word as uvj. It's not reasonable to read it as avj, or avaja, because the script has two distinct signs for <i>a</i> and <i>u</i>, and the inscription uses the <i>u</i> sign. Avaja can't be the Elamite version, as that's Halamtu.</p>
<p>You know, I would happily accept that Ahwaz, in Suq-el-Ahawz, is the Arabic version of an old Persian or Elamite city or place name if there were any believable source. I don't want to advance a particular version of events; I just want to find out what happened. But it seems to me that you've decided what conclusion you want to reach, and you're busy digging up evidence to support the foregone conclusion. You're citing old works (for which you carefully don't give the dates), or geographers writing five hundred years after the controversial Arabic translation/transliteration/neologism/whatever. You're using an older version of the Encyclopedia Iranica and refusing to believe that the online version could be new and improved. This is all in service of some sort of holy war to erase any vestige of Arabic influence from the history of the province. That does not lead me to trust your version of events.</p>
<p>But that's OK. There's room in the article for your version of the etymology. But what about <i>allowing</i> the alternate views? That Ahwaz IS an Arabic word? or that there isn't enough info to know?</p>
<p>What fascinates me is that there MIGHT be evidence that would settle the matter. Instead of relying on relatively late texts, what about clay tablets? Inscriptions? The cache of accounting tablets found at Persepolis? We might be able to reconstruct the rise and fall of cities in old Elam/Susiana/Arabestan/Khuzestan and figure what they were called when. Solving a controversy with NEW evidence would be the best way, yes? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:17, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A suggestion</span></h2>
<p>Many of you have cited the Encyclopaedia Iranica. As a suggestion, it's very healthy to use more than one type of reference when trying to get facts. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 14:39, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Encyclopedia Iranica is not the only reference cited on the main page, as anyone can see. In addition, it is considered the most authoritative source on Iranian history. How many sources will we have to provide in order to prevent Zora from attempting to promote the revisionist idea (and I stress this point, because this is revisionism, verging on historical denial) that Ahvaz is of Arabic origin? If Zora wants to set up a third party website which promotes this idea, that's perfectly alright. But this is an encyclopedia, and you will not find any encyclopedia or academic reference which justifies her motives, nor will you find in any encyclopedia or schoarly work the idea that Ahvaz (or Khuzestan) is of Arabic origin. If you don't believe me, by all means please check the references out for yourself. I challenged Zora several times to prove that what is presented on the Khuzestan-related pages to be factually incorrect. She avoided the question and insisted on delving into this historical revisionism/denial. There is no tolerance for such behaviour in the academic community, and likewise there should be no tolerance for this type of thing here on Wikipedia. I, and other users, have become increasingly frustrated in having to deal with Zora in these matters and her attempts at undoing all our many hours of hard work and research. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 22:54, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's not <i>undoing</i> to allow other points of view. As for academic argument -- I took the trouble to look up the inscriptions by Darius, find a site that gives the accepted sound values for the Persian cuneiform, and did an independent transliteration: I got uvj, not avj. Since the script discriminates between a and u, you can't just assert that they are the same thing. Persian government websites are worthless evidence in this regard. Rather than deal with this, you just tell me that I'm insane and not worth debating.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm NOT saying that there's definitive proof that Ahwaz/Ahvaz is an Arabic rather than a Persian or Elamite word. I'm just saying that the issue is more open than you assert. Since the name first makes its appearance with the Arab invaders, there's a possibility that it's an Arabic word ... just as there's a possibility that it's just an Arabic pronunciation of a name that was current before the invasion. The Achmaemenid inscriptions are really not much help here, since they were chiseled more than a thousand years before the Arab invasion. That's a long time, for an area that saw so many wars and invaders. The name of the province, Khuzestan, doesn't prove anything, since it's NEW; the province was known as Arabestan under the Safavids and Qajars. I imagine that there's some historical evidence, somewhere, of how the name was chosen/created/whatever.</dd>

<dl>

<dd>Since I don't believe in Arabic nationalism, or ethnic separatism, I'm NOT making these arguments because I believe that Khuzestan should be a province of Iraq or an independent nation. I don't.

<dd>Bogus history? I'm not going to get into this with you again, and so far you have been the only one to dispute these facts. You accuse me of Persian nationalism (funny how I have not attempted to promote a political agenda in these articles) - I in turn accuse you of being pro pan-Arabist. It's a pointless discussion. The page is NPOV as it stands and the references are legitimate. If the references were 'bogus,' then that would be something. But they are references from actual sources and historians. I'm sorry, but your arguments have consistently been moot. You can invite as many third-parties as you want, and I think that they would all find that the articles are fine as they are, and certainly fall within the realm of NPOV. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 23:33, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I fail to see why I should be accused of bigotry. The only major things on which we differ are:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) Organization. You want to put an expanded etymology section front and center. It's a pointless argument, and it doesn't matter one way or the other. You seem to think it has some political significance. From my point of view, the legitimacy of the central government derives from the consent of the governed, not from convoluted historical and etymological claims. If the governed are unhappy, you aren't going to make the unhappiness go away by citing history at them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) The size of the etymology section. If it has to be there, then a few paras in a side note near the end is enough, and probably more than most Wikipedia users want. You seem to want to pack in everything that comes to hand, and it's confused and unreadable. Not only that, it duplicates the history section. That's why history should come first and then the etymology note.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) A few points of emphasis in the history. I would have to do more research, but I believe that your treatment of Sheikh Khazal and the Kabide Emirate is inaccurate.

<dd>I agree that she blatantly vandalized the article, which is what I've been saying all along. She deleted practically the whole article to further her own obscure political agenda of 'ambiguity in history,' whatever the hell she means by that. And she did this without even the slightest discussion. She consistently derides the information as being 'inaccurate' and POV, simply because she doesn't like the idea of established history. This is saying nothing of the fact that she contributed absolutely nothing to the article, while deleting all the pertinent data, and yet claims not to have vandalized the article. I would love to see her attempt this sort of propaganda with the Jewish holocaust or the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_California_b3e2.html" title="History of California">History of California</a>, or any other article for that matter.

<dd>And yes, her lack of education and ignorance in this subject, most evident in her stereotyping of Khuzestani Arabs as all being separatists and anti-Iranian and whatever the else she wants to believe about them, is fantastically ridiculous. She also claims that only 'Arab separatists' use the Arabic pronunciation, <i>Ahwaz</i>, which is simply not true at all. And she also objects to any mention of Sheikh Khaz'al. It all smacks of Orientalism and political bias on her part. Edward Said would not be amused. And yet she will continue to condemn anyone who adheres to history as being a 'nationalist.'

<h2><span class="mw-headline">if I may ...</span></h2>
<p>I see a lot of contention on this page. I do not want to get involved as I know little about Persia (except that I have personal reasons for being a huge fan of Cyrus the Great) (and I assume that isn't the "Persian" spelling), and I <i>really</i> do not want to make things worse, and if anyone thinks I am doing that, I apologize in advance. As to conflicts over style, I can give no constructive advice. In some cases, consulting the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a> might help, but usually the best way to go is <i>first</i> to gently explain why you think the way something is phrased or organized will make it hard for the average reader to understand, and then see if you can work out a mutually acceptable solution. There are two good reasons for this advice, and I speak as an experienced writer: On the one hand, the author (presumably an expert) has to recognize that he or she does not have distance from his or her own writing, and a non-expert is almost always in a better position to comment objectively on style. On the other hand, the copy-editor, no matter how good their ear for articulate phrasing, their eye for eloquent prose, will often miss highly nuanced matters of content that only an expert can perceive and understand (i.e, what appears to be an improvement in style <i>unintentionally</i> leads to an inaccurate sentence). I hope opposing parties see this as giving good reasons for listening to one another seriously.</p>
<p>As to disputes over content, this may be a little easier to resolve than you might think. Easier, because Wikipedia articles <i>are not arbiters of truth</i>. Period. This is the essence of the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> policy. Talk pages are not contests to prove one person wrong and another person right, they just aren't. There is only one relevant question: do you have a legitimate and appropriate source for your claim? If you do, include your claim in the article along with a citation. What if two people make opposing claims and both have sources? <i>It doesn't matter</i>. Each puts in their claim with their source (e.g. "According to X, .... but according to Y, ...." The only think left to argue over is whether the source is appropriate and legitimate. Here too the solution is easy. Include the claim and the source, and then mention that some people believe that the source is not appropriate or legitimate. If possible, state <i>who</i> thinks the source is inappropriate or illegitimate (and no, the "who" isn't a wikipedian, but someone who has published on this topic), and if possible give a concise explanation as to why they question the legitimacy of the source. In short, if you see a claim you do not like, even a claim you are <i>absolutely convinced is wrong,</i> <u>do not delete it</u>. Just (1) insist that the editor who put the claim in provide the source, and (2) agree that since you are not going to delete the editor's claim as long as there is a source, that you have the right to add that some either take a different view (provide source) or some question the source (provide source). End of conflict. I hope. And I hope all understand that I have written this with the utmost respect for all who have contributed to this article, <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 22:21, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just got a wonderful book, Touraj Daryaee's 2002 <i>Sahrestaniha i Eransahr</i>. A translation of the famous Middle Persian text into English and modern Persian, with notes and commentary. I'm going to use it to rewrite the history and etymology sections -- LATER. Right now, I just wanted to work on the formatting. I have long thought that the layout is ugly and confusing, that the etymology section logically FOLLOWS the history section, and that both belong at the end of the article rather than at the front. I'm hoping that SC and Zereshk will accept the changed layout. Then we can limit the argument to the history and etymology sections. OK?

Yes, I found a citation for a late Sassanid use of Xuzestan in the Eransahr book, in a 3rd century inscription of Sabuhr I.

<p>Before I start I would like to thank Zereshk for inviting me to this conversation. Here is a little information for those of you who do not have in not information on <a href="../../../a/h/v/Ahvaz.html" title="Ahvaz">Ahvaz</a> to be even a part of this conversation (Zora included).

The city has been part of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> and the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">persian Empire</a> for as far back as the <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elamite_Empire_2aeb.html" title="Elamite Empire">Elamite Empire</a>.

This problem has been solved in <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaties.html" title="Treaties">treaties</a>, acknowledgment and apparently in these conversations so please give up and stop changing the Ahvaz site.

<dd>Guys, the Elamites were Elamites. They are no more "Persian" than the Babylonians were Arab.

<p>Actually if u insist on knowing the <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indians</a> are also related to Persians.

<dd>Mind you, that is just a theory. Possible linguistic connections between Elamites and Dravidians do not necessarily equate to common ethnic origins. If this were the case, then Europeans, Iranians, and Indians would share common ethnic origins due to linguistic connections, but then again, this is only one theory out of many and is often disputed. The Elamites were certainly not Persian (I don't think Pedram was implying this), but they did ultimately become an Iranian people and their civilization formed the basis for the later civilization of the Aryan tribal groups when they settled the area - and Iranian does not automatically equal Persian, as this is an inclusive term for the peoples who are (and were) indigenous to the Iranian plateau. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 23:59, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, that makes sense. I still think we should include the Arabic name at the top, however. The main reason is the city's significant Arab population, and also for historical reasons. This is the same reason, for exapmle, why we have the Kurdish name at the <a href="../../../d/i/y/Diyarbak%C4%B1r.html" title="Diyarbakır">Diyarbakır</a> article. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 05:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ahwaz is actually more common than "Ahvaz".

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Only people in Persian-speaking parts of Iran use Ahvaz because Persian does not have IPA [-w] . The local population and most of the world consider [æhwæ:z] a perfectly fine pronounciation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most encyclopedia articles are either titled "Ahwaz" or include Ahwaz as a perfectly fine alternate pronounciation.</li>

<p>In Iran, both spellings are used inter-changeably:</p>

<li>The Iranian embassy uses the Arabic spelling: <a href="http://www.salamiran.org/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=128&amp;Itemid=210" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.salamiran.org/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=128&amp;Itemid=210" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></li>

<li>A list of companies in Ahwaz uses the Arabic and Persian spellings inter-changeably: <a href="http://www.irantour.org/Iran/companies-loc/tehran.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irantour.org/Iran/companies-loc/tehran.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></li>

<p>It is therefore not controversial to use either spelling.--88.111.92.91 20:52, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The correct term is Ahvaz as already explained. As for Google hits, it doesn't matter how many people make a mistake, if a name is mistakingly pronounced, then it should be corrected. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">Mardavich</a> 18:53, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Al-Ahwaz" is not the name of the city but the name of the province as used by pan-Arab nationalist groups in UK. It is a political term today. Long time ago "Al-Ahwaz" was the name of only part of Khuzestan. The city was just "Ahwaz". <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 00:35, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wrong! All city names in Arabic have the al- prefix. That's just the way it is in formal Arabic. The name of the city is Ahwaz, but when you write it in Arabic you write al-Ahwaz. And it has nothing to do with Khuzestan in general.

<p>I think the main problem is the pan Arab connection to the name Ahwaz.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 21:26, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's get this straight. The Iranian alphabet doesn't have "W" And they pronounce the city name Ahvaz. Ahvaz is an Iranian name and a city in Iran. In conclusion, the right way of spelling it, is the way 70 million Iranians spell it. AHVAZ. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArad_0f22.html" title="User:Arad">Arad</a> 00:50, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Ahvaz_is_correct" id="Ahvaz_is_correct"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ahvaz is correct</span></h2>
<p>First: You indicate that Ahwaz is more common but when you do a google search, Google searchs both ahwaz and al-ahwaz, if you try <b>ahwaz -"al"</b> then you can see that Ahvaz is more common.</p>
<p>Second: Iran's official language is Persian and any name (no matter German or Chinese or Arabic) must be written using Persian transliteration, so Ahvaz is correct.</p>
<p>Third: "W" is just a sign of Arabic transliteration and can't represent the local's pronounciation.</p>
<p>Fourth: Ahvaz comes from the Elamite word "Huvja" and so it's not Arabic.</p>
<p><br />
here's a long discussion on this issue: <a href="http://www.wikiran.org/wiki/Talk:Ahvaz" class="external free" title="http://www.wikiran.org/wiki/Talk:Ahvaz" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikiran.org/wiki/Talk:Ahvaz</a> <a href="http://www.wikiran.org/wiki/User_talk:Sassan#Ahvaz" class="external free" title="http://www.wikiran.org/wiki/User_talk:Sassan#Ahvaz" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikiran.org/wiki/User_talk:Sassan#Ahvaz</a></p>

<p><br />
I think both spellings Ahvaz and Ahwaz should be mentioned, although Ahvaz should be mentioned first since it is the official name; it looks as if both spelling are used in English. However al-ahwaz is not accurate since, as mentioned above, it is not the Arabic name for the city but a name used by Arabs for the whole region. It does not belong here.<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGol_cff6.html" title="User:Gol">Gol</a> 05:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Gol. Ahvaz is the official name, but even government departments sometimes refer to Ahwaz and the airport's code is AWZ. Naturally, the Arabic spelling is commonplace because Arabs populate the region.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 10:52, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
