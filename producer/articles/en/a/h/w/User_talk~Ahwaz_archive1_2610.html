<p>You dont need my approval Ahwaz. You can write any article that suits you. But you might find that such articles already exist on WP. Watchout for duplicity. Articles on Terrorism arent really my thing. They are deep inside negativity wars against one country or another.

<dd>The topic itself is too subjective and political for me. "Terrorism" doesnt even have a clear definition. One man's terrorist is another man's hero. Just as an example, while you consider Hizbollah as terrorist (which comes as a big surprise to me since you claim to be an Arab), they are considered a fully legit organization and political party by Lebanese; they have members in Lebanon's parliament, and even Hamas is now considered a "democratic" group.<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4534224.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4534224.stm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. Sorry Ahwaz, Im not with you there. Youre free to trash Iran as much as you like with the Bushite neocon playwords of "terrorism". As the grandfather of Muhammad once said "the Ka'bah has its own God that will protect it". over and out.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 23:36, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, look at the facts. A Persian editor threatens to run a campaign to sack an editor from his university position using Iranian students in the student press and the Wikipedia editors lean over backwards to accommodate him - and a whole number of other civility violations. I revert the blanking of my content (and I am not accused of 3RR violation) and I am blocked. This speaks volumes, indeed. I have approached everything constructively, but have repeatedly been called ignorant, an imposter, a terrorist, etc, and admins have done nothing. It speaks volumes, indeed.

<p>Ilir had simply gone too far. I have abandoned the article myself when I could not stop him and Bormalagurski edit-warring. As far as I am concerned Ilir provoked them with an on-your-face attitude on the Montenegro referendum forecasted results. Hardly a mature or civil thing to do. He is indeed well-mannered towards people that share some or all of his views but I found his treatment of Osli very rude indeed. He knows the rules well. I just hope this 24h break helps him to clear his mind and we could all move forward. I have no intention of long-term involvement on the Kosovo article, as I have expressed previously, but I would like to see a fair resolution to the last conflict. You are more than welcome to contribute to the debate on the introductory text.</p>

<dd>Yes, I realise that some editors, including Ilir, moved too fast to dissolve the Serbia and Montenegro union before the referendum results were even officially announced. Anyway, I got bored with the arguments over Kosovo's status as they were going around and around. Fairly sensible suggestions - including mine, which was to just state the status of Kosovo in the UN Resolution and the Constitution of Serbia and Montenegro - have been rejected by both sides and instead we have an overwhelmingly mad argument. I feel that if Ilir is to be dealt with in this way, then so should some of the pro-Serb editors who have been responsible for atrocious conduct - conduct that has not been addressed by admins for some unknown reason and which is generating a lot of the animosity and preventing compromise.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 17:30, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ahwaz, thanks for your positive attitude in the 3RR page, where (not only) I got attacked by some users who think differently than me in a particular subject. I see that above you even got flooded by one of them (or their lawyers). Indeed I am having a tough time reaching compromise, having in mind that are tons of sockpuppets and meatpuppets circulating around here, but I am a patient person by nature, and refuse to talk to people that offend me directly. So I have all the patience needed to deal with them, even if that means I have to be alone in this dispute, against this many suspicious users. Take care. <a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EIlir_pz_c0a5.html" title="User:Ilir pz">ilir_pz</a> 18:53, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for taking the time to answer, and give me advices in my talk page, Ahwaz. There is a mistake in your advices, as you asked me to refer to the Constitution of the Federation of Serbia and Montenegro. First of all, this federation does not exist as we speak, Montenegro was just declared independent, and recongized internationally. Second of all, from 1999, the moment when international administration was installed in Kosovo, <a href="../../../u/n/m/UNMIK_e70a.html" title="UNMIK">UNMIK</a> is the highest body, which governs with Kosovo, and whatever laws or constitution other countries (read: even Serbia and Montenegro) pass, and they are related to Kosovo, are as such <b>invalid</b> for the reason I mentioned above. The only law to be used is the UN security council resolution, even if it is a temporary one. The next one is yet to be released once Kosovo's status is clarified by the end of this year. Anyways, as a neutral (non-Balkans) reader, I encourage you to express your opinion, once some kind of polling will be held on the introduction part. Take care, <a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EIlir_pz_c0a5.html" title="User:Ilir pz">ilir_pz</a> 23:55, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your comment on the cfd discuission. Just to let you know the reason why the content is not very consistent is because it's a new category. Once we've sorted out the question of what cats should exist and what they should be called, I'll then sort out the contents. In the meantime I dont' want to do a lot of work on the cat only to have it deleted.

<p>Dear Ahwaz, I recently noticed your signature (الأهواز) is not in line with the guidelines for signatures as they should always also include latin characters (See <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html#Language_and_alphabet" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages#Language and alphabet</a>). You might want to change it to include also your username (Ahwaz) perhaps. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 10:07, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for changing, it looks fine to me now! It is not really a rule, but a guideline. In this case, it makes your signature also readable for people without arabic fonts installed for example. And yes, the rules and guidelines on Wikipedia are often obscure and sometimes even contradictory. Guess, we will have to live with that. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 10:43, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll be happy to work with you (albeit slowly because im at a busy point right now). Having said that, I don't care much for pointless non-backed up arguments about Kurds, Arabs, Turks, Bahais, Politics etc.. I just want to work with referenced hard facts and provided they come from a reliable source I will be more than happy to accept them.

<dd>Yes definately - I guess we could say a good source is an "internationaly <b>recognised</b> human rights organisation". But I would feel that regional independence movements or anti-regime groups, or even the iranian government itself, would have a bias (i.e. MKO, PUK,... and god knows how many others). Newspapers would have to be on a case by case basis depending on the standing and reputation of the newspaper. How does that sound to you? <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETototom_2f5e.html" title="User:Tototom">Tototom</a> 09:13, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I withdrew because I didn't think that the threshold of consensus, roughly 75–80 percent support, would be reached in the remaining two days. Some of the oppose votes were legitimate, based on lack of edit summaries which I will (and have been) working on. I am not naive however, I know that the sudden burst in Iranian Wikipedians (in particular those who Zereshk spammed to get keep votes <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Misconceptions_about_Iran_3fc4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Misconceptions about Iran">in the Miscoceptions of Iran Afd</a>) voting oppose on my RFA wasn't a coincidence particularly after Zereshk hinted that he would use e-mail to get votes after what happened in the Afded article in which he was blocked for internal spamming. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASa.vakilian&amp;diff=64968767&amp;oldid=64968053" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASa.vakilian&amp;diff=64968767&amp;oldid=64968053" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> What is really sad though is that I don't have anything against Shi'a or Iranian Wikipedians. I think that we need more of them to be quite honest because of the lack of information in articles pertaining to those groups on Wikipedia. But if the aforementioned user goes on Persian/Farsi Wikipedia, or talks to other Shi'a/Iranian Wikipedians and says things about me out of context well then there is really nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p>Another thing that amused me was the last oppose vote was from a user that hasn't been active for three months (four months really if you don't count two minor edits in April) and before that only editted articles pertaining to his website <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinnwebe.html" title="Spinnwebe">Spinnwebe</a> who's <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_SpinnWebe_6856.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SpinnWebe">afd</a> was in fact filled with meatpuppetry. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Spinn" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Spinn" rel="nofollow">[28]</a></p>

<dd>Not that it really matters at this point, and not that JD will read it, but the fun bits here are that 1) he makes a claim that's false (I only edited SW-related pages) and links directly to the page that shows the proof of his inaccuracy, and 2) blows off my opinion as invalid because of his feelings for me and my "worthiness" as an editor, not because of the merits of my statement. Come to think of it, the <i>really</i> funny thing is that I voted against his RfA because of his habit of ad hominem attacks, and here he is. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinn_39bd.html" title="User:Spinn">Spinn</a> 18:34, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not really disappointed however, most of the Wikipedians whom I respect voted support and those whom I respect but who voted oppose or neutral voted on legitimate concerns about my lack of edit summaries. I'm sure that if I just continue on the track that I am now and change my habits towards always using edit summaries that next time I'd get consensus for adminship regardless of the vote stacking attempts.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 22:14, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
