<p>You've been selectively removing and, transferring content on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> claiming that you're doing all this due "the result of the AfD". That's a false claim, "The result was Rename to Politics of Khuzestan and keep for now". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ethnic_politics_of_Khuzestan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ethnic_politics_of_Khuzestan" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>The result of the AfD was to keep the article, but to sort out POV issues, which I am doing. The proposer of the AfD argued that content should be reallocated to other articles that are more relevant and this was not contested by me or anyone else voting either to delete or to keep. In fact, you argued to merge the article with other articles! Nothing has been removed from Wikipedia, just reorganised and shortened. Changing the name of the article from Ethnic Politics of Khuzestan to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a> obviously requires a different editorial approach, with some sections removed and some added.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 11:52, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If the content you are removing from <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a> is contentious (which it obviously is), I would recommend not transferring it into the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> until the material has been discussed. While it needs excising from the politics article, a merge should be a considered blending of content, and not all content may be suitable. That said, bold changes can provoke a discussion, so provided it doesn't break out into an edit war I don't see anything wrong with the occasional bold merge. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 12:17, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yomangani: I am trying to do one thing at a time; I don't have time to spend hours and hours on this. I have transferred content and once I've finished my edits to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a>, I'll move onto the other articles and ensure that there is a blending of content that ensures balance. There is nothing to stop someone putting a POV tag on the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> article in the mean time. I'd just ask for a bit of patience and when I've finished, no doubt there will be editors who will begin disputing!--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 12:23, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand, my suggestion was meant to be helpful in avoiding those disputes in the meantime: you can always remove the information without transferring it over, as it will be available in the history for you transfer at a later date. Anyway, I'm not pushing you to work on it - I'd like to think of myself as disinterested party (otherwise I wouldn't have closed the AfD).

<dd>Ahwaz, please revert yourself on <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a>.

<dd>That's what you should be doing, your actions are not in sync with the result of the AfD.

I have put the articles you told me on my watchlist. Your info seems to get removed instantly by iranian nationlist. BTW, as time goes by, everybody will figure out that Wikiepdia contains a lot of rubish, specially in politic related articles. You shoud really think of making a website and posting your articles there, that way you will get the credit and nobody will revert it. <a href="../../../j/i/d/User%7EJidan_3a52.html" title="User:Jidan">Jidan</a> 13:58, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

They are suddenly reverting all my recent edits on these articles after I voiced an opinion on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersian_Gulf_3c5e.html" title="Talk:Persian Gulf">Talk:Persian Gulf</a> , which <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">User:Mardavich</a> disagreed with. They have never had any previous involvement with these articles. Their reversions include fact tags, wikilink updates and legitimate edits to ensure NPOV. As such, they are vandalising these articles and consequently my reversions do not count as a breach of 3RR.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 13:27, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I accept what you are saying, but I think that Persian nationalism is preventing the legitimate inclusion of the commonly accepted alternative name for the Gulf - the Arabian Gulf - in the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Gulf_06b2.html" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> article (in fact, in some Arab states it is illegal to refer to the Gulf as the Persian Gulf). Please take a look at the talk page.</dd>

<dd>Also, after stating my point on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersian_Gulf_3c5e.html" title="Talk:Persian Gulf">Talk:Persian Gulf</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">User:Mardavich</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/h/User%7EBehaafarid_1c2f.html" title="User:Behaafarid">User:Behaafarid</a> appeared to track back on all my recent contributions - namely to <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_minorities_in_Iran_c1fe.html" title="Ethnic minorities in Iran">Ethnic minorities in Iran</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvand_Free_Zone_f63b.html" title="Arvand Free Zone">Arvand Free Zone</a> - and reverted any changes I made, including updated wikilinks, fact tags and NPOV adjustments (nothing substantial, just small edits here and there). It is notable that they have not ever edited these article before, so the only reason for reverting was to stalk and vandalise my work. This is disruptive, but is the common experience Wikipedia users have when confronted by nationalists.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 16:25, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ahwaz, I really like your version of the article better than the other and removing tags is a bad style, but 3RR is a 3RR. Please note that you accumulated quite a long block list, including at least 4 blocks for 3RR violations, so the next 3RR block can be significantly longer. Next time please find a better way to settle the difference than revert warring. You could e.g. request a page protection and start an article RfC or another <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 16:46, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I thought that if the reversions were against vandalism - which I think this is, as it is a case of stalking by two editors who disagreed with what I wrote on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersian_Gulf_3c5e.html" title="Talk:Persian Gulf">Talk:Persian Gulf</a> and blind reverted anything I wrote recently - then they didn't count towards 3RR. I don't actually know how to start an RfC. (The <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Gulf_06b2.html" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> issue has been raging for months <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Iranian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=43610196" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Iranian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=43610196" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, with Iranian Wikipedians insisting that no mention of Arabian Gulf be included, even when it is sourced to Encyclopaedia Brittanica - I've only recently added my opinion)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The fact is that a cabal of editors is imposing its POV on Iran-related articles. They have a particular hatred of me because I spell Ahwaz in the Arabic way and not the Persian way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APersian_Gulf&amp;diff=99748678&amp;oldid=99745972" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APersian_Gulf&amp;diff=99748678&amp;oldid=99745972" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. It sounds ridiculous, but some people get very worked up about spellings. I've been marked out on a number of occasions as an attacker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Iranian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=42565724" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Iranian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=42565724" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> or anti-Persian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Iranian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=43828907" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Iranian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=43828907" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At one point, I had a message on my talk page to "fuck your dirty Arab mother's cunt" in Farsi. I responded in kind in English, but retracted my own profanity within half an hour - yet still subsequently got blocked. That was my first block (admins later agreed to wipe my user pages so that the profanity was wiped from the history files). Yet the anon user making the profanity was not even warned! I've also had to endure repeated racist statements that I am a lizard eater (a common Iranian insult against Arabs) and a liar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Politics_of_Khuzestan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46096954" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Politics_of_Khuzestan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46096954" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Admins have failed to deal with over a year of anti-Arab racism, the gang-like nature of a certain group of editors (I have been banned for incivility in the past for calling them a gang, but that's what they are), the stalking and the inflexibility of some editors. They refused to allow me to transfer content from <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a> to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> after an AfD, yet they refuse to respond to my calls for a debate<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Arabs_of_Khuzestan#Merge_sections" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Arabs_of_Khuzestan#Merge_sections" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> or even attempts by one user at mediation (Mardavich has been among those who was disputing content, but failing to respond to mediation attempts).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So what am I to do? I am sorry, but I don't have a lot of confidence in a system that allows this kind of behaviour. This gang of editors refuses to talk, ignores mediation attempts and even reverts even the smallest edits I have made. I don't really know what to do, so I guess I will continue to be blocked! I give up on the processes.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 18:04, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not simply vandalism, it is aggressive bullying by a certain organised group. You know the type. It is absolute nonsense that Arab states don't use the term Arabian Gulf. The Arab League itself uses it <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-33,GGGL:en&amp;q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.arableagueonline.org%2F+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AC+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A+" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-33,GGGL:en&amp;q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.arableagueonline.org%2F+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AC+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A+" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Every Arab state uses it and many non-Arabs use it. They are enforcing their viewpoint - which excludes all mention that the Gulf is known by any name other than the one they favour. If Arab states use the term Arabian Gulf, then it should be included. The real reason for exclusion is underlying prejudice, as I have experienced so many times on Wikipedia and detailed above.</dd>

<dd>As for the reversions on <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_minorities_in_Iran_c1fe.html" title="Ethnic minorities in Iran">Ethnic minorities in Iran</a>, they are plain stupid. The nationalists are simply reverting a whole load of necessary and non-controversial changes (updated wikilinks, rewording for the sake of NPOV and tags requesting sources) that I made because I made them. They won't debate, they won't consider any reason or logic. They want to drive off all Arab Wikipedians. And admins never, ever stop it. Look at the abuse and harassment I've had from these nationalists and how indifferent the admins are to it. The 3RR law is nonsense because these people can pile up their 3RRs and impose their POV and drive off all they oppose.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 21:44, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Mardavich: But I did not use that source, I used the Daily Telegraph that quoted the British Ahwazi Friendship Society. You objected to this quotation, but it nevertheless conformed with Wikipedia policies because it was from the Daily Telegraph. As for your other acts of vandalism, you removed legitimate wikilinks and fact tags purely because I put them there and for no other reason. You are the one you constantly reverted and you were unwilling to discuss either on this article or on others you have objected to, such as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> - you have ignored one appeal for mediation on these.

<dd>Sigh - I don't think you can read English properly - or you are a liar. Anyway, this is the part of the quotation from the Daily Telegraph you repeatedly deleted: "The British Ahwazi Friendship Society (BAFS), an advocacy group for Khuzestani Arabs in the UK, claims it will help Iran's Revolutionary Guards to influence the Shi'a areas of Iraq. A BAFS spokesman said: "Apart from being a serious human rights issue, any development that involves people being displaced by force obviously has a security element to it as they clearly do not want people being too near. The fact that they are deciding to put this huge complex right up against the border is significant. We think this is to enable them to train and send militias over the border." The original is here: [<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/10/30/wiran30.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/10/30/wiran30.xml" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Take a look at it. The only other reference to that group was a link to an article that quoted from the Hamsahyeha, which is now closed down. The article in Hamsahyeha exists because there is a photocopy of it here: <a href="http://www.ahwaz.org.uk/images/Minoo-Land-Sale.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ahwaz.org.uk/images/Minoo-Land-Sale.jpg" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></dd>
