<p>Thanks for reverting, fixing, linking to other people with Hesse name. I just saw the article on #enrc.wikipedia and threw in a disambig real quick.

<dd>The problem wasn't your edit, the problem was the anonymous user before who moved the article by copy-and-paste, thus breaking the history - and of course the naming scheme which says that we use the english names when it has them. As 90% of the link to Hesse mean the state, and those who mean one of the persons should use the full name of the person (I just fixed some of the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Hesse_c53a.html" title="Otto Hesse">Otto Hesse</a> links) the current position of the article is clearly preferred. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a></dd>

<p>Hello Andy, in the <i>Blank Map tracings from copyrighted maps?</i> section of the Village Pump you kindly offered to draw a map from Panmap data for part of the Falklands Islands. I have shown 2 small examples on <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibob_Maps_2f71.html" title="User:Wikibob/Maps">User:Wikibob/Maps</a> of the coastlines I need for the Falklands article. All I need is just the coastline, maybe two or three times larger than shown. Geographical location of the island is 51.5 degress South and 59 degrees West. -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibob_130d.html" title="User:Wikibob">Wikibob</a> | <a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibob_a563.html" title="User talk:Wikibob">Talk</a> 19:50, 2004 Apr 5 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andy, I am relieved to see that we are coming to an end with our districts. I wonder if we should design a common template for the cities and municipalities as well. Some cities have the template of the German wikipedia (<a href="../../../s/c/h/Schweinfurt.html" title="Schweinfurt">Schweinfurt</a>), some have this locator map (<a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiel.html" title="Kiel">Kiel</a>), and several others are just stubs without any information. What do you think about setting up a template which can be adopted for every city article? -- <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBaldhur_abd2.html" title="User:Baldhur">Baldhur</a> 12:38, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, all district have an article already, we just have to convert the last few to the template. And of course fill those listed as "in progess" - most notably adding the coat of arms. It take quite long to get to this state, but we both had our other projects and topics we worked on, there was your move of focus to the german wp, and so on. As for the cities: I don't like the german template that much, it puts quite a lot of relatively irrelevant data into the table (especially the <i>Gemeindekennzahl</i>, the telephone and postal codes IMHO also don't need to be in a encyclopedia), or put things into the table which are worth some full text around it (like the city subdivisions which can fit perfectly into a history section). And most ugly IMHO is to put the coat of arms next to the locator map - it makes the table way to wide, with a lower screen resolution the first text paragraph does not have enough width left. IIRC that was one of the reasons why for the districts the coat of arms became a section of the text - another reason is of course to have the description and the image of the coat of arms close together.</dd>
<dd>I also don't think it makes much sense to adopt a template with an infobox for cities in only one country, then we'd better aim for a common city template used for all cities world-wide. The other administrative subdivisions are unique to one country, so some design differences between an article on a german district or on a province of Thailand don't strike as much as design difference between two cities. IMHO instead of the strict template like it is used on de: a guideline of topics which should be present in a good article on a city is what is needed - the german template gives that guideline only as a side-effect of the strict sectioning structure, every section present in the template means a good city article should have that section.</dd>
<dd>I am not sure if I will spend much time on articles about german cities however, given that I have so many other topics where there are still big holes which need attention as well - and by the policy of "donating the most precious knowledge" those should have priority on cities where I would mostly collect information from other web sources. Which of course doesn't mean I won't fix an ugly stub of a german city if I come across one. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 12:44, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Are we really done? Tell me if I am wrong but every article about a district seems to be converted to the template. Of course there is still some improvement to be done but it is good to know that this rather monotonous work is finished. I think it is worth an <a href="../../../a/n/n/Wikipedia%7EAnnouncements_a4ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Announcements">announcement</a>.</dd>
<dd>As for your objections to a template, I stand corrected and think that you are perfectly right. (However, I never planned to adopt the template of the German pedia since I do not like it either.) I collected some thoughts on <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBaldhur_German_cities_1c77.html" title="User:Baldhur/German cities">User:Baldhur/German cities</a> and I would like to hear your comments. And as my time is mainly dedicated to the German pedia, I won't spend too much time on these city articles either.

Now it's only the coat of arms drawing which is left out.

<p>I've for long (a year, actually) been itched by the way Wikipedia-links are done with often sloppy distinctions between nationality, citizenship and ethnicity (with regard to persons) and also between nations and countries. This is particularly obvious in the case of people or entities that are denoted as <b>German</b>. A link to the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Germany_0e8f.html" title="Federal Republic of Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a> is often outright unhistorical and wrong, but this has until now been the most usual.</p>
<p>Therefore I'm considering an article on <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germans.html" title="Germans">Germans</a>, which I've started at <a href="../../../r/u/h/User%7ERuhrjung_Germans_12e1.html" title="User:Ruhrjung/Germans">User:Ruhrjung/Germans</a>. I would wish to avoid lots of edit wars. In particular, I would not wish to see the current disputes over German-Polish matters automatically extend also to this article, why I kindly ask you for comments now, in advance, in order to try to find wordings acceptable to as many as possible of concerned wikipedians.</p>

This kind of thing should really be on <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">Vandalism in Progress</a>, but even that warns against listing isolated incidents which are probably just newbie tests.

<dd>Unfortunately I can't read German. I put the German article through an automated translator, so I suspected it was wrong like the English, but you can never trust a machine translation. I'm concentrating on biographies of various asteroid discoverers, rather than articles about the asteroids themselves. But I do try to check for German articles and create interwiki links between the two language pages on the same subject. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a></dd>

<p>Guten tag Andy; On the subject of redirects, a while back you put a comment about homeless articles on the redirect talk page. A lot of similar entries were created by Rambot handling of U.S. census CDP districts. I'm very slowly cleaning these up as I come across them, and thanks for your concern. For an example of what I'm talking aboutt see <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houlton%2C_Maine_09f2.html" title="Houlton, Maine">Houlton, Maine</a> and the <i>What links here</i> data. You might also want to check out <a href="../../../c/e/n/Census-designated_place.html" title="Census-designated place">Census-designated place</a> and its talk page.

<dd>It's good that finally someone adopts this open issue - I didn't continue to fix those pages due to lack of feedback, and not knowing well enough what entry is about what (what are the differences between CDP, town, village, township). So I just de-orphaned a few, mostly when I stumbled upon one clearly missing and needed, but never in a really systematic way. The first ones I did with a mini-disambiguation page, later by guessing which should be main entry and then creating a redirect and a <i>see also</i> at the bottom of the article. The way you did it with Houlton is better, as it gives the explanation why there are two entries - the fact I would have to guess from the census data. If you need my help in this task I will try to help, but I also have enough other things I want to do... <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a></dd>

<p>Hello Andy, sorry for not reacting earlier. Yes I am interested in the statistics. Let me set up a temp emailaddress so it will not interfere with my regular mail. About the nr of Bangkok inhabitants. My feeling is that there are less people registered that life in BKK than there actually are. It is quite difficult to register in BKK especially for provincials as it would mean their kids could go to BKK schools. That is why they make it so difficult. Estimates are that the BKK population is 30% (low side) to 100% higher than the official number of people registered here. <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 13:30, 13 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, we can do Amphoe articles, however I'm not sure if we can get enough stuff to make them more than plain stubs giving name, area and population. Most information to find on the web are just touristical info, and that belongs more to wikitravel than here - I already had that problem with the provinces. And for example the cambodian provinces still are at that stub level, and probably will stay so for quite some time unless we adopt them... Maybe we should first do the main cities (especially the Mueang). And there are still enough important thai kings missing or way too short - that was your favourite topic anyway, wasn't it&#160;:-) Or maybe first the current issues of Thailand mentioned <a href="../../../t/h/a/Talk%7EThailand_5d92.html" title="Talk:Thailand">here</a>? It's sometimes hard to decide where to start with so many open tasks. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 18:07, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About the things mentioned on Talk Thailand, I already wrote on the southern troubles and the Pattani sultanate in Dutch. I am also trying to keep the Bangkok gouverneur elections up to date. The Cambodian province have already been done in Dutch by myself (look at ot more info than the en wiki!) , one of these days I'll copy the info to a disk and translate it in English at home (the internetcafe is growing way to expensive&#160;:(( ) Yeah there is so much to choose from and .... and I just started the African days on the Dutch wiki in order to get some more articles (mainly translations, little new research) on Africa and some longer ones done. Since I started it, I have to contribute part of my time to that! About Kings, I am still searching the internet copying and pasting and gathering at my home pc for sorting out, I did the Lan Xang kings on the Dutch wiki in the same way. It took 4 months to finish that. About the amount of info in the provinces ..... well, I think we got quite some info already, and there is nothing against mentioning tourist sites, as long as ou focus on the history etc aspects of it. I still feel in favour of doing the Amphoe articles. That way it is easier if you write other articles about Thailand to get a reference of where somthing is, but I do not want to do it alone! And I suggest making 3 templates, one in english, one in Dutch and one in German, so that we only have to copy and paste the names and figures in! We can do that province by province I think. And oh yeah, I became a moderator on the Dutch wiki today, so there goes some other time I normally had .... <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 08:53, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course I did see before that you did some of those topics on nl:, but as I don't speak dutch I can only guess the content by the similarities of dutch with german, so it's a bit hard for me translate those articles. And don't get me wrong on the Amphoe project - I don't want to discourage you, I just worry it might be too ambitious at the moment. For the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_German_districts_9471.html" title="List of German districts">german districts</a> it did take more than a year to create all 300 articles by two authors, and many of the districts have webpages which could be used as good sources.</dd>
<dd>I would suggest to wait with the template till the release of the next MediaWiki version - IIRC that version will contain the possiblity to create templates with variables, so we don't need to create a infobox in every article, but just use the common template and just put the variable content into the article itself. But I guess the template wouldn't be much different from the one for the provinces, maybe just exchanging the ISO code with the Amphoe code used by the DOPA, and use a more localized map. And maybe the ranks by area, population or population density don't make that much sense with the 900 Amphoe. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:51, 21 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I only know the hard way - add the warning in every page (maybe you can shortcut and avoid the actual source URL, but just write it came from bloomberg.com), and add them to the copyvio listing. There you can also shortcut a bit by list them all in one comma separated list and also skip the actual URL again, but it's nearly the same amount of work. It's a pity a probably well-meaning user can create so much work just because he didn't read (or understand) the legal mumble-jumble below the edit window. AFAIK there is no speedy deletion allowed (which an admin like me could do) even for absolutely clear cases of copyright violations.

<p>Andy, I <i>know</i> that normally spelling errors are kept as redirs. However, this one is very uncommon: try googling for it! It got only mistakenly created (by me) because somebody else had mistyped the name, and the link showed up red. It really makes no sense to keep it, also and especially since it isn't linked from anywhere within Wikipedia. And as a dbl redir, it is still useless. So, please, could you delete it now? <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 07:55, 28 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But as long as that redirect does not reside at a place where a normal article can pop up sometime in the future (like it's the name of a totally different taxonomic group) it does absolutely no harm, and almost noone will ever notice it anyway, except if they check the "what links here" link. But if you really want it gone - <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion</a> is the official way to go, not speedy deletion. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 08:01, 28 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
