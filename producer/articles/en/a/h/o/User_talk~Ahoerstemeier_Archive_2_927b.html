<p>Hi Andy. I've noticed that you use personal pronouns in lower case. He, he try to switch to English where they are written in upper case. So "german" should be "German" here, right. Nouns in English are written in lower case and not in upper case like they are written in German language - but I guess you know this for sure. Great photos you have in your photo album as well. Can you someday put one or two photos of your birth town <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemer%2C_Germany_59a5.html" title="Hemer, Germany">Hemer</a>. It would be nice to have some photos in this article. You can also check the article about my birth town <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celje.html" title="Celje">Celje</a> and you can compare them since these two cities are very similar in the number of their population. You should also learn about the <i>Deutsches Haus</i> and perhaps some more.</p>
<p>And further on since you're very much interested in astronomy and related subject you can also check recent pseudo 'edit-war' about the great Greek astronomer <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hipparchus.html" title="Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a>|<a href="../../../h/i/p/Hipparchos.html" title="Hipparchos">Hipparchos</a>. Current revision of the article is under the latter name -- but it is still in the development phase (in fact both articles... - the final one will rest in the first one I guess...). I am debating about the tiny or huge details via the e-mail with another Wikipedian <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Peters_0511.html" title="User:Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a>, who is disputing the content of it. You may also give some extra help if you wish. Best regards. --<a href="../../../x/j/a/User%7EXJamRastafire_2aa5.html" title="User:XJamRastafire">XJam</a> 23:36 2 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>-Addition 1: In the article <a href="../../../s/o/y/Soyuz_TMA-2_45a9.html" title="Soyuz TMA-2">Soyuz TMA-2</a> you use properly personal pronouns for the Chilean Klaus von Storch. But <b>r</b>ussians are written in lower case. If nobody cares - I do&#160;:-) Check also my recent short additions to <a href="../../../s/o/y/Soyuz_1.html" title="Soyuz 1">Soyuz 1</a> article. I am planning to spent some more time with Soyuzes.

<dd>As you're asking about the fact sheet about Soyuz TMA-2. Reserved or reserve data for launch and ISS docking time is (I believe) the second open window for the flight if something goes wrong in last minutes. If it is bothering you, you can remove it. I have no other explanations for them either. Best regards. --<a href="../../../x/j/a/User%7EXJamRastafire_2aa5.html" title="User:XJamRastafire">XJamRastafire</a> 12:29, 15 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-Addition 2: I have noticed that you have on 2003-03-14 changed in the article of <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Komarov_3683.html" title="Vladimir Komarov">Vladimir Mikhailovich Komarov</a> link of [[Russian language|Russian]] for the original names to [[Cyrillic_alphabet|cyrillic]]. Can we agree to use the first form of such linking since the Cyrillic alphabet can be from some other Slavic languages, for example the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_language.html" title="Ukrainian language">Ukrainian</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbian_language.html" title="Serbian language">Serbian</a>. And the Soviet and now Russian space programme was/is officially working under the Russian language. I guess your changes will repeat since there are already some similar forms of linking. So that's why I am writing this. <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston%2C_Texas_c0fa.html" title="Houston, Texas">Houston</a> we're ready to take off .... --<a href="../../../x/j/a/User%7EXJamRastafire_2aa5.html" title="User:XJamRastafire">XJamRastafire</a> 00:08 3 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just a short hello and thanks for the comments, I will check them in more detail when I return from vacation (with many new photos for upload I guess) - I have not the time nor the internet connection to work on the 'pedia for the moment. Then I will also write a longer reply to you. -- <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 09:48 8 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Finally your answer - sorry for the delay. It is a long time since I last learned the english language rules, thus some german grammar might slip in occasionally, but thanks to the Wiki it can be fixed easily. Of course I try my best, and will remember to capitalize the country names.</dd>
<dd>It's nice you noticed the Hemer article, I will definitely enlarge it when I have more time and more information - including adding photos of course. However I have none in my photo archive so far, as I never thought about to take photos of daily sights - and now I am not so often in Hemer anymore and thus had no chance yet to take them. But it is definitely on my ToDo list, we need many more pictures in the articles.</dd>
<dd>About the cyrillic vs. russian issue. IIRC in the first article I added the cyrillic letters I wrote cyrillic, as I know these letters are used not only in Russia. But then I saw others write russian in that place, and then continued to do so - as it was in my beginnings here I did not dare yet to change it to the IMHO correct value - so you're welcome to change to back to cyrillic. And then other projects then the russian spaceflight became priority, so it stayed that way then. I have so many topics I want to write about I cannot make them all&#160;:-) so it's good if you spend some time in the Soyuz now. That reminds me - I have two photos of Soyuz capsules from museums, I will upload them soon I guess...</dd>
<dd>I did see the Hipparchos oddity once already, but decided to keep out of the fire of the dispute as I prefer to create article then to argue about them. -- <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 10:55 24 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

Hi Andy, glad to see you back. Am I right, that all old style maps have been replaced by newer versions? Or is anything left? If the section "maps to be deleted" is complete now, we may place a link on the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a> page now. -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a> 12:21 22 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, vacation is sadly over already. Were are nearly done with the maps (now the german 'pedia has at least templates for every district I will create all the remaining maps the next days for the german site) - but there are still a few old map left in Brandenburg at least, I will change those tonight. -- <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 12:30 22 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I like the new <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somaliland.html" title="Somaliland">Somaliland</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> maps. They do lack the names of the two countries (unrecognized and recognized), though, which seems odd. If you're able to add labels (similar to what the CIA maps have), then it might be a good addition. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 13:14, Jul 31, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems like in all CIA maps the country which is highlighted isn't named by a label - anyhow, how to call the part "Somalia without Somaliland"? That name isn't much nice, and anything stressing the NPOV would be even longer, thus not fitting into the map. Any better idea? -- <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 21:12, 3 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Congratulations, you have just been made a sysop! You have volunteered for boring housekeeping activities which normal users sadly cannot participate in. Sysops basically can't do anything: They cannot delete pages arbitarily (only obvious junk like "jklasdfl,öasdf JOSH IS GAY"), they cannot protect pages in an edit war they are involved in, they cannot ban signed in users. What they can do is delete junk as it appears, ban anonymous vandals, remove pages that have been listed on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Votes for deletion</a> for more than a week, protect pages when asked to by other members, and help keep the few <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtected_page_6ebc.html" title="Wikipedia:Protected page">protected pages</a> there are, among them the precious <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>, up to date.</p>

<p>Its a fake? Looks pretty real to me, but even if it isn't, it still is showing the area where it happens, it gives a better impression than the others do</p>

<p>Could I have some advice please. I have just received an email from User:68.214.46.183 who I blocked for his constant copyvios after he had three warnings. He is now claiming the following:</p>

<p>Hi Angela, I just received a notice that you have blocked some of my submissions. The material I am submitting today is my personal original material. I realize that some of this material is available on other websites, but it is my material and has been freely shared with them as well and is not subject to copyright by anyone except myself. Could you unblock my submississions?</p>

<p>What's your opinion on this based on the work of his that you looked at earlier? Am I supposed to just accept it? I have taken the block off temporarily. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 21:06, Sep 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I doubt this very much. The only thing he added to the text from the golfers hall of fame were the wiki-links. He even copied the typo "eamings" instead of "earnings" in <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Boros_e851.html" title="Julius Boros">Julius Boros</a> - I guess that one is no longer a copyvio now I made it complete sentences? <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 21:14, 14 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A stupa is NOT a pagoda. Please wait till I get more proof. Please don't add anything until this is resolved.

<dd>I am not 100% sure either as I know only about the SE Asia versions and not about the indian ones, but as far as I know the only difference between a stupa and a pagoda is the architecture style. Same as a Khmer prang isn't the same as a Thai chedi and the difference can be noted easily, they are so similar in religious meaning a separate article isn't necessary at the moment. However I wonder why you only blanked the redirect, while you did not remove the stupa from the pagoda article. BTW: the author who wrote the same article in the german wikipedia also added the stupa to the pagoda variants. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 18:05, 16 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Before I verify the facts, I just want to tell you that as far as I know right now, historically a stupa is a domical structure that has relics of Buddha underneath. A pagoda is more like a crowning element and is pyramidal and stepped. I think there is a theory that it could have evolved from sloped roof structures, probably from India/other South Asian countries. Even if the pagoda has evolved from the stupa, definitely they can't be synonymous.Buddhism,and hence the stupa, originated in India, and there is a whole history of the evolution of stupas in India[And I didn't read the pagoda article at all, just noticed the redirect]-<a href="../../../k/r/s/User%7EKRS_9867.html" title="User:KRS">KRS</a> 18:17, 16 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the Thai chedis also often contain relics of Buddha. And the shapes can vary a lot - Khmer style look like a phallus, Thai style usually more bell-shaped, and so on. The book "A guide to Khmer temples in Thailand &amp; Laos" says <i>Most Khmer temples derive from Indian models, and the more complex constructions owe much to those of the Chola dynasty in southern India</i>. But if you write a good article about the stupa alone, then it will be no problem to remove the stupa in pagoda and instead write that the stupa was the original design. But I also don't know enough about the buddhist architecture yet to write more than I already did. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 18:23, 16 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ahoerstemeier, how dare you remove my material on George Bush, someone I know a great deal about. I don't see any evidence that you have any expertise in the field of modern American political history. (History professor here.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The more extreme the claims, the more sound must be the proofs. If you claim that George Bush senior did have anything to do with the assasination of JFK you need to proof it very soundly - and you cannot as otherwise George Bush would be on trial already. What you can add is a sentence like "Some conspiracy theorists claim that George Bush had relations to the assassination of JFK". <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 08:27, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Out of curiosity, how can I present simple biographical information about Graham Hancock, books, dates, etc. without having a copyright violation? Can I paraphrase the biography from his website? DRH PS thx for the redirect on legends, I had assumed we had something on that, will have to fill in more later</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course you can use the official biography from his website as the basis for the biographical data, but you need to write it in your own words. What is also not too good is to do the rewriting sentence-by-sentence and just replace some words using a thesaurus. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 21:33, 30 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess you talk about the Ayutthaya art picture, right? Well, at first it's the feeling that it don't look like a free picture - it more looks like a poster of an art exhibition. While we have many good free pics here already, the better looking the more suspect is an image. As I searched that one previously with the google picture search and didn't find anything then, this time I tried <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com" class="external free" title="http://www.alltheweb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alltheweb.com</a> - and found it in the picture search (searching "Ayutthaya"), only the URL on the site had changed since alltheweb last indexed it. And I also tried to look at the text search for "Ayutthaya art", and that helped me to find the second place. But text copyright violation are <b>much</b> easier to find then images, even though images might pose the bigger copyright violation risk. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 09:36, 2 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello andy, RE: your comments on taxonomic and common names: the term "Driver ant" is loosely used to describe other ant subfamilies in addition to the dorylinae. I was intending to link these, once added to the "driver ant" page. Doryline ants alone have no unique common name (apart from the rather predictable "Doryline ants"!), so listing them under a name the also applies to other, different ants strikes me as unnecessarily inacurate. However, I take you point about common names being used when available, so unless you have a better suggestion, I will use taxonomic names when common names are ambiguous/used for several different taxa, but common names when they are specific. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 16:41, 2 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
