<p>Hi. I'd like to request that User: Robert the Bruce be temporarily blocked for violation of the Three Revert Rule, per <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">Wikipedia:Three revert rule</a>, for his reverts on <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreskin_restoration.html" title="Foreskin restoration">Foreskin restoration</a> (see that page's edit history for details). Though his reverts are relatively minor, they still represent an attempt to push a particular point of view in spite of opposition from other frequent editors of the article; his edit summaries also indicate that he's well aware of the 3RR.</p>
<p>I would block him myself, but am a contributor to the article. Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Andy. I got your message about the deletion of Lame's Special Quartic, but the problem still seems to remain. On the page <a href="../../../m/a/t/Category%7EMathematics_3089.html" title="Category:Mathematics">Category:Mathematics</a>, there is a broken link to the non-existant article. No one can seem to fix it, since it is automatically generated. Any ideas? <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Kelly_ce0f.html" title="User:Sean Kelly">Sean Kelly</a> 18:33, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see, now I understand that's why you created it, I thought it was just a normal test for a new article creation. There seems to be an article in the database which isn't accessible in any normal way, so it seems only a developer with direct connection to the database can locate and remove it. I have put a note on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Non-development_tasks_for_developers" class="extiw" title="m:Non-development_tasks_for_developers">m:Non-development tasks for developers</a>, then someone will look into it. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 21:44, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Does it double? Don't know about that... Sometimes I have to block a second time as the first block apparently didn't take action, never knew blocks accumulate, I would imagine that simply the latest block is the one which counts. The only sad thing is that her blocking overwrote my blocking comment to that vandal&#160;:-) Somehow tonight is rather busy with vandals, I have been reverting nonsense edits for two hours already.

<dd>Yes, I am mostly active at the Thailand stuff, but sometimes I'm doing some cleanup in the other countries as well. Having a simple geocode redirect might be handy in some cases - especially if there are several romanizated name versions around, however at least for Thailand UN/LOCODE is quite incomplete, it just has the real big towns (the provincial capitals), but smaller towns like <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaiya.html" title="Chaiya">Chaiya</a> are already missing. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 21:37, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I choose the number a bit by feeling according to the kind of vandalism and its persistence. If someone just adds an <a href="../../../e/x/a/Image%7EExample.jpg_5e93.html" title="Image:Example.jpg">Image:Example.jpg</a>, that's definitely just a test. If someone add "%Classmate% is gay", that's more like a 2, and if that one is done again after being removed before I may go directly to 3. Maybe I am sometimes a bit fast to go to the higher levels, but especially if its a vandal rush hour I prefer to get the RC manageable than to make sure no potential contributor is scared away.

<p>Hi, I'm hoping you can help clean up the mess that I have created. I was trying to create a standard format for titles of articles about Canadian political party leadership conventions. Specifically, I was trying to follow the format that has been adopted for Canadian elections, i.e., putting the year at the end, so: "Party Name leadership convention, YYYY". Also, "leadership race" is too colloquial for an encyclopedia. The problem is that I did not know how to "move" an article, and was cutting and pasting the text into the new article. The author of the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_leadership_convention%2C_1968_e122.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 1968">Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 1968</a> article, who had originally created the article as "1968 Liberal Party of Canada leadership race", reverted my edit, and scolded me for my bad redirection. I have now learned how to move an article, and the original author has now agreed with my suggestion for re-naming of the article, and has completed the move. I was trying to correct my mistake on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Liberal_Party_of_Canada_leadership_race_0e5e.html" title="2003 Liberal Party of Canada leadership race">2003 Liberal Party of Canada leadership race</a>, but I am unable to move it to <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_leadership_convention%2C_2003_31cb.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 2003">Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 2003</a> because that article already exists, even though it is blank. Can you tell me how to move the article? I would be very grateful for your help in this matter. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 22:38, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, if you do the revert manually you have to type text on your own.

<p>Hello, I'm wondering what relics there are of the Frankish Empire. What architecture and museum-level pieces remain? I understand that Charlemagne's tomb lies in his cathedral, but what about the palaces? Where are those? <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorderer_8031.html" title="User:Borderer">Borderer</a> 02:21, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The main relic is of course the cathedral, while there are no remains of the palace (<i>Kaiserpfalz</i>). The town hall (<i>Rathaus</i>) was built on top of what was part of the palace in the 14th century, when the palace was in ruins due to neglect. The museum of the cathedral (<i>Domschatzkammer</i>) has some remains of the times of Charlemagne, but also of later times. The city museum at the Frankenberg castle ( <i>Museum Burg Frankenberg</i>) would also be worth a visit, however due to lack of funds its opening hours are a shame - just 3 hours on Sundays around lunch time. I haven't been there yet. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 17:20, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andy, thank you very much!&#160;:) What are the locations of those lost buildings? All in Aachen? I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time. The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe. Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor? I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children. Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then? Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname. I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style. Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond. Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses like Hanover and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. So, what do you think...Am I right? <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorderer_8031.html" title="User:Borderer">Borderer</a> 01:10, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, just got a message saying I should comment on a talk page about the above subject. However I disagree completely with the author's view of irish trad so would like to delete everything on that page. What is the point of talking about it when I consider everything on that page to be incorrect? Somehow we get redirected from the old trad music page (don't know whether the current author did that). If he wants a generic "irish music" page then let him have one. But someone so untutored in trad music should not be the sole proprietor of that page. How do we resolve this conflict, allowing me to point out to new users where the text is wrong? Can I start a separate "trad music only" page and take away the redirect?</p>

<dd>I made some minor changes, made the text a bit smaller in the templates (text size = 85%) to get it a bit smaller. Also added 3 rows to changwat template, an idea stolen from the Brazil templates on nl: . I also changed the background colour of the intro part from very light purple into very light grey ....

<dd>You can compile that list from the province websites, those are usually up-to-date.

<p>hi andy, I think every province has a page, but on <a href="../../../t/h/_/ISO_3166-2%7ETH_7a43.html" title="ISO 3166-2:TH">ISO_3166-2:TH</a> some are read. I do not know which spelling is correct. Even if ISO is wrong, this should remain in the list , maybe with a note that this is spelled after an unusual romanization. I think you are better in this than me. I also moved all but two province-page from Something_province to Something_Province. I do not know which method is really better, but it seemed more common to use uppercase. For other countries it is mostly uppercase. As well it is common to say Some_River not Some_river.

<dd>The romanization of Thai names is a pain, there are lots of different schemes, and even though there is one official scheme (which has many weaknesses, see <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Thai_General_System_of_Transcription_3481.html" title="Royal Thai General System of Transcription">Royal Thai General System of Transcription</a>) by far not all texts from government follow it - especially on websites. There is a list of recommended spellings, yet I somehow cannot find the link right now, but at least for the letters I think I have followed that list. I don't know by which rule the <i>buri</i> (which means town) is spelled with blank or without, it's confusing me as well.

<p>Perhaps someone used it as part of a vandalism campaign? In any case, there has been quite some controversy over this image.

<dd>Yes, I deleted it in error, I was trying to fix vandalism which was done by sneaky redirects to that image, and did not notice it was the image page I was seeing, not a page using the image, and when I noticed it the deletion was already done.

<p>Hi&#160;! Just wanted to say thank you for all those interwiki links you keep adding on our Thailand pages. I will soon be away on holidays so I will calm down and stop creating so many pages. That'll give you an opportunity to breathe for a while. All the provinces and capital cities pages have now been created (and visited by you) anyway... Thanks again. Take care. — <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discussion_Utilisateur:Oxag" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discussion_Utilisateur:Oxag" rel="nofollow">Oxag</a> 13:52, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC) <small>(It seems there is a User:Oxag on en: but it is not me.

<dd>Apparently that user account was just used yesterday for a sick vandalism run, and now blocked indefinitely, so you're one day late to register it. Anyway, I am nearly through with adding the interwikis for the provinces, but not for the cities yet - those are ugly stubs here anyway as well. However I am a bit disappointed that you didn't add the interwikis at least on the french site when you created those stubs. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 19:51, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To tell you the truth, I did not even think about it. I was far too engrossed in the creation of the 150+ pages, their relevant {{models}} and the statistics for each province (which took me ages), and I must admit the interwiki thing did not even cross my mind. Shame on me. I think I'll go and bury myself in the backgarden...&#160;:)<br />
On a more serious note, on en: the names of Thai provinces seem to be somewhat inconsistant. All the <i>buri</i>-s are written in a single word (ie, Lopburi, Suphanburi...) except Sing Buri which for no obvious reason is spelt in two. Nakhon Si Thammarat has a space between the <i>Si</i> and the <i>Thammarat</i> but Sisaket has not. Same with Nong Khai and Nongbua Lamphu. If you have time to correct that... — <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discussion_Utilisateur:Oxag" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discussion_Utilisateur:Oxag" rel="nofollow">Oxag</a> 01:59, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The transliteration of Thai is a pain - I followed the Royal Thai Institute, but which names to be spelling in one word or two there seem to be different ways. I cannot find the list I used anymore, <a href="http://narst.dmsc.moph.go.th/another/Thai%20province%20and%20district%20names%20in%20English.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://narst.dmsc.moph.go.th/another/Thai%20province%20and%20district%20names%20in%20English.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is one which conflicts a bit with some spellings I used. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 13:00, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Saw your query about rafflesia in Khao Sok- I've been studying them for 7 years there. I've found them blooming from October through March. There are about 8-10 sites around Khao sok where they can be found some are 45 minute walks others are several hours. If you want more information e-mail me at akbeeman2000_at_yahoo.com as I'm new to this wikipedia page (first time) I'm not sure how to send messages, Regards Steve</p>

<dd>Thanks a lot for that info, so I was there at the right time in January this year, but just wasn't lucky. As most of my trips to Thailand were at around that time I will try if I can see one next time. One of the reasons I want to see them in nature is of course to create a free photo to illustrate the <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafflesia.html" title="Rafflesia">Rafflesia</a> article... <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 22:49, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did a search on Gestalt Therapy before I posted the article and nothing came up, which is why I did the search. If I had seen an article on gestalt then I would not have input my piece, as I did not input my piece on frued, jung or lacan.

<p>Hi Ahoerstemeier — did you not look at the page history before deleting <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheeses....html" title="Cheeses...">Cheeses...</a>? If you had, you would have noticed that I had been trying (unsuccessfully) to get it to redirect to Cheeses�(of_Nazereth) and was still working on it (my last edit came back with an error because the article I had been working on had suddenly dropped out from under me).</p>
<p>If you could help though, it would be much appreciated — <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarg_cafc.html" title="User:Sarg">User:Sarg</a> had asked for my help and I wasn't able to do much. 1) The page Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Cheeses� doesn't seem to link from <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Log_2005_March_31_4149.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 March 31">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 March 31</a>, even though it seems to be correctly listed using {{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Cheeses%85}}. 2) I couldn't create a redirect from <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheeses....html" title="Cheeses...">Cheeses...</a> to Cheeses�(of_Nazereth): the page saved correctly but had as its content "1. REDIRECT Cheeses�(of_Nazereth)" instead of the little redirect symbol (and thus did not function as a redirect). There seem to be errors caused by the use of the ellipsis symbil (%85) in the article title.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="grey">Talk</font></a> 14:34, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I only saw that redirect with a red link, thus redirecting into nothing. I already undeleted it now, and made the redirect work - you have to write the characters, not the encoded characters like they show in the URL, that's why it did not behave as a redirect. And apparently one dot was missing as well. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 14:57, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
