<p>Hello Ahoerstemeier! I'm severely updating the copyvio page on <a href="../../../k/o/_/Ko_Samui_d6f5.html" title="Ko Samui">Ko Samui</a> at the moment - take a look at Ko Samui/temp to see how it looks now. I was wondering if you'd be so good as to either lend me a copy of your great <a href="../../../t/h/a/Image%7EThailand_Mueang_Surat.png_892b.html" title="Image:Thailand Mueang Surat.png">Image:Thailand_Mueang_Surat.png</a> so I can place the appropriate dot, or if you would like to do it yourself and add it to the article that would be just great too.

<dd>Sure, I already saw your rewrite of that article, much better than the first version. I can make a map similar with the one for Mueang Surat Thani easily - however as Ko Samui is also an Amphoe a map showing it within the Surat Thani province would be fitting, but I don't have that one ready yet. So as you asked I guess I will upload the simple one first. And how about a photo of grandmother and grandfather stone? The one I already uploaded to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/article/Ko_Samui" class="external text" title="http://wikitravel.org/en/article/Ko_Samui" rel="nofollow">wikitravel:Koh Samui</a>.

<p>I think what matters most is readability over nice appearance. If the interspace between 2 lines is a bit larger, that's ok. We are not making art. We are informing people. What's the point of writing the names in Thai if it is completely unreadable? Until 2 weeks ago, texts in Thai (and also Chinese by the way) were perfectly readable, but now they have changed the format of pages on Wikipedia (I don't even know why!), and the fonts are smaller (including the Latin fonts). It's ok for Latin fonts, we can still read, but for Thai or Chinese fonts it is ridiculous, we can read nothing. I have the latest version of Internet Explorer, like most people, so the problem doesn't come from my browser. I can assure you that even for Thai people it would be hard to read. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 23:04, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If it changed to the worse in the last two weeks then it is probably related with the new skin, so it should be reported in <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.3_comments_and_bug_reports" class="extiw" title="meta:MediaWiki_1.3_comments_and_bug_reports">MediaWiki 1.3 comments and bug reports</a>. However as I said I don't see it bad currently, so I will make screenshots later and add them here to illustrate it. If it really displays different on your system then we better let developers hunt for the problem in the css, not change all articles which display the problem - especially if the problem isn't there in all cases. It might be that your browser selects a different font than mine for whatever reason. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:49, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I now can see the problem as well, on the laptop of my wife which have no additional fonts installed. There it really shrunk to a non-legible size, however also before the switch to the new skin it already was significantly smaller than the normal text - you can see it at <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org" class="external free" title="http://www.wikinfo.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikinfo.org</a> which hasn't switched to 1.3 yet. The laptop and my workstation use different Windows versions, but I guess the main difference is that on my workstation I have an Arial Unicode font which contains almost all characters defined in Unicode. I will document it all with some screenshots, then hopefully someone can suggest a way to tweak the css to make it look good without that special font as well. Yet I still think we should try to fix the problem with the css, not by tweaking HTML into the wikicode. Strangely the thai wikipedia shows with a good font here... <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 20:38, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>For Thai font there is a tiny difference of size between the old and new version of Wikipedia. For Chinese characters though, the difference is abysmal. Chinese characters before were perfectly fine, but now they are utterly unreadable. And I am a fluent Chinese reader! I have all the Chinese fonts possible on my computer. I don't think I have Arial Unicode though, but I don't believe most people have it. So it is better to make the writings readable for the majority of people without Arial Unicode, in all the languages. Honnestly, even the Latin font is smaller now, which must cause problems to people who have difficulty reading small fonts (not my case, but I am sure it's the case for many people). With the new Wikipedia version, it looks to me appearance and style were favored over comfort, which I totally disaprove of. Anyway, if you know the right person to contact about the unreadable Chinese fonts, please do so.

<p>At present there are several articles (<b>Mukacheve</b>, <b>Mukachevo</b>, <b>Mukachiv</b>, <b>Munkacs</b>) redirecting to article <b>Munkács</b>.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to place the main article in <b>Mukacheve</b> and redirect the others to it. After all, the town is located in Ukraine and <i>Mukacheve (Мукачеве</i>) is its official name, while <i>Mukachiv (Мукачів)</i> is the name in Ruthenian, and <i>Munkács</i> (Hungarian) and <i>Mukačevo</i> (Slovak and Czech; Russian <i>Мукачево</i>) are historical, albeit well-known, versions of the name.</p>

<dd>I wonder why you tell me, as I haven't worked on any of those articles yet. If you want the article to be moved to anyother location, but that one is blocked with a redirect, then you should ask at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion</a> to get it deleted, as that is the official way to go. However for city names there is always the tricky question of what variant is the <i>english</i> name, i.e. the name most often found in english-language sources. So maybe you should put your above rationale to the talk page of that article and wait for some time if anyone contradicts the proposed move, and then go to RfD and have an admin do the actual move. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 08:21, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there. I just moved that article back to <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazonas_State_a350.html" title="Amazonas State">Amazonas State</a> -- that title fits in much better the pattern used to name <i>all</i> the Venezuelan states, plus it more closely reflects the local use of almost invariably referring to it as "Estado Amazonas". I can understand your wanting to disambig with the Brazilian state, but perhaps a disambig note at the top of the article would take care of that? I'll put one on now, see what you think. <a href="../../../h/a/j/User%7EHajor_7ab9.html" title="User:Hajor">–<i>Hajor</i></a> 23:58, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I don't think that's the correct way, because both the Brazilian as well as the Venzuelan state are a "state" in english. And a disambiguation note at top of an article should only be used if the topic of the article is the most common meaning - but I don't think any of the two states is more "famous" than the other one. As an opposite example <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plateau.html" title="Plateau">Plateau</a> is the name of three provinces in Africa, but there the main meaning is the most common use of the word. How about <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazonas_State_%28Venezuela%29_a0d7.html" title="Amazonas State (Venezuela)">Amazonas State (Venezuela)</a>? <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 14:25, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yeah, OK. Cool. Although, as long as the redir from <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazonas_State_a350.html" title="Amazonas State">Amazonas State</a> is still active, I'll be tempted to use that if I do any work on the Venezuelan articles. (Afterthought: we could relocate <i>all</i> the Venezuelan states to the very ingrained local use of "Estado Amazonas", "Estado Miranda", etc -- or would that be too radical for the "no Spanish please, this is the English wikipedia" crowd?)

<dd>Shouldn't the redirect point to the Amazonas disambiguation as well? <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 16:18, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Andy. As you know, I'm a great fan of your work on the <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> articles, but there is one of your edits that I disagree with. When I go to the <a href="../../../a/y/u/Ayutthaya.html" title="Ayutthaya">Ayutthaya</a> page, I expect to find an article on the city, not a disambiguation page. There is nothing ambiguous about the word "Ayutthaya". I fear this will set an annoying precedent, where for example <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> will become a disambig for "City of London"/"Greater London"/"London forces"/"Jack London"/"London (Canada)" etc. Imagine your favourite city receiving the same treatment.</p>
<p>Would you object if I moved <a href="../../../a/y/u/Ayutthaya_%28city%29.html" title="Ayutthaya (city)">Ayutthaya (city)</a> back to <a href="../../../a/y/u/Ayutthaya.html" title="Ayutthaya">Ayutthaya</a>, and added a line at the top in italics saying <i>This article is about the city.

<dd>In general I agree with you, and I don't much object if you would do that move. However as for the provinces the capital (Mueang) has the same name there is always some confusion whether one is talking about the province or the city. For those provinces where the capital is a rather small city Thai usually refer to the province when they don't add "changwat" or "mueang", for those where the capital is big it's more the other way round. For some I did with that disambiguation header you suggest (see e.g. <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalasin.html" title="Kalasin">Kalasin</a>), however as for Ayutthaya, <a href="../../../s/u/k/Sukhothai.html" title="Sukhothai">Sukhothai</a> and also <a href="../../../p/h/u/Phuket.html" title="Phuket">Phuket</a> there are more than those two meanings interfere it gets more complicated, so for the first two I did with a disambiguation page at top level. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 08:53, 17 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<dd>To interfere in this discussion. I personally feel Ayutthaya should be a disam... page. As there are so many different meanings. If i talk about Ayutthaya with somebody it could be about either one of them. Not just the city. Same goes for Sukhothai. The Ayutthaya and Sukhothai periods are rather important in the history of Thailand.

<dd>No, I don't think that is really necessary. And if I read it correctly, the new <a href="../../../t/e/r/Wikipedia%7ETerms_of_use_fe37.html" title="Wikipedia:Terms of use">Wikipedia:Terms of use</a> is trying to address that problem as well, by claiming only the current version as being fully GFDL, while the history being an archive under US law. There is talking about a feature to delete selected revisions of the editing history to be added to MediaWiki (it is possible by manual database magic by developers already) - especially the German wikipedia thinks they need it, as probably that archive law doesn't apply to Germany. However deleting the complete article and recreate only the latest version would also be a violation of the GFDL, as the previous contributors are then no longer credited.

<p>Hello Andreas, on my computer at my home I have made a start with the first amphoe: amphoe muang Samut Prakan. This amphoe is divided into a number of tambons, now how do I find out which of these tambons form the actual city?? Is there a list of which tambons are combined to fall under the city administration??? I will upload a Dutch and English version tomorrow or the day after. How should I name the English version? amphoe muang Samut Prakan or Samut Prakan district? Also if you like the setup can you than please create a German version of the template, so I can copy the figures in there as well. <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 12:22, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good question. So far I haven't made much difference between the <i>Amphoe Mueang</i> (note the "e" in the romanization according to the royal institute)
<dl>
<dd>As far as I know there is no standardized spelling, this one is new for me. I wish they would implement it on roadsigns and in the papers and other publications <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 09:06, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<dd>At <a href="http://www.arts.chula.ac.th/%7Eling/tts/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arts.chula.ac.th/%7Eling/tts/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> you can find an online romanization tool which uses that "official" transcription system. IMHO that'd be the best for naming the articles, yet we'd probably need many redirect for the alternative spellings. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:12, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>and the actual city - see e.g. <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surat_Thani_ef4e.html" title="Surat Thani">Surat Thani</a>. I am not yet sure about the local administration system (and its reforms) - as far as I read it the Tambon are relatively autonomous - is there any "city administration" beyond that at all?

<dd>However that one only applies to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pattaya.html" title="Pattaya">Pattaya</a> - only Bangkok and Pattaya have a special administrative system (and maybe Pattani will get one in the future), all other have AFAIK only the Amphoe and Tambon administrations. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:12, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Translating it to German is no big deal - however on the German wp there are already articles about all provincial capitals. Those are actually a bit of a mixture of city and province article, yet making a nearly duplicate article for the Amphoe Mueang wouldn't be that good.

<dd>Normally I only do it when I fix anything inside the table, or the table has some problems. It's a bit of work to convert it manually, and usually there should be no difference in the result of the wiki table and the HTML table. The wiki syntax is maybe a bet clearer and easier, but the decrease in page size is insignifcant, except for pages which only consist of table (especially if they are created with MS Word HTML export). Tge country articles will be converted to use a template which contains the table, however the templates still have some infancy problems. Thus it'd be a bit of work-for-nothing to convert the table to wiki syntax first and then to the template later. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 20:55, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The name of the show is <i>Tong bai krai kriat</i> (it would actually deserve a lemma) on channel 3 at 12.00 in the afternoon. It is one of the most popular comedy shows on thai tv! They were shooting a new opening for the show, which will be the start of the program for a year. They invited all the groups/characters that play regularly on the show. So I hope that our group will be invited more often. We are becoming better known every month. We have had major newspapercoverage, been in tv shows and perform regularly. I was lucky that one person dropped out and they had a spot for me .... .

<p>Well, I recomend you to Change the Chakri Kings' names to "Rama I - IX" because Romanization is not stable, also even in Thailand. For example, <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha_Yodfa_Chulaloke_39b8.html" title="Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke">Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke</a> is used in en:Wiki, but according to the Romanization used in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_Thailand_d659.html" title="Provinces of Thailand">provinces of Thailand</a> <i>Phuttha Yotfa Chulalok</i> seems more correct spelling.

<dd>I know, the romanization of Thai names is a pain, yet there is a recommended romanization scheme <a href="http://www.arts.chula.ac.th/%7Eling/tts/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arts.chula.ac.th/%7Eling/tts/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> - only very few actually use it. But AFAIK the Rama-Names would be wrong as well - as I try to summerize in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chakri_dynasty.html#naming" title="Chakri dynasty">Chakri dynasty#naming</a> that one was introduced by King Vajiravudh, and abolished again by his successor. Thus we should use the most common english version of the name - which is rather easy for Mongkut, Chulalongkorn and Bhumipol Adulyadej as they are referenced rather often. And of course we have the redirects like <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rama_IX_34ff.html" title="Rama IX">Rama IX</a>... <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 16:28, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi andy, whilst a perjorative and mischeivious choice of edit, I was not vandalising the page permanently, but making a demonstration to another present of the communities efficiency. I had no idea it would be checked in as little as two minutes though.

<p>Sawadee-kap Andy, having just come back from Thailand and being a new enthusiast for all things Thai, I would like to write more articles and will do so as I get time. Do we have articles on Wat Arun, Wat Pho, Wat Doi Suthep, Wat Cheddi Luang or Wat Chiang Man? If not I can do them as I have photos and guide books from all of them. Also the Democracy Monument and the Victory Monument in Bangkok. On Vajiralongkorn, is Maha Vajiralongkorn his full and correct name? I can't find any other versions. Also, is the stuff about his marriage correct. I know Thai sources are very reluctant to comment on such matters, but I'm sure there is more to be said about it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:06, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is very "dangerous" to write "negative" things about members of the royal family. I live in Thailand and know that making negative marks about the royal family can get somebody into big problems. No matter if it is the truth or not. Theoratically it can result in a block of wikipedia, they are blocking over 10.000 websites in Thailand already, part of them because they are negative about the government etc. For the list search at 2bangkok.com. Contact me through private email if you want and we will discuss it there.</dd>

<p>Hello, currently at the Dutch wikipedia we are discussing copy vio's of pictures. A user (he has been on nl wiki for a long time) claims that edited maps of originals, no matter how significantly edited are still copy-vio's! I threw back to him that that means that all province maps of all countries that we have copied so far from EN wiki are than copy-vio's and should be removed, as all of them are drawn from copyrighted originals. Untill we finish this debate I want to ask you not to upload any of the amphoe maps, if you were planning on that. There are a lot of voices to ditch most of the pictures because they "might" be copy vio's. Even though the pictures have been accepted on other wiki's .... <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 15:55, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Great, same as the German wikipedia enjoys a copyright paranoia on images, as well as an endless discussion on the possibility to include coat of arms there. IMHO (and especially IANAL) for maps there are two points: Of course maps are copyrighted, same as a statistics yearbook. However the base data can't be copyrighted, thus it is possible to extract facts from both sources and built upon that. Thus same as we can use the data from a yearbook, we can also use facts from maps. Cartographers sometimes insert small bugs (a small non-existant island for example) to trace abuse, thus a crosscheck would avoid such problems - yet I think the plain location maps are trivial enough to avoid any copyright problems. While I am not happy with the many "fair use" images here (which in most cases are simply stolen images labeled "fair use"), the opposite paranoia is also bad as it only scares away uploaders. So - just upload those maps to the dutch wikipedia when you feel confident they will be accepted. I get enough edits there by fixing interwiki links. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:48, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Are you sure that you are not violating copyrights? It can be a problem even if you do not think so. I want you to be sure because I frequently upload your changwats' graphics.

<dd>Of course I am not sure (IANAL) - but as a wrote above, the location of borders cannot be copyrighted, only a map which shows them in a specific style.

<p>Hi. I see you're disambiguating "doping".

<p>I am sorry about having to revert but this 80.133.56.237 is causing major problems on many sites. And I work from a Library computer and I don't have much time and I had to restore the missing elements without having to retype it all back in. I am sorry and thanks for your re-contribution.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 16:23, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just fixed the broken non-ASCII characters which were accidentally broken by the vandal - the actual fix I wanted to do to that article was the spelling fix of Hilter, but that apparently was in the deleted part. But now you reverted it I simply did it now. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 16:25, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Must have been the same one who blanked several pages two days earlier (nearly same IP). I reverted most of them then, and luckily an admin was around as well who blocked the culprit. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 18:33, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I cannot read how long the user was blocked, but it was exactly the same IP address that did it a day earlier. On the Dutch wiki when something like that happens (so many blankings and bad language like F.. Y.. etc.) I usually immediately block them for a month ... I know it is harsh, but I am not a kindergarten teacher. <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 18:41, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that an IP rarely belongs to exactly one human being. For dialup IPs or a shared IP of an university a longer blocking can block innocents. But maybe as that one returned already despite being blocked a range block with a bit longer timeout (in english the default is 24 hours, that's enough to get rid of the standard vandals) may be valid. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 18:47, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I know that, I was blocked from the English wiki a long time ago for a few days because somebody in the internetcafe I used had done some vandalism here. Luckily Andre Engels solved the problem. So I know how it feels. At least you get a decent page with contact possibilities. So if someone wants to edit they can send a mail, but what happened a few nights ago was out of proportion! And in my opinion that warrants a longer block, untill somebody complains in the moderatormail. <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 20:51, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for expanding <b>William H. Tunner</b> and <b>Lucius D. Clay</b> I had already put in a piece on <b>Daniel Isom Sultan</b> and <b>Albert Coady Wedemeyer</b> and had run out of time.

<p>You may have noticed that I got to Amphibians adding categories to the tree of life.

<dd>Maybe I will rename them to the common english names of the families - newt and salamander are both general terms used for mostly aquatic or mostly terrestrial respectively, thus the Salamandrinae are commonly called "True salamanders and newts".

So far only positive votes.

<dd>Actually the original nomination here was made for the whole project of the province articles, I extended the main article well after it was already on brilliant prose (it was listed on November 28 2003, but I started the history part in March 2004). But anyway, it's great news, and I really appreciate it when my contributions are received so well. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 20:51, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<p>I have just about had it with this character. Is he the same as Andy. He has erased a major section of the Weimar Timeline then took the erased stuff and created a new article with my material which could have all stayed in the Weimar timeline. I am furious. The Weimar Timeline can put it all in perspective. The man did no work no research no time except to steal the work. I resent this. And his supposedly "authority" to erase stuff in the Weimar timeline for what reason? There is no reason for this <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Nazi_Timeline_38af.html" title="Early Nazi Timeline">Early Nazi Timeline</a>. He just copied all my work when it can all been included in the Weimar timeline and this new timeline is connected to nothing!

<dd>Actually, I neglected to check the history and just wrote a little in "Much Ado About Nothing" because nothing was there.
