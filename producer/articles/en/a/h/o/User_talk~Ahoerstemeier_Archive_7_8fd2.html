<p>So you found the Thailand newspage! There have been a few new pages like this one. Mainly based on the fact that it scores good with the visitors. See: <a href="../../../../nl/w/a/e/Gebruiker%7EWaerth_Wikipedia_hitsparade_3087.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Gebruiker:Waerth/Wikipedia_hitsparade">nl:Gebruiker:Waerth/Wikipedia_hitsparade</a> for the number of hits per page on the Dutch wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 11:32, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I sometimes look around the other languages to see what exists there about Thailand - that's how I also noticed that someone just started with translating the province articles to finnish. At least dutch has the advantage that I can grasp the contents roughly due to the similarities of Dutch with German. And if I come across some broken wikicode I can fix without speaking the language I am bold enough to just fix it. The idea of that news article is good, but it's also some work to keep it current - and that's even harder for someone who can only access the english Thai newspapers by web... <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:44, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wanted to create a disambiguation page for PNG, so navigated to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG_(disambiguation)" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG_(disambiguation)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG_(disambiguation)</a>, and received the "Wikipedia does not yet have an article with this name" message. Instead of the "edit this page" link properly linking to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=PNG_%28disambiguation%29&amp;action=edit" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=PNG_%28disambiguation%29&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=PNG_%28disambiguation%29&amp;action=edit</a>, it linked to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=PNG_%2528disambiguation%2529&amp;action=edit" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=PNG_%2528disambiguation%2529&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=PNG_%2528disambiguation%2529&amp;action=edit</a>, which seems to be the source of the problem. Instead of "Editing PNG (disambiguation)" displaying as the title of the page while editing it, it read "Editing PNG %28disambiguation%29". It seems that perhaps the "article does not exist" page is improperly parsing the parentheses for the edit link. (This does not happen for the "create an article with this title" link on the search results page.) For whatever reason, I didn't realize the mistake until I had created the page. I hope this helps. - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattTM_b021.html" title="User:MattTM">MattTM</a> 08:32, Sep 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Andy, it would be nice to meet you when I get to the Netherlands. On another note, Adam Carr has started deleting Sukhothai, Ayutthaya and history of Thailand articles in favour of his own. I totally object to this. His article is to small. Why can western countries have 100 history pages and does Thailand need to be handled in one page? <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 07:16, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can join the discussion at <a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHistory_of_Thailand_a196.html" title="Talk:History of Thailand">Talk:History of Thailand</a>, both me and <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkalexander100_03f8.html" title="User:Markalexander100">User:Markalexander100</a> also thought that we need both an overview article and detailled ones for the Sukhothai, Ayutthaya and Thonburi/Ratanakosin periods - actually you're about a month late to notice it&#160;:-). But Adam is also writing a lot new text, thus Mark and him agreed that Mark will later split and summerize the text to have both several detailled articles as well as an overview version. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 10:57, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is not what has happened look at the history of the articles and you will see he deleted the contents today! I reacted at his talk page! <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 11:02, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I now noticed he did the same he did one month ago, when both me and Mark told him the same already - and came to the agreement that Mark will later organize the new text, while leaving the separate articles alone for the moment. I left another note on Adams talk, explaining again why we need both the overview and several detailled articles. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:16, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<dd>You can see his reactions to my arguments at my talk page. This might become a protracted discussion .... <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 11:19, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So we better put the discussion in one place instead of spreading it on now four user talk pages... Seems like something like <a href="../../../i/r/i/Wikipedia%7EIrish_wikipedians%27_notice_board_5442.html" title="Wikipedia:Irish wikipedians' notice board">Wikipedia:Irish wikipedians' notice board</a> would be also useful for us Thai-enthusiasts to have a central point of discussing or organizing. Or even a Wikipedia:WikiProject Thailand? <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:25, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Another page to watch .... but it is a good idea, we could also get Ramendra, Bact, Phisite and others in on the discussion. Now that I have my own internetconnection I am more involved in discussions than in creating new articles. <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 11:54, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Adam also created another page see: <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Thailand_%28overview%29_807e.html" title="History of Thailand (overview)">History_of_Thailand_(overview)</a> <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 20:53, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The noticeboard is an interesting idea... For the moment, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Thailand_fbd7.html" title="History of Thailand">History of Thailand</a>'s talk page is probably the best place to sort it out (again!) if necessary, but if it looks like dying down there's no need to stir it up again. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkalexander100_03f8.html" title="User:Markalexander100">Markalexander100</a> 02:19, 12 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yepp, they look very good. But sadly the German wikipedians are paranoid about pictures which even have the slightest smell of being non-free, thus I guess that the requirement of giving the source would be too much for them already. But if you upload them here they may sooner or later find their way to de: anyway, I am already bored to have the recurring discussions on de: about images. At least I made sure that the articles on de: and en: are correctly linked with each other now. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 07:44, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello again. I just want to know one thing about symbols in provinces of Thailand. Now in Ja: some of them are discussing templating of uploaded pictures and will neary agreed as every picture must have templates such as {{GFDL}} or {{PD}}. Well, what should be the status of the symbols, GFDL or PD? I hope it is not <i>fair use</i> because we are not allowed to upload fair-use pictures.... --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamendra_132a.html" title="User:Ramendra">Ramendra</a> 15:18, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be honest - I am not sure anymore. I believe that as public symbols they should be PD, same as the many flags here, but I got quite confused by a similar discussion on the status of German coat of arms on the German wikipedia. Yet I somehow doubt that there is any law in Thailand which gives them a copyright protection - but so far I hesitated to choose any of the license tags for them. Maybe we have to ask one of our Thai wikipedians if they can find anything on the status of those symbols. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 19:41, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Argh I am not reading this am I ..... . I personally do not think coat of arms, flags etc are copyright. Most of them are older than 70 years anyway. <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 07:29, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, for the really old coat of arms or flags that's obviously true. The German discussion mixed the copyright (or to be more correct the German equivalent), and the <i>Wappenrecht</i>, which protects official symbols. Yet that one just protects the coat of arms for abuse, e.g. it's not allowed to use the coat of arms in your letterhead as it would look like it's an official letter from the "owner" of the coat of arms. But that one should be of no concern for a encyclopedia. Yet the main problem are those coat of arms created more recently, whether these have any copyright protection, or are free as they are public symbols. After more than a year of discussion in de: still no real result has shown up. And I doubt there is any real answer available for the Thai symbols, as Thailand is famous for not caring about copyright (at least until recently). <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 08:18, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have another thing that I want to ask - happily not about copyright -. Because windows does not have Lao font and we are using Lao font in our articles.

<dd>I have <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arial_Unicode_MS_afd6.html" title="Arial Unicode MS">Arial Unicode MS</a> which contains Lao letters - however it has some display problems as some of the vocals aren't placed correctly on top of the consonant. I don't know if that it because of the font or somewhere deeper in Windows (I use 2000). However for most other languages that font seems to be perfect, only Khmer is missing. I haven't tried other fonts yet, as that one is the most complete, only sadly it is not a standard font in Windows, nor available for free. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 15:33, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)

ich hab grad gesehen, dass Ihr in der en:WP shortcuts eingeführ habt. Sehr praktisch. Gibt es dafür einen eigenen Namensraum oder sind das quasi Artikel.

<dd>Sind AFAIK einfache Artikel. Aber wie ich auf der technical-Mailingliste vor kurzem gelesen habe kann man wohl recht einfach weitere Namensräume hinzufügen, z.B. auch für die Portale auf de:.

<p>Hi, Andy, the Romita website is surely copyright, which makes a straight translation from it a copyvio. But I hate taking the big <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> stick (slap a template on! delete all the text!) straight to these cases, where it's quite likely that the copyright holder <b>would</b> give permission, if the article was brought to their attention. Have you considered e-mailing the webmaster or whoever? Yesterday I found the text of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wilmot%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Rochester_36fa.html" title="John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester">John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester</a>, that was listed on Cleanup on the 25, on some Rochester fan's personal website, and didn't much feel like doing the "right thing". So I e-mailed the fan instead, and he confirmed that he was the original author, was surprised but pleased to be on Wikipedia, and immediately started editing the article.&#160;:-) A really nice outcome, and all that remained to do was put in acknowledgements and a link to the original in the reference section. It's up to you, of course, and I realize a prompt and enthusiastic reply may be less likely from a town (?) bureaucracy than from a one-man website. But maybe it couldn't hurt to e-mail Romita and give them a few hours, before moving in on the article with the wrecking equipment? --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 11:38, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure, there are sometime pearls which are too good to be simply deleted as copyvios. However in most cases what ends at wp:cp are texts copied-and-pasted from somewhere without investing the slightest work to make them fit into a encyclopedia. And <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romita.html" title="Romita">Romita</a> is somewhat similar, that one needs a lot of copyediting and formatting to become a good article. Basically what it need is a complete rewrite using the informations from that article. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 21:41, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

If you feel bored you maybe better work through some of the 1000+ article on cleanup instead of argueing about keeping or deleting a presubstub - or write an improved version of that one (which should be possible spending maybe 10 minute with google), and we can undelete that presubstub as it's beginning.

<dd>Stormfront is a neo-Nazi organization, while Protest Warrior is a pro-freedom and pro-individualism organization; they are in complete opposition to each other. One of the slogans, found on PW bumper stickers, is "Protest Tyrants, Protest Lies, Protest Evil"; hardly a pro-Nazi slogan. If you think right-wing extremism ("economic-conservativism", "social-liberalism", libertarianism, and anarcho-capitalism) is somehow related to Nazism then you apparently don't understand what right-wing means (pro-freedom, pro-individualism, at least here in the USA) and/or haven't bothered to read anything about Nazism. Nazism is anti-freedom (statist) and it is racialist/nationalist (racial/ethnic collectivism) and socialist (economic collectivism); it could also be argued that it's theocratic (religious collectivism, "positive christianity" and thulist occultism) as well. Similarly, Communists (the Soviet model), Communazis (the Asian model), and theocrats all practice all three types, with just the difference in prioritization being the distinguishing factor. Soviet-style Communists have economic collectivism as their primary, religious collectivism (enforced atheism) as their secondary, and racial/ethnic collectivism as their tertiary (sometimes, particularly during war-time, secondary and tertiary priorities get swapped). Asian model Communazis have economic collectivism as their primary, racial/ethnic collectivism as their secondary, and religious collectivism (Confucionism is especially useful for keeping a dictator in power) as their tertiary. Theocrats (modern-day Islamofascists, dark age Christofascists, etc.) have religious collectivism as their primary, racial/ethnic as their secondary, and economic collectivism as their tertiary (I dare you to find even one theocracy with a free market). Secondary and tertiary forms are generally used to reinforce the primary. Same pattern, different emphasis.</dd>

<dd>Collectivism and statism are, in the United States, the very definition of leftism. Keeping up the pretense of private property, and leaving some of the owners of businesses in charge of day-to-day operations while putting all the real power in the hands of the state, is still socialism; it's just not the brain-dead Bolshevik-style kill-all-the-people-who-actually-know-how-to-run-things socialism. Mussolini's Fascist economic system, from which the Nazi economic model was derived, was based on the ideas of Karl Marx, not those of Adam Smith. Even by the ridiculously broken European standard of the political spectrum (which somehow manages to have statist collectivism on both ends), National Socialism can be seen as leftist because it is a form of socialism. PW is as anti-Nazi as it is anti-Communist and anti-theocrat. It is the view of the Protest Warriors, as individualists, that whenever we are put into these artificial and/or nonsensical groupings of race/ethnicity, class, religion, etc., that we are being dehumanized in the process; that dehumanization has been used to commit all the great atrocities of modern times (and, it could be argued, throughout all of human history as well). It is the view of the Protest Warriors, as students of history, that statism and collectivism are inseparable in practice. It is the view of the Protest Warriors, as liberty-lovers, that the individual's rights must be valued and defended and that those who would take away those rights must be challenged. Protest Warriors believe that we're people, not drones born only to serve leftist elites, nor are we cogs built to slave in the collectivist machine of some totalitarian state. Somehow that puts Protest Warriors on the side of Nazis? PW has protested Nazis, you fool. If you have a paypal account, I'd be glad to donate a few cents towards your buying a clue. -- Rich&#160;: 24.29.127.196 05:06, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see that you deleted this, yet it seems not to fit any of the speedy deletion categories - it's not nonsense or lacking substantial content. Please let me know why you think it qualified as a speedy delete rather than something which should have gone through VfD. Alternatively, perhaps you'd undelete it and list it on VfD, with your reasons? There I'd vote to delete it if it turns out not to be improved - but many dictionary definitions do get improved, which is why they aren't speedy deletion candidates. Someone has listed this on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</a> as well. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 05:18, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Correction: that was a listing on votes for <b>Un</b>deletion, not deletion. Since I see you've been active since my question and haven't said why you thought it was nonsense and in discussions three people, including me, expressed the view that it did not meet any speedy deletion condition, equalling those who thought it did, I'm proceeding to undelete it and per undeletion policy will be listing it on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a>. Once that's done you may wish to say more about why you think it was nonsense rather than simply a short dictionary definition. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 12:44, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't remember for sure, but I guess I deleted it because I thought it to be a simple vandalism-like article like "Josh Gayboy" - someone wanting to insult someone who's nickname is butterface. But if it's an actual derogative term in English (as a non-native speaker I don't know them all) - well, undelete it and we have yet another not really encyclopedic article without any hope of improvement, like the thousands in Cleanup. Does every derogative term really valids an article - it just attracts the childish vandals listing the friends in them. It might fit in wiktionary, but I strongly doubt it's worth to include it here. I think that both VfD and Cleanup don't scale anymore with the success of WP, thus I think the speedy deletion rules are a bit too strict to cope with the influx of more-or-less garbage. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 13:19, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I saw that you deleted twice the two links I placed in the Wikipedia,s friends. Is it not written "This page lists external sites that feature links to Wikipedia"&#160;? So, take the time and have a look on the two mentioned sites and you will see three pages with a link to wikipedia. Don't check them with the google command because you will not find them, the reason, simple, the links have been added recently and they are not yet in the google index. So, you will find following two backlinks to wikipedia, it will save you time. I guess I have the right to link my two websites for my contribution to wikipedia no&#160;?</p>

<p>LOL! I'm glad you caught that. I didn't notice the missing "a" and thought someone had simply typed the page name to create an article.

<dd>Strange, the year would make it volume III of "Das Thierreich", not volume IV, . Google only find exactly two hits which cite it from Cuvier 1823, while all others seem to agree on Schinz 1825. And according to <a href="http://www.google.de/search?q=cache:Y-uma6roL8oJ:www.nature-conservation.or.id/primates/macaca_maura.html+Macaca+maura+Cuvier&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.de/search?q=cache:Y-uma6roL8oJ:www.nature-conservation.or.id/primates/macaca_maura.html+Macaca+maura+Cuvier&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (google cached site, original site didn't answer) cite it as Schinz 1825, and say "Based on specimen depicted in Cuvier, 1823". So maybe that's the answer - Cuvier gave the depiction, but it was Schinz who made the description and naming two years later? <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 08:42, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe you've nailed it. Cuvier might have described it as a specimen of another species, but Schinz quickly (for the day) corrected him. And why "F. Cuvier" instead of "Cuvier"? Mysteries and mysteries. Anyway, I'm inclined to follow Groves, since his work is the most accessible to both the public and the scientist. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> 13:27, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>However, you should notice that this guy has a history of inserting negative spin to Islamic articles. As you can see, he even did it to my user page. The statement he removed was discussed in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_56ae.html" title="Talk:Jesus">Talk:Jesus</a>. It's just a fact that people think Muhammad, Ghengiz Khan, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler, etc had historical influence. There is nothing POV about that statement. And of course, in my first revert, I told this vandal to come to talk Jesus and discuss it. He never did and just reverted it back without giving reason or discussing it <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 09:22, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

What is this "test" you speak of? I do not believe I have made any bad edits lately. Maybe it was someone else on the same IP?<br />

<dd>Yes, I saw it in the mailing list as well. And the funny thing is - that Weasel speak wasn't intended&#160;:-) When I wrote that statement I just was annoyed that some of the Kerry supporters thought they can fight for more votes by vandalizing the GWB article, especially by sneaking in voting recommendations. But as I am no fan of GWB the second meaning noted by the NYT isn't alien to me&#160;:-) I guess that one deserves to get listed on my user page... <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 08:47, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've "started" the <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">Free the Rambot Articles Project</a> which aims to get users to release all of their contributions to the U.S. state, county, and city articles under the CC-by-sa 1.0 and 2.0 license (at minimum) or into the public domain if they prefer. A secondary goal is to get those users to release ALL of their edits for ALL articles. I've personally chosen to <a href="../../../m/u/l/Wikipedia%7EMulti-licensing_5622.html" title="Wikipedia:Multi-licensing">multi-license</a> all of the <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">rambot</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> contributions under the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> Attribution-Share Alike <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_License_4fc5.html" title="Creative Commons License">License</a> so that other projects, such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiTravel_62d2.html" title="WikiTravel">WikiTravel</a>, can use our articles. I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all your contributions (or at <i>minimum</i> those on the geographic articles) so that we can keep most of the articles available under the multi-license. Many users use the <b>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</b> template (or even <b>{{MultiLicensePD}}</b> for <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>) on their user page, but there are other templates for other options at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_namespace_f54f.html#Licensing_Templates" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User namespace">Template messages/User namespace</a>. If you only prefer using the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, I understand, but I thought I'd at least ask, just in case, since the number of your edits is in the top 20 most. If you do want to do it, simply just copy and paste one of the above two templates into your user page and it will allow us to track those users who have done it. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Option 1</b></dd>
<dd>I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:</dd>

<dd>I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below:</dd>
<dd>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</dd>

<p>Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain (which many people do or don't like to do, see <a href="../../../m/u/l/Wikipedia%7EMulti-licensing_5622.html" title="Wikipedia:Multi-licensing">Wikipedia:Multi-licensing</a>), you could replace <b>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</b> with <b>{{MultiLicensePD}}</b> -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> 14:37, Nov 24, 2004 (UTC)</p>
