<p>Sorry I didn't respond to your message earlier. It seems the vandalism at tlh has stopped now, but if you decide you do still need adminship there, the quickest place to ask is either on IRC or at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/requests_for_permissions" class="extiw" title="m:requests_for_permissions">m:requests for permissions</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 01:44, Apr 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>When you block likely reincarnations of this user, please bear in mind that he uses an NTL proxy shared by many and so, if possible, make blocks of short duration. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:07, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>How can anyone without direct access to the log files know which IP a user has? Even in the block log the auto-blocked IPs are not listed as numerical. And anyway IIRC the timeout for these autoblocked-IPs is 24h, even if the user is blocked longer - maybe that default/maximum value should be set a bit lower? <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:07, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well the reason I know is because every time you block him you block me!&#160;:) -<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:44, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But as you're an admin yourself, at least you can unblock yourself. Still annoying, but better than for a normal user, then you'd be locked out completely. If <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=550" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=550" rel="nofollow">Bug 550</a> will be "fixed" the problem would disappear. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:50, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well the good news is that this vandal, like most "for the hell of it" vandals, gives up as soon as he's blocked. A relatively brief block is likely to work just as well as a longer one. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:03, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>With the best of intentions, you fixed the "Lord Hudson" redirect to Carl Hudson -- but that's complete claptrap. Take a look at its VfD, and the VfD of a number of closely related pages. They're so awful they're almost funny. PS User:Dexillon is very keen to add a mention of the fictional Lord Seal to <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spilsby.html" title="Spilsby">Spilsby</a>.

<dl>
<dd>And what is your point? That you can recreate accounts to vandalize, and keep well-meaning admins from more useful tasks by keeping them busy to cleanup your mess? That everyone can vandalize articles? It is the philosophy to keep this site as oppen as possible, even though some would be more happy with a more restricted access, see e.g. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_users_should_not_be_allowed_to_edit_articles" class="extiw" title="meta:Anonymous_users_should_not_be_allowed_to_edit_articles">meta:Anonymous users should not be allowed to edit articles</a>. Vandalism is usually quickly fixed anyway, the current model has worked fine for all the time of the existance of this site.

<dd>Incidentally, yes, that is my point. Or a variation of it. My point is that with this open society, it is very possible that a group of not-well-meaning people can come along and disrupt Wikipedia, keeping well-meaning admins from useful tasks, and causing disturbances in the whole site, eventually leading to its downfall. My little experiment with sockpuppeting has just shown this point. You try to discourage me by putting me to shame. But what if these theoretical vandals <b>have no shame</b>? Then Wikipedia will be as good as gone, and goodbye, free editing. Vandalism is very quickly fixed, but only in small, isolated outbreaks. What if this large group comes along with the intention of harming Wikipedia? They will be much harder to stop because: 1) they have a common goal, 2) they might be able to circumvent the blocks/bans, 3) they will stop at nothing. And given the infinite amount of letter-number permutations, they could do this until Kingdom come. Better be prepared than unprepared, I say. Although I do not know what influence you have in Wikipedia, you could address this situation. Great things began with little ideas in small men, after all. That is all.

<dd>There is always the version history still available so there is always a way to get back to the last good version. And IF Wikipedia comes under such an attack, the developers can set the database to read-only, or disable anonymous edits, or maybe implement the need for a verified email address for account creation. But so far this wasn't necessary, and hopefully won't be necessary in the future, as the <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupedia.html" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a> project died partially due to the very closed user base. BTW: Here's another page for you to read: <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a> <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 16:18, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Understood. But what if these theoretical vandals break the 3RR continously, further disrupting Wikipedia? At least it's comforting to know that the developers can fix this up in case it happens. And by the way, I have been trying to make my point for a long time now, but nobody listened. So I guessed I had to take some drastic action. Tschus - Whowilldothat 16:32, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You'd have received the same answer if you just posted your concern in the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_Pump_1a2c.html" title="Wikipedia:Village Pump">Wikipedia:Village Pump</a>, or maybe the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Wikipedia%7EMailing_list_0943.html" title="Wikipedia:Mailing list">Wikipedia:mailing list</a>, without annoying people and disrupting the site by vandalism. It normally isn't worth to monitor vandals in more detail, except to just revert the damage and give them a warning, as most are just school kids discovering they can put nasty things about their classmates here. And to answer the 3RR question - if an article receives too many reverts it gets <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtected_page_6ebc.html" title="Wikipedia:Protected page">protected</a>, so the combatants have to discuss their problem about it. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 08:22, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 3RR reply: why not protect every page in Wikipedia? Then nobody would be able to edit it and Wikipedia wouldn't be free anymore. Praktisch, oder? But, nobody listens to prophecies until the bad stuff actually occurs. Maybe I'll just sit tight and wait for a giant swarm of vandalbots wrecks Wikipedia. Das wäre SEHR effektiv!

<p>I am unsure why you deleted correct information and left information that is false on the burglary page?</p>
<p>The facts presented on the page that were incorrect:</p>
<p>"Many other U.S. states treat burglary as a more serious crime when it occurs at night; <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, for example, prosecutes nighttime burglary as "burglary in the first degree" and daytime burglary as "burglary in the second degree," under most circumstances."</p>
<p>I pointed out that this information was incorrect so that an innocent person using Wikipedia would not be mislead with false information.</p>
<p>I then added the factual statement:</p>
<p>"Burglary is entering any habitable structure with the intent of A. commiting larceny(theft), whether it be petty or grand, or B. any felony. If there is no intent upon entering the structure, there is no burglary. First degree burglary in California is reserved for any burglary to a residential structure e.g. house, apartment. Second degree burglary is all other types of burglary, e.g. businesses, vehicles, containers."</p>
<p>I am just unsure why my update was deleted, and I was wondering why you would want incorrect information posted on a resource that is relied upon by many people across the globe.</p>
<p>I am a practioner of law, and am certified by the State Bar of California. I feel that the editing you have done is a disservice to the faithful patrons that utilize this great site and that providing unfactual information to your clients is not something they would be fond of.</p>
<p>OK, but note: in the UK the crime, if done during the daytime, is "housebreaking." At night it is "burglary." Or that's the way it was when the terms made a meaningful distinction. Minasbeede 19:29, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
I though so. Astanhope regards as "vicious, hateful, no-value", links from a website with 2 million hits per day &amp; a roster of national columnists. He appears more interested in maintaining a shrine to a politically simpatico soulmate than in disseminating accurate information.</p>

<hr />
<p>The Marla Ruzicka article does not conform to the NPOV principal. The young woman was a political activist, &amp; the article, &amp; external links make little or no mention of her highly debatable political activities. When an external link is added to provide some clarity &amp; balance, it is deleted as "hate speech" &amp; "vandalism". Also deleted are the POV dispute alerts. Clearly someone is interested in maintaining a shrine to Ms Ruzicka, not in disseminating information. Astanhope has deemed that no link to Frontpagemag is to be allowed because it is "fringe" &amp; engages in "hate speech"-- the Frontpage site receives over 2million hits per day, &amp; has some of the most prominent columnists in the country. I don't believe the article is 'neutral', or even fair.</p>
<p>One reason given for excluding the link was "factual inaccuracy" in that it said Ruzicka had been in Iraq prior to the war, with the Code Pink org. Astanhope denied this, &amp; was mistaken Here are 2 sources of confirmation--</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=679085&amp;page=3" class="external free" title="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=679085&amp;page=3" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=679085&amp;page=3</a></p>

<p>--- I am not interested in that article, so please keep your NPOV discussion to the place it belong: <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMarla_Ruzicka_f2d1.html" title="Talk:Marla Ruzicka">Talk:Marla Ruzicka</a>. Please note that I only got involved when you started to vandalize the article, because you did not succeed to get that link into the article, and I only reverted the actual vandalism edits. Everything else is the question wether the article is NPOV, or a allegedly hate-speech link can be included, and needs to be discussed. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:49, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

In case you haven't seen it yet - following you recent stubs on Thai rivers I have created more elaborate version of the Tapi, bang Pa Kong and Pa Sak river, so there's some material for you to translate. Also don't forget to monitor my edits on Dutch, there's probably something to fix for them, e.g. the new disambiguations I created.

<dd>Great, I planned to write about him for quite some time since I learned about his significance after visiting Wat Suan Mok once. But I haven't searched much for sources yet, and as I am no Buddhist I worry to misinterpret his teachings. But the Thai spelling I could find for you: พุทธทาสภิกขุ; uploading Thai script is relatively easy, at least on Windows with Mozilla/Firefox it all works automatically once you have a font for Thai. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 18:50, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These Lithuanian cities never had Polish names in the past.</p>
<p>Adding to explaination: they (the cities in question) never had Polish minorities either. These are attempts by certain indviduals to establish an idea that Lithuania is historically Polish because it was part of Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth I think.

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I note from <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_Delete_f502.html" title="Special:Log/Delete">Special:Log/Delete</a> that you deleted <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Council_of_the_Valleys_a6a6.html" title="General Council of the Valleys">General Council of the Valleys</a>:</p>

11:50, 16 Jun 2005 Ahoerstemeier deleted "General Council of the Valleys" (only external link)

<p>I'd knocked this into a halfway decent stub, and removed the speedy notice; is there any chance you can undelete it, or will it need to go through <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</a>?

<p>hi there. well as far as i know, Rama V is more common that Chulalongkorn or whatever.. in english. what the situation in Thailand is, i am not quite sure. the reason of renaming is simple: before, an article would simply be headed as let´s say for example, "Vajravudh". vajravudh who? the prince? the king? the gardner? the god? so you will probably agree with me, that that can´t work, and most encyclopedia´s won´t list him that way anyways. it has to be more than, "King Vajravudh of Thailand" or something like that... do we agree on that?</p>
<p>regarding the rules you mentioned about naming, i´ve heard it before, but in my humble opinion the naming rules are bull... i don´t know who put those up, but i´m going to go there and discuss it as well. Queen Sirikit is listed as Sirikit Kitiyakara, which makes NO sense whatsoever, even by current Wikipedia rules. then we have a case like "Mary of Teck", who nobody knows who that is. (Answer:Queen Mary I of England. why it´s impossible to list her under that name is a riddle to me). it gets even better: "Marie Antoinette" is listed at the moment under that name, just like in the German version. perfectly fine. according to Wikipedia rules however, she should be listed under her maiden name, that would be "Maria Antonia, Archduchess of Austria". tell me honestly, who knows Maria Antonia? another point, Empress Elisabeth of Austria (Sisi) is currently listed as "Elisabeth of Bavaria". according to Wikipedia rules, she should actually be named "Elisabeth, Duchess in Bavaria". excuse me, but who has ever heard of Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria?</p>
<p>since the Thai kings are monarchs, why should they be listed differently? you can check out the naming rules for monarchs here</p>

<dl>
<dd>The main problem is the Rama something - that is not the common use. E.g. Wyatt's "History of Thailand" as <i>the</i> standard english language history book almost never uses it, it's always "King Mongkut" etc. The "of Thailand" would be necessary if the king have names like "Edward", but there'll never be any other King Mongkut than the one in Thailand. I prefer the simple article titles, thus even skipping the "king" if there is no confusion about it - there's no other "Mongkut" in Thailand. You might also see <a href="../../../b/h/u/Talk%7EBhumibol_Adulyadej_c371.html" title="Talk:Bhumibol Adulyadej">Talk:Bhumibol Adulyadej</a> why that one shouldn't be moved to Rama IX - why treat the current king other than the previous ones? But as I said - maybe it'd be a good idea to discuss this in general how to treat Thai titles, as the "correct" name is a very confusing topic there. But I would suggest to use Wyatt as the guideline. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:33, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Now added it to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28Thailand-related_articles%29_3ca1.html#Article_names_for_Thai_royals.2FThai_with_honorary_titles" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (Thailand-related articles)">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (Thailand-related articles)#Article names for Thai royals/Thai with honorary titles</a> <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:46, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>actually there is controversy as well about the naming of "Bhumipol Adulyadej" because it would signify a slight disrespect towards His Majesty. you can read up on that on the [[Talk:]] page of that article. besides "Mongkut" doesn´t tell a lay person anything, it needs to elaborated, just like "Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom", or "Empress Michiko of Japan" and NOT "Michiko" or whatever. in any case, there need to be better guidelines how to name non-european royals, we need to talk about this to come to a suitable solution.</dd>
</dl>
<p>about the naming of Thai royals, i have always seen both, either " King Rama V" or the personal name. if the majority chooses to use the personal name, then I shall respect that. however the title cannot be simply be "Mongkut" as I pointed out earlier. that is simply not acceptable and is a slight on Their Majesties. comments are more than welcome <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares911_8cd1.html" title="User:Antares911">Antares911</a> 19:17, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Andy,</p>
<p>I guess you know nothing about Siam (Thailand). Would it be better to keep your hand out of our topic and make it confusing for many (not only Thais but for all who know the history). I beg your pardon, you can use many books in library to refer to your knowledge but please dont think by yourself.</p>
<p>I guess if you have any problem of that, you should better leave for others who know better than you ok. You know I am also study Physics and think that this kind of pure science would help you too think more broader and be more systematic.</p>

<p>No, I don't have the Unicode version unfortunately. When I made the graphic versions, I used this Khmer dictionary <a href="http://www.khmerlanguage.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.khmerlanguage.com/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> to display the words I wanted, then I made snapshots of the screen, cut and pasted, voila! On a side note, I thought you might be interested in joining the discussion at the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> article. There is a controversy as to what the exact number of Khmer people living in southern Vietnam is. I put official statistics from the Vietnamese government, but I also put non-government statistics from Khmer exile organizations. Unfortunately, as was predictable, there are lots of angry Vietnamese Wikipedians who just don't want to accept anything BUT official Vietnamese figures. I think in cases of controversies like this one, we should present data coming from all sides, and not just government data. Imagine if at the Tibet article we reported only official Chinese figures, and we didn't report Tibetan exile figures! So anyway, I am the only one defending Khmer figures against many angry Vietnamese Wikipedians, so I thought maybe other people having a look at it would be helpful. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 1 July 2005 23:25 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for contacting me... I guess. The page seems to have been about three sentences long for two years or so. I try to help it out a little and you immediately criticize what I've done in about two days. What are you the Wiki Poleizei? I'll assume you're really a nice guy, just temporarily too full of your own importance. Happens to the best of us.</p>
<p>Sorry I forgot to sign the above. And, having received your apology, I am sorry that I snapped at you as well.</p>
<p>But you ought to give folks a chance before you criticize the earliest stages of what I hope will be an ongoing effort. You did have nearly two years yourself during which, ahem, not much got done. So your first "directive" went down a little hard, Herr Professor Doktor Hoerstemeier. Made me feel as though you were the "enforcer" for the self-appointed Thai mafia which feels it "owns" the Wikipedia Thailand related pages, as pictured at the "Wikipedia Meetup in Thailand"...</p>
<p>Well I'll start again. Thanks for saying hello. As I understand it you are free to obliterate my work if you feel it is not up to the mafia's standard.</p>

<p>hallo Ahoerstemeier. well i would like to ask you the same question, why are you so fixated in getting rid of the royal titles? I really don´t understand it. why for european royalty is it ok to write <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Alexandra_of_Edinburgh_f512.html" title="Princess Alexandra of Edinburgh">Princess Alexandra of Edinburgh</a> or <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales_d703.html" title="Diana, Princess of Wales">Diana, Princess of Wales</a>, but in Thailand and the rest of world it has to be <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chulabhorn.html" title="Chulabhorn">Chulabhorn</a> or <a href="../../../s/r/i/Srirasmi.html" title="Srirasmi">Srirasmi</a>? and please don´t point out to me the Wikipedia rules on naming royals "it does not apply to eastern civilizations", i mean sorry, i just cannot buy that. because some of the rules are just dogmatic and don´t make much sense sometimes. btw. the Princess Mother in that case would have to remain under that current name and not her maiden name, because apparently the naming-rule for dead queen consorts does not apply to eastern civilizations. current queen consorts are named with their titles, but <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Sirikit_of_Thailand_b5fd.html" title="Queen Sirikit of Thailand">Queen Sirikit of Thailand</a> has to be known as <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirikit_Kitiyakara_3176.html" title="Sirikit Kitiyakara">Sirikit Kitiyakara</a>.</p>
<p>what? i have lived in Thailand myself and i know that nobody there calls her that officialy, it would actually be offensive. and the Princess Chulabhorn is known internationally and in english in Thailand as that, "Princess Chulabhorn" and certainly not just Chulabhorn.</p>
<p>and yes i have already heard the argument that there is only one princess Chulabhorn and no other and therefore it is completely unnecessary etc etc... and i can only say to that, yes maybe for the Thailand-expert and insider this might be the case, i also know who she is obviously. but put yourself in the position of someone who is using Wikipedia for the first time. what is he supposed to do with an article-heading of "Srirasmi"? and what would be the problem by simply adding "Princess" to it? is that so difficult or so horrible? i really don´t understand it.</p>
<p>i mean we can go on and on about this. what i didn´t like is that you would simply move the articles, without consulting anyone about this first, since there are not even clear rules regarding this. if the rules would be clear, i would accept them. so if you want we can gladly discuss the issue, but just please stop moving the articles I created and renaming them, because it´s really tedious to put it back again the way it was. i´ve tried moving it back, but obviously that was not possible sometimes because you (or someone else) moved it just like that. thank you... <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares911_8cd1.html" title="User:Antares911">Antares911</a> 20:16, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As was said over and over again - there are many royals named Diana or Alexandra, so there has to be the disambiguation with the country. I simply want the article title to be as simple as possible, and as long as EB and Encarta don't need to add royal titles in their article titles why do we have to. And why noone of the Thai people who edited here so far had any problem with the location of the article? Of course, if I ever meet any of those royals I would adress them in the appropiate way. And especially the elder royals had not one title, but many, so the article title would be blown up to many screen lines.</dd>
<dd>But I am tired of the moving back-and-forth as well - I try to keep the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Thailand-related_topics_8c76.html" title="List of Thailand-related topics">List of Thailand-related topics</a> up to date, to monitor changes and notice vandalism in these articles, and changing the location of the articles almost daily is a nonsense task. But notice, I haven't moved them back last time but <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">User:Arrigo</a>, and it was him who added something to the editing history of the redirects which made you use the wrong moving way.

<dd>yes i´ve heard you, and i know what <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">User:Arrigo</a> did. i never said that we have to include all the titles in the article heading, those are not my words and that would be ridiculous, because you can put that in the article itself. and i have already said that i am aware about the argument about there being only one "Srirasmi" or whoever and i´m getting tired of this as well. however <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">User:Adam Carr</a> created an article as well title <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Tipangkorn_Rasmichoti_d0de.html" title="Prince Tipangkorn Rasmichoti">Prince Tipangkorn Rasmichoti</a> and that was moved without discussion. i find it very ironic, that other users can simply move articles by whim, and when someone tries to restore it by moving it, it obviously does not work, and on top get accused of violating rules. the person should have posted a discussion in the first place, so that alone was already a violation of Wikipedia policy. we can have a discussion about naming rules, but there are no clear guidelines at the moment. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares911_8cd1.html" title="User:Antares911">Antares911</a> 22:14, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Ahoerstemeier,</p>
<p>I would like to bring to your attention the activities of user: kennethtennyson and JD (whom i suspect are one and the same). The gist of my complaint is that their activities involve the constant alteration of material on the Wikipedia page for Kalaripayattu, the indian martial art system.</p>
<p>There has been a long held belief that Kalari is strongly linked to Shaolin and the various chinese martial art systems and Wikipedia has been instrumental in providing a channel for Indian and Non indian individuals to provide evidence to support this connection. However due to the open policy of Wikipedia, the page in question has become the arena for a few Chinese individuals who are resistent to this fact to stage attempts at quelling this school of belief.</p>
<p>These individuals are cearly intent on altering the material and stifling whatever information that is brought forth to reveal an existing connection between the Indian and Chinese martial art systems. I am distressed at this fact because Wikipedia has given us an opportunity to provide information in an area that has been shrouded in doubt for much too long and we are unable to provide the existing evidence due to the bigotry of a few individuals.</p>
<p>I am certain that Wikipedia administrators are unable to intercede in an event like this, but I wish for advice on a course of action to cease in what is likely to be an unending editing war. 02:08, 5 August 2005 (+0800hrs)</p>

<p>Dear Ahoerstemeier,</p>
<p>I would first like to point out that Kennethtennyson and I are not the same person. The martial arts are merely where his interests and mine intersect. A quick check of our respective histories should clear that up. He has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bodhidharma&amp;diff=19615133&amp;oldid=19608814" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bodhidharma&amp;diff=19615133&amp;oldid=19608814" rel="nofollow">reverted</a> some of my edits and I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shaolin_%28martial_arts%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=19691026" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shaolin_%28martial_arts%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=19691026" rel="nofollow">qualified</a> some of his, but he has always been respectful in his exchanges with me.</p>
<p>In contrast, "Oliver", who calls himself "Morfeen" on <a href="../../../k/a/l/Talk%7EKalarippayattu_0946.html" title="Talk:Kalarippayattu">Talk:Kalarippayattu</a>—a quick check of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=202.156.2.162" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=202.156.2.162" rel="nofollow">his history</a> will show that they share the same IP (202.156.2.162) and, as far as I can tell, do not use a Wikipedia username, at least not the same one consistently—takes umbrage whenever anyone challenges the assertion that Shaolin comes from <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalarippayattu.html" title="Kalarippayattu">kalarippayattu</a>. I had placed content on the page (now restored and protected) that cited sources which questioned that claim, material which 202.156.2.162 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kalarippayattu&amp;diff=20348350&amp;oldid=20272267" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kalarippayattu&amp;diff=20348350&amp;oldid=20272267" rel="nofollow">replaced</a> with the following POV screed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the advent of the internet, there are many hypotheses about various subjects masquerading as facts and/or academically accepted theory. The disguise hiding the proponents' biases and agendas. The intent is to create a lie that is spread so widely and repeatedly the propaganda is popularly accepted as truth. These are often complicated when one propaganda is argued against another, so it seems like the truth is between either lie when neither is true. Kalaripayattu is one of these subjects. Kalaripayattu is an Indian martial art, and a claim has been made that it is the origin of the martial arts traditions of Asia, and it was transported to China by Bodhidharma. This has been strongly refuted by those who have a bigotted bias against India and those who have nationalist agendas that precludes any idea that any cultural art is the result of an import, as if somehow that would degrade the art or the country and it's artists.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some have gone so far to claim that Bodhidharma did not exist simply because there are no surviving historical, as in written, records in India, whereas there are numerous records of him in China and Japan. This argument is logically ridiculous, there are in fact no historical records of Hsuan-Tsang or Xuan Zang, the famous Chinese Buddhist pilgrim who travelled to India, in India itself. Yet, he provides one of the most important and accurate histories of India used by British scholars centuries later to rediscover sites in India lost from use with the decline of Buddhism. Buddhism's importance in historical records in India had almost been erased and subsumed into the Hindu tradition. Regardless of the logical fallibility of the argument, one would not really expect Indian historical records of a monk who made his mark in China and did not return to India. On the internet, propagandists disclaiming his existence remark that historical record of Bodhidharma did not exist until centuries after his death. Yang Xuanzhi describes Bodhidharma in the earliest surviving mention of him in "The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Lo-yang", a 547 Chinese text. Yang tells of meeting Bodhidharma at the monastery of Yung-ning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, propagandists claim there is no record of Bodhidharma coming from the south of India. Several texts in China do exactly that including "Xu Gao Sen Zhuan" by Dao Xuan, which is a 120 years or so after Bodhidharma's death though it largely copies earlier texts--T'an Lin's "Biography" and Bodhidharma's own "Two Entrances" from the first two sections of the "Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices" discovered in tens of thousands of manuscripts in a hidden chamber of the Tun-huang or Dun-huang caves in northwest China. The differences in Dao's text in that he uses Yang's description of Bodhidharma's age and a route to China by sea. The texts describe Bodhidharma's birth in the modern southern Indian state of Kerala around 440 during the Pallavas' rule. He is told to be a clan prince in a poor hunter class and was well versed in martial arts. Since the region is the area where martial arts are practiced to this day, the martial art of Kalaripayattu is connected to the martial arts that Bodhidharma practiced by many martial artists Indian and Chinese and Japanese, or other ethnicities, but to essentially describe the development of Oriental tradition of martial arts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Propagandists claim that "Hindutva" scholars and historians are the only ones who propose these ideas, but clearly these ancient contemporary texts could hardly be described as "Hindutva", they were Buddhist and to do so would be anachronistic to attribute an unassembled ideology several centuries into the past. Furthermore the claim that the origin of the Oriental tradition of martial arts coming from India is made by Chinese and Japanese martial artists, who could hardly be described as "Hindutva" idealogues. A book by Terence Dukes, or Shifu Nagaboshi Tomio, an ordained teacher and Buddhist monk initiate of the Ryushinji Temple in Okinawa, Japan, studies the development of martial art forms from China to Japan and from India to China and also traces the corresponding transfer of Buddhism and ancient Indian knowledge like Sanskrit texts ("The Bodhisattva Warriors: The Origin, Inner Philosophy, History and Symbolism of the Buddhist Martial Art within India and China").</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All of this comes with the notion that any transfer of martial arts from region to region was accompanied by the transfer of Buddhism. Although there was much cultural exchange as Buddhism travelled through Asia from India, this does not preclude cultural exchanges that occured prior to the advent of Buddhism along the already thriving silk roads and other exchange routes. Much of the preconceived notions about Oriental martial arts come about from the assembled stereotype of the current situation of martial arts and films; in which, Buddhism is also associated with China and Japan and not India regardless of Buddhism's origin and once flourishing in India.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since most traditional martial arts in the Orient including India are based on a tradition of masters, regions, schools and forms can be studied as they have been by scholars like Terence Dukes, one could compare Kalaripayattu traditions and Chinese traditions and Japanese traditions to find some sort of definite answer to whether or not India was an origin of martial arts in other countries. In a country like India, where there are few recorded historical works describing ancients times that we know surprisingly much about, it's important to rely on archaelogical evidence and other means of scholarship. After all, one of the world's most important historical works the Bible is filled with legends, by most people's definitions, and written a few centuries after the crucial events described within.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kalaripayattu could credibly claimed to be older than the 13th century. If not, then neither can many of the historical assumptions most serious academic theory holds true. One does not date Jesus Christ by when the Bible was physically written. Also, I am not clear at what the earlier editor is describing about the "Hundred Years War" and the Cheras and the Cholas. The Hundred Years War was fought between France and England. Maybe the editor was claiming that since the war between Southern Indian dynasties of the Cheras and the Cholas (and the Pandyas and Pallavas--the dynasty described in Indian and Chinese histories and in Chinese historical texts as the dynasty to which Bodhidharma was born under) lasted more than a hundred years it means that anything associated with the war is false also. Such a logical step is false, the wars between Southern Indian dynasties lasted several centuries and regardless how long the wars last, that would not prove or disprove that kalaripayattu existed during the wars or before the wars. The historical text by Pillai connects the origin of kalaripayattu to the wars between the Southern Indian dynasties that would make it existing during the early part of the first millenium. Regardless of if Kalaripayattu existed in India early on, it's clear from archaelogical evidence and the Vedas, the Hindu's religious texts (one of the world's oldest literatures), that martial arts existed from the earliest times, as the warrior caste is tied to martial arts training under gurus. Also in the earliest Vedic texts, the importance of wrestling to male status is described, corroborated by what Greek historical records say Alexander the Great and his armies found and admired. (Though not mentioned in any written historical record from that time in India. One would have to discount Greek and Roman histories to make this any significant evidence about martial arts in India.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I will not say that India is the origin of martial arts of China and Japan, etc. even though Chinese and Japanese sources say as much. Shaolin monks in China relate how Bodhidharma brought martial arts and how they used these arts to survive brutal imperial repression and dacoitry. The Shaolin Temple in China contains fresco murals with dark-skinned, not black, but similar in skin tone to Indians, monks teaching ostensibly Chinese monks fighting forms. On the mural that survived three fires between 1644 to 1927, it says in Chinese script "Tenjiku Naranokaku" translating as "the fighting techniques to train the body [which come] from India . . ." Likewise, Zen Buddhists in Japan and other Japanese martial artists also trace martial arts to India. It may very well be a legendary narrative that a single Indian brought martial arts to China though reflecting a true transfer of martial arts from one country to another. History is full of legends borne out to have truth, like the discovery of Troy by Heinrich Schliemann. Or it might be a legend connecting countries in bonds of brotherhood that do not exist. Either way there is no definite or clear answer in historical (written) records that would settle the issue ie. clearly say Bodhidharma brought "Kalaripayattu" to China and start martial arts traditions; although from the sum total of evidence--oral histories and the transfer of other arts along trade routes, one is more inclined to believe at least some transfer of knowledge occured given the same academic inferences made in other cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever the case, propagandas and controversies will ensue. Especially in light of upcoming films's like Jackie Chan's The Myth (which features a Kalaripayattu artist along with the beautiful Bollywood starlet Mallika Sherawat) and rivalries of the two great emerging nations of China and India--or at least a supposed rivalry by outside observers and misguided nationalists. A supposed rivalry ignore current cooperative efforts by both countries--recent 2005 joint military exercises, a joint oil purchasing effort, etc. And to extend any modern rivalry to ancient martial arts would be a futile anachronistic exercise that ignores the ancient historical record and archaelogical evidence of many tribes and kingdoms that moved between both regions in which Central Asia also played an important role along trade routes.</p>

<p>Is this the sort of material that belongs in a Wikipedia article?</p>
<p>In addition to the blatant POV, the author brazenly and consistently misrepresents the works he cites in support of his views by claiming they say things that they do not (e.g. the year and kingdom into which Bodhidharma was born) or making omissions of the inconvenient (e.g. Yang Xuanzhi's identification of Bodhidharma as Persian, Terence Dukes' dating of kalari to c. 1200).</p>
<p>There is one final, additional thing that 202.156.2.162 gets wrong.</p>

<p>Heya! Thanks for adding the info on <i>Mirza zaza</i> and <i>Microcebus lehilahytsara</i>. Where did you run across the info? I was able to find the authors' paper describing the new guys, but I'd love to be more well informed about such events. I also note that the paper assumes the existance of <i>Microcebus simmonsi</i>, which I hadn't heard of before either.

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>It seems you are the only admin around the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a> article, and things aren't getting any better. See <a href="../../../r/o/m/Talk%7ERomania_3901.html" title="Talk:Romania">the talkpage</a> too.</p>
<p>I'm trying to pull out of the article, but most of the Romanian editors seem to be pissed off or too busy elsewhere, while the vandals don't seem to be giving up anytime soon, so either a block or a vprotect would be greatly needed IMO. My understanding is that you are not supposed to do either, once you have taken sides, but you'll likely know another sysop whom you can ask to help out.</p>
<p>If you've got no time for this now, and there's a different / better way to handle this, please give me some instructions - last time I reported vandalism on <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a> there was next to no effect.</p>

<dd>Guess you've meant 25km<sup>2</sup> :-) But actually I think km² is better the km<sup>2</sup>, as the latter creates an additional space between the lines due to the bigger height, and thus making the text flow somewhat jumpy. And also it's much easier to type, and does not need any HTML, but just wiki text. On the other hand km<sup>2</sup> is save for non-unicode browsers, but as such a browser will create even more damage with interwiki links they should not be able to edit anymore. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 16:29, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course that's OK. The reason why I did not create such an article for it is simply that there are soooo many editing experiments and other speedy deletion candidates, it's impossible for just one person to check the ligitimate topics and replace the nonsense with correct info. And keeping the editing experiments for legitimate topics isn't good, better keep it a red link and then let's start anew. When I wasn't an admin yet and thus couldn't delete such nonsense texts at legitimate topics, I sometimes also replaced the editing experiments with a stub on the topic. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 16:09, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Reading other people's mail is fascinating. I edited the Macombs Dam Bridge article to include a historical note about the 9th Av el. The bridge leads to <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankee_Stadium_25aa.html" title="Yankee Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a>, by the way.</dd>

<p>As you have done work with some monarchies, please take a look at this too. There's been a huge fuss lately over whether articles on Hawaii's monarchs are in the right location and there are some people who'd like to change the format used in naming the articles (e.g. one user wants to move the article <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamehameha_I_f766.html" title="Kamehameha I">Kamehameha I</a> to <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamehameha_I%2C_King_of_Hawaii_6e92.html" title="Kamehameha I, King of Hawaii">Kamehameha I, King of Hawaii</a>.

<p>Ok,we can disagree.But if i get a response from that person agreeing with the article,can you re-instate it???It really isnt offensive.If you disagree to that request,then i will drop my case and leave you alone</p>
<p>(As a neutul in this Cathal scandal can I add my opinion? The article to me was harmless fun poked at Cathal, who no doubt would appreciate the light hearted banter and almost romantic notion of someone createing an entry in his honour. Surely if the man himself can accept that, and goes on record of accepting that, there is no harm here?)</p>

<p>Surely however the article was providing no harm? It was a a toungue in cheek biography, what this is built in. I cannot really see why it's remaining undeleted would in any way undermine the website or it's readers.
