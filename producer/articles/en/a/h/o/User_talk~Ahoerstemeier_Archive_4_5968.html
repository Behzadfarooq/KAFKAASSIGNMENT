<p>Hi, why should a pattern that works perfectly for other Swedish, Dutch, Italian places not work for German places? Greetz, Sunny.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe this is best discussed at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_German_districts_4f26.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject German districts">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject German districts</a>. I just think they are not really needed, and especially in Bavaria with 80 districts they are way too big to be useful. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 22:12, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If Nena was an unique name that only one individual possessed I believe I would agree with the word linking simply to her but it doesn't take long to find more people with the name, and even reading the original article itself states that her original name was not <a href="../../../n/e/n/Nena_Kerner_32b1.html" title="Nena Kerner">Nena</a>. I'm sorry if my major edits caused any of an uproar but I do believe it's unfair to other individuals that have the same name to have the name link straight to her. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadra23_8ed3.html" title="User:Quadra23">Daniel</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>But if 99% of the times someone says Nena means the singer, then it is enough to guide to the alternative meanings as it was done originally. I have no idea how much well-known these two organizations are, at least for me I have never heard of them.

<p>You asked to have your user page deleted at Wikinfo. But that page did not actually exist there until you edited it. When you went there, it presented you with a copy of the Wikipedia user page that is provided by Wikipedia in XML format. That page did not actually exist in the Wikinfo database until you changed it and saved it there.24.144.15.243 13:55, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, but it <b>looked</b> like it existed there, so I haven't checked in depth why it may not be really there. Having such a copy I could accept/expect for articles, but not for user pages. And I only stumbled upon it as it was linked from google, so that even more made it look like I am a contributor to WikInfo. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 14:01, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When you edit your user page on Wikipedia it says right under the save page button that it is released under the GFDL and in bold letters says DO NOT SUBMIT COPYRIGHTED WORK WITHOUT PERMISSION. If its released under GFDL its fair game. Even so, its not a habit of anyone to copy useless Wikipedia user pages over to Wikinfo. I think Fred Bauder has copied a couple to get some text out of them but its not a real big practice to copy Wikipedia user pages since they serve no real purpose there.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If it is the opinion of most Wikipedia folks that user pages should not be released under GFDL then Wikipedia should remove the notice from the page, remove the notice under the save page button, and stop exporting user pages via XML. Wikinfo would not have been able to import the article if Wikipedia were not exporting it. The XML import/export was done by MRM Parrott as a convenience. It does not discriminate between any Wikipedia articles, it only checks to see if Wikipedia offers them up or not. If not, no import.</dd>

<p>You MUST KNOW the auschwitz facility tour is a total lie. Has it not been debunked?</p>
<p>cmon... I stopped editing the other page just so you wouldn't have to argue me there.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I only know there are few who believe it is a lie. The vast majority believe it is the truth - and I belong to that majority. Thus as long as you modify the article to state only the minority view it will get changed back - but as we have the <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> policy there is absolutely no problem with adding descriptions about the Holocaust denials, as long as it stays neutral and not claims that the Holocaust did not happen. Thus "Auschwitz is a lie" is unacceptable, however "A minority around of people Z√ºndel deny the Holocaust" is no problem. You might have noticed that I wasn't the only one who reverted your changes, or tried to make them NPOV.</dd>
<dd>BTW: Discussions about articles belong into the talk pages associated with the articles, not into the article themself. You can use the link "Discuss with article".

"A supremacist -- of whatever race -- is distinct from a 'separatist.' A separatist may believe that his race is superior to other races in some or all characteristics, but this is not his essential belief. The separatist is defined by his wish for freedom and independence for his people. He wishes them to have their own society, to be led by their own kind, to have a government which looks out for their interests alone. The separatist does not wish to live in a multiracial society at all, so he naturally has no desire to rule over other races -- since such rule necessitates the multiracial society the separatist wants to avoid at all costs.</p>
<p>A supremacist, in contrast, demands a multiracial society, since it is the supremacist's express wish that he dominate or rule over other races in such a society, such rule often being justified by a doctrine of racial superiority."</p>

You really do have no business "mis-re-directing" any NPOV article to only a POV one, whatsoever!</p>
<p>I have stated my position about insisting upon the Wiki NPOV in many "talk pages", and you and your own biased POV ilk always still mis-re-direct or you revert, and always without any rational nor any truthful rationale, whatsoever!</p>

<dd>Yes, enough cluttering the editing history with reverts and back-reverts. If you don't see the pattern that the majority here thinks your addition is POV then I cannot help you. Maybe you should take a look at <a href="http://wikinfo.org" class="external free" title="http://wikinfo.org" rel="nofollow">http://wikinfo.org</a>, which is similar to wikipedia but which less focus on NPOV. Maybe you can get your changes alive there. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 16:05, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
The "pattern" here is only that the Wiki NPOV is actually NOT being upheld by either the likes of you or by your "minority" or Marxist-PC "majority" ilk of POV dogmatic censors and POV bigots. How, specifically, is that article NOT any NPOV verses any POV that is non-factual? Curious.</p>

And that'll be sometime near the end of this year. Only other use is to give a reference for the numbers here. I am not sure if I asked it before - does that book have any historic population numbers as well - I could find some at the census website, but they are incomplete, and to make it worse are not the same I have in a book on country subdivision in general (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0786407298</a>). <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 15:28, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>I want to invite you to weigh in at the new discussion of related matters that have come up in the last few days at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28places%29_95c3.html#Transliteration_of_Russian_place_names" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (places)">Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_(places)#Transliteration_of_Russian_place_names</a>. Please see the intro paragraph of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Yeltsin_b37f.html" title="Boris Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a> to see an example of what's been going on with articles on Russians and places in Russia....</p>
<p>Also, if you haven't already do so, you might want to take a look through Cantus's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;hideminor=0&amp;target=Cantus&amp;limit=250&amp;offset=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;hideminor=0&amp;target=Cantus&amp;limit=250&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">contributions</a>.</p>
<p>Right now, the main participants in the discussion are the two people who've been changing the formats of intro paragraphs of articles -- both of whom have been here for less than a month and seem rather uninterested in other people's points of view.

<p>Hello Andy, I finally finished with all of the Thai provinces on the Dutch wiki. So you can take current population from there and put them on the en wiki. Saisombun is not a special zone anymore, according to ISO updates it is now a province. Sawasdee kap, <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 09:21, 10 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks. But are you sure about Saisombun - the last of the ISO3166-2 updates which mentions Laos is issue 4, and in that it corrects a mistake in update 2, where Saisombun was first announced, but as a province. BTW: can you check if I did the drawing of the boundary of Saisombun correctly? My base map did not include it, and on the web there were only contradicting or bad maps with it. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 09:37, 10 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>==What I have heard now here in Laos is that the previous saisombun special area has been devided into two parts: the west belongs now to vientiane province and the east to the province where Phonsavanh is the capital (forgot its name)</p>

<p>Hi, any thoughts on the best way of linking from each Thai province to its capital? A reference in the text, or a disambiguation notice at the top of the page? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkalexander100_03f8.html" title="User:Markalexander100">Markalexander100</a> 08:28, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not sure myself. The link from the province to the city is rather clear - it has the link in the fact box, and it also can have another link in the Amphoe list for the Amphoe Mueang. However it is a bit more difficult for the city - e.g. when Kalasin is said without <i>changwat</i> or <i>mueang</i> before it can both mean the province or the city, but in most case it doesn't matter as especially historically both were essentially the same. In <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalasin.html" title="Kalasin">Kalasin</a> you can find a small disambiguation header guiding to the province, for other cities, e.g. <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surat_Thani_ef4e.html" title="Surat Thani">Surat Thani</a> I skipped it - as at least for me the bare name more refers to the city. Only for Ayutthaya and Sukhothai I made a real disambiguation page, as those names also refer to the periods of thai history.</dd>
<dd>We just should try to keep it consistant. How about having the small disambiguation header for the small provincial cities, but skip it for the bigger ones more well-known outside Thailand? Those will have the link to the province in the text anyway. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 08:44, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Copying my comment I just posted to your talk:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Granted, there <i>may</i> be prostitution in that park, maybe even by underaged prostitutes, but that isn't the most defining fact about that park for sure. There are many more appropiate topic - when was it established, now big is it, does it have any noteworthy plants only present there and nowhere else in Ireland. If that article grew beyond stub level even a short sentence like "Prostitution is a problem in the park, making it an unsafe place at night" would be much more fitting then making a kind of ad where to find underaged prostitutes. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:11, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Thank you for your advice, I never meant it to be an advertisment for child prostitution, in fact i wanted it to be the exact opposite, to warn people that there are dangers of this park. This was mearly meant to be an addition of facts about Donard Park, for example you want want to point out the dangers of climbing Mount Everest but you would still be advertising to masochists, it is impossible not to make something an advantage or an attraction to someone in the world. 217.33.82.4 13:12, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p><b>I do not agree</b>. I feel it is sad that you still do not want to highlight the problem of child prostitution scine it is a far more serious matter than prostitution by adults. Children in many cases are forced into doing it and are unable to escape the trap. By just saying to people 'Prostitution' they will just think it is another sleazy area but infact a far bigger problem needs to be tackled. One that includes capturing paedophilles and the runners of the illegal trade of children. 217.33.82.4 13:28, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a thin line. In my perception mentioning "child" in that article will make it sound like an ad for pedophiles, while if it is just meant to be a warning for tourists "prostitution" would be more than enough. And don't forget this is an encyclopedia, so we cannot solve the problem of child abuse, that is the responsibility of the law enforcement. Instead of argueing about that part, you should better focus on improving that stub into a better article, in its current state it is nearly worthless. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 13:37, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course, in the map it is present - but I made up the table from a table in the book, while the map is from the map on the first page of the book. But as the table lists the provinces which were present at the creation of the monthon, it might be possible that Khon Kaen was split off from another one before 1915 - but I doubt it as provinces were merged at that time. BTW: that is one of the missing facts I mentioned, as I still don't have the complete overview of provinces present around 1900. Of course I saw a lot of stuff you created yourself, but sadly my dutch isn't good enough to translate it to english - usually I can guess the topic and the main points, but not enough details to trust my translation. The kings of Thailand are also on my list of topic I can write something about, but maybe the next bigger thing I will do is to continue with the national and historical parks. There are sooo many open things in this topic I am sure we both won't run out of topics for some years. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 13:24, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe we can do some cross fertilization. I am good with kings ..... . But natural and historic parks ...... nah anything biological or cultural are my weak points. I will start on the Thai kings eventually, I will do them in English and Dutch, you can then format/spellcheck them and translate them to German. If you concentrate on other subjects we do not have to do double work. Only thing is I cannot guarentee when I will start with the Thai kings as I am still busy sorting out Laotian ones. Some had only 2 or 3 day reigns! But I put all of them in there as I like to be as precise as possible. We can also split up the list of kings. I am really looking for the official reign names. I have finally found the ones for Rama I till Rama IV and I have the ones for all of the Laotian kings. But the Thai ones..... I have searched geanology sites and found reign names for many kings and queens in the region, but none for Thai kings. And yes only on Thailand we can probably create 100.000+ topics. The country has 76.XXX villages if I am not mistaken. <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 14:06, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That are some good ideas on how we can get more effective on covering the Thai topics multilingual. Maybe we should include the german user <a href="../../../../de/m/e/d/Benutzer%7EMedia_lib_4f22.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer:Media_lib">Media_lib</a> who did most of the Thailand articles in the german wikipedia - did you know he's in Thailand now as well? So far I haven't written much on the german wikipedia, nor did I translate much from there - I most like to create articles by researching them myself. But of course some translation, cleanup and spellcheck is fine as well.</dd>
<dd>I am sorry I cannot help you with the royal names of the thai kings, the only book on Thai history I have so far lacks tables, and uses only the short names for the kings. I have to look for a second such book next time I visit there - maybe the one by Wyatt should be good source? Do you know the <a href="http://www.siam-society.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.siam-society.org/" rel="nofollow">Siam Society</a> - they have a big library where you'd quite certainly find what you search. I haven't been there yet, I just noticed their existance when I out of curiosity bought a reprint of a 1904 book made by them.</dd>
<dd>For the 76.xxx villages - did you notice I already started with one very minor town when I created an article about <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaiya.html" title="Chaiya">Chaiya</a>? Luckily it has a lot of history, otherwise I would have had problems writing something about the hometown of my mother-in-law&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>And of course it was my mistake that Khon Kaen was missing in that monthon... <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 23:35, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I am still thinking what to write about my gf's village: Baan Nam Sum noi, small village of about 500 inhabitants in nam som district of Udon thani, the population consists mainly of farmers ..... I wanna make a bet if I put that on the English wikipedia as my first full article here it will be deleted in no time. They are very very picky here. That is why I choose to work on the Dutch one only. Maybe I'll give it a try ..... <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 19:02, 20 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I kinda mix my contributions btw, depending on my mood. I do not have a phone line at home, so I write the articles mainly at my home, I keep copies of the most current versions at my pc at home, and then I go to the internetcafe to upload them. It just depends on my mood, sometimes I copy 20 pages from the english wiki, or German (i translated all the Luxemburg entries in Dutch) and just translate them. More often I type in a search word on google, take all the text from the webpages, look for a corresponding book or 2 on the topic and start writing down all the facts (they are free of copyright!) and voila I have a whole string of new articles, I found reignnames of different kings that way. Especially the genealogy sites are great.</dd>
<dd>I pass the Siam society almost every day, I still want to go there. It is a short busride, but somehow I never get around to go there . <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 19:08, 20 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you happen to visit Siam Society tell me if it's worth - I plan to visit on my next stay in Thailand, but then time always runs so fast and so much things to visit. For the Lanna kings the <i>Chiang Mai chronicles</i> (have to look for ISBN at home) might be interesting, but maybe just the two tables listing the kings are the ones you want to have. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 12:49, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am using the one suggested in the palette at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Maps_d040.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Maps">Wikipedia:WikiProject Maps</a>. For marking cities it is IMHO a good color, for areas it feels a bit dark for me as well - but maybe we better discuss it in the Wikiproject. But changing the color again would be a bit annoying, I was just preparing most of the provinces of Thailand for upload... <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 20:44, 25 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I'm using the one shown in the sample maps on that page. I'm not asking you to change any existing ones - obviously mapping new areas is a far greater priority, but I was wondering if this dark-on-bright to highlight was a particular preference of yours (cf the maps of Brazil etc). However it is a bit silly we are uploading maps that are in a nearly identical colour scheme but not quite. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> 20:48, Mar 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess they are well known in Thai media, but that one not that easy to follow here - especially without being able to read Thai. I usually read the 2bangkok.com website, however that one focuses mostly on BKK politics, especially on mass transit. And it's just 4 years now I learn about Thailand, but focusing on history and culture so far. If I were living there it'd be different for sure, then I'd be much more up-to-date with current politics as well as some gossip.</dd>
<dd>Something unrelated: I finished with copying the population data into my big excel sheet, but noticed that for Bangkok you still used a 2001 number. And do you have the number for the complete country, so I can check at least that the sum of all provinces is the correct, to spot any obvious typos by you or me. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 15:12, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)
