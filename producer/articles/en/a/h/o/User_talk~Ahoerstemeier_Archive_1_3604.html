<p>Hello, I've seen your new articles about <a href="../../../m/a/e/Maerkischer_Kreis_e71d.html" title="Maerkischer Kreis">Maerkischer Kreis</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemer%2C_Germany_59a5.html" title="Hemer, Germany">Hemer, Germany</a>. I don't know if you plan to add more articles on German towns and districts; if so, that would be great, since your contributions are really good, and my progress in adding this stuff is quite slow. Just a little remark: We don't have to name articles <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemer%2C_Germany_59a5.html" title="Hemer, Germany">Hemer, Germany</a>, if just one Hemer exists on this planet (or is likely to be the only one mentioned in an article). So the title of the article should be just <b>Hemer</b> (and accordingly for the other towns added in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Germany_af6f.html" title="List of cities in Germany">List of cities in Germany</a>).

<p>Hi again, I would like to adopt your idea of stating the names of all towns and municipalities in the district articles. Do you know an internet source, where it is possible to find out, if a place is a town/city or just a municipality, i.e. if it has "city rights"? I just have a written source, which may be somewhat outdated in some cases. (Of course it is possible to find this out on the town's websites themselves, but that is a little bit arduous.) -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a> 20:30 Feb 19, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I usually find them on the webpages of the district itself, in most cases those give all the information I put in the articles. Only rarely I have to check the website of the city/muncipality itself to see how they call themself. Also a source is <a href="http://www.meinestadt.de" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meinestadt.de" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> -- <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 21:18 Feb 19, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, that's what I used to do as well - some district pages do not contain this information, but never mind, somehow we will find the information. I keep off the NRW districts for a short while in order to set up the pages for the other Bundesländer and, maybe, to enlarge the list of cities according to the aim of including every town having "city rights".<br />
I am thinking about setting up a new WikiProject, similar to the Swedish Counties Project. In a <b>WikiProject German districts</b> we could define a template, which includes more details than the current district pages. That does not mean, that we shall begin our entire work anew. My thoughts are unsorted yet, but a district template should include a table with the basic facts, maybe the district's coat of arms and a full list of towns and municipalities. What do you think? If you are interested as well, I would like to set up a WikiProject page, where we can discuss about the template. -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a> 07:16 Feb 20, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will join such a project for sure, even though I most like to spend my energy on the districts and cities near my former and my present hometown&#160;:-) I already started by applying the template you used for the states like <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Rhine-Westphalia_29ea.html" title="North Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a> to <a href="../../../m/a/e/Maerkischer_Kreis_e71d.html" title="Maerkischer Kreis">Maerkischer Kreis</a>. I just added the car license, removed the stuff in the table from the text, put the towns into a list, added the neighboring districts and added some sections into the text. I think only the map can use some improvement now, due to the fact I started with your JPEG version and tried to clean it for PNG it's still not as sharp as it could be. Or did I left out anything you had in mind? -- <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 22:49 Feb 23, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello, that looks absolutely great!! I am too tired now, but tomorrow I will set up the WikiProject according to your template. (Of course you may do it as well, if you want.) I will try to find other participants. Today and yesterday I expanded the remaining Bundesland articles, only Baden-Württemberg and Saarland are not included in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_German_districts_9471.html" title="List of German districts">List of German districts</a> yet. Maybe, I will conclude that tomorrow as well, and then we have nothing else to do than adding those 431 district articles - wait, it's only 430 articles left&#160;;-) BTW, the state template was created by <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJeLuF_9769.html" title="User:JeLuF">JeLuF</a>, not by me. As for the maps, I will create some PNG templates, that we can use instead of the JPEGs, and place them on my user page. -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a> 23:13 Feb 23, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The german maps were created by <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a>, who created <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_German_districts_Maptemplates_f2df.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject German districts/Maptemplates">templates</a> for all federal states - I don't know how he created them however. The Thai map I used for <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surat_Thani_province_9765.html" title="Surat Thani province">Surat Thani province</a> I edited from a map I found in <a href="http://www.german-thai-link.de/Images/Details%20TH/Regions/South/Surat%20Thani.JPG" class="external text" title="http://www.german-thai-link.de/Images/Details%20TH/Regions/South/Surat%20Thani.JPG" rel="nofollow">web</a>, and modified it until it was same style as the ones for germany. If I find a good starting map for other countries I can do the same with them for sure. Another way to create such a map is the <a href="http://www.pangaea.de/Software/PanMap" class="external text" title="http://www.pangaea.de/Software/PanMap" rel="nofollow">PanMap</a> software, a free simple <a href="../../../g/i/s/GIS_715e.html" title="GIS">GIS</a> tool, and it has the vector data for provincial borders there as well. Sadly the one for France does not use the departement borders, but the province border, but for China it seems to be the right borders. -- <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 15:19 Mar 8, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Of course I don't mind, if you add the maps. I didn't in the last time, because on the weekends I work on a different computer (without a graphics tool).

<p>Hi, I wrote the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald_81f5.html" title="Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald">Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald</a> page and like the new standard layout and other additions very much. But I wonder if the list of muncipalities is correct -- as far as I know (and I live there), some five to ten muncipalities have town rights. This includes Breisach, Titisee-Neustadt, Müllheim, Neuenburg and Staufen. -- <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETillwe_4049.html" title="User:Tillwe">till we *)</a> 20:29 Apr 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did that list according to <a href="http://www.breisgau-hochschwarzwald.de/landkreis/staeuge/sgtext.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.breisgau-hochschwarzwald.de/landkreis/staeuge/sgtext.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.breisgau-hochschwarzwald.de/landkreis/staeuge/sgtext.htm</a> - and that list only names Breisach and Neuenburg as "Stadt", all others are listed as "Gemeinde". But you are right and that list must be wrong - I just checked at the website of Staufen, and there they call themself "Stadt" as well. Do you have a list which municipalities are cities? Going through all 50 by checking their websites (if they have one) would be a tedious task. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 20:42 Apr 25, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I don't have such a list. Some of the emails at the URL you quoted start with stadt@ instead of gemeinde@. I'm sure about Staufen, Müllheim and Titisee-Neustadt; it's highly possible that these three plus Breisach and Neuenburg are the only cities. I'll change the page accordingly. -- <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETillwe_4049.html" title="User:Tillwe">till we *)</a> 12:07 Apr 26, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Nice work on the articles. Concerning the Thai national motto, are you sure it's "Land of smiles"? It sounds more like a tourism pitch or a nickname rather than a national motto.</p>

<dd>I'm not sure either - it was added by <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a>. I google'd a bit now, and only found the motto of Laos (just added it there), as well as the joke motto <i>mai pen rai</i> (something like <i>it doesn't matter, it's ok</i>). I'll try to investigate more later. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 15:47 May 13, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My googling unearthed "Nation, Religion, King" as a possible motto. The fact that the tricolor on the Thai flag is meant to represent those things makes it a prime candidate for the motto. It certainly sounds better than the cheesy "Land of smiles" motto anyway. I suspect the motto might be in Sanskrit or Thai, so until I learn those, I can't verify it independently. <a href="../../../e/r/z/User%7EErzengel_d7cd.html" title="User:Erzengel">Erzengel</a> 09:52 May 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I googled with that words now, and found that "Nation, Religion, King" is the official motto of cambodia (see <a href="http://asiarecipe.com/camcons.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://asiarecipe.com/camcons.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, in article 4 of the constitution) - we should remember it when it comes to apply the country template to <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambodia.html" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>. It was also used as political slogan by <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarith_Thanarath_f669.html" title="Sarith Thanarath">Sarith Thanarath</a> in the 1950s, and by several others later, however I cannot find anything yet to prove it's the official motto of the state. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 10:03 May 15, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've done a text search of the English translation of the Thai consitution from the <a href="http://www.krisdika.go.th/" class="external text" title="http://www.krisdika.go.th/" rel="nofollow">Office of Council of State</a> and there appears to be no mention of any official state motto. The constitution I got was dated October 11, BE 2540 (1997 AD), which should be recent enough. You can try your luck there, but the site is really annoying to navigate and uses amateurish javascript ("no copy!"[sic]).</p>

<p>Hi, sorry for answering so late, but I was away for almost a month. Yes, you are correct, there is an error in the Rhineland-Palatinate map. I realised that error myself in the district list, but I forgot to check the map. Unfortunately I do not have the template anymore, but keep patient, I will fix it.

<p>Hi, the problem with the RLP map should be solved now. Unfortunately I could not find my original template, and I was not able to reproduce the original colours. In my opinion it looks better now, but it is slightly different from the other maps of federal states. If you have a magic tool to detect the RGB values of the original colours, then you may tell me. -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a> 13:00 6 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I already fixed it - the original color was #629530. The new color was a bit too dark, it was barely readable - black-on-green isn't a good combination, but at least the old color had a better contrast. And I also reduced the color to 256 which saves about 2k of size. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 13:08 6 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the main problem is that the list in <b>reality</b> is US-centered in the sense that it starts at the premise that the rest of the world have, with your words, censuses to recognize "places worth counting". It would in my opinion have been a totally unannoying example of lists if it refrained from faulty generalizing (by exstending beyond the area for which its idea obviously was originally thought). As a frequent visitor of Finland, and currently living in Scandinavia, I can imagine millions of places inhabited by less than 10 humans, but who cares? No-one counts them, and no-one distinguish places worth counting from places not worth counting. A list of <i>desserted villages</i> in the Netherlands, or of not yet inhabited lakes in some other <i>specific area,</i> would be of quite another magnitude of interest.&#160;:-)))</p>
<p>Please note that I am not in any way concerned by this particular list, but in the existence of lists doing, in my view, ridiculous claims. Particularly lists of openended sets which, as you know, per definition never can be complete. I do not believe such lists ever to become corrected. Particularly not when they've grown to impressive sizes. To make corrections require much more work than to revert the corrections. Compare the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_groups.html" title="List of ethnic groups">List of ethnic groups</a> where plenty of items are dubious in one or another way (<a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliteration</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcription.html" title="Transcription">transcription</a>, confusion of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a> versus <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a>, of inhabitants of present-day entities with historical tribes, of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a> versus <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizenship.html" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a>, etc, etc.). If someone would make corrections or qualifications, it would rather be in the articles, not in the very long lists.<br />

<p>Hi Andy -- I actually <i>did</i> look at the talk page on <a href="../../../o/d/r/Odra.html" title="Odra">Odra</a>. I'm changing it regardless and putting in an explanation. I helped to write the naming conventions (I used to be a wikipedeholic, and am only making a few changes until I can get someone to remove me entirely from the site -- that's another story). The official English name is Oder. That's how it should be. If you want to look at a record of my contributions, you'll see that I'm pretty consistent in things like this -- and that I've often taken the "other side" of the German/Polish issue. I also have argued for using names that are more common in scholarly works, even if not yet in common parlance -- but that is a matter of reflecting a change in customary use, rather than official use. <a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I did only see an edit by an anonymous user (seems like you aren't logged in), and I remember it did take long to get to the consensus about the current naming of the <a href="../../../o/d/r/Odra.html" title="Odra">Odra</a>. Thus I reverted your moving of the contents, as there was absolutely no mention about a reason on the Talk page. I would suggest you wait to move it until after some discussion there, this seems to be a sensible topic for the polish. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 14:50 17 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Did you mean <i>sinnvoll</i>? That's "sensitive", not "sensible". The only reason you missed the explanation is that I was in the middle of working on edits to make the Oder article clearer without making it seem that there is contention over the name. The only point of contention is here -- not in the wider world. In the wider world, people refer to things in their own language or by local names. Here, we try to stick to official English names or widest English-language usage. By looking at the article as I've changed it, it's clear that the river has other names in other languages, and that one might not always see Oder. But it's misleading to imply that the two are interchangeable in English. <a href="../../../j/h/k/JHK_7325.html" title="JHK">JHK</a> not logged in as part of a general protest</p>

<dd>Oups, I hate these false friends. Of course I meant "sensitive" (german <i>sensibel</i>). I have no objections to calling the river Oder, as a german I am more familiar with that spelling anyway. I just worry it will have the same edit war again it had before. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 15:10 17 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the edit war will return for sure. Some months ago I tried to find a compromise, as it seemed to be extremely important for some Polish wikipedians to see that article under the Polish name. The agreement was to place Oder River under its Polish and Oder-Neisse line under its German name - but it has never been fully translated into action, as you can see in various articles. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't make any difference for me, what the river is called - but there was a situation, that many of my own edits were reverted by <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETaw_8bc0.html" title="User:Taw">Taw</a> and co. with comments like "Helga fix" or "reverting revanchism", and all they did was changing "Oder" to "Odra". Since I regard myself as anti-fascist and sensitive to that topic, I was quite upset and got sticked in the dispute. But I decided, that I wouldn't lose anymore time with a stupid naming discussion, if it should come up again.</dd>

<dd>To Julie: When I say "stupid", I don't mean you, but people insisting on calling a place by its "only true name". We have these discussions all over Wikipedia, in articles like <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_of_Japan_4ec4.html" title="Sea of Japan">Sea of Japan</a> (where we now have an article <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dispute_over_the_name_Sea_of_Japan_420f.html" title="Dispute over the name Sea of Japan">Dispute over the name Sea of Japan</a> - probably we should create such an article for the Oder river as well, it would be a new playground for the fundamentalists, where they can let off steam&#160;;-) ). And I am really, really tired of it. Cheers -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a> 08:19 18 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for correcting the break in numbering. Mozilla does that sometimes and I fail to notice. <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a> 18:44 24 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wanted to fix the missing ] you forgot - and after saving I noticed the break. But it wasn't your Mozilla it did it, it was the anonymous edit before which broke it. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 18:48 24 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>
