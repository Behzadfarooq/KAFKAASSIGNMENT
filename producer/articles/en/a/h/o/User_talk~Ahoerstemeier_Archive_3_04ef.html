<dd>Guess what I am doing.

<p>Hey - I just got an email from a legit user who shares an IP you blocked (62.253.96.42) with a vandal (I've since unblocked that address). That's not a big deal - it is regrettable, but it happens. However the person who was blocked had no way to contact you because you do not have an email address set-up in your preferences. So if you want to help us block the IPs of vandals in the future, then it would be very helpful if you set-up a valid email address in your preferences. This will not expose your email address to spammers or even the people who email you (unless you respond to their email).

<dd>Strange, I had given my email their once already. I now re-added it, but I have no idea why it was lost - I even got mail that way before. And just yesterday I also got an email from someone who got the AOL IPs Michael had used before (152.163.253.xx), and I did unban those IPs as well, but seems like that user found my email via the link to my homepage on my user page. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 08:29, 11 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andy - is <i>Adolph Hitler</i> a German spelling? As far as I'm aware the correct spelling is Adolf - but I'm not German. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 15:03, Nov 12, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"ph" is an old spelling of "f" in German which gets more and more uncommon - e.g. <i>Photo</i> is nowadays always written <i>Foto</i>. At Hitler's time it was probably more common to use the ph, but I am not aware that Hitler changed the spelling of his first name - and normally names don't change their spelling. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 15:12, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, you said on Image talk:Manta Ray.jpg today that images can not be deleted, so I thought I'd tell you that now they can, as of about 25 hours ago.

<dd>You're welcome. I found it in a science section of a german online news site (<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/erde/0,1518,274822,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/erde/0,1518,274822,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), I only quoted Nature as the actual source of the news article. Last time I even compiled an article from such a news article - see <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasikabatrachus_sahyadrensis.html" title="Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis">Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis</a>.

<dd>I won't dare call myself a whale specialist/expert, but they are a topic of fascination for me, and I have ended up writing probably half the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cetaceans_0c6b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cetaceans">cetacean</a> articles here, so I will try to scrape out an article on it if you don't beat me to it.

<p>Hello, my name is Walter (waerth on wikipedia.nl). As to your question about Changwat Songkhla. I have been living in Thailand for 4 years and according to my Thai friends here Hat Yai is the capital and not Songkhla. I have to agree that my Thai is not perfect, and I have not found it written anywhere. But then again, Thai statistics ............... . I do use them though for the details like population etc. I will try to make interwiki links myself. Nice to hear from you, good luck. <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 16:37, 28 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's true that Hat Yai is the biggest settlement in the Songkla province, as well as the most popular and well-known one, however e.g. <a href="http://thestar.com.my/services/printerfriendly.asp?file=/2003/9/20/features/songkla.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://thestar.com.my/services/printerfriendly.asp?file=/2003/9/20/features/songkla.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> says: <i>"The following day we made a day trip to Songkla. This seaside town is the capital of Songkla Province, not Hat Yai as many people think."</i>. And my wife also confirms that it's always the <i>Amphoe Mueang</i> which is the one which is the capital. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 22:04, 28 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, as I checked it again with the government district office and indeed, Songkhla is the Amphoe Muang. So far for Thai "folk" wisdom .............. .</dd>

<p>I see you're pluralizing names of general types of salamanders. I had to think about that a while back with common names of fish families, and decided it wasn't a great idea. Although one could argue the plural is appropriate because the term refers to a group of types rather than a single type, it's still the case that in running text we want to able to refer to either one or multiple members of the type without relying on redirs. Almost all general types are singular now; presumably you're not proposing to also change <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frog.html" title="Frog">frog</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammal.html" title="Mammal">mammal</a>, <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snake.html" title="Snake">snake</a>, etc, because like <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lungless_salamander.html" title="Lungless salamander">lungless salamander</a> they designate multiple species? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 22:11, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the taxonomic listing I use to sort those pages they are all listed in plural, and the latin family is plural by itself as well. And it has at least two cases where it has a specific species with the same name as the higher order group (the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mole_Salamander_fdd9.html" title="Mole Salamander">Mole Salamander</a> and Pacific Great Salamander) - so either it needs an article title like Mole Salamander (family) or the plural one. But for now I will keep the simple cases in singular, and post the question in the Wikiproject TreeOfLife - I thought it had a guideline there. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 22:37, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Animal taxa have always been in singular case here. I consider this a good idea. The guideline in German wikipedia to place families in plural case and species in singular case and genera sometimes in plural and sometimes in singular case is often leading to a complete confusion of duplicate articles and inconsistencies. So in my view it is the best solution to place everything in singular case. -- <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBaldhur_abd2.html" title="User:Baldhur">Baldhur</a> 08:53, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think those (common) article names, at least for families should be in plural if possible to avoid problems. Sometimes common names for families are (in singular) the same as a Latin name for a genus like <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agamas.html" title="Agamas">Agamas</a> for <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agamidae.html" title="Agamidae">Agamidae</a> (family) and <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agama.html" title="Agama">Agama</a> (genus).

<dd>I tend to oppose that. Most users will search for the information in the <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agamas.html" title="Agamas">Agamas</a> article; they are probably less interested in a list of scientific species names. Unfortunately they probably won't find the information under <b>Agamas</b>, if they previously searched for <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agama.html" title="Agama">Agama</a>. We have disambiguation pages in order to point users to a page, if family and genus are ambiguous.

One is to blank the nonsense page, then it cannot do so much harm anymore, and it is also quite easy to spot in the <i>New Pages</i> list (if that one isn't disabled due to performance problems). The other even better one is to replace it with {{msg:Dtest}}, then it can be found on the pages which link to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeleted_test_124d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deleted test">Wikipedia:Deleted test</a> - and it also is notable in the new pages as a very short article with just 13 bytes. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 16:21, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Schoene Gruessen aus Kalifornien... Many thanks for providing the species list for Macaca, and the picture. I changed the spelling you'd used (Makaque), because I've never seen that used in English. If you know of a community where it is used, though, we should include it on the page as an alternative - presumably it is a transcription of some non-English word so there is unlikely to be one "right" spelling, if there ever is of any word at all.</p>
<p>Now all we have to do is write the 19 species accounts (no, maybe 2 or 3 are done already). <a href="../../../s/e/g/User%7ESeglea_8627.html" title="User:Seglea">seglea</a> 05:00, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just noticed that I have this photo in my archive and searched for a good article to place it - and then I noticed that the species list was a bit confusing and I tried to clean it up. I hope the source I used for it uses the currently accepted species and the "official" names. I don't know what is the most common english name - according to a online dictionary the german <i>Makake</i> is Macaque in english, which looks like it originally comes from a french word. <i>Macaca</i> is the latin name of the genus. But, well, you are the native speaker... <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 08:42, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, "macaque" is the normal English spelling.

<dd>No, Baden and Württemberg are two different former states of Germany, which were merged around 1950 to form Baden-Württemberg. So both refer to different areas, and thus the Weingarten in Württemberg is a city, the Weingarten in Baden is a much smaller town. And it even has several villages with the same name in other parts of Germany as well - you can find the more complete list in the German wikipedia (<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weingarten" class="external autonumber" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weingarten" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 16:32, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>
