<p>Zemiri arrived in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> in 1994, where he applied for <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refugee.html" title="Refugee">refugee</a> status. His application was rejected on <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_security.html" title="National security">National security</a> grounds in 1996. Nevertheless, he married a Canadian woman, Karina Dereshteanu. After his refugee claim was turned down Zemiri should have been <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deport.html" title="Deport">deported</a>, but he and Dereshteanu lived in Canada until July 2001, when they moved to <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>.</p>

<p>Dereshteanu, was able to flee Afghanistan in November 2001, around the time of <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_in_Afghanistan_%282001%E2%80%93present%29_53f3.html" title="War in Afghanistan (2001–present)">invasion</a>. Zemiri was captured.</p>
<p>Dereshteanu filed an affadavit with a US court where she attested that, to the best of her knowledge, her husband had no ties to terrorism. She reports that bounty hunters sold her husband to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> forces of $5,000 <a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Citizen_8564.html" title="Ottawa Citizen">Ottawa Citizen</a> obtained a copy of Zemiri's <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a>. Zemiri, like approximately half of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay declined to agree to the conditions which would have permitted him to attend his review hearing. So it was held without him.</p>
<p>The tribunal cited his friendship with <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Ressam_607d.html" title="Ahmed Ressam">Ahmed Ressam</a>, and said that Zemiri loaned Ressam $3,500 and some camera equipment, which Ressam used to help him conduct his foiled Millennium bomb plot. Ressam, like Zemiri, was an Algerian expatriate, who lived in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>.</p>

<li><i>"It is not right or just to accuse somebody of something not true."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Ressam explained the incorrect information he had previously offered American <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligence_analysts.html" title="Intelligence analysts">intelligence analysts</a> was because he <i>"was in shock and had a severe psychological disorder<sup id="_ref-Iht070105_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Iht070105" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CanWest070105_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CanWest070105" title="">[5]</a></sup></i> Ressam was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.

<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>There is no record that Zemiri chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.</p>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings.

<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
