<p>The way this poll was conducted was highly objectionable.I voted on one side and found that I ended up being blocked with the unfair explanation being given that I was a 'sockpuppet'. Not just me, but all those who voted in the same way, ended up being blocked and having their votes removed. This seems to have been a coordinated move on the part of those with more rights than others.Did anyone bother to check whether these voters whose votes were removed were legitimate, by tracing their IPs? I myself have been contributing to the AC/DC page for some months now and it seems to me that all of us who voted against the external links were unfairly lumped into the arbitarily labelled category of 'Sockpuppets' so that there would be only one result to the vote.Furthermore, once all the participants were so labelled and banned from editing, there ceased to be any more debate. This would suit only one objective - a stage managed win for one side. Now, that is vandalism. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Archer_1bb0.html" title="User:The Archer">The Archer</a> 13:45, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Last night, <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelltopay27_49f2.html" title="User:Helltopay27">Helltopay27</a> added <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_metal.html" title="Classic metal">Classic metal</a> to the genre listing. Now, this morning, an unregistered user removed it and I was just about to remove it myself when it was initally added last night, but when I read the classic metal article, it read:</p>
<p>"<i>Classic metal bands are typically characterized by thumping fast basslines, not so fast heavy, but "clean", riffs, extended lead guitar solos, high pitched vocals and anthemic choruses.</i>"</p>
<p>Now, in my opinion, this sounds a lot like a typical AC/DC song. However, I'm not an expert in music, so, I would like everyone's opinions on whether you consider AC/DC a classic metal band or not and whether we should include this in the article before I add it back in or not. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 08:32, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see no problem with including this quote - it's sourced and relevant. Anyone who wants to exclude it should state their reasons here, or leave it in.

<dd>I removed it, and explained why in the edit summary (ahem!); pleasantries, especially drunken ones, uttered at an awards show don't usually add anything of importance to an article, and thus slow it down. Steven Tyler's not very clever comments take up a lot of room and don't say anything of note about AC/DC ("make soup out of your girlfriend's panties," indeed). I removed Brian Johnson's more germane comment because it consisted largely of a long quotation from song lyrics. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions"><span style="color:white;background:#700">&#160;<span style="background:#800">Pr<span style="background:#900">oh<span style="background:#a00">ib<span style="background:#b00">it<span style="background:#c00"><b>O</b></span><b>ni</b></span><b>o</b></span><b>n</b></span><b>s</b></span>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProhibitOnions_b4f5.html" title="User talk:ProhibitOnions"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 21:11, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, well let's see what people say - any other opinions on this one? We can see if there's a concensus either way. And thanks for referencing it by the way, HK51&#160;:o) <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 21:26, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmmmm, I think Tyler's comments should be left out, there's no <i>real</i> significance to them. But I do think a link should be left to them. Johnson's quote from the award ceremony (the one with the lyrics from <a href="../../../l/e/t/Let_There_Be_Rock_%28song%29_98f7.html" title="Let There Be Rock (song)">Let There Be Rock</a>) should stay. I think they show Johnson's respect for Scott and also I think it's important to include at least part of the acceptance speech, to show how well the award was recieved by the band. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 21:44, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm thinking something along the lines of:</p>
<p>'During their induction to the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_d7e8.html" title="Rock and Roll Hall of Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_in_music.html" title="2003 in music">March 2003</a>, AC/DC performed "Highway To Hell" and "You Shook Me All Night Long" with guest vocals by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Tyler_6293.html" title="Steven Tyler">Steven Tyler</a> of <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosmith.html" title="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>, who inducted the band into the hall, calling the band's <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_chord.html" title="Power chord">power chord</a> the <i>""The thunder from down under that gives you the second most powerful surge that can flow through your body."</i></p>
<p>The band thanked their fans for their support in an acceptance speech and Brian Johnson quoted the band's 1977 song "Let There Be Rock," written by Bon Scott. <i>"In the beginning, back in 1955, man didn't know about the rock 'n roll show and all that jive. The white man had the schmaltz, the black man had the blues, but no one knew what they was gonna do, but Tchaikovsky had the news, he said, let there be rock"</i> he later said, <i>"Bon Scott wrote that. And it's a real privilege to accept these awards tonight."</i> '</p>
<p>What are everyone else's thoughts on this layout then? <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 21:48, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Better. I had no objection to the sense of Johnson's comments, though they are hard to edit down. One positive phrase from Tyler, as you have here, gets the point across without slowing things down and making him look foolish. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions"><span style="color:white;background:#700">&#160;<span style="background:#800">Pr<span style="background:#900">oh<span style="background:#a00">ib<span style="background:#b00">it<span style="background:#c00"><b>O</b></span><b>ni</b></span><b>o</b></span><b>n</b></span><b>s</b></span>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProhibitOnions_b4f5.html" title="User talk:ProhibitOnions"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 22:31, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regardless of their relative standing, or whether Steven Tyler was drunk or not, the quote (the whole quote) does put in perspective the impression that AC/DC creates among their fans and peers.A description of AC/DC's history or their success in the music industry, may not convey the effect that their music has had on fans and indeed the reason behind their popularity and success.That quote is actually quite colourful and clever too and it does not slow things down at all.On the contrary, it sounds well crafted and explains why AC/DC is often described as the definitive Hard Rock Band, without saying so. My viewpoint aside, since there is a separate Hall of Fame section as it is, there is not much cause to say that the quote slows down the article (which it doesn't, to anyone interested in AC/DC). Also, Tyler's own status as the acclaimed and successful frontman of one of AC/DC's greatest contemporaries, along with the fact that he inducted the Band and that this quote was essentially his induction speech, explaining who or what AC/DC stood for, lends enough weight to the quote. The fact of the matter is, AC/DC is a band that sings lyrics about Rock N Roll, Booze, Sex and more Rock N Roll, laced with tongue in cheek humour and fun, for the most part and there have been very few deviations from that theme. Tyler's quote captures the essence of the effect that AC/DC has on it's fans while staying in tune with the sense of fun and excitement that their music has. The "make soup out of your girlfriend's panties" portion while ribald, is very much part of the quote and the whole quote in it's entirety was reproduced on music news sites that reported the event and i've come across many.However, "the second most powerful surge that can flow through your body", does sound out of place and overdone.</p>
<p>Brian Johnson's quote from one of the most popular and definitive Bon Scott era songs, with the theme again being "Rock N' Roll" is entirely legit and as already said above, shows his respect for Bon Scott.</p>
<p>I think that the article should go back to showing the full quote from Steven Tyler, perhaps leaving out the powerful surge part.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Archer_1bb0.html" title="User:The Archer">The Archer</a> 19:26, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe. But things like Tyler's comments, which probably were a lot of fun to hear (and in that context probably did get the point across about what AC/DC stands for) look pretty daft in print, unfortunately, and I'd be for selective quotation to tidy them up. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions"><span style="color:white;background:#700">&#160;<span style="background:#800">Pr<span style="background:#900">oh<span style="background:#a00">ib<span style="background:#b00">it<span style="background:#c00"><b>O</b></span><b>ni</b></span><b>o</b></span><b>n</b></span><b>s</b></span>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProhibitOnions_b4f5.html" title="User talk:ProhibitOnions"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 21:32, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's actually a point of view. As long as the quote is legitimate, it's not Steven Tyler's intelligence that is under consideration here. Considering the circumstances and the subject material, an urbane comment on AC/DC from one of the 'suits' (incidentally, the band's own comment on the Music Execs attending the induction) present, could hardly have done better.I've already explained the context in which the quote should be taken and considered for inclusion.It would have been daft if an editor on Wikipedia had written that quote perhaps, but not coming from Steven Tyler commenting on AC/DC, in that setting.I think that we need some consensus on this.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Archer_1bb0.html" title="User:The Archer">The Archer</a> 22:04, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I still think we should just leave his comment about the band's <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_chord.html" title="Power chord">power chord</a>. Leaving the rest of it in, in my opinion, does clutter-up the article and slow it down quite a bit. The article is long enough as it is. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 17:18, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Past members in the infobox</span></h2>
<p>Is it necesary to have names like Paul Matters or Russel Coleman in the infobox? They aren't named anywhere else on the article nor the minor members article. I think it will be better to have them listed in the minor members article and remove them from the infobox. <a href="../../../n/o/-/User%7ENo-Bullet_ab70.html" title="User:No-Bullet">No-Bullet</a> 17:37, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>They are in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_members_of_AC_DC_9e4d.html" title="Minor members of AC/DC">minor members article</a> - I'm pretty sure I put everyone who's relevant in that article, so as not to clutter up the main AC/DC article, and to stop people starting lots of little individual articles for each one. Like you, I'm not sure those guys need to be in the infobox - I reckon the Young brothers would be hard-pressed to remember them anyway! <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 17:44, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't think they should be in the infobox either, none of them were really proper members of the band were they? They were just there as occaional fill-ins and probably only played a few gigs amongst them. We should wait to hear a few more views on this before we delete them from the 'box though. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 20:37, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would say that the infobox should contain current members, plus Scott, Wright, Slade, Mark Evans and maybe Dave Evans - all the others were pretty minor really, and could be covered by "other members" and a link to the minor members article.

And I think <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Evans_81fd.html" title="Dave Evans">Dave Evans</a> should definitely be included. Although he didn't do much to shape the band's sound etc. he is quite an important part of the band's history. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 23:29, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree too. Despite the Young brothers' dislike of Dave Evans, he was their first frontman and they had a single with him.Mark Evans, Simon Wright and Chris Slade should all be included too. That goes without saying.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Archer_1bb0.html" title="User:The Archer">The Archer</a> 19:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Trouble is I've never uploaded an image before (that I didn't create myself) and was wondering what has to be done to insure I'm not infringing copyright etc. by uploading them.

<dd>The one who passed the article was an anonymous editor and left no comment, i.e., he/she just changed the template and left no comment. This looks like a passing vandal (or a sockpuppet). For the sake of keeping the integrity of the nomination process, I think it is better that the article goes back in its place in the nomination queue. Otherwise an editor who was involved in the article really made the decision to GA which would be unacceptable. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelHistBuff_2de7.html" title="User:RelHistBuff">RelHistBuff</a> 10:51, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="External_Links" id="External_Links"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">External Links</span></h3>
<p>Soothing has suggested the following links be changed to this format: (See my talk page)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.accadacca.net/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.accadacca.net/index.html" rel="nofollow">Profile page by Albert Music</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.acdcrocks.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.acdcrocks.com/" rel="nofollow">Profile page by Epic Records</a>}}</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason being is that nowhere on acdcrocks.com does it say that it's an official site, as I have said previously. Google does not list it that way either, btw. Furthermore, AC/DC's publishing company and business partner for 30+ years is Albert's Music while Sony has distributed recordings for AC/DC for only the last 3. They had to securing a contract through Albert's, not the other way around. In any event, if any page should be considered official, history should be the first consideration and AC/DC's entire career has been w/Albert's. Sony/Epic is just another company in a long list of distributors for the band, historically speaking.</p>
<p>I also propose we rid ourselves of any link to Rolling Stone and Music Brains. In the first place, Rolling stone shows nothing but contempt for AC/DC as has been pointed out previously in the last external links argument/discussion. Secondly, Music Brains offers nothing which cannot already be seen on Wikipedia's AC/DC page. It does offer a small bit of info on AC/DC bootlegs but much of that info is inaccurate as far as I can see. NCC17 15:17, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's far enough about the record company sites, but we do need some links other than the official sites. All the articles I've looked at have them, <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosmith.html" title="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallica.html" title="Metallica">Metallica</a> to them a few. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 15:37, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I assume you mean fair enough but, yes, I agree that we do need links from other sites and that's why I and many others had previously posted these below on the AC/DC page. Before Fair Deal gutted them all, they were on this site for nearly two years with no complaints.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ac-dc.net/" class="external text" title="http://ac-dc.net/" rel="nofollow">Electric Shock</a></li>

</ul>
<p>I'm of the opinion that all or the majority of them be brought back to replace the the useless Music Brains link and the link to Rolling Stone magazine. Having Rolling Stone magazine linked on the AC/DC page is akin to a John Kerry page having a link to swiftvets.com. NCC17 18:16, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think is Ok having the non-official links in the external links section, but I also think we need to have the link to rolling stones (we already discussed that) and the link to music brainz (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_MusicBrainz_8c3a.html#Goals" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject MusicBrainz">Wikipedia:WikiProject_MusicBrainz#Goals</a>). <a href="../../../n/o/-/User%7ENo-Bullet_ab70.html" title="User:No-Bullet">No-Bullet</a> 20:18, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we should keep the layout NCC17 has suggested and add Rolling Stones and Music Brainz to it. Why? Although most of us here love the band, there are those that don't, and just because we disagree with them on many of their issues with the band, it's no excuse not to incude their points of view. Showing different points of view make an article far more interesting, we're showing what those that love the band see and also showing what those who dislike the band see.</dd>

<p>Done&#160;:) I hope there's no objections. If anyone's wondering on the order I've listed them, it's purely alphabetical. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 00:19, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If at all the Rolling Stone link has to be on there, I would have preferred that it be the last one on the list. As it is, I'm not sure how it appears so high on the list, if it is indeed alphabetical.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Archer_1bb0.html" title="User:The Archer">The Archer</a> 06:17, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You do have a valid point about the Rolling Stone link, HK51. I still think the Music Brains link is worthless and offers misleading information but I can live w/it seeing as how the better links are posted again.</p>
<p>Since they are both there, I believe they (RS &amp; MB) should be included in alphabetical order, as well. Does anybody object to that? NCC17 08:02, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No objections, nope, you haven't placed them in alphabetical order though. Everything that begins 'AC/DC' should've been listed first, which includes the RS and MS link. Meh...the order doesn't matter much anyway! Just makes it look neater IMO. I shall leave it as is, as I don't want another edit war over it. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 16:12, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I was going alphabetically by the names RS &amp; MB. After all, it seems to me that they could all be technically called AC/DC pages. I left the ODP link where it was because that's where Soothing had it placed before (under the record company profile pages) and also because it links to many other AC/DC pages. NCC17 17:16, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This layout or the one HK51 came up with above is fine by me. My layout does purposely de-emphasize the RS link because many of us feel they are negatively biased against AC/DC as shown before here in their album reviews. NCC17 21:50, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>NCC17. Usually, I've always considered it fairly easy for me to control my temper on the internet. However, by looking at some of your writing on talkpages the opposite is about to appear true. You're really on the edge of performing personal attacks again: <i>if you're not going to properly sign in, you really have no business starting to gut the links again</i>, as if that is an actual reason to withhold somebody from editing Wikipedia. And by calling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AC/DC&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72487678" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AC/DC&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72487678" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AC/DC&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72487678</a> his edits] "vandalism". His edits was perfectly good faith, and there was no reason to suggest otherwise. He was removing a <i>non-notable</i> Yahoo fangroup (HK, how is that an important link?) and correcting the spelling and style of two other links. How does that equal vandalism?

<p>Soothing, there does not seem to be anything right in the anonymous removal of links, especially when this is a volatile issue here and it should have been discussed. Your condemnation of the response to the edits would seem evenhanded, if only you would not turn a blind eye to the actions of Fair Deal, or whoever it is from the NC area that is perpetrating the vandalism in question.Otherwise, it would seem that the only objective of the repeated warnings to NCC17, regardless of the reason, would be to protect the vandal in question and punish someone whose only crime seems to be pointing out that vandalism.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Archer_1bb0.html" title="User:The Archer">The Archer</a> 15:47, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Heavy Metal</span></h2>
<p>AC/DC is not heavy metal, it's hard rock and rock &amp; roll, why do you keep adding it into the infobox? <a href="../../../n/o/-/User%7ENo-Bullet_ab70.html" title="User:No-Bullet">No-Bullet</a> 23:24, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I keep adding it back in because it was there before I started contributing to this page and I think it should stay there. There are certain songs I personally would class as Heavy metal. Just because the band disagrees with this classing their music as this genre, does not make it untrue. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 01:13, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've never said anything about what the band said, I just think their music isn't heavy metal.

<dd>"The two genres have some crossover for example; the pioneers of heavy metal, such as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin are often considered both "Heavy Metal" and "Hard Rock"... whereas, bands such as AC/DC, Aerosmith and Kiss, are normally referred to as just "Hard Rock" and not "Heavy Metal"." <a href="../../../n/o/-/User%7ENo-Bullet_ab70.html" title="User:No-Bullet">No-Bullet</a> 02:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Personally, I wouldn't class AC/DC as heavy metal because then how would you class a band like <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Maiden_6b08.html" title="Iron Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>? They're clearly worlds apart, yet are they both heavy metal? I don't think so. But then a lot of people, particularly those who don't really know much about heavy music, would class AC/DC as metal. So without a real definition of Heavy Metal, this is going to be difficult. For myself, I would class early AC/DC as hard blues rock, with the later Johnson-era stuff just being hard rock or hard boogie rock. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 11:07, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two things here.One, some of the music sure does sound like metal. Two, it is undeniable that AC/DC have been a huge influence on many groups that fit firmly into the metal pantheon.However, unlike say a Black Sabbath, AC/DC have never themselves tried to blur the line, fimrly calling themselves a Rock N' Roll band<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Archer_1bb0.html" title="User:The Archer">The Archer</a> 11:46, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>What I'm saying is that are certain songs written in the Brian Johnson era that do sound like heavy metal and just because these songs are few and far between doesn't mean we should not include their genre. I mean, we have blues rock in there (and rightly so) and AC/DC have very few blues rock songs, Ride On is the only one I can think of off the top of my head. So, my point is, AC/DC are a hard rock and rock and roll band, with a few heavy metal and blues rock songs. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 12:16, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't want to get into an argument about something that I think is insoluble, but 90% of all the pre-1979 AC/DC songs are blues-based, hence they are blues rock. "Ride On" is one of the very few slow blues that they did, others being "Crabsody In Blue", "Little Lover" etc. Half of <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powerage.html" title="Powerage">Powerage</a> is very bluesy indeed. The closest I would say to heavy metal that they got was perhaps the <a href="../../../f/l/y/Fly_on_the_Wall_d5a7.html" title="Fly on the Wall">Fly on the Wall</a> era stuff, or <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blow_Up_Your_Video_474f.html" title="Blow Up Your Video">Blow Up Your Video</a>, even then the blues structure is still there.

<dd>Well, if the majority don't want to include it, I'm not going to argue with it. Again, the songs I would class as heavy metal are few and far between (I would class a few of the Fly on the Wall album as such, and not many more), but I still think it should be included in the genre listing. But I won't argue with it if no-one else wants it there, I'm not an edit-warring type. Also, it was in the genre listing before I began contributing to the article, so I'm sure there must be a few others who support my opinion. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 12:42, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's pretty much the way I look at it - I think it's the kind of thing that gets edited in and out several times a month, and life's too short to argue about it. If people want it in, fine, if they don't, fine. Short of having a big vote which everyone would agree to stick to, there's no real solution. At the moment, I'd say it's about equal for inclusion or exclusion. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 13:03, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to see more references in this article as a whole. For example, the quote, "The band were tagged as a punk rock band by the British press, ..." needs some referencing or clarification. The whole of the press certainly didn't. Which part of the press? Had the writer misunderstood British tongue in cheek humour?

<ul>
<li>Weasel words, particularly in the later sections, are a problem. "It has been said that..." etc. won't fly at the next level. This problem even made me pause and wonder about making this a GA, but I think the article succeeds in enough other ways.</li>
<li>Citations - current referencing is spotty. An FA on this topic would probably have twice as many footnotes as the current version.</li>
<li>Lists - <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">FAC</a> reviewers don't like lists within articles. I don't particularly mind them myself, but I'd suggest branching off the list material into a subordinate page. With enough verification the list page might even become a featured list (see <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Joan_of_Arc_d22a.html" title="Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc">Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc</a> for an example).</li>

<dd>The way they've done it in the Iron Maiden article is pretty good actually. I'd be in agreement if we done a similar thing to what they've done; still including a 'Band members' section, but only showing the current and original line-ups, then having a seperate 'Band members' article which would obviously be linked to in that section. I'm still not sure about having an article that's really just a table though, but if it works on another article, it'd be ok I guess.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Why do people keep changing the AC/DC article to say that AC/DC is an Australian band?</span></h3>
<p>I keep changing the article to say that they're a British band. This is because almost all members (both current and previous) are British, they were born in Britain, and they have primarily British influences. They are also often regarded as a British band, and are included in polls of British bands. My edit keeps on getting changed back to saying they're Australian, and Australian only. And now I'm being accused of vandalism, and threatened with being blocked. I am not deliberately trying to give false facts on the article, I am trying to improve it. Surely I can't be banned for that?</p>

<dd>Considering that almost all members are British, and they were primarily influenced by British music, I would personally class them as a British band.</dd>
<dd>But I see your point - it's very hard to say which they are exactly. I know that they're included in music polls and lists for both countries, and different people have different interpretations on which country they truly belong to. Perhaps it would be best to state both Australia and Britain as their country of origin, and have a paragraph explaining the situation? <a href="../../../s/u/i/User%7ESuicidal_Lemming_66cd.html" title="User:Suicidal Lemming">Suicidal Lemming</a> 21:48, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My 2p worth - can anyone find out which country's passports the Young brothers hold? Are they Australian citizens or British citizens? If they took Australian citizenship, then they're Australian regardless of where they were born. <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliff_Richard_d0cb.html" title="Cliff Richard">Cliff Richard</a> is not Indian. In any case, two of the current band are definitely British and one is definitely Australian, so "British/Australian" or "Australian/British" sounds to me like the best solution. To use a similar example, <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleetwood_Mac_e8b5.html" title="Fleetwood Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a> are described as "British/American" due to two members being British and two American. Let's try and be accurate and say AC/DC are collectively a mix of the two nationalities, which is the undeniable truth. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 18:17, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think calling the band Australian-British is miss leading. The whole article refers to the band as Australian, the band was formed in Sydney Australia according to the bio they all have residences in Australia, the Youngs refer to Sydney as home. Bon Scott is buried in Fremantle Western Australia where he grewup went to prison. The members played in other AUstralian bands prior to forming, they also work in Australia. so besides being born in Scotland and emigrating to Australia with their parents what is British about the band. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 16:39, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>2003 "It's a very good night to be British because three of the finest acts of the last 30 years came out of Britain and three are here to be honored," said singer Elton John.<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/11/rock.hall.fame.ap/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/11/rock.hall.fame.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> there were 5 inducties that year The Clash(UK), The Police(UK), Costello(UK), Righteous Brothers(US) and AC/DC if AC/DC was considered British Sir Elton John would have referred to 4 acts(whether he likes them or not).

<p>Just my two cents on the nationality question: Angus, Malcolm and Bon were all born in Scotland but emigrated to Australia at very young ages. Bon was 6, for example. Each of their families became Australian citizens and have lived the rest of their lives in Oz. AC/DC was also formed while each member was a citizen of Oz. Cliff Williams, an Englishman, joined the band in '78 becoming a permanent member and Brian, a Geordie, replaced Bon in 1980 after, of course, Bon's untimely death. Phil Rudd, the other longtime member was also born Melbourne, AU.</p>
<p>Here's where things get difficult. Angus now lives in Holland, and both Brian and Cliff reside in Florida. Brian, in fact, has lived in Florida for around 20 years now. At last report, Phil was living in Tauranga, NZ and has lived in and operated various businesses for many years in thet country. Frankly, I'm not certain where Malcolm permanently resides but it's pretty well known that the Youngs return to Oz during Christmas and other special occasions. For example, when they've received awards from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).</p>
<p>So, are we to include every country that can make some claim on AC/DC members? If we do that, the article would have to read Aussie/English/Scottish/Yankee/Dutch/New Zealander etc and so on! lol</p>
<p>My point is that the band was formed in Australia. No matter how many lineups they've been through, the seminal players (Ang &amp; Mal) were Aussie's when they created AC/DC and I think that's how the article should read. NCC17 14:37, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well actually, America and Holland etc. have no claim whatsoever on the band. Just because they lived there at some point doesn't mean thay are a part of that country. And that's exactly the point I've been making. Agreed, they have spent enough time in Australia to be considered Australian, but considering that almost every single one of them is actually regarded as British, it makes the band both. The band will remain as Australia/Britain, and it will not changed. We've agreed on it, and you will all stop reverting it back to the mistake of before. <a href="../../../s/u/i/User%7ESuicidal_Lemming_66cd.html" title="User:Suicidal Lemming">Suicidal Lemming</a> 15:20, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is getting beyond ridiculous. Looking at the current line-up of AC/DC, which is very relevant to the article indeed, one member is unequivocably Australian, and two are unequivocably British. Two past members (Wright and Slade) are also absolutely British, and one (Mark Evans) is undoubtedly Australian. Regardless of the nationality of the Young brothers and Scott, this alone is enough to warrant the term "Australian / British".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that they formed the band in Australia is important, but it cannot deny the fact that at least two current members are British. To say the band are 100% Australian is simply inaccurate and any edit to that effect should be removed instantly. The question of the nationality / immigration of the Young brothers and Bon Scott should be addressed in the article without it having a bearing on the nationality of AC/DC as a band. Whether or not they are "considered" one or the other, even by someone as *relevant* as Elton John, this is an encyclopedia and we should be concerned with facts, not what Elton John thinks, or Rolling Stone, or anyone else. Rolling Stone hate AC/DC, so their viewpoint can be discarded as an unbiased source anyway. It doesn't matter how many people say they're all Australian, two members are completely British - that is a fact. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 17:02, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

From where I sit the article has 32 references all of which say the Band is Austrtalian including Rolling Stone magazine an undesputed authorative source for all thing music and used a source for most articles on wikipedia about music. What I think is happening is that there is confusion between the defination of <i>"origin"</i> and the definition of <i>"nationality"</i>. I dont dispute that members of the band both past and present are British citizens and that as British citizens they may(still unverified) appear on British charts because of this, but that doesnt change the origin of the band. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 00:53, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>lets move forward, the Band <b>AC/DC</b> formed in Sydney Australia, they played their first gig in Sydney, they recorded and released their first album in Australia. The article is about the "band" not about the "band members" they have their own articles, the infoxbox refers to the origin of the "band". As individuals I suspect that the current "band members" are all British citizens, as such would appear on lists of british entertainers as individuals. <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerify_6da8.html" title="WP:Verify">WP:Verify</a> requires all facts to be verifiable, all I am asking is for a reliable source external to wikipedia that says "the british band AC/DC" or something very similar, where RollingStone comes in is that it is a recognisable authority on this style of music the bio they have on AC/DC doesnt refer to them being "british" or "australian/british" it calls them australian, and that any source provided needs to as reliable and authorative as them. The elton john quote looked like it was possible that he was supporting the position of the band being british(the only grey refernce currently in the article), so I took the time to investigate the comment made and found that three other bands undisputalbly british were also inducted. From this I deduced that he was not referring to AC/DC (ok thats borderline original research). The only facts I am using are the references already stated in the article, it is possible that there may be other information about the origin of the band that isnt verifiable from these references, You have indicated that you have possession of other facts please provide them.</dd>
<dd>third paragraph of the lead is acceptable, I'm not removing it from the article all that is needed there is a reference to a UK/british list that shows AC/DC within the contest of what is being said. <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerify_6da8.html" title="WP:Verify">WP:Verify</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> have a more thorough description of whats required, any editor can request this by adding {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} that its against wp policy to remove it without providing the requested information or alternatively the whole statement can be removed. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 18:36, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I second Gnangarra's opinion; nowhere have I seen AC/DC touted as a <i>British</i> band or a <i>British-Australian</i> band. AC/DC are an Australian band - formed in Australia, influenced by the Australian pub rock scene, had many of their early albums released seperately or, in one case exclusively, in Australia. I just don't see a British influence there at all, I mean, the only proper British citizens in the band are <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliff_Williams_135d.html" title="Cliff Williams">Cliff Williams</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Johnson_0020.html" title="Brian Johnson">Brian Johnson</a> who both joined a good while after the band initially formed. The Young brothers, although born in Scotland, grew up in Australia and I'm quite confident that they're Australian citizens and would declare themselves so. And I really don't see why their British roots should be mentioned in the leading paragraph. It's virtually unimportant. There's already an extensive section about the Young brothers time in Scotland and of course there's also their own articles. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 20:32, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And another thing: Why have you placed Britain in the origins part of the infobox? It is downright wrong to say the band originates from Britain. They were formed in Australia and shaped their sound there, they originate from <b>Australia</b> <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 20:42, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They were born in britain, but even the british press says they're australian. <a href="../../../n/o/-/User%7ENo-Bullet_ab70.html" title="User:No-Bullet">No-Bullet</a> 20:49, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've reached the point where I'm past caring, but "origin" is a fairly pointless thing to have in the infobox anyway, and "nationality" is more important in my opinion. AC/DC kicked off in Australia, but moved away in '76 because they outgrew the music scene there so quickly, and collectively never had a base there again. Two years in Australia and 30 elsewhere, mainly in Britain. The other thing I wanted to say is that OK, Cliff Williams joined 3 years after the band formed, but has been a member for 29 years, with Johnson present for 26. To say they're an Australian band is misleading, no matter how "accepted" it is. This isn't a great article, and rucking about things like this makes it all a bit of a farce. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 23:09, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know who's saying they're a British band - I'm certainly not. What I am saying, and which is incontrovertible, is that at least two very long-standing members of the band are British, thus to say they're an Australian band is misleading. I don't know why anyone needs a source to prove it. Do you want 32 sources that say Johnson and Williams are British? If we are still banging on about "origin", I just don't see the relevance of it beyond explaining the beginnings of the band in the article.</p>
<p>Also there is a huge difference between AC/DC being Australian and them being "generally accepted" or "considered" to be Australian. If we are just pointing out the fact that the music media consider them to be Australian, we should make it clear. If we are blindly taking the music media's opinion to be fact without bothering ourselves whether it's true or not, then that's a sad state of affairs. I shan't be bothering to push this any further, so put what you like, but it'll still be misleading. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 11:06, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>AC/DC is a band that was formed (or <i>born</i> to use the biographical equivalent) in Australia. Some of the members had British/Scottish roots and those indisputable facts are reflected in their own biographies. This article is about the Australian <b>band</b> called AC/DC. -- <a href="../../../i/40/n/User_talk%7EI%40n_406b.html" title="User talk:I@n">I@n</a> 13:00, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look, no-one's denying the fact that there have been many British members of the band. I just don't see how the band can originate from both Australia and Britain as Sucidal Lemming seems to think. The band was undeniably formed in Australia and this is where they developed their sound. And I think the origin is very important, I mean, where a band originates from is where they get their sound. Almost all the band biographies on Wikipedia I have looked at have it listed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, it gets complicated as two of the current members are both English. So, I think changing the third paragraph of the lead to:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Although the founding members grew up in Australia and the band itself was formed in Sydney, most of both the current and previous members are either British or of British descent. The band is often included in both British<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[</span><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup class="noprint Template-Fact">citation needed<i>]</i></sup></span></a></sup> and Australian music polls and statistical lists."</i></dd>

<dd>this is all I've been wanting to have happen plus see your suggested third paragraph there are 31/32 references in the current article not one of them is a British(UK) music poll, all I want to see here is a reference to support that section similar to the Australian one, 2nd to only the wiggles earnings or something similar.

<dd>Huh? A band cannot have a nationality, only people can. Why can't you accept that the band is Australian?

<dl>
<dd>I@n, I find the comment, "A band cannot have a nationality, only people can," is somewhat debatable in common usage and we are <b>not</b> debating the nationalities of the individual band member. We know the nationalities of the musicians, we know where the music originated but we are trying to hammer out how this should be explained as succinctly and accurately as possible. By common usage I believe that people may say "British Intelligence Services" or "Indian Press" or "Chinese Merchant Navy" to imply the origin of these organisations or structures. To say I cannot use these because the Intelligence Services, Press or Merchant Navy are not people seems counter productive to the use of an adjective.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is about how we apply the correct adjective (or not) to describe AC/DC. Your comment doesn't really help to further the debate and if you read the comments more carefully I suspect you would see we already understand what you have stated but not the other way around . <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandorwien_f900.html" title="User:Candorwien">Candy</a> 03:22, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do undertstand the debate and was responding to Suicidal Lemmings statement "Perhaps underneath the origin, we could state the nationality of the band?" above. Stating the bands origin as Australia is clear enough in tbe infobox. In the text we need to establish a phrase which is supported by citations. -- <a href="../../../i/40/n/User_talk%7EI%40n_406b.html" title="User talk:I@n">I@n</a> 04:03, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why would only one band need to have a band member nationality in the info box, we are also making presumptions(reasonable at that) based on place of birth that the band members are british citizens. The proposed third paragraph covers this position, to add information into the Info box should be something thats taken to the Wikiproject music to create a standard format for all bands. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 04:17, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now I think that it is a stretch to say that the place of birth determines a persons origin. If I was to say that ACDC was British(2 out of 5 were), I could also argue they were Scottish(with 2 out of 5 as well). It is saying a person that has lived in Australia nearly all their life, with not even being able remember his birth country is not Aussie. Here it is called Un-Australian. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBass_Masta_e044.html" title="User:Bass Masta">Bass Masta</a> 13:07, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">RfC</span></h2>
<p>As the editor who promoted this to <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">GA</a> status just a few weeks ago, I find it distressing to see this article on RfC. As a neutral party, I'll summarize what I see in this dispute:</p>
<ol>
<li>The band formed in Australia. Their first releases were in Australia only.</li>
<li>Some of the band members were British. Of these, some of them emigrated to Australia at a very young age. Two non-original members have never been Australian citizens. (I hope I've gotten this part right).</li>
<li>Their influences were mainly British. Or their influences were mainly Australian. I'm not sure because both sides have been argued (without references provided on the talk page).</li>
<li>Most <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a> identify them as Australian.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the version of the article I approved for GA listed the band as Australian, let's take that as baseline (fair or not). The claim that some editors seem to be making is that - in some way - they're better described as a hyphenated Australian-British band. Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, burden of proof lies with the people who want to redefine this as a hyphenated band.</p>
<p>Fair disclosure: I'm <i>not</i> a rock historian and most of the editors here know AC/DC better than I do. I'm also neutral in the sense of having no national pride at stake (I'm a Yank). So how would these solutions strike the editors here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pro-hyphen editors provide evidence for certain members' British origins and identities: include a subheading (probably a fair way down in the article) that details the British origins of certain band members.</li>
<li>Pro-hyphen editors provide <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> evidence of hyphenated band identity such as a <i>Rolling Stone</i> or other notable industry publication article that identifies the band as Australian-British: larger subheading about British origins and identities.</li>
<li>Pro-hyphen ediors provide strong evidence for a hyphenated identity: this is a little hard to quantify, but it might include a founding (and creatively influential) member stating, "I think of us as both Australian and British" in an interview or detailing a list of specifically British bands as creative influences. In this case, introduce the group as both Australian and British in the opening paragraph and put the article under both categories.</li>
</ol>
<p>Does this look fair to everyone? <b><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font color="blue">Durova</font></a></b> 04:16, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Part one in your solution isnt needed as this isnt disputed, that current and past members of the band are/were british citizens. The other parts are fine thats all I've asked is that those wishing to change provide <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">proof</a> that the band (not the individual members) originated somewhere other than Australia. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 14:29, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
