Though his younger brother <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_Young_1b47.html" title="Angus Young">Angus</a> is the more visible of the brothers, Malcolm has been described as the business brains behind AC/DC. As the second guitarist, he is responsible for the broad sweep of AC/DC's sound, and co-writer of the material. Behind the scenes, his word is said to be 'law' on matters such as organising when and where the band go on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert.html" title="Concert">tour</a>, when to make an album or <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_soundtrack.html" title="Film soundtrack">film soundtrack</a>, and when to meet the media.

<b>Phillip Hugh Norman Rudd</b> (born <b>Phillip Hugh Norman Witschke Rudzevecuis</b>) was born on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_19.html" title="May 19">May 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. He was the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drum_kit.html" title="Drum kit">drummer</a> of <a href="../../../a/c/2F/AC_DC_2284.html" title="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> from 1975 until 1983, and again from 1994 to present. After the 1977 departure of bassist Mark Evans, he became the only Australian-born member of the band. He uses <a href="../../../s/o/n/SONOR_0245.html" title="SONOR">SONOR</a> drums and <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paiste.html" title="Paiste">Paiste</a> cymbals. Rudd played in several bands in Melbourne before joining <b>The Coloured Balls</b> with <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angry_Anderson_8256.html" title="Angry Anderson">Angry Anderson</a> (future <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Tattoo_7d98.html" title="Rose Tattoo">Rose Tattoo</a> vocalist). They soon changed their name to <b>Buster Brown</b> and released one album, <i>Something To Say</i>, before Rudd left in late 1974 to join AC/DC. He fitted in with the band very quickly and contributed his solid drumming style to great effect on the string of albums recorded from 1975 to 1983. The band relocated to the UK in 1976 and followed a heavy schedule of international touring and recording. (<b><a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Rudd_7655.html" title="Phil Rudd">more...</a></b>) In 1980 vocalist <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bon_Scott_45a1.html" title="Bon Scott">Bon Scott</a> died. The band regrouped with vocalist <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Johnson_0020.html" title="Brian Johnson">Brian Johnson</a> and recorded, <i><a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_in_Black_d565.html" title="Back in Black">Back in Black</a></i>. Rudd took Scott's death badly, but continued with AC/DC until he was fired from the band during the recording of <i><a href="../../../f/l/i/Flick_of_the_Switch_2675.html" title="Flick of the Switch">Flick of the Switch</a></i> in 1983. <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Wright_2b6e.html" title="Simon Wright">Simon Wright</a>, replaced Rudd, and helped the band record videos for two of the album's ten songs, "<a href="../../../f/l/i/Flick_Of_The_Switch_%28song%29_0300.html" title="Flick Of The Switch (song)">Flick of the Switch</a>", and "Nervous Shakedown". Rudd's sacking from the band was partly a result of his own problems with alcohol, and also growing conflict between him and band leader <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Young_6db5.html" title="Malcolm Young">Malcolm Young</a>, which eventually became physical. After leaving AC/DC, Rudd retired to <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tauranga.html" title="Tauranga">Tauranga</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> where he purchased a helicopter charter company. When AC/DC went touring in New Zealand in 1994, they called Rudd to see if he would like to "<a href="../../../j/a/m/Jam_session.html" title="Jam session">jam</a>" with them. Rudd decided to accept their offer and was eventually rehired. Since his return to the band, Rudd has contributed to AC/DC's <i><a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballbreaker.html" title="Ballbreaker">Ballbreaker</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/t/i/Stiff_Upper_Lip_2a22.html" title="Stiff Upper Lip">Stiff Upper Lip</a></i> albums.

After being recruited as a full-time member, Evans did not actually meet singer <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bon_Scott_45a1.html" title="Bon Scott">Bon Scott</a> until the next gig.

In recent years he has been performing with Dave Tice (ex-<a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo_%28band%29.html" title="Buffalo (band)">Buffalo</a>).

The Young brothers, however, asked Slade to leave after four years with the group and reinstated former drummer <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Rudd_7655.html" title="Phil Rudd">Phil Rudd</a>, claiming that Rudd had demonstrated a "groove" more fitting their style of rock. Slade's departure, however, was amicable; Angus Young stated, "<i>Chris was probably the best musician in the band. We hate to lose him, but getting Phil back is worth asking him to leave.</i>" (<b><a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Slade_375f.html" title="Chris Slade">more...</a></b>)</p>
