<h2><span class="mw-headline">To do</span></h2>
<p>I've requested a <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">peer review</a> a few days ago, but I'm very busy right now, so I made a to-do list to improve the article. <a href="../../../n/o/-/User%7ENo-Bullet_ab70.html" title="User:No-Bullet">No-Bullet</a> 03:00, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Genres</span></h2>
<p>Last night, <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelltopay27_49f2.html" title="User:Helltopay27">Helltopay27</a> added <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_metal.html" title="Classic metal">Classic metal</a> to the genre listing. Now, this morning, an unregistered user removed it and I was just about to remove it myself when it was initally added last night, but when I read the classic metal article, it read:</p>
<p>"<i>Classic metal bands are typically characterized by thumping fast basslines, not so fast heavy, but "clean", riffs, extended lead guitar solos, high pitched vocals and anthemic choruses.</i>"</p>
<p>Now, in my opinion, this sounds a lot like a typical AC/DC song. However, I'm not an expert in music, so, I would like everyone's opinions on whether you consider AC/DC a classic metal band or not and whether we should include this in the article before I add it back in or not. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 08:40, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd consider AC/DC to be a hard rock band, or blues rock, but not classic rock. They really made rock harder than anyone else did. Also, make sure that they are not refered to as a metal or heavy metal band, since, according to the many AC/DC biographies I've read, they seem to hate being called that. '74 Jailbreak '74 Jailbreak 16:07, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>'74 Jailbreak is right. They are a hard rock band. Several old copies of Rolling Stone, interviews with them, unofficial biographies, etc, all say this. They are blues influenced, with alot of scales from it. If anyone doesn't agree, I'd like to hear your comments.--<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBass_Masta_e044.html" title="User:Bass Masta">Bass Masta</a> 09:55, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alot of the solos and riffs that Angus plays mostly come from the Blue Scale and alot of other scales. On what Bass Masta said, it's true. 124.178.34.146 11:08, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Nah, I wasn't suggesting they were heavy metal. I just thought the description of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_metal.html" title="Classic metal">Classic metal</a> - "<i>Classic metal bands are typically characterized by thumping fast basslines, not so fast heavy, but "clean", riffs, extended lead guitar solos, high pitched vocals and anthemic choruses</i>" - sounded a lot like a typical AC/DC song. Like I said, I'm no music expert, so I thought I'd leave this open to discussion. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a></p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Whether they "like" it or not is irrelevant; some of they're music is metal (for instance, note their inclusion on VH1's <a href="../../../4/0/_/40_Greatest_Metal_Songs_b999.html" title="40 Greatest Metal Songs">40 Greatest Metal Songs</a>).<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelltopay27_49f2.html" title="User:Helltopay27">Helltopay27</a> 00:24, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that they would know more about what type of music they play than VH1. When i think of classic metal, i think of bands like iron madden and accept, not bands like acdc. when i think of heavy metal, i think of bands like slipknot and system of a down, not acdc. I and most other people i know think ACDC is as much metal as jimmy hindrix. We should just keep hard rock as the only genre. Captanpluto123 02:34, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We should be going by what <i>reliable</i> sources say, not what you think or what other people you know think.

<p>Could someone tell me when and where they ever said that? Until proven otherwise, I removed this from the article. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERoda_d0f0.html" title="User:Roda">Roda</a> 18:00, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reopening the external links debate, hopefully with less edit-warring and such</span></h2>
<p>I was pretty happy with the external links as they were a month ago, but now I think a lot of the fairly low-quality links have been edited out and I'm pretty happy with that, though there were a few I thought should stay, link the Magazine Archives and the Crabsody in Blue site, but I won't complain if no-one else wants them there.</p>
<p>But what's bugging me now is the three "Profile pages" which are listed. We'd came to the conclusion a few months back that, seen as AC/DC have had so many record companies, it would be best to include them all just as "Profile pages". However. I've just watched the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_%28AC_DC_album%29_4a08.html#Video" title="Live (AC/DC album)">Live at Donington</a> DVD and when I clicked on 'The Web' it listed <a href="http://www.acdcrocks.com" class="external free" title="http://www.acdcrocks.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.acdcrocks.com</a> as the <i>official</i> site, I can do a screenshot of this if anyone wants one.</p>
<p>So, to sum-up, I think the EL section should read as follows (also, I think we should put acdcrocks.com into the infobox as the official site):</p>

<p>Gentlemen: Do we have to go back to link fighting again? Why did someone erase the old agreement from this page anyway? This was the old set up we agreed on and it should still carry the day, imo. Btw, accadacca.net is owned by Albert Music. Albert Music licenses Sony to sell AC/DC product. If any site is truly official, they are it since they have been AC/DC's partners for going on 33 years now. Nowhere on acdcrocks.com does it say it's the official site. You might note that Google now says accadacca.net is the official site, btw.</p>

<dd>First off, I'm not asking for a "fight", I'm asking for a discussion. Most of the links you've posted are good, but there are some which we do not need, please read <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. According to it, we should axe the following from your list:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/bonscott/" class="external text" title="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/bonscott/" rel="nofollow">AC/DC Fan Club</a> - <i>provides nothing of merit in terms of AC/DC's history, and links to message boards/discussion groups aren't generally tolerated</i></li>
<li><a href="http://ac-dc.net/" class="external text" title="http://ac-dc.net/" rel="nofollow">Electric Shock</a> - <i>adds little in terms of knowledge of the band's history</i></li>
<li><a href="http://www.acdcpower.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.acdcpower.net/" rel="nofollow">Rising Power</a>- <i>adds nothing of merit</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.acdcrocks.com" class="external free" title="http://www.acdcrocks.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.acdcrocks.com</a> is listed as the Official Site on the Live at Donington DVD and seen as Epic Records is currently the label AC/DC are signed to, I'd say it's the offical site. I'm aware of the band's long history with Albert, but Epic is the label they're currently signed to, thus, their site for them is most likely the official one.</p>

<p>I'm not asking for a fight either. I'm simply asking for the consensus I posted above, that was agreed upon and set in stone previously by Wiki administrators, to be restored.</p>
<p>Nowhere in fact, in the history of this discussion, have any of those links been shown to break any of the rules by any Wiki administrator. I would still like to know why the original discussion was eliminated from this page as there were several wikipedians that concurred with my arguments during that discussion. I don't recall DownUnderThunder being there at all for any of that discussion, btw.</p>
<p>As for the merits of the individual links, let's go one by one, if we must.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/bonscott/" class="external text" title="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/bonscott/" rel="nofollow">AC/DC Fan Club</a> This is the longest running, largest AC/DC fan club on the net that is also frequently updated with the most up-to-date news on AC/DC that you can find on the internet. It's also an official link of accadacca.net, the only truly official ac/dc website as I have previously mentioned. The photo albums alone on that site make it worthy of being linked alone.</li>
</ul>

The owner of that site is credited on AC/DC's Family Jewels DVD and has recently co-authored what will likely prove to be the most well documented AC/DC bio, "AC/DC: MAXIMUM ROCK &amp; ROLL" which has already been released in Australia and is due out in America in January of 2007.</li>

<dd>Nothing on Wikipedia can be "set in stone", if you truly believe that, you don't understand the concept of Wikipedia at all.

<li><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/bonscott/" class="external text" title="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/bonscott/" rel="nofollow">AC/DC Fan Club</a> - according to <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>: <i>Sites that require registration or a paid subscription should be avoided because they are of limited use to most readers.</i> And it also states that, only a website such as this should be included if: <i>The web site itself is the topic of the article</i>, or, <i>It has relevant content that is of substantially higher quality than that available from any other website</i>.

<li><a href="http://ac-dc.net/" class="external text" title="http://ac-dc.net/" rel="nofollow">Electric Shock</a> - I respect the fact that this is a well-known and long-running website and that it's owner is very respectable, I'm not slagging the website itself off at all, I do think it's rather good. But, I must refer you to a policy from <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, in which it states that one should avoid: <i>Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain once it becomes a Wikipedia:Featured article</i>. This , in my opinion, is true of this website. It doesn't really give more information than any other of the websites, or the article itself already gives and therefore, does not merit inclusion <i>in my opinion</i>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Seen as there's obvious confusion over which is the <i>official</i> AC/DC website, even if there truly is one, then I'll drop that from my argument and conclude that we have three <i>Official</i>s! <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 21:24, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hk51, no where on the <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> does it expressly forbid a site requiring registration! It only gives recommendations in very general terms. And that site btw, only requires registration with Yahoo. Of course Yahoo, at last check, is still the most popular site in the world. So, it's quite likely that most people reading Wikipedia would already have a free ID on Yahoo, is it not?</p>
<p>I also think removing Electric Shock is a mistake as well. You're talking about a website that was the bible for AC/DC fans before AC/DC even had any presence on the net. It didn't get to the 2nd spot on Google without having a ton of hits over the years. For a long time, it was the #1 ac/dc site on the web. NCC17 22:28, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia policy basically states that sites requiring registration should not be included in EL sections unless they're either the subject of the article, or there are no other decent websites on the Internet that provide information on the articles subject. In this case, seen as we already have sites which give out information without a requirement for registration, it seems strange that this message group is included. The fact that Yahoo is one of the most popular sites on the web, even if this is true, is completely irrelevant. You can't assume everyone is going to have a Yahoo ID.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To me, Electric Shock doesn't provide any more information that's already in the article and covered by the other sites. I respect its history and its standing, but I don't think it merits inclusion. The discussion on this site will probably always be open, Wikipedia policy doesn't necessarily suggest it not be there, but I think it's a waste of time having both it and Crabsody In Blue there, I'd pick either or. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 21:36, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The other links are completely unnecessary. Cheers. <a href="../../../n/o/-/User%7ENo-Bullet_ab70.html" title="User:No-Bullet">No-Bullet</a> 19:49, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>To No-Bullet: So you say, based on something supposedly seen on a DVD that's how old? If it is the official AC/DC site as you claim, why does it not say so anywhere on acdcrocks? You'd think they'd want to post that information prominently, if it were true??? NCC17 03:09, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To HK51: I think you're misquoting wiki guidelines (not rules, btw). It's obvious that this policy is mostly an attempt to discourage sites that require a subscription. It's also my belief that it's completely relevant that Yahoo is the most popular site in the world as the EL policy is clearly only there to discourage small sites requiring registration from being posted on Wiki. (Mainly newspapers.) As far as it's newsgroup's merits, can you name another AC/DC site that has band news updated daily, even hourly at times? None of the other links posted have that uniqueness.</p>
<p>I've also stated why Electric Shock is unique due the knowledge of the owner and his work on what will probably prove to be the most definitive AC/DC book, which incidentally was co-authored by Murray Engleheart. If I have to tell you who that is and his relation to AC/DC's career then I would guess you don't know as much as you think you do about AC/DC.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point is that people come to wikipedia to get AC/DC info. Either you want to give them the best resource links out there or you don't. If all you care about is what status this article gets (which who really gives a damn, imho - certainly not the average AC/DC fan) then keep gutting the best links and limit what info can be found here. NCC17 03:09, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, this is an encyclopedia, we're here to make quality articles. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a repository of links</a>. The information should be <i>inside</i> the article. <a href="../../../n/o/-/User%7ENo-Bullet_ab70.html" title="User:No-Bullet">No-Bullet</a> 02:00, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First off, the live at Donington DVD is only three years old, and as I said, I can do a screen shot of where it states acdcrocks.com as the official site.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, I'm not misquoting guidelines (which I never said were rules, I said they were policies IIRC), you can read it for yourself right here: <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. I'm sorry, but nowehere does it state in WP:EL that the fansite policy is just there to discourage small sites, if that were so, it would say so. Also, I can't even check to see if what you say about this fansite is correct. Why? I don't have a Yahoo ID! <i>That's</i> why the policy is there. There are some, believe it or not, who don't have Yahoo IDs and don't wish to get one in the near future, thus, the site is completely useless to them.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Third, what the owner does in his free time is none of my concern. Even if he was <i>in</i> AC/DC, that wouldn't change my opinion on the site. I just don't see why it needs to be there. The owner's status has absolutely nothing to do with this. And low and behold, I have no idea who Murray Engleheart is. I actually don't care. You can launch your little subtle personal attacks at me all you like, it doesn't change the fact that you are wrong about the links. Why do you think people have been arguing with you and edit-warring with you for months over these links?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If people want AC/DC links, tell them to go and type "AC/DC" into Google. Like No-Bullet said, Wikipedia is not a link repository, it's an encyclopedia. I care about giving the best information out there on the band, if the article ever does get to FA status, I'll be happy for it and the team of editors who've worked hard at it these past few months, trying to get it perfect. If it doesn't, myself and all the other editors here will try our best to get it to FA again. Because, in case you don't know, FAs are the best articles on Wikipedia, and there's a reason why someone used these links as one of their reasons for objecting to the article's promotion to FA status. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 20:54, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Look, I don't want to edit-war w/anyone. Especially, not like before. And my mention of Murray Engleheart was not meant as a subtle attack on you at all. I'm sorry you took it that way. What I am suggesting is that the book that will be coming out in January (in most of the world) will likely be the most definitive ac/dc tome ever available. It includes the participation and the cooperation of the actual band members which has never been done before and may not be accomplished again.</p>
<p>My point is that people viewing this article in the future will want to know where they can find the author's website. Not only should you look at current site information, you should look at a site's potential for accurate info in the future. That's why I support the links that I do. I would say also that much of the accurate info that's in this article comes from experts on the band like Arnaud and the owner's of the other site's that are currently linked here.</p>
<p>Rolling Stone &amp; Music Brains certainly don't qualify to be here imo when you look at what info they have and what they will likely focus on in the future concerning ac/dc. However, I've compromised on them and I'm asking for your continued compromise on the links I've posted and support being here.</p>
<p>Btw, regarding the other issue, a screenshot from a three year old dvd does not constitute any proof of acdcrocks.com being ac/dc's official site. I can show you a picture of the Back In Black album that's brand new and they still haven't got the correct song order on it after 26 years!</p>
<p>Even if they have claimed that on a dvd, they do not claim it on Sony's site now. I wonder why that is??? NCC17 22:57, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No-one's edit-warring, I specificly haven't edited the EL section again for that reason. At this moment in time, I see no reason why Electric Shock has to be included. I'm not saying it's a bad website, and I'm by no means disrespecting the owner in any way, I just don't believe it (from <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>), <i>"provide[s] a unique resource beyond what the article would contain once it becomes a Featured article."</i> To narrow that down, I don't think it gives the reader any more information that's not already in the article. If it offers any further information in the future, then we could take it into consideration again, but as of this moment, I, personally, don't believe it, like I said, offers the reader any more information than what's already there in the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's all well and good if the site's owner has written a great book on AC/DC, but his site doesn't, in my opinion warrant inclusion here. If people want to find out more about the author of the book, I'm sure a URL of his site will be included in the book, if not, a standard Google search will bring up his site.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rolling Stone does most definitely qualify to be here, as of this moment it's the only site we have listed which offers reviews on the band's albums. It also has several interesting articles, one of which is actually written by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Rubin_4c3a.html" title="Rick Rubin">Rick Rubin</a>. The biography section does show the band in a bit of a bad light...but it does show a differing POV than what's on, say, the Atlantic Records website. Thus, we're showing the reader two varying opinions on the band.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>MusicBrainz, I'm not entirely sure about...but I've seen it listed on countless other band articles (see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kid_Rock_6111.html" title="Kid Rock">Kid Rock</a>, there are many others too). Therefore, I'm sure it's included for some reason. However, if no-one can provide a valid reason as to why it should be listed here, I agree with you on this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Why don't you think this constitutes as it being the official website? This is the only evidence I've seen which confirms any of the record sites we have listed as official, something I think we should take into consideration. None of the other websites have themselves listed as officials, but really, anyone could create a website and call it the <i>official</i> AC/DC website. Therefore having the word "official" in the actualy website does not necessarily make it so. And to further add to this, why would Sony say their website is official on the DVD if it wasn't? Surely for something like that, Albert Music would have taken notice and taken appropriate legal action against Sony for this offence?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To sum up, I'm willing to reach a comprimise with you, but not if it violates <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. I see no reason to include websites which provide no further information than what's already in the article.</dd>

<p>If you make an agreement with other people you should learn to stick to that and not go back on what you've said. Okay, so you changed your mind.

<dd>Don't patronise me, <i>kid</i>. You most definitely haven't made any decent contributions to <i>any</i> AC/DC article in the past six months, just disputes over these silly links.

I didn't just swoop in here and change the links, you obviously have no idea what's went on here the past few months do you? I made a proposal at the start of this discussion, <a href="../../../n/o/-/User%7ENo-Bullet_ab70.html" title="User:No-Bullet">User:No-Bullet</a> agreed to it and a few days later an anon IP chnged the section to what No-Bullet and I agreed to.

<p>Hey, so now you're removing Soothing's links from the talk page? What juvenile behavior! However, two can play this game.</p>
<p>None of these links violate the <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> by the way. The <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> is only a general guideline whose obvious purpose is to block pay sites from being listed as links on wikipedia. If you truly believe that it excludes all sites that you have to sign up for, which it does not, then you cannot possibly list acdcrocks.com here because you have to sign up on that site as well to get much of it's content.</p>
<p>And btw, not every editor has time to check in with this site daily or even weekly. So you waited two whole days and then you and NoBullet decided you had a new consensus and everybody is supposed to accept that? What a joke!</p>
<p>Okay, so NoBullet archived the discussion. Why take it off this page at all? It was a pretty important agreement that many editors had come to which, incidentally, solved a lot of problems this page was having.

<p>Did we not agree a few months ago to use the "Classic" line-up in this section? I.e. the one with Bon Scott? It seems the most relevant to me.

<dd>Who says the "classic" line-up included Mark Evans and not Cliff Williams? It seems hard to justify, and "classic" is a POV word... <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 16:25, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, that was just what was on the archive page when I copy/pasted it; Cliff Williams is probably more relevent. Well then we should find an alternative to the word "Classic", because I just don't see the point of having the Dave Evans/Original line-up there, that line-up just wasn't important; they only released one single IIRC, which was later re-recorded., therefore, I don't know why people think D. Evans deserves a special mention in that section over Bon Scott.</p>
<p>User:209.105.206.97 wants the Dave Evans line-up there (from my talk page) <i>"because that is what the earlist lineup is"</i>, but I don't see the point in that argument. It's the earliest line-up sure, but why should it get preference over a Bon Scott line-up? <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51"><b>ĤĶ</b><i>51</i>→</a><sup><a href="../../../h/k/5/User_talk%7EHK51_1c98.html" title="User talk:HK51">Łalk</a></sup> 16:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I certainly don't see the point in having the original Dave Evans line-up there - they might have been the first but they're hardly vital to the story. Isn't there a timeline of line-ups somewhere? If so, then the only line-up you need to have separately is the current one. A lot of people would argue that it's the "classic" line-up anyway, the line-up that recorded "Back In Black". I just don't see any great relevance in plucking another line-up from the 70s and putting it in a separate section, just because they recorded the best music according to most of us. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 18:08, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The member timeline page is: <a href="../../../p/a/s/Past_members_of_AC_DC_0818.html" title="Past members of AC/DC">Past members of AC/DC</a>. I see a relevance to a Bon Scott line-up in that Scott is very integral to the story, it was with him the band earned their international success. Having said that, you're right, it is hard to justify any line-up as "Classic", so I'd be happy with just the current line-up there, just as long as the Dave Evans line-up isn't placed there as well. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51"><b>ĤĶ</b><i>51</i>→</a><sup><a href="../../../h/k/5/User_talk%7EHK51_1c98.html" title="User talk:HK51">Łalk</a></sup> 23:07, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't think there should be a classic lineup section. classic is an opinion. Wikipedia deals in facts, not opinions. I consider the first line up the original lineup. I also think that bon scott was the best singer of the three; also that brian johnson was the most influential. we should just classify the lineups by date, not by which one was the classic one or not.

<p>Is this sentence, "The track selection of this album was heavily weighted towards the more recent <i>T.N.T.</i> and included only two songs from their first LP, <i>Little Lover</i> and <i>She's Got Balls</i>", supposed to mean:</p>

<p>I've been copy editing <a href="../../../a/c/2F/AC_DC_2284.html" title="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> and in my opinion the following sentence is half meaningless rock-journalese and detracts from the encyclopedic tone of an otherwise excellent article but I haven't removed it (so interested editors can discuss this among themselves):</p>
<ul>
<li>"The previous albums gave some ground to unheard elements, like backing vocals, but still feature the AC/DC minimalism signature; loud, simple, pounding riffs and grooving backbeats.&lt; ref name="AMG" / &gt;" (I have no idea what the first half of this sentence means and if "elements" are "unheard" then how are they on an album&#160;???&#160;!!!)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The sentence should be "some ground to previously unheard elements". Anyway, I added that to the sound sample, so remove it if you want. <a href="../../../n/o/-/User%7ENo-Bullet_ab70.html" title="User:No-Bullet">No-Bullet</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/-/User_talk%7ENo-Bullet_2850.html" title="User talk:No-Bullet">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_No-Bullet_c3b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/No-Bullet">Contribs</a>) 22:08, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the Bonfire book says that, I'll quote you the paragraph: "The unleashing of Highway To Hell in 1979 however was a whole new shipping container of nitro glycerine.

<p>While I've been copy editing, IP 138.130.161.241 changed "Sydney" to "Adelaide" in the History section. It's the only contribution from that IP. I'm drawing it to your attention because I don't know if it's a correction by an anonymous editor or vandalism (most of the google hits say they moved to Sydney) and I don't want it to be missed because all my minor edits push it off the article's first history page.

<dd>No. It does not matter that the band is Australian. The name of the band (singular) is AC/DC. You can substitute the name with the word 'band' in any sentence, and the rules of plurality are the same. The band is old = AC/DC is old. This is k nown as a discretionary plural, as described in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_plural.html" title="English plural">English_plural</a>, as incorporated in <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMos_eda7.html" title="WP:Mos">WP:Mos</a> by reference. In this case, it would be equally correct to use 'is' or 'are', so the original editor's format should not be changed. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 20:33, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The lead had 'are' originally, thus, seen as you've stated both are correct, it should stay. Everything else in the article must be converted to have 'band' as plural for consistancy. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51"><b>ĤĶ</b><i>51</i>→</a><sup><a href="../../../h/k/5/User_talk%7EHK51_1c98.html" title="User talk:HK51">Łalk</a></sup> 21:27, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In other matters of English variation, it seems that "in the charts" is the UK phrase, while "on the charts" is the North American phrase. During a copyedit, I innocently converted "in" to "on", but you are welcome to revert them. –<a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutriggr_fee9.html" title="User:Outriggr"><font color="#112299">Outriggr</font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../o/u/t/User_talk%7EOutriggr_67e3.html" title="User talk:Outriggr"><i>§</i></a> 04:01, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
