<h2><span class="mw-headline">1</span></h2>
<p>The name AC/DC had nothing to do with the bisexual connotations that people have given it. The band started at the catholic highschool, Ashfield Boys High School, and the name "Anti-Christ/Devil Child" was solely to piss off the fathers who taught the school. Catholic teenage rebellion at its finest. Nothing to do with Satanism or any other cult crap. This information comes straight from the original Ashfield Boys School AC/DC drummer, (who, incidentally, told Angus that T.N.T. would never be a hit after they first played it at a highschool dance), Gary Baldwin.</p>
<p>--Gary's next door neighbor</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's total nonsense, made up by someone pretending, wishing to be an expert on the band. Yes, and I'm Angus Young's illegitimate child. There's no question that the name is about electrical currents. If you weren't blinded by fantasy, you'd notice the theme that's so clear and un-subtle that I'm ashamed to be discussing this: High Voltage, Powerage, Volts, the lightning bolt between AC and DC, every album cover. I don't think theresa knott was questioning the original inspiration for the name, but was more likely considering the possibility that AC/DC was aware of the bisexual connotation and acknowledged it. Your creating a falsified account of how the name originated doesn't at all refute theresa's arugment. But the fact of the matter is that, even if they were aware of the connotation, they say that they weren't, as Tlshd mentions, and it isn't up to us to question that in a Wikipedia article without actual evidence.<a href="../../../t/y/h/User%7ETyharvey313_16c2.html" title="User:Tyharvey313">Tyharvey313</a> 03:03, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it just me, or does anyone else think they <i>must</i> have been aware of the bisexual meaning of ACDC&#160;? Why the school boy uniform&#160;? Why the verse in dirty deeds done dirt cheap&#160;?</p>

"You got problems in your life of love
You got a broken heart
(She's) He's double dealin' with your best friend
That's when the teardrops start - fella
Pick up the phone
I'm here alone
Or make a social call
Come right in
Forget about him
We'll have ourselves a ball"

<dd>He's supposed to be talking about a woman in that verse, "<b>he's</b> double dealin' with your best friend". I believe when AC/DC started, Angus was still in school. He had shows right after school and didn't have time to change his clothes, so he just played in them. He liked how it looked and stuck with it. --65.33.71.42 23:01, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The lyrics cited above are--at best--unsubstantiated, and are, IMHO, inaccurate. The lyric sleeve that shipped with the LP copy I own (Atlantic catalog:K50323) doesn't include the term "fella"--the line is printed as "That's when the teardrops start -". I've listened to this song over the past two decades and I have always heard the same utterance after the word 'start', that is "wella" (i.e. well ah). This is simply a pick-up to the next line and nothing else.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Actually, if you were going to make your argument using the lyrics to "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" you could have picked the stanza that begins "If ya got a lady but you want her gone..." and ends "For a fee I'll be happy to be, Your back door man". This lyric can be taken <i>many different ways</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of these arguments I think it's ridiculous to argue--the band has commented on the origin of the name several times, and at no time has any of them mentioned bisexuality.</dd>

<dd>I've read what you say on that page. I was following the story at the time for <a href="http://rocknerd.org/" class="external free" title="http://rocknerd.org/" rel="nofollow">http://rocknerd.org/</a> - the Snopes page came out saying "FALSE" while the story was actually still unfolding, and their "false" was at the time based solely on a CC press release <i>after</i> the flap, which greatly discredited Snopes' opinion on the matter in my eyes. It's also prominent in the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clear_Channel_Communications_80cb.html" title="Clear Channel Communications">Clear Channel Communications</a> article.

<dd>Hi, I appreciate that you were documenting it at the time, that counts for a lot. I think the problem with the way it's worded is that it claims CC main office management devised and "sent out" the list which according to all accounts I've read is inaccurate -- a couple of station managers sent out an e-mail which was passed around and modified (unless you are claiming from your research at the time that you know differently; this seems to be the version accepted by all sides). This is much less noteworthy in my opinion, and would require so many weasel words as to become quite weak. <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 18:07, 15 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, I heard the bisexual meaning of AC/DC was unintentional.</p>
<p>Why is there no comprehensive list of members on this page. The only reason I came here was to find out the drummer's name. wtf?</p>
<p>Although I know they spent their adult lives in Australia (well, most of it on tour round the world...), I have added the Young brothers and Bon Scott to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Scots_7b76.html" title="List of Scots">List of Scots</a>.

<p><b>It was on VH1's Biography of AC/DC. It was their sisters sewing machine that had ac/dc on it. In fact according to what Angus and Mal said on this program his first school boy stage suite was made by his sister on this very same sewing machine. The rumor has always been around that the band are satanists. Mal put that rumor to rest clearly. He said, "Me mom would kill me for that!" So I don't think the good ole' boys from down under worship satan. It was very informative and enjoyable. So I hope this may clear up the question.</b></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Album Inconsistency?</span></h2>
<p>I've noticed that a few of the special 2003 digipak remastered albums are listed, but not all of them. I believe all of AC/DC's international studio albums (Simply meaning not the Australian High Voltage and TNT) are now out on digipak, with the exception of Stiff Upper Lip. This leads me to wonder whether it's typical to list remastered releases by bands at all. If this article were to note all the digipaks and then even previous remasters, it would produce a lot of clutter. I suggest that either the digipaks be removed from the studio album list, or all other remasters be added. While I prefer the former, if it turns out that the latter is more appropriate: please do not forget the fresh October 18 2005 issuing of the Ballbreaker digipak. Thanks to whoever gives this attention. - G R Early --64.217.224.239 16:15, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thats not true...Cliff Williams was not a memeber of the band until 1978, so he did not have an input in the name of the band</p>

no the razor's edge was a song and the band was known as ac/dc in 1973. cliff was not a member until 1978, so ha ha ha. also all the other names suggested are listed in the family jewls DVD set k..</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">They're not bisexual</span></h2>
<p>They had no idea it was another way of saying bisexual. Hell, I'd never even heard of that until about last year. It's an electricity thing, stands for "Alternate Current/Direct Current". They got it from the back of a vacuum cleaner or a sewing machine, I've heard both stories. As for the schoolboy outfit, Angus and Malcom's sister suggested he wear it on stage, saying "it would give the audience something to look at". Although her suggestion probably did come from the fact that, as a kid, Angus would come home from school and start playing guitar right away without changing out of his school uniform. Also, Angus was 18 when the band was forming in 1973, so he would've been out of school by that time.</p>
<p>Also, Cliff Williams wouldn't have been able to suggest a name for the band in their early years, since he wasn't even in the band until late 1977. And they're not all from Scotland. Angus and Malcolm are from Glasgow (moved to Sydney when Ang was 5, and Mal was 7). Bon Scott was from Scotland, too, but I can't remember what city. Phil Rudd's from Queensland, Australia, I think. Cliff Williams is from England, as is Brian Johnson. And thier ex-bassist Mark Evans is from Australia, too.</p>
<p>One last thing, that first guy was right, they have nothing to do with occult stuff. Angus played in a church as a kid, actually. -- TMFSG, December 2, 2005.</p>
<p>Wait, one more thing. I dont' know if you want to add this, but while it was around, the Soviet Union compiled a list of 12 bands they considered "idealogically harmful", and AC/DC was on it. I think they were #9.</p>
<p><br />
hey i know that AC/DC is not bisexual because i am Anguses #1 fan... i can play all there songs and i happen to now his entire life and i know that the only reson this story got out was because Bon Scott and Angus were the best of friends and some people thought they hung out with each other to much. people also thought that because Angus wore a school uniform to shows that they were showing suggestive theams such as the story about the priest haveing sex with the kid....well thats another reason why people thought they were Bi. so thats it k -By: Jam Lee of the band"Thorns Of Glory".</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ballbreaker and Digipaks</span></h2>
<p>I posted here earlier as GR Early about Ballbreaker and the other digipak re-releases of albums. Firstly, I've corrected the date of the Ballbreaker digipak release from November to October 2005. However, I still think the listing of studio albums is sloppy as long as some digipaks are listed but not others. We should really decide whether to show all of them or show none. I would rather not make this edit myself without discussing it.</p>
<p>Also, regarding Cliff Williams suggesting a name for the band, please note that he was not a member of the band until years after it was formed. I have to wonder where you heard this. Decatur 05:48, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>are you completely sure they said "we write songs to make a point and give the listener a picture."? because that seems way out of their style. Malcolm has said before, "[<i>when asked about AC/DC's lyrics</i>] If people wanna hear deep lyrics, they can listen to R.E.M. or whatever. But at the end of the night, they wanna go home and get fucked. And that's where we come in"</p>
<p>hey i agree with you about evrything its just if u do on vh1.com and look up AC/DC they give you an interveiw with Brian Jhonsen and Angus Young and i forget what Angus said but they talked about what style of music and how they made the music and lyrics so go check it out K.</p>

<p>Although commonly referred to as an Australian band (and they may well class themselves as Aussies) it is true that Bon, Angus and Malcolm (and George, 3rd brother and later their producer) were all Scottish and by definition therefore, BRITISH. No argument there then. And Brian Johnson is most definitely British, from my home town of Newcastle England. Phil's an Aussie, so like is mentioned above, lets leave it as 'International'.

<p>Yes it can be AC/DC is a much larger act outside of the US.</p>
<p>There's a major problem with the text on album sales in the Wiki text. I can't find a single website that lists Back in Black as selling 42 million copies worldwide, or selling 21 million copies in the US. Most websites variously list The Eagles, Michael Jackson, Fleetwood Mac, the Beatles, Elvis etc, as being the top 5, although they normally suggest US album sales only. The best I could find was a website suggesting Back In Black sold 19 millions worldwide. Also, Wiki suggests that no list can be difinitive, as no organisation ranks international sales.

<dd>Note that the phrase refers to "production values" not "quality of the songs." I think <i>Flick of the Switch</i> is a great album, but it has a muffled sound and in some places a lack of attention to detail that a top producer like Mutt Lange would likely have fixed, but as the album was "produced by AC/DC" a lot of the finer touches are missing. Just off the top of my head, there's what sounds like a bad edit in "Nervous Shakedown"; an experienced producer would probably also have told the drummer to quit hitting the crash cymbal every four measures.</dd>

<dd>Whatever the flaws of FOTS, the production of <i>Fly on the Wall</i> is far worse; Brian Johnson and Cliff Williams are inexplicably buried in the mix, and it's a horribly muddy arrangement with a counterproductive overuse of reverb. This is a shame, because the songs on it are consistently good, and if an experienced producer had worked with it instead of it being produced by Malcolm and Angus it would undoubtedly have worked out much better. This is a point made by many reviewers at the time. I'm surprised the record label allowed it to be released as it was. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 09:57, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone tell me why 'legendary' should be a 'point of view' when used as an adjective for Bon Scott? Characterizing Scott as a legend, when it is so widely acknowledged and well known that he has been an influence on everyone from contemporaries like Van Halen, to all three vocalists of Iron Maiden and to even the latest Garage Rock Bands and an icon to generations of fans, born after his passing, is surely not out of place. When Classic Rock Magazine ranked him as number one on the list of 100 Greatest frontmen and celebrated his 25th death anniversary with a cover saying Bon Scott: Hero Icon Legend, it reflected the popular sentiment among the band's fans and Rock enthusiasts in general.Bon Scott has been widely called legendary and charismatic, both of which are arguably points of view.If an editor has no problem with 'charismatic', he/she should not have a problem with legendary.210.211.198.46 03:04, 30 April 2006 (UTC)210.211.198.46</p>

- Good point, but the fact is that many contemporaries of AC/DC's including bands that were older than them were influenced by them. The energy of their live performances especially, made an impact on many Bands who toured with them in their early years.For example, Jounrney is an older band, but they toured with AC/DC, after their arrival on the scene. The vocalist at the time, Steve Perry has gone on record as to how Bon Scott and the band's high energy Rock N Roll galvanized their own act and their style from that time on.There are other bands who would have likewise been afftected. A band cannot be excluded from this list, solely because they were older than AC/DC.61.17.69.201````</p>

There were a couple of other names mentioned at the time by the press - Alan Friar, Stevie Wright for example, that we could mention as well. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 20:58, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "rainbow pride" list was certainly unique and artistic. The one thats there now follows a common format found on many Wikipedia music articles. I have not seen any discussion on them in any of the Wikipedia music project discussion pages so I don't know if the "common" format stems from any kind of consensus? If it does then it should be standard throughout all Wikipedia music articles. <a href="../../../1/5/6/User%7E156.34.142.158.html" title="User:156.34.142.158">156.34.142.158</a> 16:32, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">#4?</span></h2>
<p>do we really have to include the VH1 #4 bit so high up in the article it really is not such a big honor, perhaps we can replace it with a #1, because honestly making #4 on a VH1 list is not thta big of a deal and i think we can find something to replace it, like maybe something from kerrang magizine - Ishmaelblues</p>

<dd>That list has "Dirty Deeds" released in 1981, as it was in the States. Everywhere else it was 1976. It also doesn't include the Aussie "High Voltage".
