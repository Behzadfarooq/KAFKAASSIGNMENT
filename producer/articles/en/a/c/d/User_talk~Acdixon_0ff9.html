<p>Hi there. Just completed a major renovation of the template. I hope it solves most or all of the remaining issues with it.

<p>I've been dumping counties as mid-importance, and most "local" cities as low. It's my feeling that we need to focus on county development before city development. Now, Louisville, Lexington, Frankfort, Newport, and the like are higher priority than say, Hardinsburg, Brandenburg, etc., or at least that's how I envision it. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldan_2c27.html" title="User:Soldan">Soldan</a> 17:32, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, going through some of these articles, I've come across some very strong ones that we might want to try to push to feature status. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrie_Nation_5fd0.html" title="Carrie Nation">Carrie Nation</a> and the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrollton_bus_disaster.html" title="Carrollton bus disaster">Carrollton bus disaster</a> are both very strong, and I don't think it would take much to get them to GA status or better.<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldan_2c27.html" title="User:Soldan">Soldan</a> 19:35, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For that matter, we can go ahead and start posting "close to good" articles on the project page as we find them. Put them somewhere on the main page, which needs a coat of whitewash anyway.

<p>Oops -- silly me. I read "Glasgow" in her row on the list and immediately thought of Glasgow, Scotland, without clicking on the link; figured it was one of those traveling parents things and they lived there for work, but she moved to Lexington later in her life.

<p>Hi Acdixon! Good to talk to someone with an interest in KY. &#160;:-) When I looked in to your request to changed the name, I noticed that the name had been changed in the reverse a few months back. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_from_Kentucky&amp;diff=61466915&amp;oldid=61303664" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_from_Kentucky&amp;diff=61466915&amp;oldid=61303664" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p>Thanks for the very kind words!!! I submitted this article for a peer review a while back, and the only negative was the lack of citations. I have not had a chance to go back and add them in, but your words are an incentive now to do so. I will try to tackle this over the next couple of weeks while on business trips.

<li>Looking on your userpage I see that you are a fellow Republican. Even though there is a category labeling "American conservatives", the category labeling "American liberals" is up for deletion. This is obviously by liberals who don't want the bias pov of liberal celebrities and public figures to be known. So they don't want them categorized as what they are...liberals. I'm asking you to go to "Category:American liberals" follow the link to the nomination page and please vote to keep the category. -- <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmeriCan_b85d.html" title="User:AmeriCan">AmeriCan</a> 17:43, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is a problem; see below.</p>
<p>I revised the page because the new macros used to define the entries provide more information and make the internal format of the page cleaner (at least in my opinion). I shall try to finish the page by moving the rest of the entries to the new table format by the end of today, and then you can propose it as a best list. <a href="../../../r/f/c/User%7ERfc1394_3d02.html" title="User:Rfc1394">Paul Robinson (Rfc1394)</a> 18:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I noticed when I was adding the FIPS codes for each county, that in the list of counties which include histories, <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_County%2C_Kentucky_3239.html" title="Wayne County, Kentucky">Wayne County</a> is missing, but it appears in the census info list. This will need to be fixed; I will put the county in the table with empty history information and you can look it up. <a href="../../../r/f/c/User%7ERfc1394_3d02.html" title="User:Rfc1394">Paul Robinson (Rfc1394)</a> 19:00, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your edit of January 26 created two tables listing the counties to change the article from your edit of January 15. Unfortunately when you did the edit of January 26 you left out Wayne County in the new table. You need to see if there is a map image for that county. I was just mostly checking to make sure I hadn't made the mistake. I won't criticize because I've made errors too, and I realized that I could have made the same mistake, so the only suggestion I will make is when doing a long list of items, you might try comparing item by item against another list so you don't miss any; that's how I spotted the missing item. I'm thinking it would have been embarrassing to propose it as a featured list and they point out it's incorrect, or worse, if it gets approved and it's discovered later that it was.&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/f/c/User%7ERfc1394_3d02.html" title="User:Rfc1394">Paul Robinson (Rfc1394)</a> 19:14, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is kind of funny.<br />
I gather you copied the entry for Washington County to create the entry for Wayne County. When I was saving my changes I got an edit conflict. So I checked and found you had added the new information for Wayne County. <i>However</i>, the map specified for Wayne County was the map for Washington County! I did correct that, however. I find it kind of funny, so don't think I'm picking on you. &#160;:) <a href="../../../r/f/c/User%7ERfc1394_3d02.html" title="User:Rfc1394">Paul Robinson (Rfc1394)</a> 20:40, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have converted the census table from standard table syntax into a macro. The size of the source page dropped from 96K to 53K.</li>
<li>If you look at the internal format of the table entries, the way they are shown is much clearer and better formatted. Also, each row of the table is now one line instead of 11. It definitely makes it easier to update if needed.</li>

<p>Hello! If you are receiving this message, that means that your user page is in a specific year category. Per a recent user-category per deletion, all specific year categories are to be deleted. If you wish to continue using year categories, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using an age group category, such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_in_their_30s_2bf8.html" title="Category:Wikipedians in their 30s">Category:Wikipedians in their 30s</a></li>

</ul>
<p>If you wish, you may do both. Hopefully, this change in categorization will be quick and painless. Happy editing! --An automated message from <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedRobot_c4d1.html" title="User:MessedRobot">MessedRobot</a> 12:59, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for adding the extremely impressive image map to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_counties_in_Kentucky_fe0f.html" title="List of counties in Kentucky">List of counties in Kentucky</a>. In the interests or readability, I moved it from the very start of the page to lower down. I restored the individual county maps, as they enable anybody reading the article to instantly see where the county there are interested in is. I also dropped the size of the image slightly to prevent horizontal scrollbars (you don't have to chnage the image maps co-ords for that). <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETompw_aa36.html" title="User:Tompw">Tom<small>pw</small></a> (<a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETompw_bf4a.html" title="User talk:Tompw">talk</a>) 11:35, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Glad to see you like the new feature. I - and others - had been "lobbying" the developers to put some form of clickmap capability in the Wikimedia software for quite some time now and once it was announced that it was available, I tried it out in a couple of pages first (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Texas_area_codes_5294.html" title="List of Texas area codes">List of Texas area codes</a>) and how it and each area code page's map interconnects to all the other area codes in that state along with neighboring states. There was a minor error that I - and others - had discovered which was fixed, and now the feature works and it really hepls. I even paid the shareware fee for a program that allows creation of clickmaps, then I use Word Perfect to translate the map from the standard format to Wikipedia's specification.</p>
<p>Where I was first thinking about it was a clickable map of the United States, and this is now also another good feature. <a href="../../../r/f/c/User%7ERfc1394_3d02.html" title="User:Rfc1394">Paul Robinson (Rfc1394)</a> 19:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your message. I discovered a gold mine of pictures at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers <a href="http://images.usace.army.mil/" class="external text" title="http://images.usace.army.mil/" rel="nofollow">Digital Visual Library</a> and I have been mining it for all it's worth. They have thousands of pictures there, mostly of lakes, dams, and rivers, of course, since that's what they do. Frankly, most of their photographs are of rather low quality, but they are certainly better than nothing! ●<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> • <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanMS_16c9.html" title="User talk:DanMS">Talk</a> 23:50, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
