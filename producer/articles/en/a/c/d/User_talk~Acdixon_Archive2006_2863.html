<p>The article that you had created, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Family_Foundation_of_Kentucky_a2cb.html" title="The Family Foundation of Kentucky">The Family Foundation of Kentucky</a>, was deemed <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">non-notable</a> for organizations. Below is the criteria guidelines:</p>
<p><a name="Criteria_For_Organizations" id="Criteria_For_Organizations"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/d/User_talk%7EAcdixon_Archive2006_2863.html" title="Edit section: Criteria For Organizations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criteria For Organizations</span></h3>
<ol>
<li>Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verified</a> by a third party source.
<ul>
<li>Individual chapters of national and international organizations are usually not notable enough to warrant a separate article unless sufficient notability is established through reliable and verifiable sources. However, chapter information is welcome for inclusion into wikipedia in list articles as long as only verifiable information is included.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found.</li>

<p>Notability can be asserted for organizations through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inclusion in third party published materials.</li>
<li>A significant amount of media coverage that is not trivial in nature and that deals specifically with the organization as the primary subject:
<ul>
<li>For example, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, <a href="../../../u/c/_/UC_Berkeley_d44e.html" title="UC Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a> enforced a moratorium on alcohol for fraternities and sororities. The moratorium became a much covered topic in the media outlets in the San Francisco Bay Area. While this asserts notability for the moratorium and the greek system at Berkeley and possibly justifies an article either on the moratorium or the greek system in general, it does not assert notability for an individual chapter of a fraternity or sorority on campus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following cannot be used to assert notability:</p>
<ol>
<li>Internal documents cannot be used as an assertion of notability. However, they can be used as source material for an article.
<ul>
<li>Internal documents can include, reports, newsletters, press releases, magazines and websites published by the organization itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Student-run newspapers.</li>
</ol>
<p>A search-engine search of the Internet may have been performed, and was not seen as notable enough. However, <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&amp;fr=slv8-&amp;p=%22The%20family%20Foundation%20of%20Kentucky%22" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&amp;fr=slv8-&amp;p=%22The%20family%20Foundation%20of%20Kentucky%22" rel="nofollow">I performed a search</a> and have seen alot of references to it.

<p>Hi. Sorry I didn't respond earlier; my daughter was just born last week.</p>
<p>I've reverted my redirect of the article, even though I'm not entirely convinced it's necessary to have an article separate from on on UK basketball (or UK athletics in general).</p>
<p>I also find it odd that 2 of the 3 external links are to UK websites that aren't directly related to fandom, and the third is called "Wildcat Nation" rather than "Big Blue Nation". The only reference in the article doesn't mention the term "Big Blue Nation" either. This seems like a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> problem that could probably be fixed with some editing. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffspear_16b0.html" title="User:Geoffspear">Geoffrey Spear</a> 19:59, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Acdixon,</p>
<p>If I'm gonna be involved, then Christamas sounds good. I'm swamped. You can do it yourself tho. It's not difficult at all, conceptually, there's just many categories to be created (perhaps twenty to 23; could be less if you desire fewer categorization options) and put into a hierarchy. Once you've done it once, it's a cakewalk. Later! --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELing.Nut_3c51.html" title="User:Ling.Nut">Ling.Nut</a> 15:57, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can't find that much about the "notable person" either, so I am inclined to leave it off for the intern. At any rate, it would fit under Flatwoods, not Ashland, but since the cities involved are quite small, it should be noted that the person was "born in Flatwoods" if it does pan out. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 03:18, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The next step up from a B-rating is a good article rating. Unfortunately, that is a more formal designation, and articles really only get that after being submitted to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_eaa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles">Wikipedia:Good articles</a>. So, I gave it a "B"-rating because that was the highest one I could give it myself. You may wish to submit the article for peer review and/or list it on the page <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_Candidates_8f1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles/Candidates">Wikipedia:Good articles/Candidates</a> to see if it can receive the more formal Good Article standing. There was no disparagement of the work of the article, again, it's just that a "B" rating is really the highest rating an article can get from me as an individual in this more-or-less informal way. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 15:04, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right, an article can be made an "A"-class article without going through Good article recognition first, as an A-status is also basically an informal status. Unfortunately, I have myself discovered several so-called "A" articles which failed when nominated for Good article status, and on that basis hesitate to possibly mistakenly overrate an article as an "A" only to have it crash down to a "B" status after a failed good article review. So, in practice, I tend to error on the side of caution and give an article which hasn't been recognized as a good article the "B" class. This avoids the possibly disspiriting relegation later. The good article review is also rather more in depth than the more basic review I give, and in several cases I have found that I mistakenly overlooked insufficient referencing or other faults which prevented an article reaching good article status. Again, almost all of the assessments as placed in banners are less formal ones, generally for letting a project interested in an article have a rough idea of the article's current status so it can know how much effort to put in its improvement, than those given by the good article and featured article reviews, which are more formal procedures. I just want you to know that I wasn't in any way denigrating the quality of the article, just basically erring on the side of caution. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 15:30, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I noted that there is no real climate section as it is, and that several people have been stressing that having one is important for comprehensiveness. It might be a good idea to indicate if there are any high ranking officials of the various creeds in the state, like Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran or Methodists bishops or archbishops and other notable leaders, although I'm not sure if it's required. You do want to remove the duplication of the percentage of Catholics, though. The sports section could make reference to any notable minor league teams or non-major sports teams, but I only would if they are particularly notable in their fields (past champions, that sort of thing). Lastly, the government sections, particularly the lead, are really short. One sentence sections are a definite no-no. I know that all that might sound like a lot, but I don't think it's really much, and much of it might not be required anyway. It does look like a good solid article, and like I said, even many of the things I cited might not be seen as being vital anyway. I'd still try to do something about them, particularly the climate and government sections, as I think that those might very well be counted as important. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 16:07, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After that, you'll wanna make major edits to the template that places articles in your WikiProject. You may need more help witht that; I'll be glad to help. Essentially, you'll wanna copy {{<a href="../../../e/t/h/Template%7EEthnic_groups_825d.html" title="Template:Ethnic groups">Ethnic groups</a>}}. Don't copy the Hawaii template; I haven't made the necessary changes to set the small option (to compare, see <a href="../../../p/o/p/Talk%7EPopora_people_5303.html" title="Talk:Popora people">Talk:Popora people</a> &amp; <a href="../../../h/o/a/Talk%7EHoanya_people_f0a3.html" title="Talk:Hoanya people">Talk:Hoanya people</a>.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I'll be around in case you have any questions. My internet access is much more limited over the holidays than is usually the case, but we aren't in any huge hurry, are we..?</p>
<p>Drop me a line any time with any question at all.. --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELing.Nut_3c51.html" title="User:Ling.Nut">Ling.Nut</a> 16:26, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS I just thought that I could make it a little easier.. here, click these redlinks, and copy the contents of relevant Hawaii template to the new Kentucky category, altering things slightly:</p>

<p>Hi. I'll be happy to provide technical assistance on this if you need it, especially on templates. I'm still in the process of refining WPLou's system, but I think I have it nailed down enough to be able to help others with similar systems. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 02:07, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Apparently "Stevie is the man" is very knowledgeable. Feel free to ask him any questions.</li>
<li>At this point, tho, unless someone has screwed up the categories (quite possible), you can just start assessing articles &amp; leaving comments. If there are q's that Stevie can't answer, drop me a line.</li>
