<p>I don't think sea urchin roe is "repulsive enough" to be an acquired taste. Anyone else? -HiFiGuy 17:17, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I think that this is anyway a subjective classification. I would say the beer is an acquired taste, for example, since most people that come enventually to enjoy it, find it repulsive when they taste it for the first time. <a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaintCahier_e74e.html" title="User:SaintCahier">SaintCahier</a> 15:30, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think most people actually like coffee (unless it's especially bitter, old or of low quality) on the first instance they try it. --<a href="../../../b/j/a/User%7EBjankuloski06en_b36a.html" title="User:Bjankuloski06en">B. Jankuloski</a> 12:00, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Coffee by itself is certainly an acquired taste, as it is bitter and doesn't really have any flavor to recommend it. Loaded up with so much cream and sugar, and possibly other flavors as well--as it is drank by many (most?) people--and it's virtually a liquid dessert.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Were it not for its caffeine, I doubt coffee-drinking would have ever caught on in the first place.</dd>

<p>Yes, things are all subjective here, but there will always be someone, somewhere that will say "product x" is an acquired taste. What I hope t his page would limit itself to is exotic things; or things whose popularity is limited, perhaps to certain locales, because they're somehow repulsive. With "a Starbucks Coffee on every corner," "Guinness available in bars and stores worldwide," and Uni widely available in most any Japanese restaurant, I'm inclined to vote against those three being acquired tastes. -HiFiGuy 19:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But they are ALL acquired taste. I think we should put coffee and such as they can provide an adequite understanding of what acquired taste is. If we merely put disgusting and unsanitary foods here, people will think that that is what acquired taste <i>is</i>. We don't have to list all acquired tastes here, but I still think that we should put coffee as one, as it is a commonly used example of acquired taste. We are not talking about exotic food. Also, I have no idea what Uni is, so it's certainly <i>not</i> too common <a href="../../../r/e/p/User%7ERepku_4f10.html" title="User:Repku">Repku</a> 19:26, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Oh, if people were thinking of putting coffee on here, I'd counter that I wouldn't even consider <a href="../../../k/o/p/Kopi_Luwak_480d.html" title="Kopi Luwak">Kopi Luwak</a> to be an acquired taste. Its taste or aroma seems appealing enough to most coffee drinkers, though its harvesting/production method is... quite unorthodox. -HiFiGuy 19:28, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's verging on absurd listing coffee here. It's the <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">second most commonly traded commodity in the world</a>. Almost everything could be considered acquired tastes, using such criteria. The only foodstuff all humans unconditionally like is probably breast milk. I strongly suggest coffee to be removed. Until this is further discussed, I resist myself to placing the list entry in its correct alphabetical order. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevanatha_69bd.html" title="User:Devanatha">Devanatha</a> 10:18, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I certainly didn't like the taste of coffee the first time I tried it and I still don't. It has an unusual taste that many people find offensive. 68.2.136.114 21:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I really don't think Guinness should be included on this list. Its certainly a "special" taste, but if you class it as acquired then suddenly a flood of other foods should be added (coffee, tea, black olives, general beer, spirits, etc.) Shouldn't this page be reserved for the very extreme?</p>
<p>Russell Quinn 14:27, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, I mean Guinness is one of the most popular beer brands in the world. There are things people just don't like consuming, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that, universally, it would make them an acquired taste. -HiFiGuy 19:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Am I the only one noticing that this list exclusively contains items that don't originate in the USA? I would definitely consider, just as a few examples, Dr. Pepper, root beer, bison meat or even "prarie oysters" to be acquired tastes as well!

<dl>
<dd>I think a large part of the problem is that "acquired taste" has a somewhat fuzzy definition. What's the difference between an acquired taste versus something that's just too unfamiliar? Almost anything can fall under the latter classification. It seems to me that an acquired taste goes a step beyond that. I'm sure there are acquired tastes in American cuisine, but it's hard to know how to recognize those with such a fuzzy definition to work with.</dd>
<dd>Unfortunately, we might have to choose between being overly inclusive of anything anyone doesn't like (which could be every food ever made) or have something of a cultural bias. It's far from perfect, however. Hopefully, a more specific definition of "acquired taste" can be found. 132.238.147.65 20:26, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the problem here is more that this article can never truly be anything other than Original Research, as people put down things they think are an acquired taste.

<p>I'm not a native speaker of English, so I wonder: when people say: "Well, I think this composer/ this writer/ this activity is a bit of an acquired taste...", is this a tendentially negative judgement, or are they suggesting that only a "superior" group of people who has the necessary education or experience can enjoy these things? <sub>This unsigned comment added by User:84.142.199.217</sub></p>
