<p>There is an obvious flaw in stating that this software is compliant with the GPL in any way: the code downloadable from Dave's site proclaims that it is in "full and total compliance with the LimeWire GPL," which is fallacious on many levels. First of all, there is no such thing as the "LimeWire GPL;" LimeWire uses the GNU GPL. Also, the code downloadable from Dave's site contains no obvious instructions, nor does it compile on its own. This is all in addition to the other arguments used to show that it is in violation of the GPL. Also, the core available from the site is not up to date. Since the program downloads the core automatically if it is missing, this seems to me to be a clear violation of the GPL, in spirit, at the very least. The crippled GPL'd pieces hardly count as a product on their own.</p>
<p>As for acqlite/cabos, I am the person who acquired the code for them, and it was through Dave. However, he no longer offers any of the code which Acquisition now uses (except the aforementioned "core"), so they are not actually based on the same product. If anything, acqlite/cabos should be considered a fork of Acquisition 0.966.</p>
<p>An addendum: From the very same GPL FAQ which is linked to in this article:</p>
<p>"... pipes, sockets and command-line arguments are communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs. So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are separate programs. <i>But if the semantics of the communication are intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger program</i>" (emphasis added).</p>

<p>It should be noted that Robin, who is behind "acqlite", did not acquire his source code by any legal means. Rather, it was outright code theft. His desire to interpret the GPL beyond its legal and moral reach is simply a way for him to rationalize illegal copyright infringement and code theft. Robin has also on several occasions made knowingly false statements and fabricated the words of others to attempt to create the illusion of justification. A proven liar with an axe to grind is not what Wikipedia would consider a reliable source nor is someone who steals code really an objective source for this sort of topic.</p>
<p>If simple communication between GPL and non-GPL processes were truly an issue, then Xcode's use of gcc should be as controversial, as the situation is identical. The fact that it is a non-issue suggests that Robin's argument does not hold water and that this "controversy" is a fiction. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.145.223.6 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.145.223.6.html" title="User talk:68.145.223.6">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.145.223.6_a768.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.145.223.6">contribs</a>) 01:29, October 13, 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>User 70.79.11.216 has just reverted my attempt to clean up the controversy paragraph and make it NPOV. The problems with 70.79.11.216's version of this paragraph are (1) it's not NPOV, since it supports the Acquisition author's view, and (2) it is confusingly worded in places (for example, it doesn't make it clear that the GUI is not released under the GPL). Per <a href="../../../r/v/_/WP%7ERV_7050.html" title="WP:RV">WP:RV</a> 'do not revert good faith edits' I've unreverted back to my version.

The "author's view" is the view is supported by the GPL itself and by precedent set countless times by others, including that of Apple Computer. In other words, the "author" is not isolated in his opinion. He is but one person of a large group of people that believe that programs that run as separate processes do not need to be licensed the same way. This is a fundamental view that is written into the GPL and has been accepted and adopted by companies like Apple. The wording of this paragraph needs to reflect this fact. The author is not the aberration here. The aberration is the small group of people who think the GPL needs to be applied beyond its legal bounds. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.79.11.216_6141.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.79.11.216">70.79.11.216</a> (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.79.11.216.html" title="User talk:70.79.11.216">talk</a>) 01:41, 12 February 2007</small></p>

<dd>With respect, it's not true that "<i>programs that run as separate processes do not need to be licensed the same way</i>".

Are the two parts of Acquisition related closely enough to constitute a single work?

<dd>Almost all of the music on Gnutella is copyrighted by large media companies, and as such can't be legally downloaded or shared.

No, your editing of the paragraph to suggest that the "author" is alone or isolated in his view is introducing a POV.

<dd>Fair enough. The new version reads 'Acquisition's supporters argue that this usage is entirely permissible, as the GPL considers piped communication a valid method of separating programs in most cases.' <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpimorph_0869.html" title="User:Epimorph">Epimorph</a> 21:34, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No, that's still inappropriate. You are phrasing this as if it is a matter of opinion, when it is not. It is a matter of correctness and incorrectness. The GPL is a legal document. There is NO precedent that says that Acquisition's or Apple's use of open source components is incorrect and ample precedent to suggest that it is entirely appropriate. The GPL is written to suggest that Apple and Acquisition are in the clear, and absent any precedent that would suggest otherwise, that is a legal FACT. Some people might bemoan the limits of the GPL, but they are not judges and their opinion does not change legal reality.</p>
<p>I'd also like to suggest that, the mere fact that this "controversy" is written about in this article is a POV. The "controversy" is a generic one, regarding the extent to which the GPL is applicable. Apple is guilty of using many more open source components within closed-source suites of applications, shielded by process boundaries. Why is this "controversy" mentioned only here? I believe that there is no real controversy, it is a fiction designed specifically to add a negative POV to this article. Consequently, the entire paragraph should be removed.</p>

<dd>That seems a bit strong to me. After all, the GPL faq says 'if the semantics of the communication are intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger program'.

<dd>I can't think of any other way to do it; right now, I don't think the evidence (even the Xcode precedent) is enough to definitively say that the method of communication used in Acquisition is not intimate.

<dl>
<dd>This isn't a matter of legal precedent. There hasn't, as far as I'm aware, been a legal cases on this matter (perhaps you could point to one?). The GPL doesn't specify what's meant by 'mere aggregation', and the GPL FAQ says that components connected by pipes can sometimes constitute a single work. It's misleading to claim that Xcode <i>proves</i> that Acquisition is legal, because Xcode <i>isn't</i> Acquisition, and the the issue here is the intimacy of the communication between components. In the view of many people, Acquisition's components are intimately enough related that they ought to both be released under the GPL, while Xcode's aren't. <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpimorph_0869.html" title="User:Epimorph">Epimorph</a> 10:16, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course it's a matter of precedent. This paragraph is in place to create the illusion of abiguity and the illusion of a controversy. The author has not received any code requests in three years... how can there be a controversy in reality? Isolation and insulation of GPL code by process boundaries is standard practice. Suggesting the presence of a controversy when there is none is spin, and is a point of view.</p>

<dd>Two wrongs a right do not make. Vandalism is STILL vandalism. I've taken the liberty of alerting the administrators. If you'd actually stop, come up with something resembling proof, and discuss this...--<a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentCDE_2c9a.html" title="User:AgentCDE">AgentCDE</a> 03:38, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What you don't get is this: The LimeWire sources have been modified to make this possible. It is not like LimeWire was originally using Unix pipes or whatever to communicate between the GUI and backend. On the contrary, gdb and gcc have always been console-style applications making it easy to slap a front-end upon it. gcc is not even interactive. Furthermore, a language like Java enforces modularity. Thus, you can almost always easily grab the modules you need from such an application and let those communicate with the rest of your (closed-source) application. In other words, yes, there is a loophole in the GNU GPL, if you consider this practice legal. --82.141.49.154 01:50, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>No consensus does NOT validate ANYTHING. Also, these repeated deletions look to be in serious violation of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>.--<a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentCDE_2c9a.html" title="User:AgentCDE">AgentCDE</a> 02:49, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again, I do not see anything indicating that this paragraph doesn't belong. Stop deleting it, there ISN'T any discussion.--<a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentCDE_2c9a.html" title="User:AgentCDE">AgentCDE</a> 03:12, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
