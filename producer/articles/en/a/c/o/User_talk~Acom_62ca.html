<p>Hi, I’ve noticed you added a couple of images to plutinos' infoboxes. Such header images (compare with a few Main belt asteroids boxes) usually state clearly what they are (e.g. an actual picture for a lucky few, an artist’s vision, a computer plot generated with the given data set etc). Could you please add a short comment like this to <a href="../../../2/8/9/28978_Ixion_d0d8.html" title="28978 Ixion">28978 Ixion</a> &amp; <a href="../../../9/0/4/90482_Orcus_ce26.html" title="90482 Orcus">90482 Orcus</a> (and Sedna)? (on the image page).</p>
<p>The colours are an important differentiator among these objects. There’s more than one way to express them (including the albedo). In addition, the colour/albedo data for some of them are limited and a stream of new observations is making the images obsolete. (This happened to some of my images in just a couple of months!) I’ve been contributing for a while now to the physical characteristics, including colours (see the related articles or <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurocommuter_c3bc.html" title="User:Eurocommuter">my page</a> for a few examples). I’m concerned that unless we align among all contributors the data we’re using and the way we use them we are risking creating confusion by presenting the same objects with very different hues, much too dim or bright compared to others etc. I believe the images you’ve added are fine; such images add some identity to otherwise difficult to distinguish objects and add some 'life' to otherwise austere articles. I’d be interested to know what data do did you use (colour indices? Slope? Albedo?) and how did you render them. Thank you. <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurocommuter_c3bc.html" title="User:Eurocommuter">Eurocommuter</a> 08:15, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I see you've been creating individual articles for some TNO satellites. Although it is true that every natural satellite should have an article, I wouldn't create articles for TNO satellites yet because we still know next to nothing about them. For example, the satellite of 2003 UB<sub>313</sub> needs to be confirmed first.</p>

<p>Hi. Recently you created a separated article for 2003 UB<sub>313</sub> when some while ago we'd decided that until much more was known about it there wasn't much point. All you'd done was removed one section from the main article and pasted it, so I put it back and restored the redirect. Now I see you reverted that, without using an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary">edit summary</a>, or mentioning it on the talk page. This is not very helpful, and I hope you'll discuss this on the talk page if you want to argue that there should be a moon article separate from the main article. If you don't discuss things when you disagree you'll find you generate far more friction than necessary. Also, as Jyril said, blanking your talk page is considered bad form. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 10:38, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many of them are very nice convex hull renderings. Those that are good provide a nice sense of the object. Those that were of poor quality I removed, as they did not provide a sense of the object.

<p>I notice you've added those nice asteroid shape models from the publications of Mikko Kaasalainen's group into the asteroid articles. They are a significant enhancement! However, I also notice that they have the GFDL-self made copyright tag on them, as in "I, the creator of this work, hereby blah blah blah ....". So, just in a friendly way, I'm wondering <i>are</i> you the creator of those images − as in, e.g. a member of M. Kaasalainen's research group? If not, the copyright tags should be changed. (At the least because those astronomers might be a bit upset to see their research described as someone else's work.) For example you can probably get their permission to upload them, etc.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I'm not going to go and tag them as copyright suspect, because I find the copyright "correctness" on Wikipedia a major annoyance more than anything else, but I also suspect that without a change, some stickler for correctness is going to find them soon and they'll get tagged for deletion. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuar_eca8.html" title="User:Deuar">Deuar</a> 14:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't care about correctness itself, but copyright issues can be damaging to Wikipedia, so the annoyance is justified. Using GNU template for images is not acceptable since you haven't created the images and the authors own the copyright. Maybe we could use these images under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>. There was a database which included all these models, but I have been unable to locate it anymore. If we had the data, we could recreate new, better images and replace the current ones.--<a href="../../../j/y/r/User%7EJyril_fd2c.html" title="User:Jyril">JyriL</a> <sup style="font-size:x-small"><a href="../../../j/y/r/User_talk%7EJyril_4baa.html" title="User talk:Jyril">talk</a></sup> 20:25, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
