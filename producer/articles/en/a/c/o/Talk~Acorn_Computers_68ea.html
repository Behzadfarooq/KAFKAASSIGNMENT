<p>2004.01.01: I have corrected an incorrect fact in the first paragraph here which implied that Chris Curry was one of the founders of Acorn. See reference:</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="http://www.cary.demon.co.uk/acorn/acornWilson.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cary.demon.co.uk/acorn/acornWilson.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cary.demon.co.uk/acorn/acornWilson.html</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I have also struck out (but not deleted, because the next paragraph refers to it) another incorrect statement. The CPU card had a standard Eurocard connector on it which brought out all the CPU signals (and others, too). See photograph and schematics at: <a href="http://www.cary.demon.co.uk/acorn/" class="external free" title="http://www.cary.demon.co.uk/acorn/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cary.demon.co.uk/acorn/</a> -- <a href="../../../m/f/c/User%7EMfc_c18a.html" title="User:Mfc">mfc</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>This is <b>really</b> bugging me... All 3 people (Hauser, Curry and Hopper) say that they are founders of Acorn. It is also the commonly reported version of history that at least 2 out of that 3 were involve in founding Acorn. The memory of one employee doesn't really seem enough to justify ignoring this and treating it as untrue. <a href="../../../l/m/n/User%7ELmno_34a9.html" title="User:Lmno">Lmno</a> 01:33, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I checked with two other employees, too, as well has Hauser, who reviewed my site without any comment on that. And Wilson is hardly just one employee -- but instead was the chief designer of their first computer. In none of the descriptions of the time have I seen any mention of Curry being around.</dd>
<dd>But this should be possible to check on the company's records. In the meantime, surely eye-witness accounts are better than hearsay and 'commonly reported history'? I'd be perfectly happy to go with a change here, given some real evidence. <a href="../../../m/f/c/User%7EMfc_c18a.html" title="User:Mfc">mfc</a> 15:39, 2005 Feb 16 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is some hard evidence, which is not just hearsay: <a href="http://www.amadeuscapital.com/team/hermann.html" class="external text" title="http://www.amadeuscapital.com/team/hermann.html" rel="nofollow">Hermann Hauser's profile at Amadeus Capital Partners</a>, <a href="http://www-lce.eng.cam.ac.uk/~hopper/" class="external text" title="http://www-lce.eng.cam.ac.uk/~hopper/" rel="nofollow">Andy Hopper's homepage at the Lab for Communication Engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.gis.co.uk/gis_1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gis.co.uk/gis_1.htm" rel="nofollow">the history of Chris Curry's company General Information Systems Ltd's</a>. All of these webpages make the claim that the respective person is a founder of Acorn. Each claim could be said to be of importance to the credibility of the person involved as a venture capitalist or suchlike. Untrue statements could lead to legal actions. -- <a href="../../../l/m/n/User%7ELmno_34a9.html" title="User:Lmno">Lmno</a> 15:16, 17 Feb 2005
<dl>
<dd>See <a href="http://www.cary.demon.co.uk/acorn/acornHistory.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cary.demon.co.uk/acorn/acornHistory.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> -- I have exchanged e-mail with all of these people except Toop and none of them have mentioned Hooper, and the only mention of Curry was to state he was not involved at that time. <a href="../../../m/f/c/User%7EMfc_c18a.html" title="User:Mfc">mfc</a> 22:45, 2005 Feb 17 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have emailed Chris Curry, Hermann Hauser, Andy Hopper and Steve Furber. As of now, Curry, Hopper and Furber have replied. All state that Acorn was a trading name of Cambridge Processor Unit, which was founded by Curry and Hauser (in 1978). <a href="../../../l/m/n/User%7ELmno_34a9.html" title="User:Lmno">lmno</a> 17:35, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This is good; that's consistent with what Furber said in e-mail to me (see my Acorn site), except that he did <i>not</i> mention Curry. Sounds like we need to close the loop with Sophie, who said in answer to: 'Hermann Hauser (from Kings College, Cambridge University) had recently founded Acorn Computers Limited in Cambridge, with Chris Curry, correct?'
<dl>
<dd>"Actually, that came later. The initial work was done for Hermann’s own company 'Cambridge Processor Unit' ... Hermann went for the System One and came up somehow with the Acorn name, then Clive and Chris had an argument and Chris left Science of Cambridge and joined Hermann at Acorn: the first thing that we worked on with Chris was the Atom."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>so that's the statement that appears to be wrong. Would you like to e-mail her about it? (I think she's easy to find on the net, but if not, e-mail me on mfc@uk.ibm.com and I'll send -- I don't want to post someone else's e-mail address here.) As you say, maybe people remember things wrong, but until corrected that's the only statement on record. <a href="../../../m/f/c/User%7EMfc_c18a.html" title="User:Mfc">mfc</a> 17:16, 2005 Feb 27 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't so much think that Sophie's statement is <b>wrong</b> as partial. Chris Curry states that Hermann Hauser worked full time at Market Hill, while, when he and Toop started to develop the Atom, they worked from Curry's home. Curry satted that Acorn Computers Ltd was ioncorporated to separate the risk of an entirely new (and possibly frivolous) product (i.e. a home computer) from the (serious) products that CPU were developing and marketing. I do find this a little confusing, however, since the system 1 was marketed as an Acorn product.</dd>

<p>2004.01.02: restored strikeout, as whoever deleted it did not adjust the following paragraph (see Talk above). I will delete the strikeout and edit the rest of the page to match in a couple of days unless someone else has an objection -- <a href="../../../m/f/c/User%7EMfc_c18a.html" title="User:Mfc">mfc</a></p>
<p>Yes, I object. Strikeouts are inappropriate in any article. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> 08:23, 3 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm, what is the &lt;strike&gt; tag for, then? It lets people see a [proposed] deletion much more easily than the dreadfully slow 'diff' function. (I'd agree a strikeout should not be a permanent feature&#160;:-).)</p>
<p>And again you didn't fix the following paragraph when you removed the strikeout. I'll do it now... <a href="../../../m/f/c/User%7EMfc_c18a.html" title="User:Mfc">mfc</a></p>
<p>The &lt;strike&gt; tag is for use on HTML pages. It is not really for Wikipedia pages which should, as far as possible, use Wiki markup, a more restricted markup language which does not include the &lt;strike&gt; tag. If you want people to see a [proposed] deletion move it into the talk page for discussion. However note that the &lt;strike&gt; tag may have a limited use on talk pages. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></p>
<p>I've changed to leaving text of that kind in SGML comments -- that way editors can see the deleted text in context without it offending the casual reader.</p>
<p>On “... use Wiki markup, a more restricted markup language”; surely Wiki markup is a superset of HTML? It adds new notations and conventions while removing nothing. (There are at least 5 conventions for placing Images that I've noticed/seen, for example.) <a href="../../../m/f/c/User%7EMfc_c18a.html" title="User:Mfc">mfc</a></p>
<p>SGML comments are a good move. And you are right about Wiki markup being a superset of HTML. It's just that it is a good idea to avoid using HTML (as far as possible) in order to make the articles easier for non-technical people to edit. That's what I meant when I used the word <i>restricted</i> -- I was talking about the non-HTML components. Having said that I realise that a lot of features have been added for Wikipedia, some of which are just as complex as HTML if not moreso, not to mention that there are some things which you can only do by using HTML. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></p>
<p>OK, thanks – sounds as though we are in ‘violent agreement’&#160;:-) Now, how to get Wikipediae to support real quotes and dashes without having to type in symbols?</p>

<p>IIRC, only ART was aquired by Pace - the rest of Element 14 went to Broadcom. I think something about this is mentioned on Sophie Wilson's personal web site.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Pretty much. A handful of non-ART people went to Pace. Also a bunch of admin people were laid off. Then obviously there's the fact that the remaining e-14 bunch were temporarily owned by MSDW and then did the management buy-out as a separate company.</dd>

<p>Surely this article should be entitled 'Acorn Computers' rather than 'Acorn Computers Ltd' as it documents the fortunes of a number of legal entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd (Dec 1978)</li>
<li>Acorn Computer Ltd (Jan 1979)</li>
<li>Acorn Computers Ltd (May 1979)</li>
<li>Acorn Computer Group PLC (Sep 1983)</li>
<li>ARM Ltd (1990)</li>
<li>Acorn Online Media (1994)</li>
<li>Element 14 (1999)</li>
</ul>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>The term most people would use to refer to this set of companies is 'Acorn Computers' rather than 'Acorn Computers Ltd'. In fact, the enterprises discussed in this article were under the posession of 'Acorn Computer Group PLC' for longer than 'Acorn Computers Ltd.' I move that this article's title should be changed to <b>Acorn Computers</b>.

<p>Were Acorn computer never sold comercially in <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a>. Because I never saw any acorn computers as a kid and I never even heard of the company until I started using Wikipedia. <i>(unsigned comment from anon)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>See the last paragraph under <i>Financial problems</i>. British computer companies generally didn't seem to have much luck in America, probably due to the simple fact that the US market is larger, and by the time a British company had succeeded, there would already be well-established US competitors. Acorn did have some limited success outside of America, though. <a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/comp.sys.mac.advocacy/msg/05247cf48fe3886a" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/comp.sys.mac.advocacy/msg/05247cf48fe3886a" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartBrady_f558.html" title="User:StuartBrady">StuartBrady</a> 15:08, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section needs rewriting to be more neutral, it currently reads more like a rant than an encyclopedia entry.</p>

<p>I made some large changes to the 'relaunch' section, as I felt that it was still needed work from a neutrality point of view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed many sections of which seemed uncertain, removed sentances with 'It's though to' and 'possibly'.</li>
<li>Removed link to reseller page on their website, it's a dead link</li>
<li>Removed talk of trademark controversy, there is no evidence that there is a trademark issue. In fact there is no reason that the new company could not have licensed the trademark from the correct people. There's no evidence either way.</li>
<li>Removed link to WHOIS information, it was irrelevant and not used to support any sort of argument (whether a domain name is registered individually and used for company purposes is not an offence and should not be taken as any evidense of wrongdoing)</li>
<li>Seperated talk about the controversal reuse of the Acorn name from the discussion of new companies operations.</li>
<li>Simplified the reference to companies house information, it's unlikely anyone would have a desperate need of the company numbers, but that they are different remains relevant.</li>

<p>More on Relaunch:</p>
<p><br />
I've tried to make the relaunch parts a bit more balanced - I'm an old Acorn user myself, having owned an Electron, programmed the BBCs and Archimedies extensively and frequented the BBSs (remember them long before the advent of the Internet? - Telecom Gold etc. - I must be getting on). I think the new company deserves a chance to proove itself - they are manufacturing and supporting entirely in the UK &amp; thus creating jobs - @ £700 (ex vat) for their new laptops, they are also quite competitive for the features they offer &amp; standard warranties etc. I do note that they are currently under investigation by the OFT for attempting to form a cartel &amp; enforce retail prices however - maybe not such a good start (OK, would be a good start to a 5 year prison sentence), but I think they are a young company and learning as they go. If you think this has gone too far, please edit again (it's what WikiPedia is for). I have spoken to the company (prime research) and base the edits on fact &amp; experience.

<dd>I've tried to make the trademark issues clearer and removed bits which were POV quasi-advertising. Hopefully we can agree that what's there now is NPOV and sourced well. I'm also going to have a crack at the introduction. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreveX_ae5c.html" title="User:TreveX">TreveX</a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETreveX_97ec.html" title="User talk:TreveX">talk</a></sup> 19:05, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've made some changes to the article so that it remains at the standard we expect of a Wikipedia featured article. I used to use Acorns myself, so I'm proud that the Wikipedia article about the company has managed to make it to featured status. I have mainly cut down on the amount of information mentioned about the relaunch in the introduction, and moved the extra information to the relaunch section. I have also cleaned up the spelling, grammar and punctuation in this section. As for the <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friends.html" title="Friends">Friends</a>-related trivia, I have moved it to a separate "Trivia" section, but noted that this is probably coincidental; Friends was an American show, and Acorn was almost unknown in the States.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the implication was that the computer and OS were (code)named after the characters, rather than the other way round. That's how I've always understood it! So Acorn being unknown in the States doesn't really matter -- <i>Friends</i> <b>is</b> well-known over here. Anyway, wouldn't this be better off in the article <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoebe_%28computer%29.html" title="Phoebe (computer)">Phoebe (computer)</a>? <a href="../../../1/3/1/User%7E131.111.8.99.html" title="User:131.111.8.99">131.111.8.99</a> 15:31, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've gone ahead and moved it. BTW, the relaunch section is much cleaner, now. Nice work!&#160;:) --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartBrady_f558.html" title="User:StuartBrady">StuartBrady</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStuartBrady_916e.html" title="User talk:StuartBrady">Talk</a>) 15:54, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Anyhow, good job Ben Fitzgerald on updating the relaunch section in the first place; I don't really keep up-to-date with such things.
