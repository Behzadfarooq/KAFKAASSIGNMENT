<p>Can somebody verify that the therapeutics section is accurate? The writing sounds rather archaic, like some early 20th century medical texts I've seen quoted elsewhere. Examples: AFAIK, "neuralgia" is an obsolete term; one of the dosages is given in "minims", a fluid measure fifty years' dead; the word "anodyne" is used instead of "anaesthetic" or "analgesic".</p>
<p>The same seems to be true of the pharmacology and toxicology sections, and possibly even of the chemistry section, now that I look at it again.</p>
<p>At the very least, it should be noted that this is historical information that is of dubious value today.</p>

<dd><i><b>Please sign your comments.</b></i> There is a citation at the bottom of the article that information was incorporated from the <i>1911 Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, and I'm guessing the sections you mention were taken verbatim. This sort of thing is exactly why many people are arguing against the use of the <i>1911 EB</i> as a source: because people are copying and pasting without possessing the knowledge or wisdom to know which info is still relevant and which is obsolete. Historical information has its uses, but if the basic data about a topic isn't given primary focus, then the historical data is, as you say, meaningless. Please make corrections as you see fit. Be bold! I'm placing a template to indicate that the article needs verification. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanonblack_67f7.html" title="User:Canonblack">Canonblack</a> 15:00, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
