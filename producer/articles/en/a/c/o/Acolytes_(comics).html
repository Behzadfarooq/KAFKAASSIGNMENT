<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/o/Acolytes_%28comics%29.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The Acolytes were first a group of desperate mutants on the run from <a href="../../../s/2E/h/S.H.I.E.L.D._6d56.html" title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> soldiers, led originally by <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabian_Cortez_3522.html" title="Fabian Cortez">Fabian Cortez</a>. Magneto housed them on his space station, <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid_M_488c.html" title="Asteroid M">Asteroid M</a>, giving the mutants refuge. Due to events arranged and manipulated by <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabian_Cortez_3522.html" title="Fabian Cortez">Fabian Cortez</a>, the first group of Acolytes perished. Cortez characterized their deaths and the assumed death of Magneto as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyr.html" title="Martyr">martyrdom</a> to further his cause against normal humanity.</p>
<p>Cortez formed and led a second group of Acolytes whose first mission was to attack a school for the handicapped, Our Mother of the Sacred Heart, to find a child who would one day become a powerful mutant. The <a href="../../../x/-/m/X-Men_5b6b.html" title="X-Men">X-Men</a> interfered with their attack and the Acolytes retreated. Afterwards, the Acolytes kidnapped <a href="../../../m/o/i/Moira_MacTaggert_3892.html" title="Moira MacTaggert">Moira MacTaggert</a>. Fabian Cortez's reason was to ascertain whether Magneto was alive. Moira was rescued by the X-Men. The Acolytes' next attack was on a hospital. Four members of the Acolytes were involved in killing several dying, hospitalized humans. Next, the team attempted an aborted attack on a military base. They were opposed by <a href="../../../x/-/f/X-Factor_%28comics%29_28ab.html" title="X-Factor (comics)">X-Factor</a> and their mercenary ally <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_%28comics%29.html" title="Random (comics)">Random</a>. The attack on the base was actually proved beneficial because it was a way for Fabian to attempt to coerce <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quicksilver_%28comics%29.html" title="Quicksilver (comics)">Quicksilver</a>, the son of Magneto, to join his cause. Meanwhile, Magneto returned to hatch his plan of revenge. Magneto recruited <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus_%28comics%29.html" title="Exodus (comics)">Exodus</a>, in order to reclaim the Acolytes in his name.</p>
<p>After the events of <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatal_Attractions_2598.html" title="Fatal Attractions">Fatal Attractions</a> and the <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Apocalypse_8293.html" title="Age of Apocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a>, the Acolytes found a cocoon drifting in space. They brought it aboard and awoke <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_%28comics%29.html" title="Holocaust (comics)">Holocaust</a>. Holocaust went on a rampage, killing everyone in his path. In a duel with Exodus, the Acolytes' new space station, <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalon_%28comics%29.html" title="Avalon (comics)">Avalon</a>, was destroyed.</p>
<p>Some time passed before the Acolytes reformed. When Magneto was granted control of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genosha.html" title="Genosha">Genosha</a>, he reconstituted the Acolytes, with new and old, surviving members. He used the Acolytes as a force to help him gain control over the war-torn island. After the civil war, the Acolytes and Genosha prospered, but the prosperity did not last. After the <a href="../../../e/v/e/Eve_of_Destruction_%28comics%29_2e25.html" title="Eve of Destruction (comics)">Eve of Destruction</a> storyline, the Acolytes were not prepared for the worst. Genosha was attacked by a "wild <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sentinels_%28comics%29.html" title="Sentinels (comics)">Sentinel</a>" programmed by <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassandra_Nova_e4cd.html" title="Cassandra Nova">Cassandra Nova</a>. Genosha was destroyed along with millions of its mutant population. Most of the Acolytes remain as yet unaccounted for, with only Exodus, Voght and Cargill known to be alive.</p>
<p>The Acolytes resurfaced after the events of <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimation_%28comics%29.html" title="Decimation (comics)">Decimation</a> consisting of returning members Exodus and Cargill, <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_%28comics%29.html" title="Random (comics)">Random</a> who aided them in a mission before, and for <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutant_Liberation_Front_4a05.html" title="Mutant Liberation Front">Mutant Liberation Front</a> member <a href="../../../t/e/m/Tempo_%28comics%29.html" title="Tempo (comics)">Tempo</a>.

After a battle with the X-Men, the Acolytes fled and sought out a way to replenish the mutant population.</p>

<p>In <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Zombies_0cbe.html" title="Marvel Zombies">Marvel Zombies</a></i>, where this universe Marvel superheroes (The Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Hulk, Daredevil, and the others superheroes) have been infected by an unknown virus and turned into flesh eating zombies and killed most of the humans population for their meals. The Acolytes (The Acolytes shown are Fabian Cortez, Joanna Cargill, Scanner, Lisa Hendricks, Reynolds, and Burns) and a surviving X-Men member <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forge_%28comics%29.html" title="Forge (comics)">Forge</a> seem to be some of the few survivors hiding in the third <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid_M_488c.html" title="Asteroid M">Asteroid M</a>. After <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto_%28comics%29.html" title="Magneto (comics)">Magneto</a> (who appear to be the only mutant left uninfected on Earth) helped <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed_Richards_7654.html" title="Reed Richards">Reed Richards</a> from the Ultimate Universe and the other three survivors (Danny Glidewell, his daughter Mindy Glidewell, and officer Kelly Ridge) escape using Reed's machine, he destroyed the machine, so the zombies could not use the machine to go to Reed's Ultimate Universe. He was then contacted by the Acolytes, who offered to send him a shuttle. Magneto, however, told them to wait until he was out of New York City, but was shortly thereafter killed by the zombies. Upon returning to Earth the Acolytes led by Fabian Cortez couldn't find Magneto, so instead they managed to find another survivor, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Panther_%28comics%29_6109.html" title="Black Panther (comics)">Black Panther</a> and zombie <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wasp_%28comics%29.html" title="Wasp (comics)">Wasp</a> "head", Cortez recognized that the Black Panther is a human and alive. Cortez is startled to discover that he is not a zombie. Cortez thought that only the Acolytes, Forge and Magneto who survived. But Joanna Cargill, Burns and the other Acolytes think it's a trick because Panther was also carrying the zombie Wasp head. Cortez warns his teammates to stand down, because they don't know anything about the Panther, so they can't do anything yet.</p>
<p>Burns disagrees and want to kill Panther. In self-defense, Black Panther flings the Wasp head at Burns, and it kills him with a bite to the jugular. The other Acolytes start fighting Panther, but Cortez orders everyone to stop fighting immediately. While the others want to avenge Burns, Cortez stated that Burns has disobeyed his direct order and paid for it with his life. Cortez informs that Panther only defended himself because the Acolytes attacked him, so he can't be punished for that.</p>
<p>Panther said that he wants to go with the Acolytes to Asteroid M, if that means the zombies or the virus can't reach him there. Cortez promises they'll do that, because he wouldn't be able to live with himself if he left another human being behind. The other Acolytes protest against it, but Cortez is confident, as he wants to ensure the survival of his species, and therefore can use all the help they can get.</p>
<p>The others realise they don't have much choice and agree with it, but they want to kill the Wasp first. Black Panther refuses, because he wants her to come to Asteroid M with them. Even Cortez isn't so sure about it, but agrees to take the Wasp with them.</p>
<p>After the Acolytes and Black Panther arrive on Asteroid M, Reynolds decided to study and learn more about the zombies by using the Wasp as a specimen. Reynolds said that he could maybe even find a cure. Later, Forge arrives and introduces himself to Panther. Cortez said they should wait until Magneto contacts them. However, Cortez also realized that Magneto was probably already killed because they didn't find him on Earth, and Magneto also never makes contact again with the Acolytes.</p>
<p>The story skips five years later when the Acolytes, Forge, Black Panther and the Wasp (still a zombie, but now with a robotic body) land back on earth. They look around and sees nothing left. Cortez stated that the zombies could still be around and they have to stay alert. Black Panther has married Lisa Hendricks and they have a baby, K'Shamba. Hendricks tell Panther and Cortez that they surely alone, there is no life left on the planet and no death, either. Other Acolyte-member Scanner and the Wasp also stated that all the zombies has vanished after Reynolds completes his sensor sweep. Reynolds, using the thermal reading, indicates there are no living humans left. And by using the motion reading, indicates there is no living human or zombie left on earth. The zombies are nowhere to be found; they either died or left the planet. Reynolds said that he doesn't know where the remaining zombies went, but Cortez and Panther are interested in finding out. This makes the Acolytes, Forge, and Black Panther the last survivors of the human species.</p>

After seeing the demise of their leader, <a href="../../../s/a/g/Sagat.html" title="Sagat">Sagat</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vega_%28Street_Fighter%29_220b.html" title="Vega (Street Fighter)">Vega</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balrog_%28Street_Fighter%29_388d.html" title="Balrog (Street Fighter)">Balrog</a> volunteered to become new members of the Acolytes. Magneto allows them to join, despite the fact they aren't mutants (even though they are superhuman in their own right). This ending (along with the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_vs._Capcom_series_959a.html" title="Marvel vs. Capcom series">Marvel vs. Capcom series</a> in its entirety) is non-canon.</li>
