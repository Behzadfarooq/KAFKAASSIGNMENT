<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some problems of the article</span></h2>
<p>In this article (Accession of Turkey to the European Union) there is no information on the actual negotiations, which are the essence of the accession process. In which order and when the 35 chapters will be negotiated, which ones are already completed, which ones are expected to involve rough discussions, etc.</p>
<p>Moreover there aren't any links to reports of EU organs and officials on negotiations.</p>
<p>The article is -very funnily- all focused on pro- and anti-membership opinions (anti: geographical location only 3% on Europe, the capital being on Asia, Islam as predominant religion, objections of Greek Orthodox church, Armenian genocide and diaspora's objections, etc; pro: Turkey's big, growing, large market for European goods, may prevent clash of civilizations, etc). The article reflects the fair or unfair "subjective" opinions of both sides, however, it is not encyclopedic in its content. All I see is fierce arguments that overshadow the main issues, which are mentioned merely tangentially. The arguments put forth do not correlate with the actual situation of the relations between EU, Turkey and member states. Rather than explaining the potential benefits and setbacks of Turkey's accession for both Turkey and EU and explaining the nature of negotiations and the likely caveats, the article is very bipartite, Turkey bashing part and Turkey advertising part. It's self-contradictory at several points.</p>
<p>Very disappointed with the article, I'd like to add that this shouldn't be an arena for Turks, Armenian Diaspora, Greek Chypriots to fight over dominating the article.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at what it has to offer to the readers:</p>
<p>Contents 1 History 2 Arguments used for Turkish membership 3 Arguments used against Turkish membership 3.1 Inherent issues 3.2 Human rights, democracy, and other internal issues 3.3 Relations with neighbours 3.4 Effect on the future direction of the EU 4 Likelihood of accession 4.1 Official point of view 4.2 Public opinion 5 Individual opinions and quotes 5.1 Opinions 5.2 Quotes 6 See also 7 External links 7.1 For 7.2 Against</p>
<p>very 2-sided, all pros and cons, fighting one another</p>
<p>1 History Although this is the best part of the article, it still lacks references and links to EU report (2006). But still it's one of the finest in the entire article.</p>
<p>2 Arguments used for Turkish membership 3 Arguments used against Turkish membership</p>
<p>These two topics must be a joke. Besides very unprofessional language and poor narration: Turkey is</p>
<p>very dynamic: I guess it means growing and competitive market and entrepreneurship</p>
<p>rapidly modernizing economy: I have to guess again, probably means shifting investments and labour pool from agriculture and textile to higher tech industry</p>
<p>In 2004 and 2005, growth was above 7%, being far above average growth in the EU.: Instead of "far above", why not give the number for EU15 and EU25, so it doesn't sound advertising and subjective</p>
<p>Altough the current GNP per capita is still lower than all of the other new EU-countries, the current economic growth rate suggests that in a few years, Turkey will have overtaken several of these: Is this the fact? No. New member states are also growing fast, and probably it'll take time, if ever, Turkey overtakes them. This is a mere prediction, if not a personal expectation of the author.</p>
<p>In addition, Turkey has a young population.: Need to mention the percentage below 14, 15 to 65 and above 65, the average education level (around 5 years), literacy rate for men and women and unemployment. So the reader can get a grasp of the facts to make the decision whether this young population is an advantage or not. (Don't get angry anyone, I'm a Turk myself and I wish Turkey joins EU ASAP, but the fact remains that the article sucks in its current version, as of Aug 26, 2006) There could be more emphasis on the aging European population and an examplar of countries growing with immigration, as the US.</p>
<p>That, combined with the huge size of the country, and its growth rates, constitutes a major dynamism and a huge opportunity for the EU: The huge size actually scares the EU as explained in the Turkey bashing part. The investment opportunities for EU will indeed grow if Turkey joins EU, due to economic stability and improving legal framework and schooling.</p>
<p>There are alleged double standards in the requisites for Turkish membership. While some refuse Turkey's admission on the grounds of its territory being mostly Asian, Cyprus is also considered to be geographically Asian.: I think any discussion of geography should be entirely removed from the article. Geography comes into play in the initial application process, when Turkey was given the status of "candidate", this also involved the endorsement of Turkey's being geographically on Europe. (ex: Morocco's rejection by EU)</p>
<p>I neither have the will nor the time to go through the entire article, but just wanted to show what is wrong and how to make it more informative and less disputed.</p>
<p>Greek Cypriotes and Armenians need to give pro-Turkey authors a break, while pro-Turkey authors need to understand that this is not an advertisement board.</p>
<p>The very existing of pro and con parts in the article make is very unreliable. Those two parts should be blended together and contradictions, quotes (!!!come on people, it's so stupid) from anti or pro Turkish people removed, and non-sided attitude should be assumed in the phrasing of the text.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.. To the person who keeps deleting this:don't</p>

<dd>I totally agree with your comments on the current state of the article and I find them constructive. In my opinion, the most important flaw in the article is the lack of information on the official negotiation process (started on October 3, 2005), which, I believe, should constitute the main part of an encyclopedia article on this subject. The closest such thing I have seen on Wikipedia is the nice looking table in the <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union_c95b.html" title="Enlargement of the European Union">Enlargement of the European Union</a> article comparing the situation of Turkey, Croatia (the two candidates with started membership negotiations), and Republic of Macedonia (which currently is not in negotiations) based on their progress on acquis chapters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The second problem, in my opinion, is the structure of the article. I understand that the issue is highly controversial and people like to have an opportunity to express what they feel about the accession of Turkey (by contributing to the article with information usually in line with their view on the subject), but I feel that the article, with the exception of the history section, pretty much looks like a mere "pro / against list" of the country. I think the information gathered in this list is very useful and it should be maintained, but the article definitely needs to be restructured, because in its current state it somehow restricts any contribution to be either in the "pro" category or the "against" category. I think this restructuring issue was also agreed upon by <a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">User:A.Garnet</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas_Richards_c6aa.html" title="User:Lucas Richards">User:Lucas Richards</a>, a few paragraphs above on this page.</dd>

</dl>
<p>I see there is no mention of the views of the Turkish Euroskeptics - I am writing a piece about why Turkish euroskeptics are against joinng the EU. When complete should I add to this site? Regards nicnewman editor@oxfordprospect.co.uk</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just to help nicnewman, I will give him some of the reasons why some Turks are anti-EU. Initially the prospect of joining a trading club and gaining new markets (or rather less restrictions in those markets) seemed a good idea - but when negotiations started and the time came to take a closer look it became apparent how far beyond being a trading bloc the EU has gone. If the question was suddenly asked 'do you want to join the EU tomorrow?' with a full outline of what sort of powers would be handed over to Brussels, Turks would possibly be too nationalistic in character for a majority to answer in the affirmative. Economically, the EU would have been good for Turkey 20 years ago, 10 years ago - but not so profound today. EU aid would not be anywhere near as generous towards Turkey as it has been to previous newcomers, this has been made explicitly clear - and the aid would not have the impact on a country the size of Turkey as it did on perhaps Ireland or Greece, for example. Joining the EU would give Turkey a short term spurt but being made to comply with all the quotas and regulations would soon have a negative impact on it. Western think tanks and economic groups are almost unanimous in stating Turkey would be a net economic gain for the EU within 10 years - but europe has not been willing to invest in Turkey and it has had to overcome its hyperinflation by itself. Turkey's main advantage is a very young population - whereas Europe faces a demographical decline. Turkey does not want its youngters leaving for Europe to work any more than some Europeans want them to arrive. There is also a feeling that Europe has peaked and tomorrows story is Asia - that Turkey should take advantage of its ties with other Turkic nations. They have gone some way towards this, making Ceylan a hub of energy pipelines from both Central Asia and the Middle East. Turkey is also building ties with traditional rivals, Russia and Iran. There is also a growing belief that as long as Turkey keeps growing, EU member states will find it harder to ignore the benefits of less restricted trade with it outside of the EU framework. Larger EU nations, afterall, frequently flout the EU rules.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The pro-Turkey camp within the EU seems to be based on logistics - increased clout as a trading bloc, increased geopolitical influence, borders into emerging areas, access to a large military heavily involved in Nato/UN duties, better dialogue with Muslim nations, whereas the anti-camp concentrates on predominantly on culture. Previously pro-EU Turks are becoming disillusioned with the process as they read these reports, and there is an increasing view that a small but influential core of the EU is negotiating in bad faith, making unrealistic demands while ignoring its own commitments - with the sole aim of making Turkey walk away from the negotiations. Here are a few commentaries from Western newspapers about the current bone of contention, Cyprus:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Guardian, Peter Preston: "Papadopoulos says the Turks can't be trusted. To the contrary, they're delivering. It is the union they want to join which swallows its last promises before breakfast, which papers hard choices over with soft words, which oozes insincerity."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Brookings, Philip Gordon: "Villepin now seems to be imposing a new condition—the recognition of Cyprus even in the absence of a political settlement—which he knows is politically impossible for Turkey to meet. One wonders whether his true goal is to bring about recognition of Cyprus or to score easy points with French voters by scuttling the start of Turkey's negotiations with the EU... If anyone needs to adjust their policy toward Cyprus it is the EU, rather than Turkey... The EU enlargement commissioner, Gunther Verheugen, said he felt "taken for a ride" by the Greek Cypriot government. The European Commission vowed to ease the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriots as a reward for their cooperation. To date, efforts to do so have gone nowhere, all thwarted by the government of a Cyprus that is now in the EU... While the Turkish government and Turkish Cypriots have nothing to show for their cooperation, the Greek Cypriot rejectionists not only paid no price but were rewarded with EU membership. Now Villepin is proposing that Turkey be the one to make new concessions. One can understand if Ankara is not exactly rushing to support the proposal."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>IHT, Richard Bernstein: "The method by which Europe has continually made promises to Turkey that in its heart it never really wanted to keep have soured the mood."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>MEP, Sarah Ludford: "Undertakings must be honoured if the EU is to be credible."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I hope one anti-EU Turk's brief view helps you complete your essay. And I hope you get this before it is deleted.</dd>
