<h2><span class="mw-headline">Democracy, secular state as preconditions to join!</span></h2>
<p>Certain persons apparently object against information that Turkey has problems fulfilling the criteria for joining the EU, more specifically that Turkey still privileges Islam en musliums over other religions. Someone made a comparison with Greece. However, both for Greece, then, as for Turkey, now and tomorrow, the seperation of chutch and state is a clear, expliciet and important condition. This conditions must be met BEFORE talks can open. Greece, contrary to Turkey, knew only minor issues that since have been removed. This is: situation was already quite good for Greece and improved since. In Turkey, situation of treatment of religious minoritoes by the state is horribly bad a,d even deteriorating in cetain aspects!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently, according to Mr. Katsaris, the situation in Greece has not improved, and major discriminations would still exist. Can anybody else confirm this? can Mr. Katsaris put forward objective and athoritative evidence. Thanks in advance, --Rudi Dierick 09:33, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, please respect this requirement! Otherwise, you are going squarely against the explicite rules of the Wikipedia project! --Rudi Dierick 10:31, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You have a quite huge problem figuring out the distinction between "secular state" and "full separation of church and state". You are arguing that Turkey still "privileges" Islam -- Greece still privileges the Greek Orthodox Church. Ireland for a very long time privileged the Catholic Church - perhaps it still does. The United Kingdom privileges the Anglican church. But Ireland and Greece and the United Kingdom are still secular states.
<dl>
<dd>So, for you it is OK that Turkey continues sending out its imams on missionary missions, and to pay for missionaries, and have state-paid imams consacrate polygamous mariages, forbide the Greek-orthodox church to re-open training schools for its Turkish clerics etc.! Moreover, you comparethe PAST for Ireland and Greece, with the TODAY for Turkey. Also in Greece and ireland, as soon as there are others then catholics and greek-Orthodox n the typcal minimal numbers for a religion to et recognised, those states will recognise them. The privileges the fomer state religion enjoyed there have been removed! In the meanwhile, theer is no songle reason that can justify for Turkey not paying clerics of the Greek-Orthodox Church when the state does fund clerics from the Islam. After all, the Greek-orthodox church was present overthere from even long before the islam! Also, the UK does recognoise <b>and funding</b> other religous organisations then just the Anglican church! Apparently, you are unaware from that!--Rudi Dierick 21:21, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Um, no, I was comparing TODAY for Greece with TODAY for Turkey. TODAY Greece privileges the Greek Orthodox Church. Today the United Kingdom privileges the Anglican church. It privileges e.g. by allowing its heads of state to be a part of only that religion.
<dl>
<dd>Come on. This is trivial! Do you really mean to say that Turkey payin thousands of imams and nothing at all can be set at an equal footting as the UK having only Anglican's for hed of state? Anywa, this is not at all meant by the COE's Framework Convention for the Protection of national Minorities, <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=157&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=11/7/04&amp;CL=ENG." class="external text" title="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=157&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=11/7/04&amp;CL=ENG." rel="nofollow">(1)</a> --Rudi Dierick 22:13, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks like this gives 1 black hole and 1 inaccuacy:</dd>
<dd>1. You avoid discussing my arguments, you don't add any evidence for your point of view of reality. So, if I would have to apply your logic, I should have to cut anything you wrote and that I don't like. I won't, as that would be arrogant censorship, even after contrary evidence was provided!--Rudi Dierick 22:13, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>2. The EU Commission explicitely refers to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/157.htm" class="external text" title="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/157.htm" rel="nofollow">2</a>), agreed in the Council of Europe as one of the guiding documents concerning the standards both current and any new member state will be judged! In a course on European integration, prof.Koen Lenaerts <a href="http://www.law.kuleuven.ac.be/int/europees/English/Institute/Staff/Teachers/Lenaerts/lenaerts_eng.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.law.kuleuven.ac.be/int/europees/English/Institute/Staff/Teachers/Lenaerts/lenaerts_eng.htm" rel="nofollow">3</a>, explained there is a fair deal of cooperation between EU and non-EU institutions, including the COE. Is he wrong? Or will you again pretend to know it much better then, in this case, a distinguished professor of law?--Rudi Dierick 09:33, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>TODAY Greece has no legally recognized Mosques in Athens even if hundreds of thousands of Muslims exist in Athens.

<dd>True, but is the fact that Greece still continues discriminating (you're correct in this), altough it promised to improve things some years ago, any reason why the European union should as from now lower its requirements and accept any state that also maintains such discrimination? If I kill my neighbour, is that a justification for you that you should be able to do so to? --Rudi Dierick 22:13, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You say "lower its requirements" when you've never proven that such requirements ever existed. The EU isn't forcing United Kingdom to allow Roman Catholic monarchs. The EU isn't forcing Greece to abolish the Greek Orthodox Church's position as dominant religion. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 01:07, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>1. Don't you have any answer on my argument that one past error does not justify making the same error again? --Rudi Dierick 22:13, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>2. I did put forward the argument that the religious quality of a monarch is NOT relevant to how well a state respects the religious freedoms of its people. That that is irrelevant, and never mentionned in the officiel documents as the Framework Convention ... But apparently, that is a source you prefer not to know, or to discard. Well, I fear that such a personnal judgement where you feel mandated to discard the COE's conventions, makes any discussion very difficult. --Rudi Dierick 22:13, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>2. You insist that I should put forward evidence for anything you don't agree with. So, how about you putting forward evidence for your disputed claims? Why not start giving the good example yourself? For your claims in religious discrimination in 3 countries, you should, according to your own rules, put forward evidence for all thee!

<dd>You might object that, while agreeing, it remains unfair that in the meanwhile, Greece is in. However, hitting a stone once is enough, otherwise we would be worse then donkey's. Isn't it? I don' see at all why the EU, having made this error with Greece once, should now repeat it once more! And for the UK and Ireland, please check public expenditure for religious training and salaries for clerics of minority religions in those countries. I've once met myself students at a Britisch university training to become a rabbi and a roman catholic priest (alongside some going for Anglican minister)! --Rudi Dierick 23:05, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

If you imply that EU requirement say that member-state must not favour a specific religion, that's false. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 01:07, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>And what evidence do you have for that? When anybody reads the latest draft constitution of the EU, and the COE's Framework Convention on Minorities, then one finds very explict requriements on the mandatory non-discrimination between religions! Or don't you like the EU's constitution? --Rudi Dierick 09:33, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And Mr. Katsaris, before wielding the axe and censoring again, you didn't find the time to read the draft EU constitution? Nor the COE's Framework Convention on Minorities?--Rudi Dierick 22:13, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Get a grip, get some sanity, and get your facts straight. If you say that "seperation of chutch and state is a clear, expliciet and important condition", and you mean that as *full* and absolute separation between the two, then please do provide the reference to the EU decision that declared such a clear and explicit condition, because I've very definitely disputing the FACTUAL accuracy of your words -- aka I think you are dead dead wrong. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 16:51, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, if yo still need being informed or convincced that a secular state with a seperation from chruch and state is a pre-condition, that again disqualifies one person as rather incompetent to say something about this! It is plainly stupid that you still insist on this! You are making an idiot out of yourself by pretending you don't know. --Rudi Dierick 21:21, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You aren't being coherent. There are specific conditions and preconditions -- if you claim that full separation of church and state is one of them, then I definitely want to see some references, or I'm gonna keep deleting misinformation you add. Your comments on my person are irrelevant. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 22:06, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>So, let's start a war between censorship and free speech! Is that what you want? It is plainly stuupid that I should have to provide detail information to anybody who first handles the axe -cutting away everything he does not like . If you wpoud be sincerely interested yo find out more abou this, the frst things to do is ask, and not start behaving like a brute!
<dl>
<dd>It's not a war between censorship and free speech, it's a censorship between truth and falsehood. You support falsehood, I support truth. You make claims you can't factually support, I then removed your errors, falsehoods and lies. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 00:57, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Moreover you keep on adding POV attitudes. You claim that Armenia did nothing to warrant such a painful economic embargo? Says who? You? Many would also say that Armenia is currenly illegally occupying part of Azerbaijan.
<dl>
<dd>Aha, you admit that Turkey embargoes Armenia because of its war with Azerbaijdian! Have a look in international, neutral fora, and you'll see international mediation efforts were going on between Armenia and Azerbajdian, but that Turkey side-stepped these, and then unilaterally started an economic war out of solidarity with its ISLAMIC neighbour! Well, that again proves that Turkey feels that islamic solidarity goes ABOVE international rule of law! So, one reason more why Turkey is UNFIT and UNCAPABLE to join the EU!--Rudi Dierick 21:21, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is not mine or yours to either "admit" or "not admit". It's not mine or yours to input arguments about whether Armenia deserves or doesn't deserve an embargo. It *does* fall on you to indicate WHO ever said that the embargo on Armenia consistutes a problem for Turkey's entry on EU. The Wikipedia article is not a place to state opinions shares only by *you*. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 21:54, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Haha, you're now turning the scientific method upside down. Copernicus and Galilei also had such arguments against them. Well, just do a search on Google, and see what you can find! I did this in French and in Dutch already, and found several mentions, including from, not wonder, organised Armenian group in EU-countries AND from members of the European Parliament (you do know that the Eur. Parliament has officially recognised the genocide by Turkish state on Armenian civilians?). --Rudi Dierick 09:33, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>By the way, the existence of that economic embargo is quite clearly mentionned in officiel EU-documents (see ref's on this page). But, of course, you don't like this evidence, isn't?</dd>

I note you failed to find a single reference to such "criticisms", other than your own beliefs. Which means that your plural reference in the text to "critics of Turkey's entry" is actually a reference to the many voices in your own head. Sorry, but I won't allow corruption of the article by mixing the *actual* issues as named by those that actually know the EU's requirements or hold national mandates, versus the illiterate and ignorant ramblings of idiots suffering by multiple personality disorder. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 21:54, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Well well, so this report admits that it applies open economic pressure against one neighbour in order to force it to make peace with another one. Whether you like it or not, but from EU member states, it is expected that they submit dispues to international arbitrage, and that they do not start with unprovoked hostilities!

Your claim about the need to fully separate church from state is FACTUALLY wrong. Your belief that states are "expected to submit disputes to international arbitrage" is blatant POV. Your argument about polygamy as related to gender-equality is likewise POV. Your claims about the importance of various preconditions you invented are likewise insane POV since you can't actually make actual references to such preconditions for membership being real -- you simply *believe* such preconditions should exist.

<dd>yes, indeed, both the recommendation+opening f negotiations, andf the later, eventuel accession will gace democratic approval! Here in Belgium, there is quite some debate and eventual voting o this stage (recommendation) of the discussions, whether the national governement should inist on a more 'average' or even a more strict interpretation of the Copenhagen criteria; later, of course, there might be another round of debates and possibly a vote of confidence on the opening of negotiations, and then on in a third stage, if it goes that far, another round of debate and then certainly voting of accession.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Other issues hindering Turkey's accssion</span></h2>
<p>The EU itself requires a general alignment of any new member state on the so-called 'acquis communautaire' (or acquis' in short). From <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/enlargement/report_2004/pdf/tr_recommendation_en.pdf" class="external text" title="http://europa.eu.int/comm/enlargement/report_2004/pdf/tr_recommendation_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">1</a> several failures are explicitely noted for Turkey, p. 16: "Turkey remains in the black list of the secretariat of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State controls. Cypriot vessels or vessels having landed in Cyprus are still not allowed in Turkish ports" --Rudi Dierick 22:13, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the EU's desire that Turkey stops its conflict w. Armenia, following implicit quote: "The accession of Turkey would extend the EUâ€™s borders to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Through Turkey the EU could have a stabilizing influence in Southern Caucasus, <i>provided that Turkey is willing to try to solve conflicts with its neighbours already before its</i> accession <i>(p. . As Turkey has no conflicts with Azerbaidjan, nor with Georgia, this can ONLY refer to the open conflict with Armenia. And indeed; it continues: "In particular, its relations with Armenia will need to be improved with the establishment of diplomatic relations and the opening of the land border which is currently closed." --Rudi Dierick 22:13, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Looks like this quote comes from a related document 'ISSUES ARISING FROM TURKEYâ€™S MEMBERSHIP PERSPECTIVE', to be found on <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/enlargement/report_2004/pdf/issues_paper_en.pdf" class="external text" title="http://europa.eu.int/comm/enlargement/report_2004/pdf/issues_paper_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">2</a></dd>

<p>So, who claimed that it was just me or only other irrelevant persons who advocated that Turkey should end its conflict with Armenia? Well, as from you, Mr. Katsakis, you should be informed that is is exactly the European Commission itself who asks Turkey to stop its hostilities against Armenia! --Rudi Dierick 22:13, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the 'Issues ...' document, an official EU document, more specifically a 'COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT', ref. Brussels, 6.10.2004, SEC(2004) 1202, it mentions Armenia. In this report, the EU also suggests, as far as I understand it, that Turkey should start doing something it has failed to do untill now, being "contribute to easing tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the dispute concerning Nagorno-Karabakh". Indeed, contribute to easing tensions is something rather different from participating in the conflict trough applying economic pressure. --Rudi Dierick 19:07, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You know I've just downloaded the link you provided, and a search through the text shows no single mention of the word "Armenia", let alone mention of opening of land borders or establishing democratic relations.

<dd>Pardon? Not sufficient evidence? For most of the items disputed by Mr. katsakis, I've provided <b>officiel reports from Eu and COE</b> that confirmed one by one those items. the number of statements I wrote, that Mr. katsaris hotly and o so diplomatically disputed, and that then were EXACTLy confirmed by the official reports, it's a long list. For none, Mr. Katsaris was able to provide authoritative evidence that said the oppsosite of what I wrote! Moreover, ALL the references in the article as it is today were added by me, that makes up 100%. Sofar, Mr. katsaris has not been able to provide anything close to that. Verify the references and in the article and the discussion yourself. So, I'm really very surprised by your statement that I consider wholly erronuus, unfair and indeed, superficial (as, you somehow honestly acknowledged by saying you had no "time to study the evidence"). Moreover, I don't consider it according to the sipirit and the guidelines for somebody who did not (yet) had the time the study, already to propose deleting!</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, also have a look at the totally different approaches by Mr. katsaris and Zoney.</dd>

<dd>The problem is more about POV than it is about factual accuracy -- Rudy did manage eventually to back *one* statement he made (the one about Armenia) and I accepted it in the reworking of the article. The problem of the blatant POV however remains as Rudy readded it after Zoney's edit -- such statements like <i>"Altough Turkey pretends being in favour of a secular state and respecting gender equality, thousands of state-paid imams still consacrate polygamous mariages"</i> or <i>"The recent 'recognition' of the Kurdish language by Turkish authorities appears to be a cosmetic operation"</i>
<dl>
<dd>So do you pretend taht Kurdish is now used more or less ion large scale in theeducatuion and public services in the Kurdish-speaking areas? if not, then my statements are perfectlu accurate: Kurdisch is still banned for 99%.</dd>

<dd>If those polygamous marriages aren't recognized by the state, I don't see what it has to do with the state's secularism. In fact it's a POV idea (even if one I tend to agree with) that polygamy (regardless whether recognized by the state or not) necessarily implies gender inequality. Likewise POV is the characterization of the recognition of Kurdish as "cosmetic".
