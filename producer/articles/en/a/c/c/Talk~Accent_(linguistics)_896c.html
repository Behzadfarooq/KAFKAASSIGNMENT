<p>It may be a little early to ask this, since this article still needs a lot of improvement; but I was wondering if anyone has any information about how people who are "natively bilingual" (i.e., speak two languages with full fluency, with no "foreign accent" on either one, especially when they learned both at about the same time, i.e., when growing up in a bilingual environment) carry their accents when speaking other languages. For example, I heard about a Belgian person who would have a "French accent" when speaking certain languages and a "Dutch accent" when speaking others -- I suspect it was Romance languages in the first case and German in the second, which would kind of seem like natural due to the genetic relationship between those languages, but I wonder what kind of accent that person would have when speaking, say, Mandarin, or Arabic. Thanks in advance. --<a href="../../../c/o/t/User%7ECotoco_32b8.html" title="User:Cotoco">Cotoco</a> 15:57, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My Aunt has lived in France for longer than her home country, Ireland. However, people mistake her for French when she is speaking in French, and she has kept her Irish accent in English. I'd say foreign accents depend on the nationality of the person who teaches you.</dd>

<p>These two words potato and tomato are classic examples of how stress produces different sounding words which are both correct. The stress Americans place on O called a "hard O" distinguishes it from the British version. Although not a direct feature of accents the stress or way the words are "sung" are a feature of accents.</p>
<p>the above i am not sure about but i think it can be expanded.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሀላካሕ)</a> 13:38, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Potato and tomato? I'm not sure what difference you are referring to here. Tomato is pronounced very differently in British and American English, but it is the 'a' that is the difference ('ah' in Britain and 'ay' in America). Both British and American speakers use 'ay' in potato. The only difference I am aware of in that word is the second 't' which becomes a 'd' sound usually in America. The 'o's aren't that different are they? Mralph72 11:02, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Correct well these two words show the differnt accents and that is why it is being discussed here, the emphasis or stress, so i think this is a good example of accents.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሐላቃህ)</a> 13:47, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The article is incredibly poor as it stands right now and requires extensive cleanup. OR is just one of its problems. I placed the OR tag at the top of the page and then you removed it which is why I readded it along with inline OR tags so that you could see the substantial portions of text to which I was referring.

<dd>POV is permitted on an article talk page. Further, there is a great deal of sociolinguistic research concerning accents. That research is what should be the focus of the article, not broad generalizations of perceptions substantiated with the editor's own examples. That is origional research. Rather, that can be avoided by focusing on what has been written by experts - hence why this is an encyclopedia, not "Halaqah's opinions about the world supported by his/her observations." --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 15:21, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"America is a melting pot for accents and cultures from around the world" is a classic American sentiment on Americanism and has nothing to do with this article. The same is true of scores of existing countries and hundreds of historical ones. Furthermore the picture has absolutely nothing to do with accents. The comment that "lot's of people think Jamaican accents are cool", is an absolutely subjective, irrelevant, and downright stupid comment. I've removed these, please do not revert them without commenting. Grendel's Mother 18:04, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do not remove work because of your bias, the proper thing to do is discuss first and then make major changes. I could say the whole thing is silly and chop it all. America is the new world, like london it is a melting point for accents, i think that is valid. subjective is valid with accents. There is no secret that Jamaican accents and french accents have associations. British accents to AMericans may be Posh. It is all valid in how accents are perceived globally. I think in a debate about accents it is valid.

<p>I agree that there's quite a bit of room for (more) improvement. The tone, style, and content are not encyclopedic enough. To call the Jamaican accent "unique" is meaningless. Chinese, Norwegian, Kenyan, and &lt;insert accent here&gt; accents are all unique. Not only does the statement add no value, but having the photograph is distracting, and unnecessarily adds to the size of the page. The photo of the Hollywood sign and the steelworker are entirely superfluous. I certainly vote for deleting the photos; they don't make it "nice," they make it distracting and amateurish. I'll come back when I have more time to discuss some improvements to the text. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetershank_bb1a.html" title="User:Petershank">Petershank</a> 23:59, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
