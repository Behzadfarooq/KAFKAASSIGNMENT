<p>I may have missed something, but the URL you give in the copyright violation notice for Alex Harris doesn't seem to contain any text that looks similar.

<dd>I posted the article as possible copyvio solely because the text in the article contains a copyright notice, referencing that web site. I could not find the same text on that web site either, but the presence of the copyright notice seemed to be reason enough to post it as a possible copyvio. Not sure how else to handle it. The new Alex Harris/Temp article does not appear to have the same issue. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 17:11, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand. That's a valid reason, and I would agree with it. I think we might get away with just removing the copyright notice in the article, given that the article author asserts he is the copyright holder for the website. I've copied this to the talk page also. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 16:36, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Accurizer. Thanks for your vigilant eye in tagging Macro processor as a copyright violation. I just wanted to let you know that, per <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a>, you should blank the article when you tag an article with {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyvio_c034.html" title="Template:Copyvio">copyvio</a>}}. This is so that the current revision (which is often mirrored and such) no longer has the copyvio problem. — <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a> (<a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a>) 13:51, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello! Many thanks for your message regarding the above article. I have placed it on AfD as the prod tag has been removed twice. The author has removed the synopsis that was copied from the Amazon website but there is nothing to replace it at the moment. He'll have five days under AfD rules to improve or delete it.

<p>Hello! I know about the 9/11 wiki. The reason why you can't find it from the main page of the English wiki is that it is a different wiki. Different rules apply to that wiki, I imagine. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> stands for the English WP and this negates <i>in memoriam</i> articles. You can point the author of the above article towards that Wiki with an explanation regarding its aims and objectives being different to the English wiki and suggest that it might be a better place to mention Ms Angell. In fact, I think that I will copy this correspondance on to his Talk page.

<p>Administrators have been deleting articles saying it is nonsense; however, they leave other better constructed articles on similar topics. I feel you are targeting certain races particulary blacks. If I knew how to report you to the Wiki president I would.

<dd>Hi Stifle, thanks for your note on my talk page. I haven't done much with images up until now so I appreciate your assistance. I'm a little puzzled. Before tagging these with the speedy tag, I read <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a> which states:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"For speedy deletion candidates, use "db|reason". See the criteria for speedy deletion. These are: duplicates, thumbnails, broken images, non-existent images, non-commercial, permission, no source, unknown copyright, and <i>unused fairuse images</i>." (emphasis added in <i>italics</i>.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But, as you noted, I now see this is not addressed as a criteria in <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. There seems to be some inconsistency between these two pages, at least the way I am reading it. Do you think this is the case?
<dl>
<dd>You're right. I've updated <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a> accordingly. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 16:02, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Also, I noted that for "Mananddog.jpg", you placed an "orphaned fair use" tag. Would not this also apply to "Grant.jpg" and "Grant2.jpg"? If not, can you explain why? Thanks again. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 15:46, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The latter two images are tagged as GFDL, so they are free use, not fair use. You can still recommend them for deletion by listing them on <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 16:02, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I really can't be bothered to do it all again. The guidelines seem to indicate that I should have been contacted before deletion, but I was given no chance to comment. I appreciate that I should have included some copyright information initially, but summary deletion is a bit much since the copyright holder (me) was not asking for that. If I have to add it all again, and chase all that up, for what was meant to be a public service, then I really don't have the time. rde42 20:01, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi ElectricEye! Thanks for your message on my talk page. I think the service that your committee provides is very important. I certainly have no objections to giving the authors time to develop the article further. In fact, I agree that the "{{<a href="../../../i/m/p/Template%7EImportance_b9e2.html" title="Template:Importance">importance</a>}}" tag that you placed was a better approach in this case than speedy.

<dd>Hi Accurizer.<br />
<br />
First of all thank you for your message and pointing these things out to me. You have certainly broadened my view.<br />
<br />
I don't believe any warning tags were purposely designed to disregard <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. The intent is clearly justified. Tons of new users simply join Wikipedia out of obvious bad faith. But, I have noticed some RC Patrollers inadvertantly or carelessly misusing the tags on <i>faithfully good</i> new users.<br />
<br />
For example, several RCPs have warned newbies with a higher level tag without ever having given a level0 or level1. In some of these cases, the RCPs warned newbies and threatened blocking for vandalism. When I checked the newbie's edits they had been done in good faith, although contrary to Wikipedia Wikipedia's various policies. Some of these new users became upset because they weren't informed on how to do things, instead they were repeatedly warned they may be blocked for vandalism and in at least one case I remember the RC Patroller actually bullying such a new user. And in the last 3 days I have seen at least a half a dozen or more new users quit in protest or simply not return, because of such "abuse".<br />
<br />
I am not aware of the guidelines and policies that dictate RCP activity because I have chosen to not get involved in the obvious vandal war. I would rather build a peaceful environment by making new users feel welcomed and helped, and by practicing patience so they may learn Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. And ultimately I believe I can help minimize the damage (vandals/etc) with my approach by preventing the creation of new "enemies."<br />
<br />
It is a very complicated social phenomenon that needs more study to understand, but I think you see what I am getting at. If not, just ask what I mean and I will try to explain.<br />
<br />
I hope to have time to continue what I am doing and also get involved with <a href="../../../u/t/m/WP%7EUTM_f81f.html" title="WP:UTM">WP:UTM</a> if the Wikipedia community accepts what I may have to offer in the UTM/RCP effort.<br />

<dd>Hi Vegaswikian! Thanks for your message on my talk page to let me know about the changes you made. Actually, when I did the revert, I did not make an effort to retain the new link to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> because I thought it was redundant; being as the article states it was a Nevada-based company. However, I don't think it hurts either way. Regarding the Fortune 1000 category, I reverted it because I thought (perhaps wrongly so) that the category would not include <i>former</i> Fortune 1000 companies such as Caesars Entertainment. In any event, it was nice to hear from you. I've noticed your contributions many times; you and I seem to work on many of the same articles. See you around!

<dd>You raise an interesting point about it being a 'former Fortune 1000 company'. I'm not sure where to even ask how to handle that information. When I added it back in, I was not even thinking that it no longer exists. However, I think its worth noting that it was in the index at the time of the merger. There is a similar problem with the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Category%7EGaming_Hall_of_Fame_a165.html" title="Category:Gaming Hall of Fame">Category:Gaming Hall of Fame</a>. That adward was to Park Place and not Caesars.

<dd>Hi, this is in response to the above and the question you posted on my talk page. I think you could revise the introduction to begin with a broad overview of what these things are. For example, you could say something like: <i>Gyn is a wooden device similar to a pulley that was commonly used on sailing ships in the 18th century to lift elephants.</i> (Of course, I don't know if this is true, but hopefully this will give you an idea of what is needed.)</dd>

<p>That was exactly the edit I was thinking of as vandalism, and I had replied to the individual regarding that exact edit. I think that this is part of a pattern where users vandalize a page and then revert it, either as a test or to be able to send someone a link showing that one point the page contained their vandalism. These ofetn appear as an edit pair or as a sequence of several edits. I have a huge number of schools on my 2,900-page watchlist, and the number of vandals from IP addresses and new users is staggering. Thanks for chipping in, I often see you cleaning up and dealing with problems on the many pages I've been working on.

<p>re. deletions, moving pages and merger context Thank you for these comments. Firstly, I have tried to avoid copying my blog pages when I realized this was not permitted. Secondly, I would like to ask you whether or not Wikipedia's policy guidelines will permit my contributions to be merged wherever possible into the list of Newfoundland and Labrador communites? Thirdly, your editing practice, whilst undoubtably based on Wiki premises, is not at all helpful in the real world context of the small Labrador coastal communities. Sir Wilfred Thomas Grenfell a great legendary missionary worker along the coast many years ago, correctly forecast that the growth of tourism would be crucial in helping the communities to survive and prosper. Whilst I appreciate that Wikipedia and all that it stands for most probably cannot concern itself with such matters as net outward population migration, I would ask you to take the above context into your merciless editing practices so that Wikipedia is accurately and effectively responding to the real world.

<p>Hi Accurizer! There are two potential policies I can see here.</p>
<p>One is that all the non-speedy dud articles could be userfied by RC Patrollers rather than AfD'd, perhaps with a Wikipedia:Articles for mainspace process (<i>Newbies! Post the link to your finished new article here and an experienced editor will review it, clean it up and move it for you!</i>) perhaps tacked on to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_contributors%27_help_page_6291.html" title="Wikipedia:New contributors' help page">Wikipedia:New contributors' help page</a> with a template to tell the newbies where their article now is and what to do next. I would think that might get a fair bit of support, especially from the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcoming_committee_dc32.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcoming committee">Welcoming Committee</a>.</p>
<p>The other is the idea of restricting the ability of new users to post articles, similar to the restriction on moving articles that already exists. This has a lot of merit from an RC/CSD point of view. But I doubt the community would agree to it. When Jimbo introduced the "anons can't make new articles" software change, the screams echoed around Wikipedia for months as people complained that the change was anti-Wikispirit, WP:BITE-worthy, discriminatory etc. Also, it caused a whole new job for others at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_dc78.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation">Wikipedia:Articles for creation</a>. I would imagine that this proposal would cause the same shrieks from around the 'pedia and would increase the workload at WP:AFC further.</p>
<p>So I'd say policy one has a 60% chance of success, whilst policy two has a 20% chance of success. That isn't to put you off, though! You might like to first propose the idea on <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikien-l" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikien-l" rel="nofollow">the WikiEN mailing list</a>, although that can sometimes be a bit of a free-for-all so do it when you're in a good mood and plan to stay that way! Alternatively, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_create_policy_4959.html" title="Wikipedia:How to create policy">Wikipedia:How to create policy</a> might be a start.

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I wanted to know if non-official school newspapers, such as the Beverly Underground, is even allowed to be added into the entry under Newsservice of the Beverly Hills High School article?</p>
<p>Isn't a school's page supposed to be a factual, and officious, representation of the school, not alternative factors?</p>
<p>I want your judgement on this one. Delete the sentence about Beverly Underground or leave it?</p>

<dd>Hi, this is in response to the question you left on my talk page. I think the answer depends on whether or not the on-line newspaper is <b>already</b> notable. Of course, this is fairly subjective and since I have no connection to the school or its community, it is difficult for me to ascertain. In general terms, if the newspaper constitutes a ranting by a handful of students and they are simply trying to gain notoriety by having it mentioned in Wikipedia, then it should <b>not</b> be included. But, if the newspaper has a large following and it already notable, it should be included. As to where it should be addressed, if at all, I think it makes sense to place it in the "News services" section. Alternatively, if the newspaper is largely a criticism of the school, it could be mentioned in a new section, "Criticisms". However, since it is not an official publication, it certainly should not be mentioned in the infobox, as one editor tried to do (which I reverted). I hope this is helpful.

<p>Hi, thanks for fixing the Nelson page -- i got the page name wrong first time and didn't know how to fix it. --Userblade.</p>

<p>Just for the future, I would definitely stick speedy delete tags on pages such as Goemaere101 instead of nominating them for AfD. — <i><b><a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBottesini_7f4b.html" title="User:Bottesini"><span style="cursor:help"><font color="blue">ßott</font></span></a><a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBottesini_Esperanza_5b12.html" title="User:Bottesini/Esperanza"><span style="cursor:help"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBottesini_7f4b.html" title="User:Bottesini"><span style="cursor:help"><font color="blue">siηi</font></span></a></b></i> <sup><a href="../../../b/o/t/User_talk%7EBottesini_40af.html" title="User talk:Bottesini"><span style="cursor:help"><font color="red">(talk)</font></span></a></sup> 23:55, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I nominate tons of articles for speedy deletion, but in this case, I don't see a <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> that seems to apply. I tried to prod it but that didn't work. Which CSD criteria would you apply? <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 00:00, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would have probably put the patent nonsense tag on it. There's probably a better one though. — <i><b><a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBottesini_7f4b.html" title="User:Bottesini"><span style="cursor:help"><font color="blue">ßott</font></span></a><a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBottesini_Esperanza_5b12.html" title="User:Bottesini/Esperanza"><span style="cursor:help"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBottesini_7f4b.html" title="User:Bottesini"><span style="cursor:help"><font color="blue">siηi</font></span></a></b></i> <sup><a href="../../../b/o/t/User_talk%7EBottesini_40af.html" title="User talk:Bottesini"><span style="cursor:help"><font color="red">(talk)</font></span></a></sup> 00:41, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Provided a proper copyright release is received, as noted on the article's talk page, it should not be deleted. I've looked at the most recent version, though, and it will need some work to satisfy the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy. It should not read like a memorial. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 13:16, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
