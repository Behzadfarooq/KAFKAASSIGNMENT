<p>I have been participating actively in AfDs on schools. I'd vote to Keep all High Schools, almost without questions. I'd like to see Middle Schools demonstrate some degree of content and work. I think that the school you pointed me to is part of a worthwhile effort, and I will vote to Keep, but I think we need to work on some sort of consensus, so that we can all avoid spending so much time on these votes. Thanks for the heads up, and for all your work on making Wikipedia a better place. Down with Deletionism! After all, even Deletionists went to school somewhere (and if not, that probably explains a great deal). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 14:49, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bally is a famous brand worldwide. So it always gets confusing when Bally is mentioned as a place near Kolkata. But Bally has a rich history and is one of the well known places. There are lot of less known places that get a good coverage. So I thought as a duty I should write on this. It has also been covered in encyclopaedia Britannica- so it demands a better coverage than just a mention. Hope it gets its due recognition. --Soumiknath 05:08, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Soumiknath. I just would like to clarify that by moving the material about Bally, Kolkata, I was not implying that it does not deserve an article. It may deserve an article and you are free to create one if you like. (I would have done so myself, but I do not have any familarity with the subject and I did not want to create an article about something I am unfamilar with.) If you need help doing so please let me know. I'm making a link to the page that should be created if you decide to proceed: Bally, Kolkata. I preserved the original material at <a href="../../../b/a/l/Talk%7EBally_%28disambiguation%29_1b0e.html" title="Talk:Bally (disambiguation)">Talk:Bally (disambiguation)</a> in the event you would like to copy and paste it into a newly created article.

<p>Although none of my additions have been deleted I have a question as to why you would even send me a message saying that such is possible considering all of the information I added was off of the wikipedia website and even from the same section! I have read the link that you sent me about <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> and i have found no part in which i would be in violation of. I was just curious why you have found it necessary to send me such a response if there is nothing wrong with my additions, especially considering that all of my additions have simply been a different way to view the SAME information already available from wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ZIP_codes_in_the_United_States_09d5.html" title="List of ZIP codes in the United States">List of ZIP codes in the United States</a></p>

<dd>Hello again, this is in response to the question you left on my talk page. The reason I contacted you was to give you a friendly heads-up about the policy in the event you hadn't seen it. Many list articles like these have been deleted at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. Just because the information is already in Wikipedia doesn't necessarily mean that it should be. In fact, thousands of articles are deleted every day. Also, given that the information already exists as you noted, another editor may decide to redirect your articles to the pre-existing ones. Since it appeared to me that you were devoting a lot of time to these articles, I thought it would be a shame to see you continue for days or weeks without knowing there is a risk they could be deleted (or redirected) down the road. I thought you would be discouraged if this were to happen. In any event, please continue to edit as you see fit. Happy editing!

<p>Well thanks for the heads up.</p>
<p>You mentioned something about a redirect. If this is what I think it is (simply have a similar link go to the same place as another article) I don't think that that would be appropriate in this case because the section I am working on is grouping the ZIP codes in a different way than listed above on that page. Yes some of them are similar but for the most part there is a noticeable difference.</p>
<p>Also I don't know if this makes a difference as far as you are concerned but I am simply adding information to the links already in place and did not create the links I am editing myself.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the heads up, but when will I know if my additions are "appropriate" for the wikipedia site. If it is deemed "unacceptable" then I won't continue to do this but I would like to continue making contributions as soon as I know for sure that they ARE "acceptable". Who do I contact to find out this information and how long does this usually take??</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any insight on this!</p>

<dd>Yes, your presumption about "redirect" was accurate (you can read more about it <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">here</a> if you wish.) I looked into this a little further, some articles like these were already redirected, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_97_ZIP_codes&amp;redirect=no" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_97_ZIP_codes&amp;redirect=no" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for example. A good place to get an answer to your question from a group of people would be <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_contributors%27_help_page_6291.html" title="Wikipedia:New contributors' help page">Wikipedia:New contributors' help page</a>. This would certainly be faster than waiting to see if someone redirects it or nominates it for deletion. If you go there, I would be interested in hearing how it goes. I hope this works out to your satisfaction. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 19:21, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, you removed the prod tag from <a href="../../../c/e/m/Cement_Mixer_f729.html" title="Cement Mixer">Cement Mixer</a>, saying in the edit summary that it had already been prodded once. However, it hadn't been. Or did I misunderstand your edit summary comment? --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 19:27, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Xyzzyplugh. Yes, you understood my edit comment correctly. It doesn't appear in the page history because it was deleted as a result of the first prod nomination. Here is a link to the deletion log that shows the previous deletion: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Cement+Mixer" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Cement+Mixer" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> So procedurally, it can't be prodded again. It would have to go to AfD if you still want to see it deleted. Regards, <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 19:37, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Aha, thanks for the explanation. It didn't occur to me that it might have been prodded, deleted, and recreated. I understand that if a deleted article is remade, prod shouldn't be used the 2nd time, as this implies that the deletion was disputed by someone. I'm going to leave it as a redirect unless the redirect is reverted again. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 19:45, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, I think you just did!&#160;:) It is really as simple as going to the user's talk page, and posting on it as though you were editing an article. When you post on another user's page, the Wiki software alerts them that there has been a change on their talk page. Hope this answers your question. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 20:53, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No problem at all. In these cases, I type "reply" into the edit summary box, which appears directly above the buttons for Save page / Show preview / Show changes. This isn't an automated feature. Using the edit summary box is considered good Wiki-etiquette. Also, the messages appear in both places because I post them there manually. This is my way of keeping track on my talk page of what I have replied to and what I still need to reply to. I've found it makes things easier for me, that's all. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 21:18, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've responded to your "neutral" vote on my RfA: the incident happened completely by accident due to a Google Toolbar bug; hopefully you will consider changing your vote. —<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets<small>501</small></a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 18:38, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I donot know how to talk or write message to you. When I am writing all this, it means I know a lot. I am founder and settler of the charitable Trust "IBSAR" and handed over Monga to run the Trust in a charitable way and as per law. I did not know what Monga had in mind and he started a private coaching business under the umbrella of a charitable trust. He is ruuning from pilla to post to get recongnition from any University, but which University in India will involve it self in private business. I have moved courts to stops its business and disolve the trust or remove trustees. Police, Income Tax department, Higher Education department, UGC are after cheaters, but legal matters take time, to bring the cheaters to book. I have filed criminal cases against him and I shall be able to remove them.But it sites like you promote bogus colleges then students are misguided and cheaters earn money. I donot know who you are, but stop promoting Institute of Business Studies and Research and I donot know what interest you have in promototing a bogus college and delete the site. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Institute of Business Studies and Research (<a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstitute_of_Business_Studies_and_Research_7493.html" title="User talk:Institute of Business Studies and Research">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Institute_of_Business_Studies_and_Research_5837.html" title="Special:Contributions/Institute of Business Studies and Research">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I donot know who you are. But the fact remains you are promoting a bogus college. I repeat again Institute of Business Studies and Research is institution established by me but the maanagers like Monga have cheated the whole world. Legal actions have been intitiated. Do you think you will continue to promote till decisions yare taken by court. I can handover tons of documents to prove that it is a bogus college, but you people want it should come in Press that it a bogus.

<li>I will freely admit that these are not the greatest candidates for retention. I had not been involved in their creation, and I only spotted them when changes were made to the County article. I agree that the election criteria under consideration should cover both candidates with adequate sources, and would also cover successful candidates once they are in office. I also agree that a clearer, more objective criteria needs to be developed to cover many areas, and elected officials is one of them. I'm not asking you (or anyone else) to do anything you don't believe in. I sincerely feel that we can make Wikipedia a far more useful tool by including articles for New Jersey's 137 members of each <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_Chosen_Freeholders_8cf8.html" title="Board of Chosen Freeholders">Board of Chosen Freeholders</a>, and that we can do so without making Wikipedia an "indiscriminate collection of useless information" as is often used in opposition. Additionally, the fact that most of this effort is being done as part of <a href="../../../n/j/_/WP%7ENJ_29f7.html" title="WP:NJ">WP:NJ</a>, an organized effort to expand details about the state, militates against the concern that this is being done on a willy-nilly basis. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 19:31, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I hadn't realised that the article was up for AfD until I saw that a reference to the article was a red link. A few clicks led me to the realization that it had been part of a blanket AfD. While I may be tempting the fates, I think the article as I've written it will withstand scrutiny, as it will discuss the role of the shopping mall in New Jersey, and not be a straight laundry list. I don't understand why some lists are rioutinely deleted, while many others that are far more meaningless survive. I will consider your suggestion to remove "List of" from the tiltle, as a means to take the red flag away from the bull(s).

<dd>I can't say you didn't warn me. It was about time that someone spotted the title of the article and started an AfD. I agree 100% that the words <b>List of</b> is what set them off. If you read several of the deletes posted, it seems clear that these people read the tiyle, but not the article. I never got around to your suggestion, and this will probably be as good a time as any to do the move.

<p><b>I've started a discussion section on the Deletion Policy page regarding reality television contestants</b>. My main point is this: the ABC.com homepage does a perfectly fine job of sorting out who is a contestant on Survivor, and their background.

<p>Looking for some help on a really small matter. One user, PassionoftheDamon, consistantly changes the "Offensive Scheme" in the info box to "pro style" or "vertical pass" when it is in fact "Pro Set". I have provided links on the user's talk page and on the 2006 Florida State Seminoles football team discussion page verifying the accurateness of the "pro set" change that I keep making, but he refuses to acknowledge it. Even the FSU football media guide, which should be the definitive source of this info, claims that it is "pro set".

<dd>I performed my own cursory research on the web and found references to "Pro Set" as a formation and also "Pro Set" as a scheme. I think you should update the article <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Set_b49a.html" title="Pro Set">Pro Set</a> to address this apparent dual meaning and cite some appropriate references. I would also recommend linking "Pro Set" in the info box of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Florida_State_Seminoles_football_team_c6f1.html" title="2006 Florida State Seminoles football team">2006 Florida State Seminoles football team</a> article to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Set_b49a.html" title="Pro Set">Pro Set</a> article. If the other editor is not able to provide <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources for his information, it does not belong in Wikipedia.

<p>Hi Accurizer,</p>
<p>Thanks for your warm welcome on my talk page. I was wondering, what's the difference between a talk page and a user page? Also, how do I get a link to the articles I've created on my user page? I've noticed some people have little icons on their user page showing what they're interested in - where do I get these from?</p>

<dd>Looking at your user page, it appears you've done well in figuring out how to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Help%7EContents_Links_c5a8.html" title="Help:Contents/Links">link</a> articles. Manually linking the articles you've created seems to be the best approach. There is an automated "my contributions" link at the top of the screen, in which you can see all of your contributions. Other editors can view this by clicking on "User contributions" in the toolbox on the lower left of the screen. However, this is not especially useful to keep track of a small number of articles, since the contributions list fills up rather quickly. For user boxes, you can browse the available boxes at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_3753.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes">Wikipedia:Userboxes</a>. I hope this information is helpful.

<p>Hi Accurizer,<br />
Thanks for your message re the above; glad to know you approve of the amended layout! &#160;However:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>...I thought, however, the heading should say "Capital" instead of "Capitals" since there is only one capital at any given time...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Good point – I agree entirely, so have moved the template to {{<a href="../../../u/s/_/Template%7EUS_capital_9330.html" title="Template:US capital">US capital</a>}} and added a comment to the code for the sake of future editors. Hope this (and col 1's align="right") is okay.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>As you invited me to "ask any questions" upon my entry to the wiki process, and marking Big Wow Theory for deletion, I thought I'd ask you. What can one do if there is a persistent difference of opinion? Noticing that the articles for Planck scale and Planck epoch were both stubs, I decided to flesh those articles out. I thought the Planck scale entry was especially weak, as it made no mention of its most common usage in Cosmology, as a lower limit to the size or distance scale. It was also my opinion that it's well-accepted or frequently assumed that the universe had its beginning at the Planck scale, and that this should be stated as one of the reasons the Planck scale is assumed to be significant.</p>
<p>Another user, Yevgeny Kats has disputed this repeatedly, and I have attempted to be civil and assume good faith. On some level; I appreciate his attempts to insist on my precise correctness, and to change erroneous or misleading sections where necessary. While I admire his tenacity, and the strength of his knowledge in some areas, he seems biased toward the view that the Planck scale is primarily the purview of particle physicists and string theory, with a decided preference for cosmological scenarios that involve some kind of a pre-bang context.</p>
<p>I have put a long note explaining my stand on his user page, and have assembled a fair number of references which support my view. Brian Greene states that it's believed the universe began as a Planck-sized Nugget quite explicitly in "The Elegant Universe," but after doing a search on arxiv.org for papers containing the term Planck scale I also came up with a number which support my view, along with a few dissenting opinions. I have tried to reflect consensus views in all my wiki editing, but Yevgeny seems to be striving for 'correctness' instead. I've suggested in my note that he should consider writing an article for arxiv.org himself, but I don't know how this will go over. I will wait to make any significant edits until there is a response. I have announced my intent to create a References section, and I will go ahead if I have time, but I'll only correct typos, and leave the content intact for now.</p>
<p>I would invite and request that you visit Planck scale, Planck epoch, and Yevgeny's user page. I am frustrated, at this point, but I don't want to give up on the Wiki, because I feel it needs me as much as I need the arena for sharpening my knowledge and skills. I have suggested to Yevgeny that we start by assuming plausible extensions to the FLRW model (i.e. - inflationary universe theories), and state later in the article that these views may not be true, citing possible exceptions or objections separately from the mainstream view, which should make up the bulk of the article, in my opinion. I know I've made some errors already, but it seems that Yevgeny has introduced a few, as well. Is there a final word on this?</p>
<p>Respectfully Yours,</p>
