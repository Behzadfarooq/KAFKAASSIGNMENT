<p>Hi, I don't think you should delete tiny, beginning pages. By starting a link there is more chance of people taking up the baton and expanding the topic. The page in question describes the location of a place and gives a fact or two about it. This seems relevant to me. Al</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, if you would like to recreate the article, you could always draft it in your userspace (User:Englishwildman/Bahia Lapataia) and I can take a look at it or you could seek help at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_contributors%27_help_page_6291.html" title="Wikipedia:New contributors' help page">Wikipedia:New contributors' help page</a> to see if it fits with Wikipedia's standards. There are editors who will give you useful advice, copyedit and wikify the article and help you determine whether it satisfies Wikipedia's inclusion criteria. If you recreate the same material as an article without first improving it, another editor will likely nominate it for <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion</a> again. I hope this information is helpful. Regards, <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 13:02, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Accurizer, two people named Morginq and Drubroughton (though it's possible they're the same person) vandalized the NJ article and left the following note: "Until Accurizer stops sucking so much ass, New Jersey has been put on notice. SLS Rules!" I've reverted it back, but I'd thought I'd let you know.</p>

<dd>Hi Ken, this user vandalized again (to the <a href="../../../n/i/g/Niger.html" title="Niger">Niger</a> article) so I referred the matter to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. He has been blocked for 48 hours. With regard to protecting the New Jersey page, this is not usually done when there are only a handful of users involved. The preferred response is to deal with the vandals individually, rather than disallowing the larger community from being able to edit an article. In any event, thanks for keeping an eye out for vandalism. Regards, <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 23:46, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that you do not find the wounded soldier article to be appropriate for display on wikipedia. The two links you sent me (what wikipedia is not and importance) were most interesting. After reading these artciles, I have failed to understand how this article does not qualify as a relavent wikipedia topic. Please be more specific with your reasoning so that I can appropriately fix the article. Also, were you familiar with the term before you read the article? I have heard it many times around many different groups of people and communities and can find it referenced in a number of documents that come up with a goole-search for the term. I thin enlightening people to its meaning is most informative and necessary. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bucktown (<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBucktown_53a2.html" title="User talk:Bucktown">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bucktown_a0ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bucktown">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Hi, before making this nomination, I attempted to verify whether the term was <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. However, my research led me to conclude that it appears to be a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>, which should be avoided in Wikipedia, per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. Also, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a dictionary. I don't see how this subject could be more than a dictionary article. Perhaps you should present it at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>. In any event, if you object to its deletion, let me know and we can raise the matter at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> where the wider community would reach a consensus regarding whether or not the article should be kept. On a side note, please don't take the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion process</a> personally. Wikipedia is happy to accept your contributions that meet the inclusion criteria.

<p>He was fictional?! Wherein is that mentioned at all (besides the word starship, I notice as I reread)?

<dd>First and foremost, please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> when you interact with other editors. This would include not characterizing other editor's work as vandalism in your edit summaries when it is not. It would be best it you read <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a> for an explanation of what vandalism is, and what vandalism is not. With regard to the <a href="../../../o/z/_/Oz_%28TV_series%29_f2b2.html" title="Oz (TV series)">Oz (TV series)</a> articles, when I first came across them during vandal patrolling, I found serious duplication of information among these articles. Some of the articles did not even link to each other. I made an attempt to clean up the issues that I could and redirected articles that seemed duplicative. Indeed, you yourself seemed to indicate doubt about the way the articles had been created, see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGays_of_Oz&amp;diff=57541757&amp;oldid=57541257" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGays_of_Oz&amp;diff=57541757&amp;oldid=57541257" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. If you don't like the way things came out feel free to fix them. But try to keep the articles consise. Also keep in mind that there is probably not a need for a separate article for every gang and character. If you feel it is justified to keep a large number of articles, you should create an info box that would appear in each article and show how they interrelate. I will revisit these articles in a week or so. If the duplicate information reappears I will propose mergers so that the wider community can discuss how best to proceed.

<dd>In order to meet Wikipedia's inclusion criteria, the company would have to satisfy <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. This is because Wikipedia is for subjects that are <i>already</i> notable. Please read WP:CORP and let me know if you feel it satisfies this requirement. Provided it does, I would be happy to help you with the article. The next step would be to provide <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a> for the information that would be contained in the article. If you don't have time today to review WP:CORP or to improve the article, you should copy it onto your computer's hard drive or into your user space (<a href="../../../j/p/s/User%7EJpskidmore_jps_IT_3182.html" title="User:Jpskidmore/jps IT">User:Jpskidmore/jps IT</a>) so that the information will be preserved in the event another deletion takes place. (I usually draft articles in a word processor before posting them to Wikipedia, so that they will be more complete when they are posted. This could help avoid deletion of the article while you are working on it.)

<p>The header of the section you quoted reads "Album titles and band names", so even though it is not exactly stated, the convention should also apply to band names. It is general usage to use the same capitalisation rules for band names, so that e.g. self-titled albums don't have a different capitalisation than the band itself (according to the guideline, an album titled <i>Cute Is What We Aim for</i> would not have a capital "f"). So yes, I would mind if you reverted the changes...&#160;:) --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryCane_57e2.html" title="User:HarryCane">HarryCane</a> 12:11, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well if it is to stop double-entries then fair enough. Will you be changing pages so that they all appear in just one category?

<dd>Hi, thanks for your response. Articles can appear in more than one category. The problem with this particular category is that it became unuseful because of the numerous multiple entries.
