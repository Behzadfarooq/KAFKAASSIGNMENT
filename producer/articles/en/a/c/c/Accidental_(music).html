<p>In most cases, a <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharp_%28music%29.html" title="Sharp (music)">sharp</a> raises the pitch of a note one <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitone.html" title="Semitone">semitone</a> while a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_%28music%29.html" title="Flat (music)">flat</a> lowers it a <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitone.html" title="Semitone">semitone</a>. A <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_sign.html" title="Natural sign">natural</a> is used to cancel the effect of a flat or sharp, whether from a <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key_signature.html" title="Key signature">key signature</a> or a previous accidental.</p>
<p>Since about 1700, accidentals have been understood to continue for the remainder of the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_%28music%29.html" title="Bar (music)">measure</a> in which they occur, so that a subsequent note on the same <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staff_position.html" title="Staff position">staff position</a> is still affected by that accidental, unless replaced by an accidental of its own. Notes on other <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staff_position.html" title="Staff position">staff positions</a>, including those an <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octave.html" title="Octave">octave</a> away, are unaffected. Once a barline is passed, the effect of the accidental ends, except when a note affected by an accidental (either explicit or implied from earlier in the measure) is tied to the same note across a barline; see <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accidental_%28music%29.html#Courtesy_accidentals" title="Accidental (music)">Courtesy accidentals</a>, below. This system for accidentals operates in conjunction with the <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key_signature.html" title="Key signature">key signature</a>, whose effect continues throughout an entire piece, unless cancelled by another key signature. The <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key_signature.html" title="Key signature">key signature</a> reduces the number of accidentals required for a measure by specifying in advance the notes in the key which are usually flat or sharp. An accidental can be used to cancel or reinstate the flats or sharps of the key signature as well for the duration of a measure.</p>
<p>Though this tradition is still in use particularly in tonal music, it may be cumbersome in music that features frequent accidentals, as is often the case in non-tonal music. As a result, an alternate system of note-for-note accidentals has been adopted with the aim of reducing the number of accidentals required to notate a measure. The system is as follows:<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>Accidentals affect only those notes which they immediately precede.</li>
<li>Accidentals are not repeated on tied notes unless the tie goes from line to line or page to page.</li>
<li>Accidentals are not repeated for repeated notes unless one or more different pitches [or rests] intervene.</li>
<li>If a sharp or flat pitch is followed directly by its natural form, a natural is used.</li>
<li>Cautionary accidentals or naturals (in parentheses) may be used to clarify ambiguities, but should be held to a minimum.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because seven of the twelve notes of the chromatic equal-tempered scale are naturals, this system can significantly reduce the number of naturals required in a notated passage.</p>
<p>Note that in a few cases the accidental might change the note by more than a <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitone.html" title="Semitone">semitone</a>: for example, if a G sharp is followed in the same measure by a G flat, the flat sign on the latter note means it will be two semitones lower than if no accidental were present. Thus, the effect of the accidental has to be understood in relation to the "natural" meaning of the note's <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staff_position.html" title="Staff position">staff position</a>. For the sake of clarity, some composers put a natural in front of the accidental. Thus, if in this example the composer actually wanted the note a semitone lower than G-natural, he might put first a natural sign to cancel the previous G-sharp, then the flat.</p>

<p><b>Double accidentals</b> raise or lower the pitch of a note by two semitones, an innovation developed as early as 1615. An F with a double sharp applied raises it a <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whole_step.html" title="Whole step">whole step</a> so it is <a href="../../../e/n/h/Enharmonic.html" title="Enharmonic">enharmonically</a> equivalent to a G. Usage varies on how to notate the situation in which a note with a double sharp is followed in the same measure by a note with a single sharp: some publications simply use the single accidental for the latter note, whereas others use a combination of a natural and a sharp, with the natural being understood to apply to only the second sharp.</p>

<p>Although a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barline.html" title="Barline">barline</a> is nowadays understood to cancel the effect of an accidental (except for a tied note), often publishers will use a <b>courtesy accidental</b> (also referred to as a <b>cautionary accidental</b> or a <b>reminder accidental</b>) as a reminder of the correct pitch if the same note occurs in the following measure. This usage varies, although a few situations are construed to require a courtesy accidental, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>when the first note in a measure is one which had had an accidental applied in the previous measure</li>
<li>after a tie carries an accidental across a barline, when the same note appears again in the subsequent measure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other uses are inconsistently applied.</p>
<p>Courtesy accidentals are sometimes enclosed in parentheses to emphasize their nature as reminders.</p>
<p>Publishers of <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> music and some <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonal.html" title="Atonal">atonal</a> music sometimes eschew all courtesy accidentals.</p>

<p>Composers of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microtonal_music.html" title="Microtonal music">microtonal music</a> have developed a number of notations for indicating the various pitches outside of standard notation. One such system for notating <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarter_tone.html" title="Quarter tone">quarter tones</a>, used by the Czech <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alois_H%C3%A1ba_e06e.html" title="Alois Hába">Alois Hába</a> and other composers, is shown on the right.</p>
<p>In the 19th and beginning 20th century, when Turkish musicians switched from their traditional notation systems — which were not staff-based — to the European staff-based system, they created a refinement to the European accidental system in order to be able to notate Turkish scales which make use of intervals smaller than the tempered semitone. There are several such systems which vary as to the division of the octave they presuppose or merely the graphical shape of the accidentals. The most widely used system (created by <a href="../../../r/a/u/Rauf_Yekta_Bey_8c13.html" title="Rauf Yekta Bey">Rauf Yekta Bey</a>) uses a system of 4 sharps (roughly +25 <a href="../../../c/e/n/Cent_%28music%29.html" title="Cent (music)">cents</a>, +75 cents, +125 cents and +175 cents) and 4 flats (roughly −25 cents, −75 cents, −125 cents and −175 cents), none of which correspond to the tempered sharp and flat. They presuppose a Pythagorean division of the octave taking the <a href="../../../p/y/t/Pythagorean_comma.html" title="Pythagorean comma">Pythagorean comma</a> (about an 8th of the tempered tone, actually closer to 24 cents, defined as the difference between 7 octaves and 12 just-intonation fifths) as the basic interval. The Turkish systems have also been adopted by some Arab musicians.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Johnston_ae28.html" title="Ben Johnston">Ben Johnston</a> created a system of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notation.html" title="Notation">notation</a> for pieces in <a href="../../../j/u/s/Just_intonation.html" title="Just intonation">just intonation</a> where the unmarked C, F, and G major chords are just major chords (4:5:6) and accidentals are used to create just tuning in other keys.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/c/Accidental_%28music%29.html" title="Edit section: History of notation of accidentals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History of notation of accidentals</span></h2>
<p>The three principal symbols indicating whether a note should be raised or lowered in pitch are derived from variations of the letter B: the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharp_%28music%29.html" title="Sharp (music)">sharp</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_sign.html" title="Natural sign">natural</a> signs from the square "B quadratum", and the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_%28music%29.html" title="Flat (music)">flat</a> sign from the round "B rotundum".</p>
<p>In the early days of European music notation (4-line staff <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_chant.html" title="Gregorian chant">Gregorian chant</a> manuscripts), only the note B could be altered (i.e. have an accidental applied to it): it could be flattened, thus moving from the <i>hexachordum durum</i> (i.e. the <i>hard <a href="../../../h/e/x/Hexachord.html" title="Hexachord">hexachord</a></i>: G-A-B-C-D-E) where it is natural, to the <i>hexachordum molle</i> (i.e. the <i>soft hexachord</i>: F-G-A-B♭-C-D) where it is flat; the note B is not present in the third hexachord <i>hexachordum naturale</i> (i.e. the <i>natural hexachord</i>: C-D-E-F-G-A).</p>
<p>This long use of B as the only altered note incidentally helps explain some notational peculiarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>the flat sign actually derives from a round B, signifying the B of the <i>soft hexachord</i>, that is, B flat (hence the name of the flat sign in French "bémol" from medieval French "bé mol" — modern French "bé mou" — or "soft b") and originally meant only B♭;</li>
<li>the natural sign derives from a square B, signifying the B of the <i>hard hexachord</i>, that is, B natural (hence the name of the natural sign in French "bécarre" from medieval French "bé carre", earlier "bé quarre" — modern French "bé carré" — or "square b") and originally meant only B natural.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the same way, in German music notation the letter B designates B flat while the letter H, which is actually a deformation of a square B, designates B natural.</p>
<p>As polyphony became more complex, notes other than B needed to be altered in order to avoid undesirable harmonic or melodic intervals (especially the augmented 4th, or <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tritone.html" title="Tritone">tritone</a>, that music theory writers referred to as "<i><a href="../../../d/i/a/Diabolus_in_musica.html" title="Diabolus in musica">diabolus in musica</a></i>", i.e. "<i>the devil in music</i>"). The first sharp in use was F♯, then came the second flat E♭, then C♯, G♯, etc.; by the 16th century B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭ and F♯, C♯, G♯, D♯ and A♯ were all in use to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
<p>However, those accidentals were often not notated in vocal part-books (but the correct pitches were always notated in <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tablature.html" title="Tablature">tablature</a>). The notational practice of not marking implied accidentals, leaving them to be supplied by the performer instead, was called <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musica_ficta.html" title="Musica ficta">musica ficta</a> (i.e. "feigned music").</p>
