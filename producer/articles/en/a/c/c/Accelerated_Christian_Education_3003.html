<p>Accelerated Christian Education was founded in 1970 by Donald and Esther Howard, who had concluded that their children should no longer attend public schools, due to their perceived lack of morals. They set about developing a <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> based curriculum, which was adopted by a number of private <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_school.html" title="Christian school">Christian schools</a>.</p>
<p>The company has been headed at various times by logistics expert David Derby and supply-chain management specialist Joseph Emerson. The company reached its pinnacle during the 1980's, when many employees walked around corporate headquarters wearing "Conquest Eighties" lapel pins. <a href="http://www.schooloftomorrow.com/aboutus/index.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.schooloftomorrow.com/aboutus/index.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>The Accelerated Christian Education curriculum is based on a series of workbooks called PACEs, which stands for Packets of Accelerated Christian Education. Each subject has 12 PACEs per grade level. The basic subjects of ACE are Math, English, Science, Social Studies, and Word Building (spelling and word usage). No teacher's manuals are published for the elementary grades since all the material is contained in the PACEs. Score Keys are published for corresponding high school level PACEs.</p>
<p>Substitute PACEs are developed for some countries that use the metric system or measurement or are not covered in detail in the regular Social Studies PACEs.</p>

<p>When a student enters the ACE system, their academic ability is diagnosed, and any learning gaps are addressed <sup id="_ref-Why_ACE_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Why_ACE" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A PACE is equivalent to two weeks of work. Students set goals of how much work they will do in each subject each day, putting the responsibility for their progress on the student. As the student works individually through the PACE, they do a series of reviews, and at the end sit a preparatory test. They then sit a PACE test. The pass score for a PACE test is 80%, however, if a passing score is not achieved then the student must retake the test until they pass (achieve &gt;= 80%). <sup id="_ref-Why_ACE_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Why_ACE" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The kindergarten subjects prepare children for reading. Children who are ready to read progress through the "ABC's with Ace and Christi" reading program. The program uses songs and stories to teach the letters of the alphabet and their sounds. <sup id="_ref-Preschool_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Preschool" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Once students are able to read at a reasonable level, they are able to work with little assistance from their teacher, or supervisor, as the ACE curriculum calls them. The supervisor is expected to motivate and supervise the student, monitor their progress, and mark their work <sup id="_ref-Supervisor_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Supervisor" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In elementary grades, students study the basic subjects, plus Creative Writing, with Art as an elective. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[4]</a></sup>. High school students continue studying the core subjects plus electives including Spanish, French, Government, Health, Bible Study, Music, Art, Typing, and Accounting <sup id="_ref-Highschool_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Highschool" title="">[5]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Many homeschooling families add their own lessons in the arts, science, sports, etc., as well as excursions and extracurricular activities. Many children that use ACE find time for internships, apprenticeships and vocational exploration, since it is reasonable to complete the curriculum in much less time than the average child uses in the public school setting.</p>

<p>In 1980 there were 3,000 Christian Schools in the United States assocaited with ACE. (Splawn, Stoker, Abstract) Splawn, Stoker 1980</p>
<p>Before a school is started the administrator and supervisor will attend workshops from ACE instructing them how to use the curriculum. Schools are not required to use the entire ACE curriculum and may augment it with additional curriculum from other sources such as BJU, A-Beka, or even secular material. <a href="http://www.aceministries.com/aboutus/startaschool.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aceministries.com/aboutus/startaschool.aspx" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>

<p>ACE holds an annual International Student Convention for High School students designed to develop leadership skills with students. Regional conventions are held throughout the world and the top placed participants are able to proceed to the International Convention. Regional Conventions have been held since at least 1979.</p>
<p>The Conventions are held at Universities across the country. For instance, 1990, Indiana University in Bloomington, 1991, North Texas University in Denton, TX, 1993 Northern Arizona University in Falgstaff, 1994 Purdue University in Indiana.</p>
<p>Schools that use the ACE curriculum may participate in the student conventions. The conventions augment the curriculum by requiring students to prepare to compete in dramatic, artistic, and athletic events.</p>
<p>The conventions also offer "Events of the Heart" which allows for students with mental and physical disabilities to participate in the activities and awards ceremony.</p>
<p>A sampling of events include Academic Achievement (100 PACEs completed, Spelling, Chess, Science Exhibits), artistic (Music Composition, Short Story Writing, Photography, Powerpoint, Metalworking), Dramatic (One Act Play, Radio Dramas, Interpretation for the Deaf), Christian Oriented (Preaching, Golden Scripture Memorization), and Athletics (Track and Field, Basketball, Volleyball, Archery).</p>
<p>The student convention augments the ACE curriculum by requiring student driven, teacher guided, prepartion for competition. Students will often participate in multiple events, some individual, and some group. <a href="http://www.aceministries.com/conventions/ISC/ISC%20Guidelines%20Section%20I%20Final%202007.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aceministries.com/conventions/ISC/ISC%20Guidelines%20Section%20I%20Final%202007.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.aceministries.com/conventions/ISC/updates.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aceministries.com/conventions/ISC/updates.aspx" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>The student convention also offers speakers geared at high school students. In the past speakers such as DAvid Gibbs from the Christian Law Assocation, Ben Jordan, William Murray (Madeline Murray Ohare's son).</p>
<p>When the convention first started a parade in the hosting city would accompony it. In 1981 over 3,000 students and sponsors marched in New York City to celebrate the opening of the convention at Rutgers University. <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D1FFD385C0C718DDDAF0894D9484D81" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D1FFD385C0C718DDDAF0894D9484D81" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

<p><i>Speck and Prideau (1993) state,</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The curriculum of many Christian Right schools includes packets of materials from the Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) program. In many of these schools the students work on the packets in their own small offices or cubicles. The work consists of low-level cognitive tasks that emphasize simple association and recall activities, as is typical of instruction from workbooks. Despite the reviling of B. F. Skinner by the Christian Right, the materials make heavy use of behavioral objectives, programmed learning, and rewards (Hunter, 1987, cited in Speck &amp; Prideaux, 1993). Students are not supposed to communicate with other students, get up, or turn around without obtaining permission from a supervisor. Students who are having difficulty are expected to raise a small American or Christian flag signaling that they need help. In many of the Christian Right schools interaction between students has been cut off and intellectual activities in groups rarely occur because group work is not valued. Cooperative learning, which invests some power in and attributes some wisdom to the group, is seen to undermine the relationship of subservience of children to adults and to God. Cooperative learning is considered bad learning."</p>

<p>"Nearly all speculative activities about the world and the human condition have been purged from the curriculum, and so, therefore, have all of the teaching methodologies that promote speculation — field trips, inquiry learning, laboratory learning, cooperative learning, and so forth. When questioned on these matters, the vice president of ACE said, "ACE does not necessarily embrace philosophical beliefs compatible with those of most contemporary writers of curriculum" (quoted in Speck &amp; Prideaux, 1993, p. 284). The vice-president might have said, as well, that ACE also rejects all of contemporary learning and curriculum theory.</p>

<p>Gehrman(1987) and Speck and Prideaux(1993) have analyzed the curriculum of the ACE and found the following:</p>

<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/c/Accelerated_Christian_Education_3003.html" title="Edit section: Mathematics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mathematics</span></h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Christian Right educators, like those who designed the ACE packets, believe that mathematics is a factual enterprise, and should be taught as an example of God's orderly universe. This belief was expressed by the Gablers when they opposed the "new math" of the 1960s. They claimed that the new math would undermine faith in absolute values, and therefore could lead to relativistic thinking, which is precisely what the secular humanists want. Relativistic thinking inexorably leads to an erosion of the students' faith in Christianity (Gaddy, Hall, &amp; Marzano, 1996).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>English is taught as a way to spread God's word, and language use is emphasized through exercises like "Jesus died for (your, you're) sins." and "God (is, are) good." Missing from high school reading lists is such literature as The Diary of Anne Frank and Romeo and Juliet (too sexual), Othello (promotes interracial marriage), and Catcher in the Rye (multiple issues, sexuality; profanity; self-indulgence; lying; defamation of women, people with disabilities, God, and minorities). Other books challenged frequently by the Christian Right include Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, and John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men. Christian Right censors also apparently believe that young children are in danger from Dr. Seuss books. Gaddy, Hall and Marzano (1996) describe how Samantha Smith of the Colorado Eagle Forum found danger in both The Cat in the Hat (it shows how a child's will can be compromised) and Green Eggs and Ham. In the middle of the latter book, writes Ms. Smith, are illustrations "where the train tunnel doesn't quite look like a train tunnel and the end of the tunnel seems to have hair on it. Could that be?" (p. 120)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ACE social studies curriculum pays homage to capitalism and contains a great many patriotic messages. These themes are often blended with Christianity, communicating the message that this is God's chosen country. An equally important message conveyed by the materials is that women have their place. In one story that is part of the Social Studies ACE packet, a mother says to her son:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your father is the head of our home. It is God's plan for the father to be head of his family. I talk to your father about things, but he is the one who decides what we must do. I would do wrong not to obey your father because he is the head of our home. God is pleased when a mother obeys the father in the home. (Speck &amp; Prideaux, 1993, p. 287).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In social studies materials in use at the Center Road Christian Academy of Buffalo, New York, students learned that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>men are often better at math and science because of the way their minds work. . . . To fulfill their duties as protectors and providers, men usually have stronger, heavier muscles. . . . Men usually enjoy work outside the home, while women usually find greater enjoyment working within the home. . . . Some vocations are distinctly for men, while others are distinctly for women. (Gehrman, 1987, p. 16)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, and somewhat paradoxically, at the <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dade_Christian_School_ccba.html" title="Dade Christian School">Dade Christian School</a> in <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami%2C_Florida_f9df.html" title="Miami, Florida">Miami, Florida</a>, students must pledge not to "draw, wear, or display in any way the 'peace' symbol" (Gehrman, 1987, p. 16). Other social studies materials vociferously condemn the United Nations and the evil people who are trying to create one world order, subjugating this nation, God's nation, to a greater authority. The United Nations is abhorred because it has as a working premise the tolerance of, and respect for, other religions. That becomes intolerable for some of the Christian Right since there is only one true God and those that do not find him are damned for eternity.</p>

<p><a name="Science" id="Science"></a></p>
<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/c/Accelerated_Christian_Education_3003.html" title="Edit section: Science">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Science</span></h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Both science processes and science facts appear to be taught poorly in Christian Right schools. One science ACE packet (1986) defines science as "the search for the principles of God's creation based upon reproducible experiments.... We should always subject a principle to the test of the Bible" (p. 3). In contrast, science was described by the National Academy of Sciences in this way: "Scientific interpretations of facts are always provisional and must be testable" (quoted in Knight, 1985, p. 118). It is to be expected, therefore, that science in many Christian schools would be taught inadequately by secular standards. And that is what is found (Speck &amp; Prideaux, 1993). ACE Packets for Year 8 Earth Science include a unit that provides "proof" of creationism and another unit that provides "proof" of the flood. Year 9 Physical Science includes a unit on the limitations of science and another on the Bible and scientific method. Year 10 Biology has units on the facts of creation, and critiques of evolution, ecology, and conservation. As might be expected, the demand for obedience by youth to authority and the Bible leads to direct conflicts with the processes and the theories of contemporary science. The much debated Christian Right alternative to evolutionary theory, Creation Science, is offered to the public schools as a way to present the facts of science in such a way as to be fair to Christian children. However, Creation Science simply is not science. It cannot be taught as science without distorting science. When public school boards and administrators seriously consider Creation Science as science curriculum they demonstrate their ignorance of science, their ignorance of U.S. law, and their lack of understanding of the goals of the Christian Right. But private fundamentalist schools of the Christian Right do not have to compete with evolutionary theory—they can teach whatever they want. Thus the ACE science packet (1986) used in private Christian schools says that Darwin is an important figure in science but that his theory of evolution is wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bible is completely against any such theory. Evolution claims that man arose through a series of random changes. The theory leaves no room for man's responsibility or man's sin. If evolution were true, no man would be born a sinner because Adam would never have fallen and committed the original sin of disobedience to God. If evolution were true, Christ would not have needed to die for our sin.</p>
</blockquote>
(p. 12)
<p>In discussing the sediment from core samples of earth obtained when drilling for oil off the coast of Guatemala, the ACE science packet notes: <i>Much of that sediment was deposited during the Flood, but even without the deposition of sediment by the Flood, the yearly deposition rates tell us that the Earth is quite young.</i> (p. 16)</p>
There is no problem in educating the young for the Reverend Lee of the Center Road Christian Academy. His school does not have to worry much about secular science, for he announces: "Daily lessons in the Scripture are designed for programming the mind to enable the child to see life from God's point of view.... Teaching is training"</blockquote>
