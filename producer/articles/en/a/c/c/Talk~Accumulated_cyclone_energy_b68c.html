<p>I know Kerry Emanual has found a strong correlation between potential destructiveness of hurricanes based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone and sea surface temperatures. (Other studies have found no correlation between storm frequency and SSTs.) Did this use ACE? If so, I suggest it would be good to add this to the article. <a href="../../../c/-/r/User%7EC-randles_89b3.html" title="User:C-randles">crandles</a> 14:37, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think adding the year <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> to this list is <b>way</b> too early. Let's wait until the season as actually over! <a href="../../../a/w/o/User%7EAwolf002_16a4.html" title="User:Awolf002">Awolf002</a> 14:11, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's enough that the 2005 number is stated in the text just before the table.

<dd>I'm restoring it, since it is a straight addition of published information from NOAA.

<p>I guess, I'm outvoted 2:1&#160;:-) Still, updating this number and table nearly each day for the next few weeks sounds totally unneccessary.

<dd>On the contrary, the number in progress indicates how active this season has been against other seasons.

<p>Can a season be both <i>near normal</i> and <i>hyperactive</i>? Say there are several long-lasting Cape Verde storms but few other tropical storms, and the ACE goes above 153 with a high number of major hurricanes (say 9/8/7)? <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyC83_1bc7.html" title="User:CrazyC83">CrazyC83</a> 02:49, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Doesn't 153 9/8/7 meets sufficient criteria for above normal? I don't see why it would be impossible to have something like 140 9/5/4 classed as near normal (9&lt;10 and 5&lt;6). If the 4 were all strong Cat 4 or 5 could it be hyperactive? (140&lt;153 but the strong cat 4 and cat 5 could push it into hyperactive territory I think. (1958 was hyperactive with only 121.)) <a href="../../../c/-/r/User%7EC-randles_89b3.html" title="User:C-randles">crandles</a> 16:10, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. I think we want Pacific ACE information added to the graph (in different colours) and perhaps also a table to be put next to the Atlantic one.

<dd>Does it matter? The uncertainty of the measurment is quite large. First the storm wind speed on which it is based is usually to +/-5 knots or even ten, and this is squared. This means that the uncertainties are probably at least 5% in each measurement, especially for powerful storms that contribute most. Also the storms are only quoted to 3 sig figs so anything in the last two decimal places is really statistically spurious. Finally there is the error in adding all the powerful storms together. All in all this debate is, pardon the pun, a storm in a teacup. Furthermore there is absolutely no justification in qutoing the total season ACE to more than one decimal place under any circumstance. 81.174.244.201 20:49, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I assume the calculation is (max. speed)^2 because as the top speed gets larger the hurricanes also increase in size and thus overall power. The problem I see with this is that it doesn't differentiate between storms of the same max speed but widely differing extents. For example Camille had higher windspeeds than Katrina, but since it was a more compact storm a smaller part of the coastline felt its highest speeds compared to the much larger Katrina. Wouldn't a better measure of a storm's power be</p>
<p>V<sub>max</sub> * R<sub>ts</sub></p>
<p>where V<sub>max</sub> is the maximum speed and R<sub>ts</sub> the radial extent of tropical storm force winds.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The calculation is (max speed)^2 because Kinetic energy equals mass times (velocity)^2. The hurricane DOES NOT neccesairly increase in size. ACE is a pretty worthless calculation IMHO because it does not take the radius of the storm into account. 08:19, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes this is a known problem with ACE. A measure of radius would improve the calculation of what it is trying to measure. The trouble is past records simply are not good enough to introduce such a measure well. If you just do it for recent years, what is the point unless you have something to compare to? While this certainly introduces errors in the calculation, when you have large numbers of measurments (over 150? 6 hourly measurements in a season or should it be on 10 storms a season?) is the ratio of small storms for the windspeed compared to those that are large for their windspeed likely to change much? I doubt it changes that dramatically provided you are comparing a season's ACE to another season's ACE. If you are comparing storm ACEs' then it is a much bigger problem. I think <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerry_Emanuel_2652.html" title="Kerry Emanuel">Kerry Emanuel</a> had another look at this for his Power dissipation index (uses wind speed cubed) but again concluded that there were inadequate records of storm radii for this to be used. <a href="../../../c/-/r/User%7EC-randles_89b3.html" title="User:C-randles">crandles</a> 15:25, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not criticising, just wondering why the new graph shows ACE per storm rather than number of storms (or something else). I am just not sure what it is trying to show. I am thinking that I would like to see what is the biggest contribution to ACE; is it number of storms, duration of storms, or stength of storms. However I am not quite sure how I would show that. (Results of multiple regression analysis maybe? If I wanted to do this, I don't even know where there is data on the number of 6 hourly storm advisories in each season could be found.) <a href="../../../c/-/r/User%7EC-randles_89b3.html" title="User:C-randles">crandles</a> 15:45, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is much less of a problem if you look at a 10year ACE average.

<dd>Great. Three weeks after I finally get my calculations in line with the table in this article, our friend decides to add subtropical (ST) values. By my calculations, no less than <b>22 seasons</b> (out of 56) would have a higher ACE if we consistently include ST data. These 22 seasons would increase by an average of 4.5. Indeed, NCDC's 2004 table, mentioned above <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2004/2004-atlantic-trop-cyclones.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2004/2004-atlantic-trop-cyclones.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, has a value for ST Nicole, but its value for tropical storm Otto is 1.05 instead of 1.94, which leads me to believe that ST data was <b>not</b> counted for Otto. Furthermore, the ACE description below the table states "all periods in which the <i>tropical cyclone</i> is a tropical storm or greater intensity." (empasis added) <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subtropical_cyclone.html" title="Subtropical cyclone">Wiki says</a> ST is only part tropical, and part extratropical, so does it fully meet the first criteria of being a tropical cyclone? (BTW, it's counter-intuitive based on the name, but ST can be up to 65-70 kt, which overlaps with the hurricane category. Also, the ST category doesn't seem show up until 1968, and including ST storms in the tropical cylcone naming sequence began in 2002.) --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiffy_sperry_6ee1.html" title="User:Spiffy sperry">Spiffy sperry</a> 03:38, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I contacted someone at the NCDC (National Climatic Data Center) and received a detailed explanation. In short, the official ACE index definition (which itself arose from something slightly different) does not include "subtropical" or "extratropical" observations, but NCDC includes it in some of their calculations anyway in order to compare data globally, due to questionable reliability of data in the Atlantic and other basins. Future updates from NCDC may indicate something to this effect. The question for us is what purpose do we have in tabulating ACE values? Whatever we decide, we need to update the 2005 articles to meet the official definition (and to be consistent with our pre-2005 data), or update 1950-2004 to facilitate global comparisons (assuming we will eventually have detailed data for more than just the Atlantic) --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiffy_sperry_6ee1.html" title="User:Spiffy sperry">Spiffy sperry</a> 19:12, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but that is quite false. For instance, Katrina had (say) 120mph winds across a 100-mile radius...compared to Camille with 190mph winds across a 10-mile radius. Katrina's PDI should be 25 times higher, but in the "approximation" it is 4 times lower. His point that historical data is not available for storm sizes (prior to about 1995) is a good one, however. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorje_69b6.html" title="User:Jdorje">Jdorje</a> 04:33, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The calculations for the east Pacific leave a little to be desired... not to say that you didn't do a good job through hard work... When adding up the totals for all storms in the 1997 season, I get a value in excess of 270, which would place it above 1992. And yet <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Epac_hurr/figure2.gif" class="external text" title="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Epac_hurr/figure2.gif" rel="nofollow">this graph</a> clearly shows that the 1997 season has an ACE below 200. Indeed, when I do the calculations without Paka and Oliwa (their ACE in the CPAC is insignificant), I still get a result above 160... even though the graph seems to show it just below 150. The graph appears to indicate that the threshold for Above Normal is 130, yet the <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Epac_hurr/background_information.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Epac_hurr/background_information.html" rel="nofollow">background information</a> gives it as 150. In addition, when I add the raw totals for the 1992 season together, I get a value above 290. Yet the graph shows it barely poking above 250. When I subtract ACE "earned" in the Centtral Pacific from that season (The storms with CPac ACE are Ekeka, Hali, Frank, Javier, Iniki, and Roslyn), I get an unrounded value of 257.855, which appears to agree much better with the graph in question. I therefore conclude that east Pacific ACE only includes the east Pacific proper (east of 140W). But this is probably original research, so I can't include it in articles. I therefore suggest excising ACE from all East Pacific season articles. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Madeline_ebed.html" title="User:Miss Madeline">Miss Madeline</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Madeline_ab22.html" title="User talk:Miss Madeline">Talk to Madeline</a> 19:52, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This also fits in with the discussion above on subtropical storms, but I've figured out nearly all of the differences I noted in parenthesis above. The table in the first link above has a total for all storms, including subtropicals, but wiki's ACE table does not include storms that remained subtropical.

Note that with the newly discovered (and unnamed) suptropical storm from Oct. 2005, the total number of storms is <b>28</b> (as listed on many of the 2005 season pages), but the total number of <i>tropical</i> storms is <b>27</b> (as listed in the ACE table).

<dd>If you were talking about listing the ACE of each individual storm in each season article: I'm also pretty sure that every storm's ACE has been calculated somewhere - even if it hasn't, there are definately programs or programmers out there that'll parse the data and calculate the data quickly. I'll let someone else decide whether it'd be worth it.</dd>
<dd>Of course, you should still ask first if you're not certain about anything or if you want feedback on an idea.

<p>Currently, the article states</p>
<dl>
<dd>The unit of ACE is 10<sup>4</sup> kt<sup>2</sup>, and for use as an index the unit is assumed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>While this is what the sources say, I must point out that they are being sloppy with units. According to the article,</p>
<dl>
<dd>The ACE is calculated by <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summation.html" title="Summation">summing</a> the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knot_%28speed%29.html" title="Knot (speed)">knots</a> or higher), at six-hour intervals.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The process being described here is clearly <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numerical_integration.html" title="Numerical integration">numerical integration</a>. Consider an equivalent calculation:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The XXX is calculated by summing the velocity of the car at one-minute intervals.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is clear that XXX would then be an approximation to the distance travelled, and that its unit would not be "miles per hour" (for example, a car moving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for an hour would not have an XXX of 3,600 miles per hour), but "minutes times miles per hour" (the XXX would be 3,600 minutes×miles per hour, or 60 miles after simplification).</p>
<p>In the case of ACE, it is not distance travelled that's approximated, but the quantity <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/e/4/1e45f90007153cd4a59a1a281f9325b2.png" alt="\int v_{max}^2(t) dt" />, where the integral is over the time a cyclone is a tropical storm. The SI unit would thus be <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/c/b/dcbda05f9a14a48c5d4b6f765a7701d1.png" alt="\frac{m^2}{s}" />, though a unit of kt<sup>2</sup>h or even kt<sup>2</sup>(6h) would be easier to work with.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how to proceed. The easiest would be to just relativise the claim that the unit is kt<sup>2</sup> and make ACE, for purposes of our discussion, merely a number without any unit. I'd just add a note on this, but do not want to violate <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.</p>
<p>This might be a bit of a minor issue; however, sloppiness when using physical (or mathematical) units is a real problem, and the treatment of units here is sloppy.</p>

<dd>It made more sense to me if I thought of it this way: the cyclone's <i>rate of energy use</i> is being measured every 6 hours, because it appears to be assumed that the cyclone replenishes a proportion of its energy every some interval of time.

<dd>Interesting, I hadn't thought of it that way. However, I do not see how it would change the unit. Of course you could introduce arbitrary constants to change the unit — but if that's what's happening, it needs to happen explicitly; furthermore, introducing a new constant whose value is six hours seems a bit redundant, since we've already got other constants only a factor of 4, or 6, respectively, away from that ...</dd>

Then approximate the integral using the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rectangle_method.html" title="Rectangle method">rectangle method</a> and a delta-x of 6 hours, to get units of nm<sup>2</sup>/hr<sup>2</sup>, or kt<sup>2</sup>. The 6 hours isn't an arbitrary constant, it's just the resolution of the data available.</dd>
<dd>As for the k (above) that's eventually tossed out at the end, I think this ends up with only a unit of kg if you derive the equation all the way from <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotational_energy.html" title="Rotational energy">rotational energy</a> (using assumptions which are something like that r and m don't vary with time, and v varies linearly with r, etc. - sorry for the rather blurry description; I once derived the equation all the way but I can't remember which assumptions I used...). The missing mass unit is reasonable since you wouldn't want to pretend that the formula took mass into account. So the <i>name</i> of the quantity isn't quite right - it's accumulated energy per mass, not just "energy" - but the unit appears still correct. —<a href="../../../a/y/s/User%7EAySz88_15e3.html" title="User:AySz88">AySz88</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AySz88_57ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/AySz88">\</a><a href="../../../a/y/s/User_talk%7EAySz88_f90d.html" title="User talk:AySz88"><font color="#FF9966">^</font><font color="#FF6633">-</font><font color="#FF3300">^</font></a> 16:22, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>6 hours is the resolution of the data; you suggested to give it some storm-related relevance as well (as I originally understood it, you essentially stated that the movement of a storm after six hours had passed was all "new" energy, with the old one having been used up).</dd>
<dd>Sorry, I still don't quite see how your argument would work. What's being measured is the average square-speed of the storm: assuming there's a relatively constant mass of the storm (your <i>k</i>), that translates to energy-time available for destruction. A weird unit, certainly, but it does make sense.</dd>
<dd>Of course you can use <i>another</i> constant to get this back down to an energy estimate, but that constant is very unlikely to be anywhere near 6 hours.</dd>

If you say (using your words) that the energy of a storm is all "new" energy after 6 hours, is this not <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/6/5/f657e083efcd7168a11690721b925e6e.png" alt="\frac{(k v_{max}^2)}{t}" />, an approximation of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/f/f/8ff2140d984d215f7ba8e3bdf4dbb08d.png" alt="\frac{d}{dt}(k v_{max}^2)" />? —<a href="../../../a/y/s/User%7EAySz88_15e3.html" title="User:AySz88">AySz88</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AySz88_57ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/AySz88">\</a><a href="../../../a/y/s/User_talk%7EAySz88_f90d.html" title="User talk:AySz88"><font color="#FF9966">^</font><font color="#FF6633">-</font><font color="#FF3300">^</font></a> 17:10, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But I'm not saying that. You did, and it appeared to me to be an unlikely coincidence, so I disagreed with it. (and no, that doesn't look like an approximation of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/f/f/8ff2140d984d215f7ba8e3bdf4dbb08d.png" alt="\frac{d}{dt}(k v_{max}^2)" /> to me). <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomP_ea0d.html" title="User:RandomP">RandomP</a> 17:18, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
