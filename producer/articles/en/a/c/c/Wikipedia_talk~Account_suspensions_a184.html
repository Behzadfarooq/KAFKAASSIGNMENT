<li>"I agree with dab: this page is pointless really, and protecting it only serves to reinforce an idea that admins are getting above themselves. In addition, there is a danger that it will encourage admins to enter into controversial blocking without bothering with the troublesome work of using other, less confrontational, problem-solving methods.

<dd>What's wrong with having an open place where admins can discuss issues? At the moment, if we want to ask for admin advice here about a disruptive user, the user we need advice about just continues the disruption on this page. The only current alternative is to contact other admins by e-mail, which makes it non-transparent. With Ed's proposal, we'd have a page to discuss difficult blocks with other admins, where other users could see what's being discussed but without being able to disrupt it.

<p>From what I have seen, this is how Wikipedia admins behave now. They throw their admin weight around, they use it to enforce POV on articles they follow, and they pick users to assault and harass. I've been on the receiving end of abuse from some of the names who've signed in to support the "We are the law, we are above the law" perspective that they have operated under. No request for intervention will ever work, because the admin will call you an abusive user and both the admin and his/her cronies will mercilessly attack you. Emailing the Wikien-l mailing list is equally pointless as the same jerks who will attack you on Wikipedia are the ones who are on the Wikien-l mailing list.</p>

<p>When did admins stop being ordinary editors with a couple of extra buttons and start being vigilantes? They are supposed to be representatives of the community, enforcing the will of the community, not nobles who punish the serfs as they see fit. Clearly, admins who take actions outside policy will support this. A means to ban dissenters without even bothering with the arbcom. Exactly what some of the more hardline admins have been looking for. Maybe we should have a fork.

<p>No. I fully support this proposal. I trust admins - I see no evidence of 'rogue' ones, that's just bitter people talking, not an objective observation. On Wikipedia I would describe myself as a "law-abiding citizen". I tend not to break the rules. Therefore, I have nothing to fear from this&#160;:-).

However, I believe <a href="../../../e/n/v/User%7EEnviroknot_8620.html" title="User:Enviroknot">User:Enviroknot</a>'s comments above are not really relevant to this discussion and are a good example of how irrelevant comments may be disruptive (<a href="../../../e/n/v/User%7EEnviroknot_8620.html" title="User:Enviroknot">Enviroknot</a>, I mean no disprespect: I just don't feel that some of your comments are really pertinent to this topic). At the <i>very</i> least, if the page does remain protected, the talk page should not be protected so that non-administrators may voice objections to the discussion—perhaps somewhat like RFAr proposed decision pages where only the arbitrators may discuss, but anyone may comment on the talk page (maybe the page wouldn't even have to be protected).

<dd>What's wrong with having an open place where admins can discuss issues? At the moment, if we want to ask for admin advice on WP:AN/I about a disruptive user, the user we need advice about just continues the disruption on that page. The only current alternative is to contact other admins by e-mail, which makes it non-transparent. With Ed's proposal, we'd have a page to discuss difficult blocks with other admins, where other users could see what's being discussed but without being able to disrupt it. I think the talk page should be protected too until we see how it works. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:25, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If a disruptive editor continues the disruption on WP:AN/I, wouldn't that be grounds for bringing the matter before the ArbCom? As I understand the purpose of that page, &amp; Ed's proposed page, this is supposed to be a forum for admin/janitors to get a second opinion about people one may <i>think</i> is troublesome, or need to find a solution than outright banning. Further, if someone posts a dispassionate paragraph saying (to the effect) "I think editor XYZ is causing trouble in this article, &amp; this is why" &amp; editor XYZ immediately appears with a response saying "So you've come here to spread more lies about me", would anyone be surprised if I or any other reader conclude that editor XYZ has just confirmed that he/she/it is causing trouble in Wikipedia? -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 05:43, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is where we record suspensions <b>after</b> making them.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of users who edit pages on this website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who come to make an accurate, useful and unbiased encyclopedia</li>
<li>Those who are experimenting, playing around, etc.</li>
<li>Those who are determined to thwart Wikipedia's goals</li>
</ul>
<p>Those in the latter group should be excluded. And admins should not have to spend days, or even hours, filling out paperwork for this. If a few genuine, heartfelt attempts to explain the rules won't work, suspend the person.</p>
<p>When they come back, they can try again.</p>
<p>And they good part is, with 100 admins able to undo a block by any one admin, there's little chance of egregious error. (Assuming the original admin doesn't launch a blocking war - ah, but that's against the rules too, so that shoul cover everything)</p>
<p>We're not here to create a blog community, but to create an encyclopedia. The rules are VERY EASY to follow, and if you can't figure them out you can always ask. The only people who will get suspended are those who are not even trying to comply with policy. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 02:20, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

I can see some use for a wiki-only peer feedback channel explicitly for block decisions (the way IRC is often used now) as outlined by people above, but what you're saying makes no sense to me. Admins can <i>already</i> block people without "filing out paperwork", and other admins can and do unblock when they disagree. What does this page add? Ease of archiving?

<dd>No of course you may not! I asked you a question, I don't expect any answer!&#160;:-P So my guess above was right: this page is intended to be a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_Block_0c1a.html" title="Special:Log/Block">Special:Log/Block</a> with more room for justification than the single-line brevity the block log demands (and the added benefit of being able to watch the page, which you can only do by vigorous refreshing in case of the block log). From what I've seen here there seem to be multiple camps now on what this page is supposed to be good for:
<ol>
<li>It's a block log you can annotate.</li>
<li>It's like <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, but explicitly editable only by administrators.</li>
<li>It's a replacement for the out-of-band IRC/mailing list channels in getting feedback/support on a possibly controversial block.</li>

<p>I fully support this proposal. On Wikipedia I would describe myself as a "law-abiding citizen". I tend not to break the rules. Therefore, I have nothing to fear from this&#160;:-).

As regular editors do when faced with newcomers on a page, but then specifically for admin-related matters. Yes, admins will disagree on things, sometimes vociferously—but then they will also back each other up over nothing more than "I trust his/her judgement", which is honest, laudable and pointless.

<dd>On what basis do you make this claim? I would imagine that it is true that in disputes between admins and non-admins, it is more likely that I will agree with the admin. But that is because a good percentage of such disputes are between admins and obvious POV pushers, which is going to mean that it's much more statistically likely that I will agree with the admin. Can you provide any evidence that admins back up other admins saying things like "I trust his judgment"? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 19:01, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Modification: I assume that you <i>can</i> find instances of people saying things like that. I doubt that you will find ones where this is the <i>only</i> argument made. At any rate, I know that if <i>I</i> were to say such a thing it would probably mean something along the lines of "I know this user is not a destructive POV pusher or putter-inner of original research, and while I don't know terribly much about the subject at hand, the comments of his opponent reek very strongly of POV pushing/original research." <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 19:04, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

It was not my only reason, but it was enough for me to "block first" and investigate afterwards.

<dd>No, I cannot offer you such evidence. This is not fact I present you with; it is, like many other things that have been stated on this page, I haste myself to say, a gut feeling. A perception of a general tendency. The statistics that are involved are also self-reinforcing: it starts to become more probable that you agree with the admin because statistically, you were more likely to do that and be right in the first place—in cases where there might be an argument against, why bring it up? It's probably wrong or irrelevant; you might even hurt your relationship with your peers. By agreeing with the most likely outcome, you reinforce the belief that admins make correct judgements, which is good. The administrator is probably right because they have the experience.</dd>
<dd>None of this is <i>consciously</i> reasoned out like that, of course. Unless they're really doing it to make some point, people will not literally say: "well, regardless of the merits of the case, I'm just going to go with X here because he's X". But neither can I bring myself to believing this never plays a significant role. "Me, too" can be much more damaging than it appears at first sight. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 19:15, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)

<dd>But this assumes that we know who's an admin. I would submit that this has nothing to do with admins, <i>per se</i>. It has to do with having experience working with particular users and having some sense of when to trust them. Since most users who have been here a long time will ultimately become admins, this often becomes trusting admins. But it has nothing to do with trusting people because they're admins. It has to do with trusting people because they have proved trustworthy in the past. Beyond that, I think you're imaginging situations that don't actually occur. Obviously, none of us gets involved with more than a small percentage of the edit disputes going on at any given time. Usually this is because we don't know much about the subject, or don't notice it, or whatever. But when we <i>do</i> get involved, I see no reason to believe that anyone's views are influenced by the idea that the admin involved in the dispute is probably right, so we should agree with them. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 19:24, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

If you just wanted to get feedback on the decision, you should have (cross?)-posted to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>. Of course people are going to pay more attention to creating a new outlet for discussing decisions than the decision that happened to kick it off.</dd>
<dd>However, let me give some honest, specific feedback then: your block was probably pointless and ineffectual. Blocking a user for being an argumentative weenie will only reinforce their belief that "teh admins" are out to get them. A three-hour block is supposed to benefit the encyclopedia? It's just going to show the "newby" that we know how to spank people who are cheeky, so he'd better behave. If he comes back, he'll just know that one Ed Poor is a bad uncle, and the other admins are probably not to be trusted either. So now he's an argumentative weenie with a grudge. Were you "wrong" in issuing the block? Meh, I don't really care; I'm a vile <a href="../../../u/t/i/Utilitarian.html" title="Utilitarian">utilitarian</a> in this regard, and think judging it by its effectiveness is more useful. It's too early to call the shot on that, though.</dd>
<dd>A valuable footnote to the above is that I'm what some people like to call a "newbie admin", that is, one who has not yet fully reveled in his abilities to block evildoers. I've blocked a few egregious vandals, but I haven't tackled any grey zone stuff, and I'm not planning to either. I'm insanely patient; as long as I can revert, protect and calmly argue, I'll do that before I'll even consider a block. Again, I'm not interested in the moral high ground on admin behaviour; I'm only doing what I think is most constructive. Other admins will do the same, and do things differently; we hardly if ever compare results, to my knowledge. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 03:53, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At the risk of butting in, it seems to me that what this page is about is that some admin actions are uncontroversial and the relevant admin just goes ahead and does them, but others are more controversial and the admin in question might or might not take the action, and then solicits either retrospective or prospective second opinions respectively from other admins. <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> has, in practice, been serving this purpose for a while.</p>
<p>One way to formalize this practice as a policy would be to have a (possibly admin-only) page where admins report on controversial situations and state clearly either what action was taken, or what action is proposed. Other admins then list "votes" that agree or disagree with the (proposed) action. If the action is proposed, then if and when the net number of admins agreeing is N, then the last admin actually takes the action. If the action was taken already, and a net N admins disagree, the last will reverse it. N should be small, say 2–4.</p>
<p>This procedure would be lightweight enough that it would reach decisions quickly. It has the advantage that the action will often be taken by an uninvolved admin. It also means that actions reflect a rough admin consensus (and corporate responsibility), and may serve to avoid block wars. I think that part of the concern over recent anti-admin trolls is that admins can feel very alone when exercising their powers.</p>
<p>Note that this procedure does not, strictly speaking, require consensus to implement. Any number of admins can simply volunteer to be bound by it. Think of it as a harmonious administration club. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBovlb_31b0.html" title="User:Bovlb">Bovlb</a> 03:52, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are we just going to dispense with the arbcom now? Now that Ed has made admins into little Judge Dredds, who ban users on their own say-so? Now he can ban them for whatever he pleases, so long as he can get a couple of activist admins to agree that he was right to do so?</p>
<p>And he plans to do it on a protected page, denying his actions the scrutiny of ordinary editors. Since when did adminship move from being "no big deal" to representing an imperium?</p>

<dl>
<dd>There are a few points I feel that must be addressed regardless of the merits of this particular idea:
<ol>
<li>Admins already hand out blocks like little Judge Dredds. In fact, people more or less expect them to. Yes, of course they still need to have a good reason, but they're generally assumed to have a good reason. Sometimes people will contend they don't. Admins are expected to make lots more good calls than bad calls, however.</li>
<li>Banning is not the same thing as blocking. To my knowledge, there are no proposals on the table that advocate giving admins the right to prevent an individual from editing, indefinitely, without going through the ArbCom. <i>Accounts</i> may be disabled, though, if they use patently offensive names and/or engage in automated vandalism of Wikipedia (the "Unpardonable Sins"), but these are highly specific circumstances.</li>
<li>A protected page is still subject to scrutiny by anyone who cares to scrutinize it. In-line discussion by non-admins is made harder, though. There are obvious pros and cons to that, just as there are obvious pros and cons to separating article pages from talk pages.</li>
</ol>

<dd>I agree with dab: this page is pointless really, and protecting it only serves to reinforce an idea that admins are getting above themselves. In addition, there is a danger that it will encourage admins to enter into controversial blocking without bothering with the troublesome work of using other, less confrontational, problem-solving methods. As I have said elsewhere, fighting fire with fire just burns the whole place down.

<dd>That is, of course, likely to happen. However, my point was that the page will tend to "reinforce an idea that admins are getting above themselves", and the perception will not go away just because an other admin steps in to undo the specific instance of damage. Indeed, the perception will possibly not go away even if no damage is done at all. To play devil's advocate and put it crudely, it would be possible to read this page as "the cabal have created a place where they can boast of their high-handed actions while denying the victims the right to respond". Of course this would be a gross misrepresentation of your intention, but then, what is your intention?</dd>
<dd>What I'm missing is a clear explanation of why the page is needed (what will it do that does not already have a forum?), how this explanation of function would relate to the page name, and of why the need for protection. It is the lack of clarity around these three questions that leads me to question the need for the existance of this page.

<p>This is how I am viewing this page: a clear endorsement for using small blocks for problematic users (a "slap on the wrist"). It's also more open - block logs are filled with lots of different blocks for myriad reasons; this place can clearly highlight policy breaches and the consequences. It is also a <i>deterrent</i> - a clear display of what will happen if you break the rules. This is good. I think keeping people on the task of writing an encyclopaedia within our rules is more important than slightly nebulous concepts such as "perception". <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan100_803a.html" title="User talk:Dan100">Talk)</a> 12:38, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>I don't know who Judge Dredd is, but that sounds like an abuse. Are these actions being recorded or justified anywhere, other than in the sea of "block log" and "blocked users"? Where are the diffs? How can others comment? What's the review process?</p>
<p>I fear that some admins are actively working <b>against</b> Wikipedia policy, and as an admin myself I feel the need to investigate this. It's way too much trouble, without some transparency.</p>
<p>What if admins start automatically reversing any block that has even a <b>hint</b> of arbitrariness, and record (a) the initial block and (b) the peremptoriy reversal at p.e.?</p>

<p>I've never seen this page before, but all of the sudden a perfectly valid block of the pelican shit vandal was removed by Ed Poor and I was chastized and given a link to this page.

<dd>Um, at the risk of sounding silly: can we agree that CryptoDerk might have explicitly mentioned he was blocking a pelican shit incarnation, but Ed might have, you know, <i>asked</i> CryptoDerk about the block before simply undoing it? I'm not convinced by the argument that bad contentious blocks should be undone as soon as possible to avoid hurting a user, because a contentious block can go either way, and if it's right undoing it is going to hurt Wikipedia. (I shudder at the thought of someone unblocking <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilly_on_Wheels_8114.html" title="User:Willy on Wheels">Willy on Wheels</a> because they don't see rightaway what's going on.) If you want you can keep blocked users informed on their talk pages that you're looking into matters, but just retracting blocks left and right is a little too bold. The user base is not an article; <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">Wikipedia:Be bold</a> doesn't apply here, neither for blocking nor unblocking. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 06:54, 2005 Jun 24 (UTC)

<dd>Update: I just saw in the block log that Derk <i>did</i> mention he was blocking a PS incarnation. What do we need? A separate page for the PS we can link to just as we have one for Willy?

<dd>When I reblocked I did mention it was the pelican shit guy. I didn't when I blocked the first time. When I block someone who is in the process of vandalizing, I typically don't bother with a long explanation, I just go with the typical "vandal" as it's faster. In any case where someone is blocked, just by looking at the edit history you cannot, in general, tell what that person did. They may have created a bunch of nonsense pages that have since been deleted. In the case of Willy on Wheels vandalism, after all the pages are moved back and the redirects are deleted, it would look like that person never did anything at all. As such, a block set by one admin should be removed by a different admin if 1) the blocked person has discussed it with another admin, the mailing list, etc. or 2) a discussion with the blocking admin occurs. I doubt the pelican shit guy sent a bunch of emails telling you to unblock him. Good faith dictates that you should presume that I set the block for a good reason. I'm all for a system that reviews admin actions, but reviewing and acting are two different things. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 18:38, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I've removed it completely. Admins should <i>not</i> be able to have fun at the expense of other regular editors. While it may have had some humour value, we must be careful of presenting a view to editors who are not admins that we don't take blocking seriously. Yes, it may seem like I'm humour impaired today, but when it comes to stuff like this it would be best if we remained on best behaviour. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 29 June 2005 02:03 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My original idea for creating this page is to have a place to discuss policy enforcement before and/or after it takes place. Sometimes what seems obvious to one is unclear to others. Somtimes what one <b>thinks</b> is obviously right may turn out to be his own particular conception.</p>
<p>I'm hoping we can refine our methods and maybe even contribute to the development of wise and effective policy here.</p>
<p>And how does everyone feel about using subpages for extended discussion of the rightness or wrongness of administrative actions? I made two subpages already and moved some discussion there.

<p>I seem to be the primary admin using this log page. It hasn't really caught on yet. I hope it does. I think if policy enforcement is made more clear - and if it's not sabotaged by complaints by policy subverters claiming their "<a href="../../../r/i/g/Wikipedia%7ERight_a500.html" title="Wikipedia:Right">rights</a>" are being violated - we will get a number of related results:</p>
<ul>
<li>more confidence in the admins</li>
<li>less tension between "sysops" and "ordinary users"</li>
<li>less trouble with policy subversion</li>
<li>better understanding of policy</li>
</ul>
<p>Clear and swift policy enforcement ultimately means LESS time wasted on "policy issues" and more time spent on the articles. (If we want to debate a policy, we can go directly to that <b>policy page</b> and lobby for a change, instead of turning every goldarn policy-enforcement occasion into a Supreme Court case.) <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> July 1, 2005 20:32 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nah, you don't want to do that. It will look awkward for me to be adding entries to an inactive page, which I will! <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 23:29, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the page is useful, as AN and AN/I get clogged. Obvioulsy it has fallen into a backwater, but that can be fixed by adding the link the the list of related pages at the top of the AN and AN/I pages. Moving it to a new name, as <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">User:Radiant!</a> suggests, isn't a bad idea either. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 23:50, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to agree with you. Perhaps the reason for you being blocked was that the administrator in question did not have enough information on the subject. The term <i>Penis Day</i> is usually viewed as a sexual vandal joke. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 03:07, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've decided to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> and tag this page as historical, seeing as how no one has added a single new user in four months. If people are actually going to use this, they can go ahead and remove it, but seeing as how it's not well watched or used, and is largely replaced by <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, I don't think there's much of a point. <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23"><font color="green"><b>EWS23</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">Leave me a message!</a>) 22:53, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
