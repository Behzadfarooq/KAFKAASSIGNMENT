<p>Dispute over whether this minor English poet, who found religion and stopped writing in the early 1970s, can be considered to have "disappeared."

Three other editors (including me) say the term "disappeared" is misleading, because there is no evidence Tonks has ever been reported as a missing person, and she may simply have chosen to live in obscurity.

<p>The 1967 war led to a dramatic increase in the number of Palestinians, especially from the West Bank, living in Jordan. Its Palestinian refugee population – 700,000 in 1966 – grew by another 300,000 from the West Bank. The period following the 1967 war saw an upsurge in the power and importance of Palestinian resistance elements (''fedayeen'') in Jordan. The heavily armed ''fedayeen'' constituted a growing threat to the sovereignty and security of the Hashemite state, and open fighting erupted in June 1970. The battle in which Palestinian fighters from various [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO) groups were expelled from Jordan is commonly known as [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]], and this was from Palestinians point of view. [[Image:Kingabdullahbinhussein.jpg|thumb|250px|right|King Abdullah I]] Other Arab governments attempted to work out a peaceful solution, but by September, continuing ''fedayeen'' actions in Jordan – including the destruction of three international airliners hijacked by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] and held in the desert east of [[Amman]] – prompted the government to take action to regain control over its territory and population. In the ensuing heavy fighting, a Syrian tank force invaded northern Jordan to support the ''fedayeen'' but subsequently retreated because King [[Hussein of Jordan|Hussein]] has asked the help from Israel{{dubious}}, then Israel threatened that it will invade Jordan if Syria internvenes{{dubious}}. By [[22 September]], Arab foreign ministers meeting at Cairo had arranged a cease-fire beginning the following day. Sporadic violence continued, however, until Jordanian forces led by [[Habis Al-Majali]] and with the help of the Pakistani - and other nationalities - forces (which had basis in Jordan){{dubious}} won a decisive victory over the ''fedayeen'' in July 1971, expelling them from the country. At the [[Rabat summit conference]] in 1974, Jordan agreed, along with the rest of the [[Arab League]], that the PLO was the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people", thereby relinquishing to that organization its role as representative of the West Bank Palestinians.</p>

<p>This is a dispute about whether only people of African origin can be called black, or if other "black" people, eg. Papua New Guineans, Indigenous Australians, Torres Strait Islanders, Andamese Islanders and other non-African black peoples can be included. The conflict can be summarized with these two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a scientific definition of "black". The articale is about a race of Humans called black, a race people of Sub-saharan origin. Only this "race" can be called black.</li>
<li>There is no formal scientific definition of "black". "Black" can either be an ascription based on subjective criteria, or it can be adopted as an identity by certain groups. Not only African people are black, other peoples self-identify as black as well. This article is not primarily about races (there are other articles that cover that, eg <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negroid.html" title="Negroid">Negroid</a>) but about the usage of the term "black people", a term that has many uses. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 06:30, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>both statements ignore other possibilities. Africa is still viewed by anthropoligists as the birthplace for humanity so we are all different shades of "black". Many religious traditions say theat mankind was created from dust and water or "Clay" so you could also say we are different shades of burnt clay. Currently there is another theory amoung anthropoligists that historically, Africans migrated by land all the way to Australia. This would make the argument moot. There has even been DNA testing along the land route along the coast to the Indian and Pacific oceans finding DNA that matches the theory in some but not all of the people inhabiting the costal areas. Please try thinking outside the box. the options are not only linear , binary choices.</li>

The most notable ones are that the article conflates two land rushes into one and needs to be split, and that "Land Rush" is preferred over "Land Run." I'm not even sure where to start on fixing this article. --D Wilbanks 19:44, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article neglects to present many, many necessary facts. Firstly, The Turkish Northern Cyprus is not a country in and of itself -- or at least as far as international legitimacy is concerned -- and has no right to consider itself plainly as "Cyprus." The article needs to better represent the history of the dispute between the Turkish-Cypriot North and the Greek-Cypriot South, as well as the uncertainty as to the North's existance as a state, rather than an occupier. Some user has recently replaced the articles pertaining to the legitimate Greek government, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Cyprus_8430.html" title="Republic of Cyprus">Republic of Cyprus</a> and the article pertaining to the island itself, <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, with highly disputable information. For instance, the article pertaining to the EU-Member Greek <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Cyprus_8430.html" title="Republic of Cyprus">Republic of Cyprus</a> with a short stint about Turkey being the country and the democratically elected Greek leader being a "rebel" terrorist.</p>

<p>This article seems to mix two basic Germanic roots of which many names derived, <i>Haimirich</i> and <i>Amalric</i> . The latter isn't mentioned in the text, but quite some examples given of nowadays forms of Haimirich are either from Amalric (like <i>Emeric</i> ) or their history is doubtful, i.e. could go both ways, could have a totally different root from the mentioned two or its history is very unclear. This problems arises because of the similarity of the two Germanic roots, not in their ancient form, but in the forms that appeared later, with the possibility of growing almost together. <i>Amerigo</i> is an example of a name that could be from both. It could either be a variant of the Italian name Enrico, which is from Haimirich, or from Amalric, through Imre, the Hungarian Saint. In other words, we need some expertise here sorting this out and change this article into something more accurate, distinguishing the two groups clearly and off course we have to create a new article, one about Amalric. 13:55 (GMT), 22 Dec 2004</p>

<p>I've made a post in the talk page that no one has yet disputed to indicate that the Christian Science Church is indeed a Christian cult (due to its contradictions with the <b>doctrines of Christianity</b>). Yet at the same time people insist to directly refer to it as Christian despite evidence to the contrary that still has not been disputed. Since people can not respond to my comments on the talk page I am posting this here to prevent a needless edit war. I will accept that they claim to be Christian but that alone doesn't make it so. For example, Christianity holds <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bible_5d21.html" title="The Bible">The Bible</a> first, while the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Christ%2C_Scientist_837b.html" title="Church of Christ, Scientist">Christian Science Church</a> holds the Bible up as it is interpreted in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_and_Health_with_Key_to_the_Scriptures_48ab.html" title="Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures">Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures</a> by its founder <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Baker_Eddy_01fc.html" title="Mary Baker Eddy">Mary Baker Eddy</a> and is stark contrast to the teachings of Christianity such as the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>.

<p>The article is being roosted upon by what are clearly the subject of the articles detractors who are posing as editors of Wikipedia. Virtually all of these editors have <b>identical</b> account names on Yahoo SCOX, a message board which is engaged in the SCO/IBM lawsuits. The article paints a "merkey is bad" message which is unbalanced, and much of the content is unverifiable and POV, and does not allow any other viewpoints to be added. Attempts by any editors outside of a small circle of rather vocal detractors to enhance the article results in revert wars and distortion and "spinning" of the content. The article needs review and impartial editing. Waya sahoni 05:44, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My knee-jerk reaction was to remove the dispute tags without discussion. I apologize for that reaction, even though I am convinced this article has been thoroughly verified.

<p>Once again, Wikipedia is being used to publicize an unverifiable attack. In this case, the target is Edward Winter:</p>

</pre>
<p>Some sample ridiculous statements:</p>
<pre>
(1)  "For the past more than 30 years, every time a new book by Keene has come out or a new article by Keene has been published, Edward Winter has written articles attacking it."
(2)  "Kingston is from the same part of England that Winter is believed to be from."  ("Wow, I didn't know that ... San Diego, California (where I was born and lived until 1980) [is] part of England." - Taylor Kingston comment)
(3)  "Edward Winter filed an ethics complaint with the FIDE Congress accusing Keene of unethical conduct in writing books almost exclusively about opening theory, whereas Winter said there should be more books about chess history."
(4)  "Keene's opponent was Florencio Campomanes who Winter supported."
(5)  "Chess Notes ... contains brief commentaries usually not more than one or two paragraphs in length attacking usually insignificant errors and spelling mistakes made by this or that chess writer."
(6)  "If a book by Keene contains a spelling mistake, Chess Notes will point it out."
</pre>
<p>At rec.games.chess.politics, samhsloan@gmail.com has referred to this as "my biography". Sam Sloan is the one who contributed the subsequently deleted supposed USCF blacklist. See discussion at:</p>

<p>It should not be necessary for anyone to do a point by point refutation of the Edward Winter "biography". The "verifiable" sources do not exist and the author will not be able to produce them, as even a minimal amount of inquiry would reveal. I apologize once again for not being acquainted with the details of Wikipedia procedure. I have no interest in Wikipedia beyond the hope that those in charge will take measures to prevent its use for the promotion of garbage.</p>
<p>Update: The Edward Winter entry has been much improved. (I understand that this has been against the will of the writer of the original version.) I still think the best thing would be to delete the article altogether. Still, I am grateful that it is no longer the disaster that it was. My thanks to those responsible.</p>

<p><i>I'm pretty certain that The Great Escape actually happened in Stalag Luft III, located at Sagan, Poland (I believe it is now Zägan or something like that). For one thing, every man that was a part of the escape was a airman officer, so they would have been in a Stalag Luft, not a Stalag (which was a prison camp for enlisted men, not officers or airmen). Also, I just watched a documentary of the making of the movie, which clearly stated the camp being in Sagan, not Luckenwald. -- Filmcom 02:58, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>Both articles' talk pages are utterly dominated by debate about whether these are the same language are not. If they are there needs to be a merge; if they aren't, both articles need to consistently address the difference. In either case, there is a dire need for reference citation. Basically, it appears to be a 2+ year flame war in both places of nothing but opinion, most of it quasi-nationalistic/political/ethnocentrist in flavor. Pretty embarassing really. The Talk page on Catalan was so full of random flaming one had to page down again and again to even find the table of contents. I fixed that, but I'm not touching the debate. Disclosure/Disclaimer: I have no stake in the debate either way, I was just dismayed to see such a morass of ad hominem attacks, edit warring (admittedly slow, more like edit coldwarring), confusion, insistence on "facts" with no provenance, etc., etc., when I just came looking for simple information about this/these langugage[s]. Worse yet, a third contingent insists that V. is one language, and that C. is actually a dialect of a third language, Occitan. Yet ANOTHER take on this is that the language is Valencian-Catalan-Balear[ic]! So I think some merging is in order, with cleanup needed on all of these such that either one article has the majority of info, and each of the separate ones (if they exist as anything but redirects) addresses nothing but what makes that particular dialect distinct; or, each article needs to clearly explain the differences between it and the other three of V., C., B. and O., cite sources, and cite sources that militate against the "same language" theory. Or something along those lines. We're not at that point yet (the question hasn't been answered, after all) so I have not used a merge template, just a dispute template. — <a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Smccandlish_3ff9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Smccandlish">contrib</a>] <span style="color: #990000;">ツ</span> 17:49, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have encountered apparent <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a> and apparently-willful and apparently-malicious reverting of bonafide corrections rendering these articles inaccurate and less useful to other readers. I have spent hours trying to improve these articles and continually encountered resistance and perverse editing comments from one or more other editors, including one named SlimVirgin.</p>
<p>After causing me great grief for an entire week, constantly reverting every contribution that I have tried to make to the articles pertaining to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Jacobs_8e6a.html" title="Charles Jacobs">Charles Jacobs</a>, she has now gone to my "contributions" and to another article that I have spent many, many hours expanding and improving for over a month and is now also making perverse alterations in the content and documentation format, which, until she began doing so yesterday, was correct formatting and correct information. She does not know what she is doing, and, it seems to me, that she is doing this either purely or primarily out of spite, due to the problems with the articles relating to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Jacobs_8e6a.html" title="Charles Jacobs">Charles Jacobs</a>. On my talk page and on talk pages of these articles, I have asked her to cease and desist. She continually and in a very hypocritical fashion is harassing me with <a href="../../../3/r/r/Wikipedia%7E3RR_f20a.html" title="Wikipedia:3RR">Wikipedia:3RR</a> warnings, when she has been the one starting a "revert" war. Most other editors who try to contribute something to this article, she reverts. I have spent a lot of time checking verifiability of sources, correcting erratic formatting of documentation styles, and she continues to undo every change. I believe that she is abusing her privileges as an editor and as an administrator (if she is one).</p>
<p>These matters need arbitration. Warning: due to the extensive nature of comments in talk pages relating to these articles, the issues are detailed and complex and one must have a lot of patience in reading through the material in and linked to the various talk pages.</p>
<p>As a professional editor and teacher of research and writing at the college/university level, I am expert in the matter of documentation styles. I do not need instruction in these matters; I provide instruction in them (including all the multiple styles listed on Wikipedia as possibilities) for over four decades.</p>
<p>Aware that these subjects are biographies of living persons, I have continually been extremely vigilant about the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and had to make many points about this policy to people re: the articles pertaining particularly to Charles Jacobs.</p>

He insists that I, on the other hand, am completely uneducated, cannot write, know nothing about citations, have probably not even heard of MLA style, and know nothing about English grammar.</dd>

<dd>An example of NYScholar's editing at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Pinter_87e1.html" title="Harold Pinter">Harold Pinter</a> was to go through the article adding "Harold Pinter," instead of "Pinter" or "he". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harold_Pinter&amp;diff=66673747&amp;oldid=65831191" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harold_Pinter&amp;diff=66673747&amp;oldid=65831191" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> It's editing like that that's being fixed. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SlimVirgin is clearly being extremely disingenous here: she knows precisely what the disputes are about; I placed them clearly in the talk pages of the articles in question; and the editing summaries describe them. Apparently, she just doesn't care. I am a professional editor with over four decades of experience using and teaching documentation formats. I am sure that she is not. (At least I hope that she's not as old as I am, given her editing screen name!) My name is also descriptive: I am a scholar from New York; my gender is not relevant. I take it that "Slim Virgin" is a she; but I suppose the person could be a he. She make <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_attacks.html" title="Personal attacks">personal attacks</a> when I am discussing "format" and accuracy of facts in biographies of living persons.</p>
<p>Re: <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Jacobs_%28political_activist%29_4ccb.html" title="Charles Jacobs (political activist)">Charles Jacobs (political activist)</a>:</p>
<p>Based on SlimVirgin's comments for many days, I can tell that she (or he) is not familiar with MLA style format and that she does not understand its appropriate use or usefulness as described in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a> and elsewhere on Wikipedia. She/he is totally callous about using quotation marks accurately so as to avoid plagiarizing from sources and mocks use of them when they are being used correctly and for appropriate reasons (when quoting from a source cited in a following note). She does not understand the difference between the style of a note and that of a bibliographical "reference" entry, and other matters of documentation format. She takes material from undated sources and attributes time frames to material from such sources, assuming when events occur without verifiable sources for them and skews the claims about the subject in the article due to such mistakes. --NYScholar 01:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I placed a "cleanup" tag on the Harold Pinter article and a "disputed" tag on the Charles Jacobs article/related articles, explained on this page (above) in close association with comments that I have made on the talk pages of each of the articles in dispute.</p>
<p>She did not go to the Harold Pinter article to make (unnecessary) changes to it until after there were charges back and forth regarding the <a href="../../../3/r/r/Wikipedia%7E3RR_f20a.html" title="Wikipedia:3RR">Wikipedia:3RR</a> on the Charles Jacobs-related articles. I see that as intentional trouble-making, not true interest in the article or its subject or the accuracy of the article. She made changes that cause verifiability problems, already explained in the talk page of the article. She knows that. She is being disingenuous here, since the explanations have been in the talk page of the Harold Pinter article well before I posted about the cleanup problem in Harold Pinter and disputed accuracy problems in the Charles Jacobs article(s) here. I suggest that people review the talk pages carefully. Because SlimVirgin is involved in both sets of problems, the same concerns relate to both articles, and I have made them very clear in the talk pages of these articles already; no need to repeat them any further. --NYScholar 01:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am fairly new to Wikipedia, months new. I am a film scholar and frequently speak at engagement in various cities throughout the country. I decided to join Wikipedia as an intellectual adventure, but instead, I have encountered personal attacks, and constant problems, ironically the majority being with this "One" article <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Mutoscope_and_Biograph_Company_2593.html" title="American Mutoscope and Biograph Company">American Mutoscope and Biograph Company</a>. There is an apparent neutrality problem, biased opinions, and forceful reverting of verified inclusions making this article inaccurate and therefore ambiguous which confuses other readers. After two months I constantly encountered defiance and biased replies from one or more certain editors; Will beback, Walloon, DPSmith.</p>
<p>There have been cases of incorrect inclusions by some of these certain editors that were added on, not verified or misquoted and forced into the article. This been difficult virtually impossible to correct. This has caused me personally great dissatisfaction with Wikipedia and its mission, which is a good one if enforced. It came to the point that any inclusions I contributed were immediately deleted by these editors and any questioning of this resulted in personal accusations against me (This can be reviewed in the "Talk" pages of me "<a href="../../../r/o/g/User_talk%7ERoger_the_red_06db.html" title="User talk:Roger the red">User talk:Roger the red</a>", the article "<a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmerican_Mutoscope_and_Biograph_Company_b5ec.html" title="Talk:American Mutoscope and Biograph Company">Talk:American Mutoscope and Biograph Company</a>" and our AMA <a href="../../../t/u/t/User_talk%7ETutmosis_0adf.html" title="User talk:Tutmosis">User talk:Tutmosis</a>). With this I posted several "Tags" that are legitimate with my concerns and felt this would give notice to other "Neutral" editors to contribute to this article. However, after the tags posted, I am now being harassed again by the same editor(s) who again makes personal attacks on me, and insist on removing the tags, therefore not allowing the article to be contributed to, or changed in any way by any other editors other than themselves. Also, the formatting of this article is disheveled at best and confusing at its worst. I have also worked on several other articles including "<a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaumont.html" title="Gaumont">Gaumont</a> Films", "<a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathe.html" title="Pathe">Pathe</a>" and others in which I have posted tags, without any disagreement or problems whatsoever. Yet on this article if anything is changed at all, there is a "Firestorm" and barrage of accusations and problems by these editors. After all this, I have contacted an AMA <a href="../../../t/u/t/Tutmosis.html" title="Tutmosis">Tutmosis</a> who will hopefully be able to help so I will not have to go into arbitration.</p>
<p>To me, Wikipedia should be a collaberative effort of ALL ediotrs to contribute knowledge to the best of thier ability, not for it to be a grandstand stage, nor a "Battleground". However, this somewhat simple article has turned into that. --<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERoger_the_red_3e12.html" title="User:Roger the red">Roger the red</a> 05:29, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

This article reads like it was written in entirety by some priest(ess)(es) of the deity who like(s) to make wild claims.

<p>I have doubts about the assertion that DCB went to St Nazaire on 10 May 1968 - he attended and spoke at the 13 May demo in Paris (widely known, and asserted in books such as those cited), and later that week went to St Nazaire. He held a meeting on the evening of the 18th in St Nazaire, then a discussion on the beach the next day (Sunday 19th).</p>
<p>Does anyone know his precise movements in between these dates?</p>

<p>The page lists discusses the band as though it is a currently active entity and lists Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes as a "current member" despite the fact that she is deceased. It is scientifically impossible for a dead person to be an active member in an active band. On the talk page, an analogy to the Beatles is made which states that John Lennon and George Harrison are not considered "former Beatles" even though they are both deceased. Still, it is worth noting that the Beatles page refers to the Beatles as a <i>former</i> band rather than an active one. If they were still active, the two deceased Beatles would most likely then be considered "former Beatles." Hence, Lisa Lopes should either be listed as a <i>former</i> member, or TLC should be referred to as a <i>former</i> band.Trixen 05:02, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recently, I got into a dispute with <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">user:Askari Mark</a> over content related to the subsection titled "the Monitor and the Merrimack" within this article. He attempted to correct the subheading to "Monitor Vs Virginia". I would have let that line go, except for the fact that when he did his correction, he wrote a statment stating that everyone who had used the title "Monitor vs. Merrimack" was wrong. I challenged him on this, and he furthur altered the subheading to reflect a revisionist history of the battle between the Monitor and Merrimack, something which cannot be tolerated. The exchange between us, as well as proof of my own correctness in the matter, is contained within the <a href="../../../i/r/o/Ironclad_warship.html" title="Ironclad warship">ironclad warship</a> talk page.</p>
<p>What I have seen by this man, as well as seing it from many others within Wikipedia, is an attempt to alter a historical or scientific article to reflect a personal belief or set of beliefs without any basis in fact. What happened in <a href="../../../i/r/o/Ironclad_warship.html" title="Ironclad warship">ironclad warship</a> is pretty minor, but that minor altering has larger implications. Students are reading these articles; they are learning from these articles, they are dependent on these articles. As such, they must be as factual and reliable as possible. To have anyone come into Wikipedia and alter them because they don't like it is wrong. I had challenged this man to provide original sources to support his assertion; he would not, and accused me of personal bias; in fact, he underhandly called me a "troll". I had provided facts, links, and documents supporting the fact that his original line was wrong, which are posted on the talk page.</p>
<p>I am truly sorry it had come to this, as I believe that disputes should not happen at all. There are too many people on Wikipedia who are doing what they can to make the whole better. But what I have cited is "revisionist history", that kind of history which is altered by an individual who ignores established fact and posts that which he feels is "correct", without sources. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 14:54, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
