<p>The Picturephone is ringing, but nobody answers it right away. Pee-wee isn't there. Then Mrs. Renee enters the playhouse. She calls out to Pee-wee that the Picturephone is ringing, but he says he can't answer because he's in the bathroom. He asks Mrs. Renee to answer it for him, and she does so. She puts on an Egyptian headdress and pulls down a curtain with a painting of <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> on it, depicting the <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphinx.html" title="Sphinx">Sphinx</a> and two <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramids.html" title="Pyramids">pyramids</a>. She then answers the phone. It's Cowboy Curtis. He's calling to find out the secret word of the day. Mrs. Renee leans outside the booth and asks Pee-wee, still in the bathroom, what the secret word is and he shouts out that they don't know yet; she should go ask Conky. So she tells Curtis to hold the phone.</p>
<p>She then leaves the Picturephone and brings Conky to life. He says he's ready to assist her and she asks him what the secret word is. A piece of cardstocks pops out of his midsection and Mrs. Renee shows it to the audience. It reads: PLACE. She asks the audience what they're supposed to do whenever they hear the secret word. Everyone says, "Scream!" She says that that's right and that whenever anyone says the secret word for the rest of the day, they should scream real loud. She then goes back to the Picturephone and tries it out on Curtis: "Curtis, did you move?" "Nope, Mrs. Renee, still in the same old place." Everyone screams. Curtis laughs and says he has to go see a man about a horse, so he hangs up.</p>
<p><a name="A_Letter_From_Japan" id="A_Letter_From_Japan"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/c/Accidental_Playhouse_366b.html" title="Edit section: A Letter From Japan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A Letter From Japan</span></h3>
<p>Mrs. Renee leaves the Picturephone about the same time that Pee-wee finally emerges from the bathroom. They say hi to each other. Mrs. Renee then explains to Pee-wee that Reba the Mail Lady gave her a letter to give to Pee-wee, but she forgot where she put it. Terrified, Pee-wee says, "Well, c'mon, let's look for it! Must be around here some place." Everyone screams. Pee-wee laughs and says, "I get it. I said the secret word, didn't I?" Mrs. Renee says yes and she also says to Pee-wee that she was just teasing him; she has the letter. She puts it in his hand and then has to leave because she says she's needed someplace. They all scream again. She then hurries out the door, saying good-bye to everyone.</p>
<p>Pee-wee examines the letter. It's from <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. Globey then explains that he went on a trip to Japan last summer. He then recounts his trip, using live video, showing off Japan and a day in the life of an average Japanese family, with whom he stayed, known as the Mitsumis. Globey says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I met all kinds of nice people. I stayed with the Mitsumi family. Here they are watching TV before bedtime. Every morning, Mr. Mitsumi takes the train to work. Japan is very small and a lot of people live there. Sometimes it gets very crowded. Here is Mr. Mitsumi doing his morning exercises with his friends before work. Here he is at his job, building cars. Kamichi and Reiko Mitsumi go off to school in the morning, just like we do here. They study hard at school and love to play after they finish their homework. When Mr. Mitsumi gets home, Mrs. Mitsumi has dinner for everyone. Here we are eating some noodles. After dinner, everyone took turns taking a bath. That evening, we all went to see a strange play where everybody wore a lot of makeup and robes, even the men. On Saturday, we saw some sumo wrestling, where these big fat guys try to push each other out of a circle. It was fun. But my favorite part was visiting a monastery and meditating. Om. I made a lot of new friends.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Chairry asks Pee-wee what the letter says, but the letter is written in Japanese. Pee-wee can't make heads or tails of it, so he asks Conky to translate it for him. He inserts the letter into the robot and the translated letter comes out of Conky via his midsection, where the secret word usually comes out. At last, the letter pops out wholly. Pee-wee then reads the letter aloud:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Dear Pee-wee, My name is Oki Doki and I live in Tokyo. That's the capital of Japan. We take our shoes off before we go into the house. When we have dinner, we sit on the floor and eat with sticks. I will be visiting your country soon and hope to come and see you at the Playhouse. Sayonara, Oki.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Chairry comments that it must be fun having so many friends. "Yeah, it's pretty cool," Pee-wee says.</p>
<p>Magic Screen says, "Hey, Pee-wee, let's take a look at this!" It reveals to Pee-wee a magic show in progress. It's actually an old cartoon.</p>
<p><a name="Oki_Doki" id="Oki_Doki"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/c/Accidental_Playhouse_366b.html" title="Edit section: Oki Doki">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Oki Doki</span></h3>
<p>When the cartoon ends, Mr. Window notices someone coming and lets Pee-wee know that. "Well, I wonder who that could be," he says. He answers the door and right there on his doorstep is a Japanese man. "Konichiwa," he says. "I am Oki." Pee-wee looks at the camera and says, "Boy, that was quick!"</p>
<p>He then looks at Oki Doki. "Boy, Oki," says Pee-wee, "when you said you were coming over soon, you weren't kidding." "It is an honor to meet you," says Oki. He bows his head to Pee-wee and Pee-wee does the same back to Oki. Then they bow their heads at the same time and accidentally bump their heads against each other (which they would do a few times). "Well, c'mon in, Oki," says Pee-wee. Oki comes into the playhouse. "Say hi to Oki, everyone," he says to the playhouse denizens. They all say hi and hello to him. After saying hello to Oki, the flowers, apparently knowing Japanese courtesy, <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowing_%28social%29.html" title="Bowing (social)">bow</a> to him as a <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gong.html" title="Gong">gong</a> is heard.</p>
<p>"So this is the playhouse," Oki says in awe. "It is known the world over as a very special place." Everyone screams. Oki immediately figures out that he said the secret word. "Can you say it in Japanese, Oki?" Pee-wee asks. "Hai, tokoro," Oki replies. Everyone screams again; this flashing word is, this time, the Japanese way of writing "place". Oki then tells Pee-wee he brought him some presents from his homeland. "Presents?" Pee-wee says. "Well, fork 'em over." So Oki gives him a piece of something that looks like candy. Pee-wee looks at it awkwardly. "Gee, Oki, thanks," he says. "What is it, candy?" Oki tells him that it's raw fish, wrapped in rice and seaweed. Where he comes from, they call it <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sushi.html" title="Sushi">sushi</a>. Pee-wee sneers at the sushi, but tries not to show it by saying (rather hastily), "Thanks, Oki, but I just brushed my teeth." "Oh, and I brought you something else, too," Oki says. "This!"</p>
<p><a name="Gamera_and_Origami" id="Gamera_and_Origami"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/c/Accidental_Playhouse_366b.html" title="Edit section: Gamera and Origami">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gamera and Origami</span></h3>
<p>Magic Screen shows "this" to Pee-wee. "This" turns out to be an old movie starring the movie monster <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamera.html" title="Gamera">Gamera</a>, dubbed into English. A montage of clips from Gamera movies are shown, followed by a man tells a little boy and his sister about how Gamera taught Japan a lesson on pollution and littering:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The seas and the oceans are among the most precious possessions that we have on Earth. But all this pollution can threaten man's very existence. Our water is sacred. Gamera taught us all that lesson. If the oceans die, then mankind will die. So we have to protect them.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The boy agrees with his father on this. He and his sister then wave good-bye to Gamera, thanking him and that they'll see him again soon. Then the movie ends.</p>
<p>Pee-wee and Oki are then shown in the kitchen. Pee-wee says (rather sarcastically), "WOW! That was <i>so cool</i>, Oki!" Oki then asks him if he would like to teach him <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origami.html" title="Origami">origami</a>. Pee-wee then mistakenly thinks he will teach him how to "break bricks with [his] bare hands and junk". Oki then says that that's actually <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karate.html" title="Karate">karate</a>, a Japanese martial art. Origami is actually the Japanese art of paper folding. He demonstrates this by making a paper swan. Pee-wee tries out one for himself, but he clearly didn't pay attention. He just wads up a piece of paper into a small lump, supposedly creating a swan's egg. He then just starts laughing maniacally. Oki then, clearly weirded out by Pee-wee's siliness, tells Pee-wee he has to leave, as he has other pen-pals to visit.</p>
<p>So Oki heads for the door and Pee-wee follows him, thanking him for stopping and asking him to come by again next time he's in the neighborhood. Oki thanks Pee-wee and says, "Sayonara!" to everyone. They all say, "Sayonara!" back to him, except for Pee-wee, who mispronounces it as, "Shanalada!" Oki heads out the door and Pee-wee just says, "Shanalada!" repeatedly. He then bows his head to the camera and accidentally bumps it.</p>
<p><a name="Charades" id="Charades"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/c/Accidental_Playhouse_366b.html" title="Edit section: Charades">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Charades</span></h3>
<p>Later, Pee-wee and the playhouse denizens are playing charades with Miss Yvonne, who clearly did not meet Oki in the previous scene. She does something with her hands, which Randy interprets as a Mexican hat dance. Miss Yvonne says that that's right. Chairry asks her to do another one. Yvonne lets the audience know what they're up to—a game of charades. Then she starts another session of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charades.html" title="Charades">charades</a>. She begins by opening her mouth wide, putting her hand over it and pulling it away repeatedly. Randy guesses if she is screaming, but Pee-wee says that those actions mean it's a song title. Miss Yvonne nods and then holds up five fingers, which means that this song title has five words in it.</p>
<p>Then Miss Yvonne holds one finger. "First word," Pee-wee deducts. Yvonne then moves her hands back and forth. "Is she... pulling?" Conky asks. "No, she's grabbin'," Randy replies. "I got it: <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Had_a_Little_Lamb_2fa4.html" title="Mary Had a Little Lamb">Mary Had a Little Lamb</a></i>," Magic Screen guesses. Yvonne shakes her head <i>no</i> and then holds up two fingers. "Second word," Conky says. Yvonne then moves her hands back and forth again. "She's doing the same thing," Pee-wee says. "That must mean the first two words are the same!" Yvonne nods eagerly and taps her nose with her finger. "<i><a href="../../../t/w/i/Twinkle_Twinkle_Little_Star_1c72.html" title="Twinkle Twinkle Little Star">Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</a></i>?" Magic Screen guesses. Miss Yvonne shakes her head. "Hmm," Pterri says. "This is a hard one."</p>
<p>Then Miss Yvonne holds up three fingers. "Third word," Globey says. Again, Yvonne moves her hands back and forth. "She is <i>still</i> doing the same thing," Pterri says, flustered. "This is driving me crazy!" Yvonne then puffs her cheeks and blows through her mouth. "Sounds like, uh... blow!" Magic Screen says. Miss Yvonne moves her hands back and forth. "Row!" Conky, Randy and Pterri all take turns saying. Pee-wee then guesses the word correctly at last: "<i><a href="../../../r/o/w/Row%2C_Row%2C_Row_Your_Boat_0f0a.html" title="Row, Row, Row Your Boat">Row, Row, Row Your Boat</a></i>!" "That's right, Pee-wee!" Miss Yvonne says.</p>
<p>Then Pee-wee decides to take a turn with charades, so Miss Yvonne switches places with him. Pee-wee holds up one finger. "One word," Yvonne says. Then he taps his arms with two fingers. "With two syllables," Pterri says. Then Pee-wee holds up one finger. "First syllable," says Yvonne. Then Pee-wee clenches his hands into fists and moving them up and down. "Uh, milking a cow?" Yvonne guesses. Pee-wee shakes his head, still moving his fists up and down. "Driving," Globey says. Pee-wee nods. "What's he driving?" Yvonne asks. "A fire truck!" Pterri says excitedly. "It's a fire truck!" Pee-wee shakes his head. "A car!" Chairry guesses. Pee-wee nods.</p>
<p>Now Pee-wee holds up two fingers. "Second syllable," Miss Yvonne says. Pee-wee then holds up two fingers again. "Peace," says Globey. Pee-wee shakes his head and holds up two fingers again. "Uh, victory," says Yvonne. Pee-wee shakes his head, still holding up two fingers. "Two," says Conky. Pee-wee nods. He then moves his fists up and down and then holds up two fingers. "Car... two..." everyone says repeatedly until Pee-wee makes the sign language for the letter N and puts the three of them together. "Car... two... N..." everyone says. Then they put it together — he was forming the word, "Cartoon". Yvonne finally gets it right. They all squeal with delight, even Pee-wee, who eventually falls on the floor, exhausted from excitement. A cartoon is shown.</p>
<p><a name="Snack_Time:_Water" id="Snack_Time:_Water"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/c/Accidental_Playhouse_366b.html" title="Edit section: Snack Time: Water">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Snack Time: Water</span></h3>
<p>When the cartoon ends, Pee-wee is seen in the kitchen. He gives the viewers a riddle of what the snack is for Snack Time today. He says it's very important for one's <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health.html" title="Health">health</a> and it's loaded with minerals and nutrients, but this snack can't be chewed on unless it's frozen. The answer is water. Pee-wee then starts to drink a glass of water when suddenly, Randy floats down and says that water is a crummy snack. Pee-wee states that water is important for one's health, it's something everyone needs to stay healthy and it's good for you. He then says that therefore, water is a nice, refeshing snack for anytime. He takes a big sip of water and says, "Mmm, watery!" One of the fish in the aquarium says, "Water, yeah. We wouldn't leave home without it." This fish and the other one laugh in unison.</p>
<p>Pee-wee heads over to his scooter's hiding spot and cranks the arm of the statue down, and the hidden door rises, releasing his scooter. He mounts the scooter, puts on the helmet and says good-bye to everyone. He then says, "Boy, I sure had fun today! I sure hope you did, too. Well, see you all again next week, same time, same... PLACE!" Everyone screams one last time. Then Pee-Wee then "scoots" out, and the supposedly locked door swings open, and he flies out of the playhouse, passing <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Rushmore_ebc9.html" title="Mount Rushmore">Mount Rushmore</a> on his way, as always. The end credits roll.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/c/Accidental_Playhouse_366b.html" title="Edit section: Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Oki Doki is played by <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joey_Miyashima_911e.html" title="Joey Miyashima">Joey Miyashima</a>.</li>
<li>It's possible that this may be the same Oki that Pee-wee wrote to in <i><a href="../../../r/e/b/Reba_Eats_and_Pterri_Runs_fe11.html" title="Reba Eats and Pterri Runs">Reba Eats and Pterri Runs</a></i>. This is evidenced in that particular episode by him saying in the letter "please write back". The character's name itself is a pun on the American phrase "Okie dokie".</li>
<li><b>Running Gag:</b> Pee-wee and Oki bowing their heads to each other at the same time and accidentally bumping each other's heads.</li>
<li>Mrs. Renee makes a reference to Reba the Mail Lady.</li>
<li>When Pee-wee receives the sushi from Oki and grimaces at it, the fish sing, "If you know Sushi like I know Sushi..." This is a pun of the song, "If You Know Suzie, Like I Know Suzie." Sushi, in this case, could be the name of a fish friend of theirs, but this is just interpretation at best...</li>
<li>Oki says several Japanese words ("hai", "dozo", "tokoro" and "sayonara") that Pee-wee apparently understands (except for when Oki said "sayonara", which Pee-wee mispronounces as "shanalada", as he usually mispronounces foreign words, though he pronounces it correctly when reading Oki's letter). This could be a reference to an old Japanese commercial starring Pee-wee in which he spoke some fluent Japanese.</li>
<li>When Oki says the secret word in Japanese, the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanji.html" title="Kanji">kanji</a> 処 is shown. This character can be read as "tokoro," but 所 is far more common.</li>
<li>During the charades game, Pee-wee holds up two fingers. Globey guesses that the two fingers mean, "peace", while Miss Yvonne guesses they mean, "victory". They can be interpreted as both.
<ul>
<li>The fingers used as "peace" is a reference to a "peace sign" that hippies used. Likewise, the fingers used as "victory" is a reference to a "v sign" used during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> (people would hold up two fingers that mean "victory").</li>
</ul>
