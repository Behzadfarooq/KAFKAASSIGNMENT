</ul>
<p>If we reed the text of the patent careful and take into account that at that time in Vienna mouth harmonicas with "Kanzellen" (chambers) ware soled already for many years and also other bigger Hand bellows driven Instrument ware soled for some years. He could not get a patent for a aeoline, because it already ware there. He could not get a patent for the diatonic arranging of keys the system ware in use on moth blown instruments. So he thought it is a good idea to get a the Year of 1833 we find a great variety of instruments mentioned in the Writing of the musician Adolph Müller "Schule für Accordion". There is also evidence that Whetstone did know this types of instruments at that time.</p>
<p>So he could think to put his idea of arranging the keys into reality by having a verity of reed instruments to test. One should also not forget, that at that time Vienna an London had a very close relationship, especially if we think abut the musicians performing in Vienna and London very often in the same year.</p>

<p>"Later, in 1824, he published 'The Harmonic Diagram' [...] Charles and his brother William took over their uncle Charles's musical instrument business on his death in autumn 1823, when Charles was 21 and William about 18 years of age. Charles was clearly well versed in musical theory, having he published his 'Harmonic Diagram' in January 1824. [...] It is evident from the two extremely early concertinas in the C M Collection with serial numbers in Roman numerals that Wheatstone was producing a type of concertina closely related to both the symphonium and the Demian accordion by about 1830. One in particular, the 'open pearl pallet' model, numbered XXXII or '32' (Item C1517) exhibits the formative 24-key 'English' layout of the symphonium, together with the exposed pearl pallets and ebony levers in common with the earliest European accordions being produced in Vienna by Demian from about 1829. The Wheatstone factory began to produce conventionally, non-Roman numbered English concertinas only from about 1836, according to the earliest dates of sale in the Workshop Ledgers, and these differ considerably in many respects from the early 'Roman numeral' models. The evolution of the design of the Wheatstone concertina, 1830 to 1850 is considered more fully below."</p>

<dl>
<dd>Theodore, sorry there is some potential for misinterpreting the original writing.</dd>
</dl>
<p>On his first page (<a href="http://www.accordion-online.de/instrum/demian2.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.accordion-online.de/instrum/demian2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.accordion-online.de/instrum/demian2.htm</a>) on the 4th line you find no other word for the invention as accordion. German text the actual beginning until the naming of the instrument.</p>
<p>"<b>Beschreibung und Zeichnung</b> Demian Cyrill in Verbindung mit seinen beiden Söhnen Karl und Guido, Orgel und Claviermacher, wohnen auf der Mariahilferstrasse No. 43 in Wien, zeigen einer hohen Landesstelle geziemend an, ein neues Instrument Accordion genannt erfunden zu haben,...."</p>
<p>And the name Accordion occurs several times in the original on other pages as well.</p>
<p><br />
The thing you think it means "aeoline" crossed out was original the heading for the following drawing of the reed banks.</p>
<p>And it reeds like this in old German:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notice that it read "NOT" Accordion as the name for the complet Insrument.</li>
</ul>
<p>It reads "Accoriien" as for the reeds arranged in chords.</p>
<ul>
<li>And originally it had the article *der* what indicates multible chord reed sets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changed to *des* - singular, but Accoriien is still in plural, singular it would write Accoriion.</p>
<ul>
<li>The the crossed out attribute *Ceftec* is not identifiably for me as with some sense at all at the momet.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>"Grundriß und innere Ansicht der Ceftec Accoriien."</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The word "Ceftec" or "Echtec" could spell a bit different but it cant find an similar word in the other text.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it seems it is a new Construction only used by Demian. Sure it cant be spelled as "aeoline".</p>
<ul>
<li>Even the letters used in this word are unusual in the way the are used, looks like he pevered a more modern way of using the letter "e". In normal sentences the traditional Corinthian "e" that looks like narrower "n" is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did read the complete original text and compared it with the German translation and it is absolutely correct repeated except, on the occasion that "Accorriien" is written as Accordion.</p>

<p>This article mentions an "A-flat diminished chord". Is this chord really possible?? The fifth of the chord would be an <b>E double flat</b>.

<dl>
<dd>Since the Stradella bass mechanism uses only 12 equal-tempered tones, E double flat sounds as its enharmonic equivalent, D. It's just a matter of spelling. For a chord containing A flat, C flat (B) and E double flat (D), can you think of a better name than A flat diminished?--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore_Kloba_cbef.html" title="User:Theodore Kloba">Theodore Kloba</a> 14:36, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>G# diminished sounds obvious. How does this answer not make sense?? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 21:14, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>G# diminished is what's shown on the right side of the chart (i.e. the top of the keyboard). Although the tones are identical, it's traditional to notate as sharp on that side and flat on the other.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore_Kloba_cbef.html" title="User:Theodore Kloba">Theodore Kloba</a> 20:54, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apart from the fact that I see  instead of b or #, who wrote the Abb for the 120 bass?</p>
<p>I no longer play accordion, but I can not imagine that it is referred to as Abb. Why would someone write Abb instead of G? Is it actually referred to as Abb on the accordion?</p>
<p>Also, I use UTF-8 (on Windows IE, ver 6) and I do not see # or b, just  or if I switch to Firefox, I'll see a question mark. Why can't you guys use # or b from a conventional character map. I looked at this page from a brand new computer in a public library (Windows XP) and I just saw  instead of # or b. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavehorne_9ff4.html" title="User:Davehorne">Davehorne</a> 12:44, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There's a page on wikipedia for ♯ and ♭ which look better. In the long run it'll be far easier to sort out your browser than to edit the internet to remove UTF encodings. Not every site has an edit facility [there are pages on wikipedia discussing encodings too that you mind find useful]</p>

<p>I suggest that the Button Accordion section be revised. Chromatic keyboards are more closely related to piano keyboards than to diatonic keyboard. Chromatic and piano have the same notes, the buttons just look different from piano keys. The same music can be played on either, though diatonic keyboards are limited to Button accordion/piano accordion isn't really a useful split. To make things more confusing, piano keyboards are <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chromatic.html" title="Chromatic">chromatic</a>, since they have all twelve pitches of the western scale.</p>
<p>I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diatonic</li>
<li>non-diatonic (I need a name here)
<ul>
<li>chromatic keyboard</li>
<li>piano keyboard</li>
<li>uniform keyboard</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To confuse things further, let's consider the bass side. You can mix and match various bass keyboards with the chromatic and piano keyboards. Stradella or free-bass or switchable can be combined with either piano or chromatic (or probably a uniform keyboard). I sort of think the bass side should be a sub-category of the non-diatonic keyboards.</p>
<p>Does anyone have suggestions? I am too new to be confident in all of this, and I'm still deciding whether to move to a chromatic keyboard from a piano keyboard, but I'm almost ready for a switch. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> 20:46, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Klezmer should be added to the musical styles. <a href="http://www.klezmershack.com/archives/000007.html" class="external free" title="http://www.klezmershack.com/archives/000007.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.klezmershack.com/archives/000007.html</a></p>

<p>I remember watching a TV series about the history of music a few years ago (probably BBC) where the presenter suggested that the popularity of the Accordion in folk music was one of the key factors in reducing the diversity of tempering of folk instruments (because an accordion is pre-tuned, they were forced to match their instruments to the even-tempered instrument). I think it's an interesting theory worthy of mention here, but unfortunately I can't recall the programme - anyone know? <a href="../../../f/s/h/User%7EFSharpMajor_aefc.html" title="User:FSharpMajor">FSharpMajor</a> 09:23, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
