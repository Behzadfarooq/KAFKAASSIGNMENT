<p>Because of internal changes to Wikipedia's template code, some editors are systematically changing the way that a number of reference templates work. Junk code is being inserted into the text of the page, and then hidden using CSS. There is an alternative solution, but this method appears to be chosen because it is easier to implement, and accessibility is being ignored. This is appallingly contrary to the principal that Wikipedia should be accessible to all users.

<p>I think more could be done for people with visual disabilities regarding images. Caption almost never tell what the image contains. It wouldn't be that hard to create a mechanism for image descriptions, perhaps an alternate name space in commons. There could also be a place for visually impaired people to request alternate descriptions for images that they have interest in. At the very least, there could be a standard syntax for an alternate description text on the image's description page so people wouldn't have to wade through all the licensing stuff and some mention of the need for descriptions, with a link to a page with some examples of good practice, on the upload page.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 19:32, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello, agr. Some time ago I had the same idea: a mechanism to describe multimedia content is needed. Images are the first target, but we should also aim at the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcription_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Transcription (linguistics)">transcription</a> of sound and video files (probably using <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timed_Text_d775.html" title="Timed Text">Timed Text</a> <a href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> or <a href="../../../o/g/g/Ogg_Writ_3fab.html" title="Ogg Writ">Ogg Writ</a>). As you say, a new namespace called Description:Handicap.svg is a possible solution. I was thinking also in semantic annotations: Do you know something about the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki" class="extiw" title="meta:Semantic_MediaWiki">meta:Semantic MediaWiki</a> project? It is a work in progress implementation of semantic relations and attributes in MediaWiki. Maybe we can reuse this framework for that type of descriptions. For example, instead of creating a page in a new namespace, the annotation would be written directly in the page <a href="../../../h/a/n/Image%7EHandicap.svg_8809.html" title="Image:Handicap.svg">Image:Handicap.svg</a>:</dd>

<p>I don't think the advice about using <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows-1252.html" title="Windows-1252">Windows-1252</a> or <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin-1.html" title="Latin-1">Latin-1</a> characters instead of other <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicode.html" title="Unicode">Unicode</a> characters is very useful because the HTML pages send by MediaWiki are encoded in <a href="../../../u/t/f/UTF-8_ae3b.html" title="UTF-8">UTF-8</a>. This is not a problem about the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows-1252.html" title="Windows-1252">Windows-1252</a> or <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin-1.html" title="Latin-1">Latin-1</a> encodings (i.e. not a Windows vs. Linux issue or a <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin-1.html" title="Latin-1">Latin-1</a> vs. other non-Western <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO-8859_d448.html" title="ISO-8859">ISO-8859</a> encodings). These two encodings are widely used and supported, but even those articles written only with <a href="../../../a/s/c/ASCII_d2cd.html" title="ASCII">ASCII</a> characters are sent with the "UTF-8" tag.</p>
<p>The first 256 characters of Unicode are identical to the whole Latin-1, however no text encoded in Latin-1 (using any of the upper half) is also a valid UTF-8 string (neither a Windows-1252 text, of course). That's because the first 128 Unicode characters are encoded using 1 byte, but for the next 128 characters 2 bytes are needed. Therefore a pure 7-bit ASCII string is a valid UTF-8, but not a Latin-1 or Windows-1252 text.</p>
<p>This advice will require changes in the MediaWiki software: when submiting an article the server would need to check whether it's only composed by Windows-1252 characters, and later send it to users with special HTTP headers ("charset=windows-1252" instead of "charset=UTF-8"). Of course it could be done, but IMHO it's not a good idea (and probably developers think the same). If screen readers don't support UTF-8/Unicode they should be updated because nowadays the W3 is adopting Unicode.</p>
<p>In summary: That guideline should be removed from the policy. Or am I missing something? Thank you --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuruena_5a7c.html" title="User:Suruena">surueÃ±a</a> 15:24, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All you say is correct, but note that &amp;nbsp; / &amp;#160; is (fortunately, otherwise I couldn't use Wikipedia) sent as is, not as UTF-8. I can read / write on Meta and the English Wikipedia, but I cannot use the German Wikipedia - too many UTF-8 encodings. Of course it's clear that the number of users without UTF-8 browser is limited, I'd guess one = me.</dd>
<dd>The software <b>can</b> support to render UTF-8 as hex. <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numeric_Character_Reference_e4fa.html" title="Numeric Character Reference">NCRs</a>, it does this in edit boxes for browsers known to cause havoc with UTF-8. It could do more for such browsers, the code exists, it's only not enabled here. The real issue is the subset of Unicode: Before HTML 4 Latin-1 was the default, it's still the default for <a href="../../../h/t/t/HTTP_293c.html" title="HTTP">HTTP</a> (the protocol). Even the most limited devices (mobile, old, etc.) should support all glyphs in this subset. No matter how it's sent, as UTF-8, UTF-16LE, Latin-1, or ASCII with NCRs, as long as the final glyph to display belongs to Latin-1 it should work everywhere.</dd>
<dd>That's not the case for arbitrary Unicode points above u+FF. The glyph lists of various operating systems used to be limited to a few hundred glyphs, also depending on installed fonts. Unicode has several hundred thousands characters. Simple devices just can't support all of them, Korean, Cyril, Greek, Math, Thai, etc. It's impossible to guess which subset is supported. I'd know where to find WGL4 (Win glyph list 4), and then I could say which characters in addition to Latin-1 (or windows-1252, that's Latin-1 plus 27 more printable characters) should work on all <i>popular</i> platforms (= Win PCs + Win CE mobile devices + almost all printers). But that already ignores screen readers on Linux or old browsers (my case) on OS/2, where the supported glyph list can be different.</dd>
<dd>But I'm 100% sure that it includes Latin-1 (or in fact windows-1252). How that stuff is transported, UTF-8 or otherwise, is a different question. --&#160;<a href="../../../o/m/n/User%7EOmniplex_327d.html" title="User:Omniplex">Omniplex</a> 19:26, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see, your are talking about character sets, not character encodings. Thanks for charifying your point. I like your proposal: to deliver some characters as <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numeric_character_reference.html" title="Numeric character reference">numeric character references</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/a/Character_entity_reference.html" title="Character entity reference">character entity references</a> (the latter is the preferred option in my POV) to better support old user agents. Of course this is one of the goals of web accessibility, and because this transformation can be done by the MediaWiki software it's transparent to editors. We could even transform not only Latin-1 or Windows-1252 characters, but some other character sets with known support in older platforms (specially those with character entity references). However, developers have the last word: maybe it imposes a high penalty in the server, and can be too disruptive. But all in all, I find this proposal interesting.</dd>

Of course changes in MediaWiki are needed to improve the accessibility (in the syntax, in the generation of HTML, etc...), but said changes are "under the hood", and need not (and shouldn't) be written in a policy. If an editor needs to write a character he/she has to write it, regardless of whether it is outside the Latin-1 character set, the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_Multilingual_Plane_ef40.html" title="Basic Multilingual Plane">BMP</a> or whatever. Can you put an illustrative example? --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuruena_5a7c.html" title="User:Suruena">surueÃ±a</a> 18:13, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As the author of that point, I'll explain why I added it. In at least <a href="../../../j/a/w/JAWS_%28screen_reader%29_dbb5.html" title="JAWS (screen reader)">JAWS for windows</a>, all characters which cannot be recognised, which is anything not in the windows-1252 character set, are spoken as question marks. The ability to read and identify characters which are not in the windows-1252 character set was introduced in version 6.1. However, the name of only a few of these characters (the Arabic alphabet, a few special symbols) is stored, and adding them is a fiddly process involving editing the language file for the synthesizer you want to speak the character. The dictionary manager, the normal method for changing the pronunciation of characters or words, still does not support unicode. Therefore, it's easier for JAWS users to read and manipulate windows-1252 characters, no matter their JAWS version. However, the actual non-Latin characters are not garbled in edit forms by JAWS; I've never had complaints about that, and I've edited thousands of pages. However, I need to be especially careful with cutting and pasting.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, all I'm trying to say is that there is nothing wrong with using UTF-8 characters and non-Latin characters. However, if there is a character in the windows-1252 character set that can replace the non-Latin character, it should be used.</dd>

<dd>re: Graham87, funny but true, on my box Lynx has the best Unicode "support" with its 256-33 printable characters in codepage 850 (or 5 less in windows-1252), it uses an old weird scheme to replace many Unicode characters by mnemonics. Something like "-&gt;" for "arrow pointing right". The effect with a screen reader on top of Lynx is probably hilarious, but in visual text mode it often works.</dd>

<dd>re: Suruena, yes something like a "legacy skin" (not the CSS based definition of skin, more like a preference) would be cute. It would have some serious limitations, therefore users won't pick it unless they must or want, and so the additional server load for transformations should be not too high. Hex. / dec. / symbolic entities is less important. The W3C has had enough of odd collections of symbols, they now recommend hex. But Netscape 4 or worse (my case) don't support hex. NCRs, so it's either decimal or symbolic. Unknown decimal NCRs result in a question mark, okay from my POV. Symbolic is also fine if I know what unsupported names mean (e.g. &amp;euro; isn't supported by Netscape navigator, but perfectly clear).</dd>
<dd>The existing symbolic names have an advantage: Somebody went to the trouble to invent and list them in the XHTML standard. Therefore any browser is supposed to support them (Netscape navigator has an excuse, it's too old for some, but knows all symbolic entities defined for HTML 3.2, essentially Latin-1 but still better than UTF-8 limited to ASCII). In other words, that is a richer set than windows-1252 that should be supported by "any" browser including JAWS, unlesss it's simply too old. After that point - identification of a small Unicode subset supposed to work everywhere - I don't care how it's actually sent, symbolic or decimal, both fine.</dd>

Its compressed archive was above 40 MB. I don't have the disk space to unpack and test it, and I'm not eager to download 40 MB over a V90 line if the most likely outcome is "won't work". The complete Netscape navigator binary and also the Lynx binary are about 2 MB.

<p>I can think of a few characters where such advice could increase accessibility for screen readers or non-Unicode browsers, but it's an exceedingly thin sliver of cases between ISO Latin and the full breadth of Unicode, and difficult for the average editor to figure out which substitutions would actually be helpful. I would recommend the standard Latin-1 character set over Microsoft's proprietary Windows-1252.</p>
<p>Latin entities might make a bit of sense if they're read out, but on the other hand I recall from my Netscape 4.0 days that a few characters would be rendered correctly if included in the page as decimal entities, but show up as question marks if entered as Latin entities.</p>
<p>Code pages in Jaws hardly sound like they're worth messing around with unless you are interested in a subject where one particular language is used, since you would still have to choose a single one. A single Wikipedia article can easily have characters from several different code pages (e.g. accented Latin, IPA pronunciation, and one or more foreign-language scripts or some technical or mathematics symbols). I wonder if the developers are considering adding real Unicode capabilityâ€”it sounds like even just reading out a characters' Unicode name would be far superior to the way it works now. Too bad a USD $900 screen reader (Jaws) can't have the same basic text savvy that a free text-only browser (Lynx) does. <i>â€”<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-05-12&#160;21:14&#160;Z</small></i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, we have here more than one topic:
<ol>
<li>I agree with you, Michael Z., although there could be some cases where a few Unicode characters could be replaced by Latin-1 ones, at the end this would be a pain and also it wouldn't be very useful in my POV. For example, Greek has assigned a block of Unicode characters,<a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0370.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0370.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and some of those <a href="../../../g/l/y/Glyph.html" title="Glyph">glyphs</a> can be found in the Basic Latin<a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and Latin-1<a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> blocks, like "Greek small letter <a href="../../../m/u/_/Mu_%28letter%29.html" title="Mu (letter)">mu</a>" and all of those with identical visual appearance like "Greek capital letter <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_%28letter%29.html" title="Alpha (letter)">alpha</a>" (equal to "Latin capital letter <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A">A</a>"), "Greek capital letter <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beta_%28letter%29.html" title="Beta (letter)">beta</a>", "Greek capital letter <a href="../../../i/o/t/Iota_%28letter%29.html" title="Iota (letter)">iota</a>",â€¦ But they're only I few, a Greek word composed also for characters not found in the Latin-1 character set will be still not readable. An also, although each glyph has the same visual appearance, the character contains additional semantic information (one character "mu" is used only in mathematical notation while the other is only for Greek texts, the "capital alpha" when transformted to lower case should be converted to "small alpha" and not "latin small a", a spell checker will allow a Greek word with a capital iota, but would reject the same word mixing Latin and Greek lettersâ€¦), and therefore if editors are encouraged to substitute them with Latin-1 characters that semantic information is lost. Those substitutions should be done by the software when serving the page, and not by the editors (no information lost, and also is easier). However, the policy can be changed to <b>"if you write non-latin text, you must provide next a latin <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliteration</a>"</b> or something like that. Therefore, those readers without Unicode support</li>
<li>Those <b>users without UTF-8 support</b> could receive some characters using entity references. This is the English version of the Wikipedia, so Latin-1 characters are a good bet. However, other Wikipedias maybe should choose another character set (but we proposal could start with only Latin-1). Omniplex, I was thinking the reverse: this substitution should be always done when sending a page unless the user specifies it in his/her preferences. Otherwise, only those registered users (knowing the existence of that preference) will be able to use that feature. But of course, the performance issues have to be taking into account. And yes, I've also heard that hexadecimal numeric entities are not supported by old browsers, therefore the decimal ones should be employed instead. I don't know whether old browsers have a good support of character entities, I only said that preference because they can be understood by humans. Maybe the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references_d265.html" title="List of XML and HTML character entity references">character entities defined</a> in the HTML 2.0 or 3.2 specification are widely supported, but those defined in HTML 4.0 should be written with numeric entities (I don't know). Omniplex, do you want to lead the proposal? I will support your enhacement request voting the <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/" rel="nofollow">MediaZilla</a> entry, and giving all the feedback you want.</li>
<li><b>JAWS must support Unicode</b>, that's very important. That's harder to achieve than a change in the MediaWiki software, but maybe if they receive some e-mails from us they will do something. UTF-8 is also very important. Does JAWS have some problems with UTF-8? For example, do it understand all characters of my surname?:
<ul>
<li>UrueÃ±a (Unicode character)</li>
<li>UrueÃ±a (character entity reference)</li>
<li>UrueÃ±a (decimal numeric entity reference)</li>
<li>UrueÃ±a (hexadecimal numeric entity reference)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Also, JAWS should understand all <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_639-1_ea03.html" title="ISO 639-1">ISO 639-1</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_639-2_9b4a.html" title="ISO 639-2">ISO 639-2</a> language codes (see <a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELang_085e.html" title="Template:Lang">Template:lang</a>).</dd>
<dd>PS: I've changed my signature replacing the plain '<tt>Ã±</tt>' character with the <tt>&amp;ntilde;</tt> entity to improve its accessibility&#160;:-) Best regards. --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuruena_5a7c.html" title="User:Suruena">surueÃ±a</a> 09:44, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The "Ã±" character is read buy all versions of JAWS , as it appears in the windows-1252 character set (the as character #241, according to the SayAsciiValue function of JAWS). That character is safe, and doesn't need to be changed. How the characters are written in the edit window only affects what is read in the edit window, and does not affect what is displayed or read by any screen reader. I would personally prefer to read question marks than the actual numbers while reading an article, which would seem like random numbers and be confusing to me. I don't support using numeric character references in edit windows either; it might approve accessibility slightly, but make it difficult for those reading non-Latin languages to decipher what character has been typed.

<dd>Sorry for the misconception, I haven't explained myself wellâ€¦ With the above '<a href="../../../%C3%B1/_/_/%C3%91.html" title="Ã‘">Ã±</a>' characters I wanted to test the UTF-8 support of JAWS. If it can read OK all of them it seems that JAWS have no problems with UTF-8. (However, is the browser that sends to JAWS the page, probably JAWS only receives Windows-1252 characters and is the browser who decodes the web page, am I right?) The transformation of characters about we were talking are made transparently by the server: i.e. editors don't write character or numeric entity references but the 'plain' character with their keyboards, and is the server who send the final web page to users with those character transformations for those who browsers with no UTF-8 encoding support. But it's only when reading the page, later, when other editor edits the page, he/she will see the 'plain' character again, and not the numeric entity reference. Well, except users like Omniplex, who have more transformations I suppose: because their browsers have problems with UTF-8 characters when editing a page, they see character entity references when editing. However, those numeric or character entity references are transformed to plain characters when they submit their edits, and therefore that transformation is also transparent for the rest of editors.</dd>
<dd>However, there're some exceptions, and I support that some special characters should be introduced by all editors as character entity references. For example, <a href="../../../e/n/_/En_dash.html" title="En dash">en</a> and <a href="../../../e/m/_/Em_dash.html" title="Em dash">em dashes</a> should always be written using <tt>&amp;ndash;</tt> and <tt>&amp;mdash</tt>, and the minus sign like <tt>&amp;minus;</tt>, otherwise they could be easily confused with a normal hyphen. Or non-graphic character, like &amp;nbsp; for the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-breaking_space.html" title="Non-breaking space">non-breaking space</a>. Or sometimes a | should be written as <tt>&amp;#124;</tt> when it must appear in a template call, for example. --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuruena_5a7c.html" title="User:Suruena">surueÃ±a</a> 09:24, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wonder if there is a way to make the timelines accessible with screen readers? At the moment, when navigating through a timeline, all I get is image map links but no years. It would be nice if I could find out in what years something occurred; for an example see <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_computing.html" title="History of computing">history of computing</a>. Could the years be added to the image description, or would this just make the timeline look ugly? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraham87_fa35.html" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraham87_9542.html" title="User talk:Graham87">talk</a> 11:58, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You mean at <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_computing.html#Graphical_timeline" title="Timeline of computing">Timeline of computing#Graphical timeline</a>?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Currently, it appears that timeline text like "<a href="../../../m/o/o/Moore%27s_law.html" title="Moore's law">Moore's law</a>: processor complexity will double every year, revised in 1975: complexity will double every two years. <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_E._Moore_e887.html" title="Gordon E. Moore">Gordon E. Moore</a>" is represented by graphical text, but only the links and redundant title attributes present in the code. This fails validation and accessibility, because each area's required alt attribute is missing altogether, and most of the text is not represented in the code at all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think it would be better if each link had the full sentence for its alt text, prefixed with the relevant timeline date or range of dates. So the link above would be represented by):</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
 <code>&lt;area shape="rect" href="/wiki/Moore's_law" coords="x,y,x,y" alt="1965â€”Moore's law: processor complexity will double every year, revised in 1975: complexity will double every two years. Gordon E. Moore" /&gt;</code>
 <code>&lt;area shape="rect" href="/wiki/Gordon_E._Moore" coords="x,y,x,y" alt="1965â€”Moore's law: processor complexity will double every year, revised in 1975: complexity will double every two years. Gordon E. Moore" /&gt;</code>
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>In this case the text is repeated, but a separate area is required for each link. Perhaps it should be recommended that editors try to include exactly one link in each timeline item. What should be in the title attribute?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And of course the timeline image map entries should be sorted by their date, perhaps grouped by timeline section. Is there a way to add the subheadings? <i>â€”<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-05-14&#160;20:22&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<dd>Yes, if the main text could be placed in the alt attribute, this would make it easier to use. I think we should recomend that the text contains exactly one link; because of its behavior in image descriptions with several links, I suspect that it will ignore the second link, but it's hard to tell. Maybe the sections can be noted by subheadings (&lt;h3&gt; and &lt;/h3) and the like, or with lists. It would be ideal if a JAWS user could move through the sections of a timeline with the quick navigation keys (which include such elements as headings, lists, ETC). <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraham87_fa35.html" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraham87_9542.html" title="User talk:Graham87">talk</a> 09:54, 15 May 2006 (UTC) sentences revised at 10:24, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Graham, how do you do? As you know, I'm currently working in the <a href="../../../a/c/c/Wikipedia%7EAccessibility_9b08.html" title="Wikipedia:Accessibility">Wikipedia:Accessibility</a> project, and there's much work to doâ€¦ I would like to know what are the biggest accessibility problems of Wikipedia, for working on them first. Image descriptions? Articles' structure? Unicode texts? The opinion of a <a href="../../../j/a/w/JAWS_%28screen_reader%29_dbb5.html" title="JAWS (screen reader)">JAWS</a> user is very valuable, thanks!

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your message; I'm glad you're improving the accessibility page; it hasn't received much heavy editing for a while. The main problems I have at the moment with accessibility are the use of IPA for pronunciation (sound files on pronunciation are especially handy to fix that), and the format of timelines. I'll probably write more on the issue at <strong class="selflink">wikipedia talk:accessibility</strong> when I've finished researching the timeline issue. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraham87_fa35.html" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraham87_9542.html" title="User talk:Graham87">talk</a> 11:49, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>However, the biggest reason wikipedia is difficult to use for blind people is related to problems with JAWS, the most popular screen reader. What is read in JAWS is quite different to what is seen in web browsers; each link is put on its own line, and the format of tables is changed remarkably. Wikipedia isn't an easy site to use for newbies to JAWS, but using the heading and link navigation features, it's possible to use most of the features of the site. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraham87_fa35.html" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraham87_9542.html" title="User talk:Graham87">talk</a> 12:06, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, IPA is also a problem for me! I don't know how to pronounce those IPA characters. However, I suppose your problem is that JAWS only gives question marks when reading an IPA pronuntiation, isn't it?</dd>
<dd>I had also some ideas about the timeline issue. As the WAI says, image maps imposes accessibility problems. Luckily, the only image maps I've found in Wikipedia are timelines, am I right? Probably a simple fix is the EasyTimeline tool writing also the longdesc attribute. However a more elegant solution would be to generate <a href="../../../s/v/g/SVG_cd15.html" title="SVG">SVG</a> images instead of image maps, but there's not enough support for SVG. Maybe in the future.</dd>
<dd>Sorry, but I don't have a clear idea of the problems with JAWS. Please, can you put an example? Are they problems of JAWS, or a Wikipedia policy should correct them? --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuruena_5a7c.html" title="User:Suruena">surueÃ±a</a> 12:14, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, my problem is that a lot of the IPA characters are written as question marks. Someone suggested once that there should be a speech synthesizer for IPA, but it was pointed out that even those symbols can be ambiguous. Timelines are the only use of image maps I know of on the wikipedia site. The problems with JAWS could only be fixed if the virtual buffer was made to look more like what the sighted user sees; freedom scientific is making plans for this, which is a good thing. Maybe the only advice I could give is to not overlink words in wikipedia articles, and make tables accessible. . <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraham87_fa35.html" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraham87_9542.html" title="User talk:Graham87">talk</a> 12:26, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see: The problem with JAWS you was referring to is that articles have too much wikilinks and the screen reader stops in each one. Yes, this is also a problem for other users because important links are "hidden" among less interesting ones, therefore it should be easier to enforce by editors than other accessibility guidelines. In fact the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28links%29_308c.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)</a> and <a href="../../../o/n/l/Wikipedia%7EOnly_make_links_that_are_relevant_to_the_context_c7de.html" title="Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context">Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context</a> warn about this, but they aren't well known.</dd>
<dd>However, probably it could be a good idea a JAWS mode only reading text and not links. Or does it exist but it isn't very useful? (Hey, is that phrase right? Please, feel free to correct any mistake, I'm not a native English speaker and I must learn my faults&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>One idea I had some time ago is to have a new syntax for dates: You now, currently wikilinking to dates is a usual practice because MediaWiki can make formatting changes. However, some dates aren't relevant, and therefore a wikilink is unneeded. I think that a new syntax should be provided to let MediaWiki make formatting changes, but it should be independent to the wikilink syntax. This should reduce overlinking. But much more can be done, I will think about itâ€¦ --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuruena_5a7c.html" title="User:Suruena">surueÃ±a</a> 08:49, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, you can get into a mode where links aren't announced by turning off the virtual buffer (known as the virtual cursor in JAWS). In fact before JAWS 3.31 (around September 1999) there was no virtual cursor and that was the only way to navigate through the internet or any help pages. That method has its advantages; it's easier to navigate well-designed forms and the blind user sees websites the same way as sighted users. However it sometimes reports false information in windows xp and it would confuse most recent <a href="../../../j/a/w/JAWS_%28screen_reader%29_dbb5.html" title="JAWS (screen reader)">JAWS</a> users. Regarding date links, there has been a lot of debate regarding the best way to handle them; I don't mind date links, but I do mind links to solitary years. Would you mind if I moved this conversation to <strong class="selflink">wikipedia talk:accessibility</strong>, to make it more visible? That's what our conversation seems to be about ... <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraham87_fa35.html" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraham87_9542.html" title="User talk:Graham87">talk</a> 09:13, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there a way to mark a link as less important, so JAWS will skip over it in normal reading, perhaps using a rel attribute? If so, this could be built into the automatic date formatter. <i>â€”<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-05-14&#160;20:37&#160;Z</small></i></p>

<dd>No, not that I know of.

<p>Hello, how do you do? I saw that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Accessibility&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=52440517" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Accessibility&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=52440517" rel="nofollow">you think that not every info or series boxes are layout tables</a> (i.e. some of them are data tables), and that's great because I've thinking about it for some time and I believe the opposite, but because I'm not sure I would like to know more opinions.</p>
<p>From my POV all infoboxes I've seen are no data tables. See for example <span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Country_7f76.html" title="Template:Infobox Country">Infobox Country</a>}}</span> or {{Infobox Episode}}. Sometime ago <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:DO-178B&amp;diff=52495050&amp;oldid=52444113" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:DO-178B&amp;diff=52495050&amp;oldid=52444113" rel="nofollow">I believed that those infoboxes were data tables</a>, and therefore they should have row &amp; column headers and a caption for accessibility reasons. Row headers were easy to find, but what about column headers? I can't find them in any infobox. And in series boxes I could't find even row headers. And that's because in my opinion they aren't a 2D data table with raw data like <span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../m/o/s/Template%7EMost_Active_Regional_blocs_3827.html" title="Template:Most Active Regional blocs">Most Active Regional blocs</a>}}</span>, but the cells are only used for layout purposes.</p>
<p>But I would like to disscus it while developing the <a href="../../../a/c/c/Wikipedia%7EAccessibility_9b08.html" title="Wikipedia:Accessibility">Wikipedia:Accessibility</a> policy (really). Am I missing something? Best regards, <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuruena_5a7c.html" title="User:Suruena">surueÃ±a</a> 15:59, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe we should discuss it on the <a href="../../../w/a/i/WP%7EWAI_56c8.html" title="WP:WAI">WP:WAI</a> talk page, because I've no clear definition of "infobox" vs. "layout table" / "data table" / "series box" / "sidebar" and what else.</dd>
<dd>What you or somebody else wrote about "data table" makes sense, if it has caption / summary / row headers / column headers, then it either is or should be a "data table". The opposite should also work, if it merely emulates what <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt> with CSS could do on modern browsers, then it's no evil table layout, but only "visible with any browser" for a value of "any = my" browsers without CSS. I don't use Lynx to read Wikipedia, I only use it to test my own pages.</dd>
<dd>Generally I don like these constructs, see User:Omniplex/ich and <a href="../../../i/p/s/Template%7EIPstack_49a9.html" title="Template:IPstack">IPstack</a>. They start an article with tons of unrelated info crying "don't read what follows, click on of those fine links to other articles". Annoying from my POV, I don't want to wade through dozens of lines before I finally arrive at the real lead section and ToC. But if these obscure boxes work as on <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a> they are fine, with legacy <tt>align="right"</tt> and a decent legacy width, 20% or at most 300, let them float. For a screen reader it should be exactly the same effect, if it's bad with CSS it will be also bad with align and width. But it's a big difference for me with my old browsers. That's one of the details I care about, if there are two ways to get exactly the same effect, excluding cruft like <tt>&lt;font&gt;</tt> tags, then I prefer the solution also working with my browsers. --&#160;<a href="../../../o/m/n/User%7EOmniplex_327d.html" title="User:Omniplex">Omniplex</a> 17:25, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the issue of an article not starting with the lead section (from the POV of non-graphics browsers) should also be addressed by the Accessibility policy (I've some ideas, but they still need more work).</dd>
<dd>But please, do you have an example of a data table used as infobox / navigational box (e.g. <span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../e/u/_/Template%7EEU_2fb7.html" title="Template:EU">EU</a>}}</span>) / series box (<span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistory_of_Spain_b983.html" title="Template:History of Spain">History of Spain</a>}}</span>) / succession box (<span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../s/e/q/Template%7ESequence_9760.html" title="Template:Sequence">sequence</a>}}</span>).

<p>I don't see the point of making the table of contents left or right aligned, nor is it a problem for me. However, I do object to putting the table of contents above the intro, because it breaks the heading structure I (and probably all other users of screen readers) expect. I've made several edits to fix this at prominent articles like <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isotope.html" title="Isotope">Isotope</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker.html" title="Poker">poker</a>, and most recently <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_peace_prize.html" title="Nobel peace prize">nobel peace prize</a>. Is there any reason the intro should ever be below the table of contents - does it look any better visually?

<dd>It's rarely a good idea to use the floating TOCs. There were all sorts of problems at the 3 examples you gave (which i've fixed, by removing all TOC-forcing templates, and rearranging a few images). I think people add them without realizing/testing-for side-effects. The only place they're really needed/non-problematic, is in articles with manymanymany headings, and no/few floating images nearby (floats tend to interfere with one another).</dd>
<dd>I'd strongly agree that the guidelines could use clarifying. I'm not sure what we could change in the section at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Section#Standard_TOC" class="extiw" title="meta:Help:Section">meta:Help:Section#Standard TOC</a>?

<p>If you browse an aticle in Lynx or other non-graphical browser, the [edit] link is always before the section heading. Maybe it would me more logical for these browser just the reverse: after the heading. I'm not sure it's really an improvement, what do you think? A nice feature is that those edit links have a <tt>title</tt> attribute like "Edit section: See also".</p>
<p>Another change related with the edit button has to do with the <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">lead section</a>: it can only be edited editing the full article, and this link in non-graphical browsers is at the bottom of the page. IMHO, the MediaWiki should also provide an [edit] button for the lead section (section 0), as done with the other sections: it will be very useful in non-graphical browsers because it would have more visibility, but also for other users because they will be able to edit only the lead section without editing the full article (very useful for extremely big pages).

<p>I've noticed a number of infoboxes use a technique creating single HTML rows consisting of a number of lines, separated by newlines or BR tags, where each line has a set of labels in a cell on the left and corresponding values in the adjacent cell on the same "physical" line. I'm imagining that this is a particularly difficult arrangement to understand using a screen reader since the intended organization is line-based rather than HTML cell/row based. For example, the current version of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Country_7f76.html" title="Template:Infobox Country">template:Infobox Country</a> which is used for most countries (e.g. <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algeria.html" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>) presents population data in this way. Am I correct that using this technique makes understanding the data in these infoboxes difficult? I have a new version of the country infobox, currently used at <a href="../../../m/j/c/User%7EMJCdetroit_Sandbox_2b32.html" title="User:MJCdetroit/Sandbox">User:MJCdetroit/Sandbox</a>, that makes the separate lines individual HTML rows. There are lots and lots of infobox templates that do this.

<dd>Yes, from my POV you're right, this is an accessibility problem because the contents isn't in sequencial order, as can be seen with the <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/" class="external free" title="http://wave.webaim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://wave.webaim.org/</a> tool.

<p>I've been thinking about layiut tables, and maybe the summary attribute should be used in infoboxes to say "This is an Infobox with basic data about the country", or something like that. It is forbidden by <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines_6ab9.html" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</a> 1.0 and <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag20" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag20" rel="nofollow">2.0</a>, however 2.0 guidelines are in the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2006AprJun/0023.html" class="external text" title="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2006AprJun/0023.html" rel="nofollow">Last Call Draft stage</a>, so comments are welcome (only until tomorrow 2006-05-31).</p>
<p>I suppose the summary attribute is forbidden because this type of secondary content should be tagged using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/mod-role.html#col_Role" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/mod-role.html#col_Role" rel="nofollow">role attribute of the next XHTML 2.0 (<tt>role="note"</tt>)</a>. However, until this better solution is available we should use another technique supported by current browsers. What do you think? PS: Do you know any browser/assistive technology implementing the new features of XHTML 2.0? --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuruena_5a7c.html" title="User:Suruena">surueÃ±a</a> 08:02, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After updating some articles to the accessibility policy I have some doubts regarding JAWS behavior. Some data tables are just after a section header, and therefore adding a caption will be somewhat redundant, I suppose also for users with assistive technologies. See for example <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_25dc.html#Group_F" title="2006 FIFA World Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup#Group F</a>. Are all those structural elements (caption, summary, and row and column headers) needed in JAWS to be read as a data table and not as a layout table? Thanks! --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuruena_5a7c.html" title="User:Suruena">surueÃ±a</a> 07:43, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the caption would be redundant in that case. I think all JAWS needs to recognize a table as a data table is the row and column headers, and that the table has more than one row. I think some restrictions were tightened in JAWS 6.0, but that should be all that is needed. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraham87_fa35.html" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraham87_9542.html" title="User talk:Graham87">talk</a> 08:37, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK, I understand. And what about the summary attribute? Are they well supported in JAWS? What do you think is the best way to write it (what should it contain, a listing of the column headers)? Thanks for your fast reply --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuruena_5a7c.html" title="User:Suruena">surueÃ±a</a> 08:42, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It should contain more information about the purpose of the table, but not too much to be condescending or chatty. It certainly shouldn't have the column or row headers, but keep in mind that it's always read after the caption. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraham87_fa35.html" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraham87_9542.html" title="User talk:Graham87">talk</a> 09:04, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The comments here seem a little bit like they are encouraging people to use inline colour for decoration. While this is useful in some cases, from the point of view of accessibility (and therefore this guideline), it should be discouraged. To give an example, a user (for whatever reason) changes their browser to use blue text on a yellow background and they then try to read a page which has table with lots of blue section headings.

<p>I've proposed a wkipedia wide project to find and eliminate instances within infobox-style templates of the anti-accessible technique of creating multiple visual rows withn a single row by embedding matching HTML breaks in two (or more) adjacent columns in a table, please see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Usability_599e.html#Infobox_accessibility_issue" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Usability">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Usability#Infobox accessibility issue</a>.

<dd>Hello! I'm agree that technique is against accessibility, so I will help in anything I can. It seems we have a lot of work, I propose to start for example searching inside <a href="../../../g/e/o/Category%7EGeography_infobox_templates_4eb1.html" title="Category:Geography infobox templates">Category:Geography infobox templates</a> (e.g. fields "Total" and "Density" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Mexico_City_Borough&amp;oldid=59200326" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Mexico_City_Borough&amp;oldid=59200326" rel="nofollow">Template:Infobox Mexico City Borough</a>). Do you know more potencially bad infoboxes? But I'm also would like to point to another related problems: in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Country&amp;oldid=76142685" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Country&amp;oldid=76142685" rel="nofollow">template:infobox country</a> the flag image and seal image are in one row, but the link to the flag article and seal article are in the next row, so they look alright but when this layout table is read in sequential orden neither the article link to the flag or the seal are next to their respective images (see it for example with <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynx_%28browser%29.html" title="Lynx (browser)">Lynx</a>). But I don't enough HTML to make the needed changes (I suppose the best solution is to embed to more tables). In my opinion we should also address that type of problem when fixing the another technique. --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuruena_5a7c.html" title="User:Suruena">surueÃ±a</a> 22:30, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Starting with the geography infoboxes seems like a good idea to me.

<dd>Am I correct in assuming that this only applies to using HTML break tags to create multiple "rows" within a single one rather than merely using them for visual spacing in two side-by-side cells?

<p>I'm proud to say there are promising advances with respect template {{<a href="../../../c/l/i/Template%7EClick_7c4a.html" title="Template:Click">click</a>}}. As you know, it is an ugly CSS hack with several accessibility, usability, browser-compatibility, and even copyright problems, and it was totally out of control (it was used even in a user signature!). As announced above, the objective of the new project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Usability_Clickable_images_203d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Usability/Clickable images">Wikipedia:WikiProject Usability/Clickable images</a> is to remove this template completely, or at least to use it only when "absolutely necessary" (I'm optimistic, I think it can be completely removed). Similar templates were successfully removed, as you know (Template:Wikisourcesmall, Template:Noclick).</p>
<p>The process is pretty smooth, but some <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Usability_Clickable_images_ea5e.html#Disagreement" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Usability/Clickable images">wikipedians complained about it</a> (in fact very, very few.

As I'm the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Usability_Clickable_images_ea5e.html#Participants" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Usability/Clickable images">only contributor listed in this project</a>, they think it isn't legitime, and clickable images aren't bad if only one wikipedian doesn't like it. I know this isn't true because some of you and other wikipedians have helped me in this issue.</p>
<p>I would like to ask you to join to the project, so it has enough consensus. It doesn't matter if you don't have enough time to contribute, but if you list in it as a participant I would feel enough people support me, and stop the complains (but of course contributions are always welcomed, that will be great).</p>
<p>Of course, any objection to this project is also welcomed. I don't want to waste so much time in something seen unimportant. Please, let me know if you think I'm wrong, thanks!

<p>Participants here may be interested in the following Wikipedia Manual of Style debate: <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#Appending_a_period" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Appending a period</a>. The gist is that MOSNUM currently says to leave the period off of abbreviations of units of measurement, entirely, when this is really only appropriate for some of them, such as <i>mm</i>, <i>km</i>, <i>dB</i>, etc., and is not appropriate for those that are abbreviations of Imperial/American units such as feet, inches, miles, etc., which have traditionally used periods, and do so with the recommendations of the vast majority of style guides. The usability issue can be illustrated with an example: "The rod is 40.6 cm (16 in) in length" (or worse yet, "has 40.6 cm (16 in) sides"; screen readers (at least some of them) are going to say "16 in sides" which will sound like "16 insides". Some of the MOSNUM regulars are strongly resistant to the idea of restoring periods here, and I suspect that only usability/accessibility concerns are going to make a dent with the entrenched view. PS: There are several other debates relating to updating this subsection of the dates and numbers section of MoS, at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#Overhaul_.22Units_of_measurement.22_section" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Overhaul "Units of measurement" section</a> which may be of some usability interest. I fear that the main debate I'm mentioning here is rarely raised because it is shouted down with "This is old news! We don't want to talk about it again!" attitudes (a quick review of that talk page shows several blantant examples of this ignoring of <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a> already); its going to take more than just me to get this fixed, I believe. PS: even from a sighted-user usability vs. accessibility issue, the current MoS-recommended practice is terrible, since English speakers parse the string "in" as a preposition not as an abbreviation for "inch(es)". â€” <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ãƒ„</span> 21:11, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/c/Wikipedia_talk%7EAccessibility_74dd.html" title="Edit section: Consider ending the practice of using accesskeys">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Consider ending the practice of using accesskeys</span></h2>
<p>I would like to suggest that Wikipedia consider ending the practice of using accesskey attributes. Many commentators have suggested that the use of accesskey attributes is beset with problems and actually causes accessibility problems. In my own case, Wikipedia's use of accesskey 'F' prevents me from using the shortcut ALT-F in IE7 to pull down the 'File' menu. Although that problem is arguably caused by a design defect in that particular browser, amongst others, and it has been suggested that the accesskey feature of HTML is inherently problematic as it forces policy onto user agents and is always at risk of denying keyboard users access to certain features of their software, even in the face of attempts by web designers to second-guess UAs and choose key assignments which will cause the fewest conflicts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, since the basic aim behind accesskeys was a worthwhile one even though the HTML accesskey mechanism was poorly designed and over-specified, I would suggest that Wikipedia consider continuing to offer equivalent facilities as a user-selectable option, but just not as the default. Wikipedia already documents various javascript-powered user-customisable usability enhancement mechanisms.</p>
<p>I would also suggest evaluating the use of other navigation-aid techniques, including meta elements such as link rel="", particularly link rel="bookmark".</p>
