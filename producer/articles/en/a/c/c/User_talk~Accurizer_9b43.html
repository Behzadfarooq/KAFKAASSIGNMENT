<p>Hi Accurizer, Many thanks for the message. I understand your concern. However, this argument with Fowler has been persistent, as despite discussions he sneakily inserts GB influences in the India page regardless of other's factually correct contributions. He simply follows local history as is taught in his locality. Whereas global perception and documented history says something else. However, his intentions immediately become clear in his writings! Please advice further... <a href="../../../h/i/m/User%7EHimalayanashoka_9aef.html" title="User:Himalayanashoka">Himalayanashoka</a> 14:52, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Accurizer, Thanks for the advice on my TP. But what do we do with this user. He simply refuses to remove GB influences from his sneaky insertions &amp; local perceptions without an appreciation of how things evolved. He simply fails to understand that India's history &amp; unchanged culture stretches back 3000yrs. No one writes in the Germany page lead that this was a country which murdered 6 million Jews in any poetic way or the main country responsible for both WW (I myself would not do that even though its a fact).</dd>
<dd>I am now just waiting to change back his insertions again with editing in the India page. Pls do update me if there is any other way out to handle this user Fowler&amp;fowler. <a href="../../../h/i/m/User%7EHimalayanashoka_9aef.html" title="User:Himalayanashoka">Himalayanashoka</a> 15:52, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite your 3RR warning, user:Himalayanashoka is indirectly reverting edits but attempting to disguise them in the name of new language etc. He has a long history of vandalism, he was recently blocked for three weeks.

<p>I recently re-posted the article <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiporn.html" title="Wikiporn">Wikiporn</a> because I believe that it is notable and deserves an article. Because I wasn't involved in the previous article and I am not an admin, I have no idea what the original article looked like or why it was deleted initially. I restarted it as a stub with the idea that it could be expanded as a legitimate article that would not need to be deleted. If you have access to the original deletion logs it might help clear things up for me.

<p>Hi, I am writing about the user, <a href="../../../h/i/m/User%7EHimalayanashoka_9aef.html" title="User:Himalayanashoka">Himalayanashoka</a>, who was blocked for 48 hours last night for a 3RR violation as a result of your report (see discussion above). This user has a long history of vandalism and sockpuppetry on the <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> page. Well, this morning I noticed that 3 new users had appeared who seemed to be making the same kind of edits and writing in the same quaint style. These are: <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomzUmrigar_6fce.html" title="User:HomzUmrigar">HomzUmrigar</a> , <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamasundara_Vetrivel_f2be.html" title="User:Shyamasundara Vetrivel">Shyamasundara Vetrivel</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMazharUbaid_c600.html" title="User:MazharUbaid">MazharUbaid</a>. Two of these user pages were created this morning and the third on December 30 (perhaps in anticipation of the battle). They are all making the kind of bold edits that beginners seldom make. Thought I'd let you know. I have also written to admin William Connolly who blocked him last night. <a href="../../../f/o/w/User%7EFowler%26fowler_e6e1.html" title="User:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#B8860B">Fowler&amp;fowler</font></a><a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#708090">«Talk»</font></a> 15:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see... ok, here is my reply.
<ul>
<li>About «<i>Generally speaking, neologisms should be avoided in articles because they may not be well understood,...</i>» I agree that neologisms have to be avoided <b>inside</b> articles, but I did <b>not</b> used a neologism in an article, but I wrote an article about a principle whose name is a neologism.</li>
<li>About «The first is that Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and so articles simply attempting to define a neologism are inappropriate.» I agreee, but my article was not about the neologism itself, but about the principle which is the result of more than 10 years of social fight and that finally was recognized by law in Italy and other European countries, and it is known in USA too.</li>
<li>About «<i>The second reason is that articles on neologisms frequently attempt to track the emergence and use of the term as observed in communities of interest or on the internet...</i>» it is <b>not</b> my case. The neologism was included in the Italian law and it was included since 2005 also in official dictionaries. It is a well recognized term since 2002. 4 years are not few for a <i>new</i> concept.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for explanation. I requested to restore the article AND I added in the article's discussion area a text that explains why it should be restored: Talk:Biparentalness.
<dl>
<dd>Well, I cited a source in article, which is the <i>National Federation for Biparentalness</i>, but please, note that the site is in Italian language. I have other reliable sources, but they are not in English.--<a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejudicibus_5e96.html" title="User:Dejudicibus">Dejudicibus</a> 20:28, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Zero trivia articles were sourced in the Bush trivia section, yet you single out mine. The fact that you think homosexuality is "negative" shows your disgusting right-wing bigotry and bias. You reverted "drink-sodden former Trotskyist poppinjay" with a blatantly obvious lack of knowledge of Christopher Hitchens, as this was a name given to him by George Galloway, and is a valid link to the Hitchens page.

<p>Thanks for your concern over Wikipedia neutrality. A synthesis of persons statements does not make an article "biased". Particularly, what do you call a person who believes state should become before people, who advocate use of torture and forms of government terror? Around here we call those people fascists. Maybe where you come from its not politically acceptable to use the word, but that IS what the word was meant for originally. I hope you will soon understand what neutrality is, and embrace the concept, instead of using Wikipedia for advocating hypocrite politically correct biased view of the world. --<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndurinFreedom_eddc.html" title="User:EndurinFreedom">EndurinFreedom</a> 16:41, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now that I see where you come from your perspective is understandable. But still, Wikipedia neutrality is a much more broad concept than you seem to be able to embrace. If all evidence points to Gonzales being a fascist, why would we call him something else? --<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndurinFreedom_eddc.html" title="User:EndurinFreedom">EndurinFreedom</a> 16:49, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I am referring to article Racak incident. I am 100 % convinced based on what I have read of international and EU sponsored reports that the article is very biased. The article is very pro-Serb and we know that the Serbs committed several massacres during the Yugoslav wars. Dr Helena Rantas reports are being abused and ignored while Serbian report is highlighted and we know that such reports are not reliable. I have made some edits using sources like BBC but all this edits was reverted by Asterion which indeed is hunting me. Once again I ask for your help in making this article more NPOV. I have a lot of facts and I hope you can help me. Thank you very much in advance. Remember that the arbitration comity has not said anything about my edits. --<a href="../../../n/o/a/User%7ENoah30_7da6.html" title="User:Noah30">Noah30</a> 07:58, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your answer, but tell me what I should do. Do you know of anyone that can help me to make the article more NPOV. Even if I am using BBC as a source some of the older users threaten me with blocking.

<dd>Just for the record, I had no involvement with this article before reverting an unexplained removal of content by this user (she may not agree with the text but as far as I am concerned it was verifiable and referenced). I merely reminded her that <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> and related articles are under Wikipedia:Article Probation and that disruptive editors may be banned from articles as per the ArbCom ruling. I do not intend to enforce any block on her myself but nonetheless I am not prepared to be subjected to insults from anyone as those left on my talk page.

<p>Hey, thanks so much for supporting my recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Budgiekiller_df91.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Budgiekiller">RFA</a>. A number of editors considered that I wasn't ready for the mop yet and unfortunately the RFA did not succeed (69/26/11). There are a number of areas which I will be working on (including changing my username) in the next few months in order to allay the fears of those who opposed my election to administrator.</p>
<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you sincerely for your support over the past week. I've been blown away by the level of interest taken in my RFA and appreciate the time and energy dedicated by all the editors who have contributed to it, support, oppose and neutral alike. I hope to bump into you again soon and look forward to serving you and Wikipedia in any way I can.

<p>Sorry I haven't replied sooner, I have been very busy, anyway, the Church teaches that you MUST be baptisted in order to recieve salvation, now how you go about baptism is different, I have taken catechism classes, there are three types of Baptism, Baptism by water, baptism by blood (dyeing for the sake of Jesus [aka martyr]) and baptism of desire (wanting to be baptised by are not able to attain a water bapitism before you die) Without baptism the person will have original sin, the Church teaches you must be baptised in order to wash it away. There are no excptions, in the way it is done yes there are, but go to www.ewtn.com and go to q and a ask if baptism is nessecary, I have asked it and they said it is a misleading thing to believe that baptism is not nessecary.

<p>Hello Accurizer - Thanks for your polite comments about my edits to the History section of the NYC article (under the IP address 69.22.240.119; I'd mistakenly thought I was signed in, so my edits aren't attributed to wv235 as they should be). I did point out in my edit summary that my changes were made in an effort to achieve more concision in that section of the article. Before removing the two sentances discussing detailed historical facts I first verified that they were included in the main daughter article on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_New_York_City_b491.html" title="History of New York City">History of New York City</a>. The challenge in the main NYC article is to strike a balance between brevity and detail and provide a good overview of all dimensions of the subject, New York City. This article, which I edit regularly, tends to accrue many details over time that better belong in the major topical sub-articles. The main article must be kept to a reasonable length. Ocassionally this requires the pruning of secondary issues and moving them to daughter articles. At least one of my deletions referenced in your comment was only recently added and is already discussed in more depth in daughter article. I hope you'd understand the rationale behind my changes. <a href="../../../w/v/2/User%7EWv235_b7f5.html" title="User:Wv235">Wv235</a> 20:01, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm back in action editing on the wiki. I recently came upon Causal dynamical triangulation, another topic with a scant description and the need for more content. This time; I've already reviewed some of the important papers on the subject, and I have a promise of answers to questions and a content review from one of the theory's framers, Jan Ambjorn. There is little chance that someone clever will want to challenge my views on the subject, and I can be useful and informative once again. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathanD_689b.html" title="User:JonathanD">JonathanD</a> 03:43, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
