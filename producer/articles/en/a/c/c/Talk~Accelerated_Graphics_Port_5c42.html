<p>In the section titled `Newer Versions of AGP' it is stated that AGP 4X operating at 133MHz double pumped and 8X at 266MHz double pumped. This is incorrect. All AGP modes run at the same frequency, i.e., 66MHz. In 4X 4 32-bit data words are transferred per clock cycle. In 8X 8 32-bit data words are transferred per clock cycle. Note, it is essentially only the AD and CBE busses that are doing this. The PCI derived control signals are still running at the base 66MHz frequency.</p>
<p>The above can be verified by checking the AGP spec which should be available on Intel's web site.</p>

<p>The article does not mention that AGP followed the footsteps of Vesa Local Bus (VLB) common on 486 era systems, or that it was first introduced on Socket 7 (second gen. Pentium) and Slot 1 motherboards (early Pentium II systems, IIRC), or that OS support was first introduced in Windows 95 and NT 4.0 (I'm guessing here). <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxEnt_fa87.html" title="User:MaxEnt">MaxEnt</a> 01:44, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many AGP 1x cards were merely an existing PCI design reworked to plug into an AGP slot and do not use AGP texturing or any of the other advanced AGP features.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Running NT on a Matrox Mystique I didn't pay attention to that at the time. One angle I would like to see further developed in this article is a sense of technologies introduced into the PC industry and their life story.
<ul>
<li>How long was the PC universe pushing the new technology with no immediate benefit to the end consumer?</li>
<li>Which advanced features ended up making a difference, at what point, under what circumstance?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Another issue which was still big at the time was BIOS level PCI bus enumeration and Plug and Play/Pray factor which was almost beginning to work around the time that AGP came along.
<ul>
<li>Did AGP contribute anything toward cleaning this mess up?</li>
<li>Is there any distinction in the IO port, DMA, or interrupt resources required of an AGP card as opposed to a PCI card?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The material I added was just enough notes and keywords that someone motivated could fill in more of the blanks themselves. AGP is well on its way to becoming a historical footnote. My feeling is that an encyclopaedic treatment should read more like a good history article and less like a dictionary of AGP ratifications (which is excellent material in its own right that I would never remove).</dd>
<dd>The most interesting story to me is how the industry shifted demand to a new design that didn't benefit the end user until the *second* PC they purchased featuring the new technology. When the AGP enhanced video cards finally showed up, did they actually work to their full potential in the AGP systems sold in the first six months after introduction, or did you have to replace your system board at the same time with one designed and tested to work to full potential with the generation of video cards that finally supported the new feature set? From a school of business perspective, the most interesting thing is how often the PC industry managed to get away with selling some new technology to the end user that promised to enable the future that ended up proving incompatible with the promised future when it finally arrived.

<p>I'm getting a little off topic here, but take a look at this: <a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/mbsys/cache/char_Cacheability.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/mbsys/cache/char_Cacheability.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcguide.com/ref/mbsys/cache/char_Cacheability.htm</a></p>
<ul>
<li><i>The amount of RAM that the system can cache is very important if you are going to be using a lot of system memory. Almost all modern fifth generation systems can cache 64 MB of system memory. However, many systems, even newer ones, cannot cache more than 64 MB of memory. Intel's popular 430FX ("Triton I"), 430VX (one of the "Triton II"s, also called "Triton III") and 430TX chipsets, do not cache more than 64 MB of main memory.</i></li>
<li><i>The keys to how much memory your system can cache are first, the design of the chipset, and second, the width of the tag RAM.</i></li>
<li><i>The only mainstream Pentium chipset to support caching over 64 MB is the 430HX "Triton II" chipset by Intel. In actual fact, caching over 64 MB on this chipset is considered "optional"; the motherboard manufacturer has to make sure to use an 11-bit tag RAM instead of the default 8-bit. The extra 3 bits increase cacheability from 64 MB to 512 MB</i></li>
<li><i>Pentium Pro PCs use an integrated level 2 cache that contains the tag RAM within it, so none of this is really a concern for these machines. The Pentium Pro will cache up to 4 GB of main memory, basically anything you can throw at it. The Pentium II uses an SEC daughtercard. It has the same general architecture as the Pentium Pro, but due to a design limitation will "only" cache up to 512 MB.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Around the time that AGP was introduced, the industry was still busy shaving three bits off a tag RAM at a point in time where cheaper memory was by far the most cost effective upgrade for any PC with a graphical desktop. That was the reason I got into the PPro early: fewer cripple bits. People who knew that the early AGP designs didn't help you much ended up buying AGP systems regardless in order to gain other advantages from less crippled chipsets. Some of those Pentium era chipsets (I'm trying very hard not to type cripsets) already had <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Yzerman_a978.html" title="Steve Yzerman">Steve Yzerman</a>'s late career knee cartilage the day they were first introduced. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxEnt_fa87.html" title="User:MaxEnt">MaxEnt</a> 14:14, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Noticed someone just made a correction to the idea that a board could possibly support more than one AGP slot.</p>
<p>This was once debated on the linux-kernel list. The two most informative posts were these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0010.2/0859.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0010.2/0859.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0010.2/0859.html</a></li>

</ul>
<p>It does appear to be true that there are no known boards with more than one AGP port, but it wasn't fully decided whether it was possible to make such a chipset or not (some voices speculated that it is). <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxEnt_fa87.html" title="User:MaxEnt">MaxEnt</a> 15:07, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Samurai board was dual-processor with a seperate <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northbridge_%28computing%29.html" title="Northbridge (computing)">northbridge</a> for each.

<p>If you guys agree (Stonehead, Imroy) I'll add a section "Dual AGP" and dispel various sources of confusion about this term. I first contributed to this article because I was interested in capturing more of the history of the AGP lifecycle and deployment. Micron's largely unsuccessful efforts to use AGP to sell more DRAM is interesting to me from that perspective. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxEnt_fa87.html" title="User:MaxEnt">MaxEnt</a> 17:41, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not an expert on the subject. However, the spec and the definition claim AGP to be a point-to-point channel. As such, it is not a bus (point-to-multipoint). Therefore no motherboard can theoretically support multiple AGP slots. At least, not with one and the same AGP port&#160;:) Any mention of motherboards with support for multiple AGP ports on websites has proven to be an error (and I've seen quite some), which was one of the reasons to make my change in the first place. However, it looks like Imroy is right that it's possible to have several independent AGP ports on one and the same board (I wonder whether that offers any improvements over PCI anyway.) However, I'll leave it up to him. Thanks for your help! Stonehead 21:07, 4 June 2006 (CEST)</dd>

<dd>The 'Hardware and Software Adoption' section should certainly be rewritten into a few paragraphs of text. The list at the end of 'Versions of AGP' could probably also be rewritten into a subsection. That list isn't even introduced - it has no context.

<p>I warned you, this is very nitpicky. This article states that AGP1x is "A 32-bit channel operating at 66 MHz resulting in a maximum data rate of 266 megabytes per second (MB/s)". However, 4 bytes * 66 MHz does not equal 266 MB/s, but rather 264 MB/s. Is the maximum bandwidth actually 264 MB/s, or is the frequency rounded in the article, or is there something I'm missing? (The official spec is very hard to read.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>66 2/3 MHz. 66.666666667 MHz. So, technically, it's 267 MB/s. But, for whatever reason (maybe the typical clock fluctuation) it is stated as 266 MHz. --<a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwaaye_95d7.html" title="User:Swaaye">Swaaye</a> 04:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, since AGP = Accelerated Graphics <b>Port</b>, it is not a Bus like PCI so the phrase "AGP bus" all over the article is basically wrong. Why does it matter? Because acceleration was one of the reasons for moving from bus (shared resource among many devices) to port (dedicated point-to-point connection between graphic card and the CPU).

<dd>True, but it's regularly referred to as the 'AGP Bus', so not referring it to that way is probably more confusing&#160;:). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 02:36, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
