<p>I recall reading a short article about a year ago announcing that Stephen Hawking had retracted his assertions of belief in the theory of black holes. He had done some work to reexamine the correctness of his math, and came to the realization that it wasn't necessarily true that the phenomenon we call a black hole constituted a space-time singularity. I'll try to dig up the article... <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinite.ki_05f6.html" title="User:Infinite.ki">Infinite.ki</a> 00:05, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are mistaken. His recent work was involved with the problem of unitarity with the formation / destruction of black holes, not whether black holes as a class of objects exist or not. (Although his proof involves the fact that an observer far enough away cannot know for certain if a given black hole exists at a given location.) Anyway, accretion disks can form around neutron stars, white dwarfs, in T-tauri stars and even in the formation of a planet - so whether or not black holes exist isn't really important for this particular article. <a href="../../../s/f/u/User%7ESfuerst_faaf.html" title="User:Sfuerst">Sfuerst</a></p>
<p>I think the spelling should be changed to 'disk', though, in all references. In my experience as a trained astronomer, and as a native american english speaker, the only time the spelling 'disc' is preferred is for 'compact disc'. I cannot recall seeing 'accretion disk', 'galactic disk', 'protoplanetary disk', etc spelled any other way, in american publications. Probably happens, but certainly in the minority. Any agreement to change the name? <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrrhlin_ef5f.html" title="User:Myrrhlin">Myrrhlin</a></p>
<p>"Accretion disk" is much more common than "Accretion disc" in the scientific literature, even though technically the word "disc" is more correct. Changing it to the more common form would probably be a good idea. <a href="../../../s/f/u/User%7ESfuerst_faaf.html" title="User:Sfuerst">Sfuerst</a> 20:22, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would be against changing to disk. Normally in the UK we use disc for accretion discs and it provides a useful distinction when writing because we tend to use disk for computer disks. This is in fact the the convention in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. <a href="../../../o/m/m/User%7EOmm3_99d1.html" title="User:Omm3">Owen</a> 13:32, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason I changed 'protoplanetary disk' to 'nova' is that there is an accretion process going on in a protoplanetary disk which has nothing to do with accretion disks. While there _may_ continue to be accretion of H/He gas onto the protostar, this is (I would argue) not the 'accretion' one would usually be talking about in the protoplanetary disk. Use of the term 'accretion disk' to describe a protoplanetary disk leads to confusion. Please see my comments on the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_nebula.html" title="Solar nebula">solar nebula</a>.</p>

<dd>

<dd>Actually, this isn't true, you can still treat the protoplanetary disk with an alpha-disk model. There has been recent research into the formation of gas-giant cores in disks where the MRI causes \alpha to act like a step-function with radius. (They are trying to explain why some planets migrate into the star, and others don't.) However, you are right once ogliarchic mergers start to happen - but then the disk is pretty much gone anyway. <a href="../../../s/f/u/User%7ESfuerst_faaf.html" title="User:Sfuerst">Sfuerst</a> 19:59, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have heard of these models, but my impression was they are still quite new, and dont have a lot of support among the researchers. Also, are they not specifically for gas giants? Accretion of dust particles in the traditional model is still required for terrestrial planets, isn't it? In any case, I still maintain that use of the term 'accretion disk' leads to confusion in the discussion of accretion in protoplanetary disks, because when I teach this (and I do), I am talking about accretion of solidified particles out of the gas, not accretion of gas onto the protostar or onto a jovian protoplanet (which probably has its own accretion disk). I am not arguing against alternative models. I am arguing for article clarity. It's okay to keep the term in this context, but some explanation to avoid this easy confusion makes the article better. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrrhlin_ef5f.html" title="User:Myrrhlin">Myrrhlin</a> 14:01, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, you reverted away the other edits I made, which may have needed some polishing, but added more information about accretion disks in close binaries with stellar remnants. I also had a sentence specifically addressing the possible confusion over the term accretion when referring to protoplanetary disks. Any comment why you removed these changes by reversion, instead of incorporating them? You marked your edit as minor. perhaps you did not notice those other changes? <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrrhlin_ef5f.html" title="User:Myrrhlin">Myrrhlin</a> 04:40, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The main problem with the second paragraph is the confusion introduced about the "size" of the companion - it was difficult to determine whether the paragraph was using mass or radius. (Astronomically, the object that is accreting is typically refered to as the 'primary' if it has more mass, yet you were calling it the "lesser companion".) Note that the more massive companion is often physically smaller in radius than the less massive companion... however this is not always the case. For example NS-NS binaries are thought to form in a process where both stars accrete mass from the other as they each go through the red-giant stage in turn. Since the more massive star reaches the red giant branch first, it will then give mass to the less massive star which is still on the main sequence. Also, you mention the size (radius) of the primary as being important for whether or not a disk is formed... however, often the strength of the magnetic field of the primary is much more important, especially in the case of white dwarfs. <a href="../../../s/f/u/User%7ESfuerst_faaf.html" title="User:Sfuerst">Sfuerst</a> 19:59, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I happily admit the dynamics of these systems is something I never studied. Yes, i was quite vague about the size of a stellar remnant companion, because I wanted to add information for a reader but I didnt want to write a lot (it takes a lot of time to do a good job!). What I meant by 'size' was a combination of mass and physical extent, because that's what determines the actual gravitational equipotential surfaces, the saddle point between the two bodies. If larger (radius) companion overfills its roche lobe (that saddle point determined by the mass of the smaller companion), and is still not in contact with the smaller (radius) companion, then that seems likely to form an accretion disk. That's what I was trying to put into few words, somewhat vaguely. But I agree that ignoring the magnetic fields probably leads to an unrealistic model. As you seem to be more familiar with modeling these systems, please write a better explanation! <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrrhlin_ef5f.html" title="User:Myrrhlin">Myrrhlin</a> 14:01, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Both of these issues lead me to really question more generally what the tone and direction of scientific articles should take. Should it represent current "traditional" scientific thinking, or a broader spectrum of ideas including largely untested or even unlikely (but still "possible") explanations? In the solar nebula article i edited, there was already a reference to a theory i'd never heard of, which i guess was placed there by a proponent (or perhaps even THE proponent). If a model has little support by the relevant scientific community, should it be included, without a discussion of why it is not accepted as credible? I left it there, not being one to censor anything, and not knowing enough to write anything about problems with it. To be balanced, an article should allow mention of any crackpot theory, but only when a discussion of its failings is also present. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrrhlin_ef5f.html" title="User:Myrrhlin">Myrrhlin</a> 14:01, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This Accretion Disk page says that quasars "can convert about 10 percent of the mass of an object into energy as compared to around 0.5 percent for nuclear fusion processes." However, the quasar page states that quasars "can convert about half of the mass of an object into energy as compared to a few percent for nuclear fusion processes."</p>
<p>The wording of both sentences is identical, just the numbers have changed. One of these has to be wrong, no? I am in no position to say which, but maybe someone smarter than I can clear this up? Patbert 05:48, 9 January 2007 (UTC) patbert</p>
