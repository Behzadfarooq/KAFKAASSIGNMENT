<dd>I'm from the U.S., and I've never heard of the word "accountancy" until I saw this article.

<p>Having lived in Ireland and England, I can confirm that "accountancy" is in widespread and accepted use in the UK and Éire. I thus think this RfC is another incarnation of ye ole "Britspeak vs. Yankspeak" issue. I would <i>personally</i> MUCH prefer "accountancy", because to a British English speaker it carries a more professional connotation. However, I am biased pro-Britspeak and there is little merit in perpetuating this never-ending war of the words. I say either let's go with whatever notation the article first was written in, as Benc noted, or write separate but linked accountancy/accounting articles about the respective British/US practices/professions. <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopers_35d3.html" title="User:Ropers">Ropers</a> 00:05, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Accountancy</i> is the underlying theory, while <i>accounting</i> is the practice. I graduated from the Department of <i>Accountancy</i> at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign_5af2.html" title="University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, nationally recognized as top tier school. However, I took many courses in <i>accounting</i>. These were courses in practical application, while courses in <i>accountancy</i> were in theory. This is the generally agreed upon distinction within academia. However, there remains a debate over the issue of <i>accountancy</i> vs. <i>accounting</i>. I doubt we can settle it on this talk page.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. This seems to be a case of British English vs American English. I haven't heard of the term "Accountancy" but if I'm to assume the page is correct, accountancy is the british word, learn something new everyday! In that case, I'm leaning toward oppose, but I'll wait to see any other comments before I decide for sure. For a lot these of cases it'd be nice if articles could actually exist at two names instead of having a redirect (but look and be functionally identical, when editing it would note that you're editing all the articles under that title.) --<a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESketchee_ce7e.html" title="User:Sketchee">Sketchee</a> 22:55, Jan 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> They're synonyms, however the difference is nuanced. Accountancy: <i>the occupation of maintaining and auditing records and preparing financial reports for a business.</i> Accounting: <i>The bookkeeping methods involved in making a financial record of business transactions and in the preparation of statements concerning the assets, liabilities, and operating results of a business.</i> (i.e. a "method of accounting" or an "accounting system") It isn't a matter of British English vs. American English as was erroneously assumed by the author of the article, because <i>accountancy</i> appears in both British and American speech. It is just that <i>accountancy</i> is more archaic as the vogue of modern speech is using the gerund form to discuss activities or occupations i.e. accounting, or knitting (which used to be <i>knittery</i> until it was dropped out of the dictionary). As such, "accounting" has become used more and more as the name of the profession. Traditionally, professions ending in <i>-ant</i> like <i>accountant</i> (or an adjective like <i>bouyant</i>) were connected with disciplines ending in <i>-ancy</i> like <i>accountancy</i> (or <i>bouyancy</i>) chiefly because the suffix <i>-ant</i> meaning <i>One that performs, promotes, or causes a specified action</i> (as a noun) or <i>Performing, promoting, or causing a specified action</i> (as an adjective) because it derives from the Middle English (particularly the French influence) present participle forms of the verb <i>are</i>. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 00:13, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support.</b> First, the distinction does not exist in US English, as far as I have ever observed. The trade and the practice are both called ‘accounting’. (ExplorerCDT is arguing that we should put an article under an <i>archaic</i> term?) Second, the article is more about the practice than the trade, so even under the British/archaic distinction, this is an article about accounting, with accountancy as a subtopic. That is the way it should be: the practice is the primary topic. If we were starting from scratch, we would not define ‘accounting’ as “what accountants do” and then refer readers to ‘accountancy’. We would define ‘accountant’ as “practitioner of accounting” and then refer readers to ‘accounting’. Cooking is not “what cooks do”, and sewing is not “what tailors do”. Cooks and tailors are doing professionally something that the rest of us can do in small ways all the time. Accounting is the more general topic and this article is general, so the redirect is <i>absolutely</i> going the wrong way. — <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFord_8534.html" title="User:Ford">Ford</a> 11:49, 2005 Jan 31 (UTC)

<li>I'm so far neutral (<i>though leaning to oppose the proposed move</i>), because it's either we use a correct term (<i>accountancy</i>) of increasingly archaic usage, or an incorrect term (<i>accounting</i>) just because it's popular and increasingly prevalent. What's the old phrase of Woodrow Wilson? Something paraphrased about how what's right is not always popular, what's popular is not always right. There should—rather than redirect either to the other—be two separate articles.—<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 03:43, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. This isn't a British versus American, thing, and there is a concrete difference between the terms. Wiktionary might not be good enough to know the difference between the two, and instead think that this is an American/British thing. But the AHD is, and does. (I'm deliberately citing an American dictionary, to make the point more forcefully.) "accountancy" is an occupation; "accounting" is a method. The two are not even synonymous. An "account" can be a narrative or a record of events, and "accounting", as in "making an account of", can have nothing to do with "accountancy". <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:30, 2005 Jan 31 (UTC)</li>

<p>The first paragraph of the history section (which I really like and know little about) starts off with "The art of accountancy on a scientific principle ..." This really bothers me.

<p>I don't agree that accounting is a science at all, better to stick with calling it an art. The technology associated with book keeping has not changed since Pacioli. Accounting is an assemblage of rules to deal with modern complexities (and is a compromise to keep the tax man mostly happy and to keep CEO's mostly out of jail).</p>
<p>I changed this wording before discovering these comments. I agree art and science do not mesh well; my objection related to the use of "science," which indicates an empirical basis versus a logical basis (thus mathematics). --<a href="../../../e/m/u/User%7EEMU_CPA_e3f1.html" title="User:EMU CPA">EMU CPA</a> 19:57, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While it is true (as stated) that the big four trace their history back to Europe (especially since Arthur Andersen is no longer with us), I think that overstates the case.</p>
<p>Pricewaterhouse and Coopers are two firms which merged just recently, so stating that <b>it</b> was formed in England is incorrect. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu also traces its history to Japan. I don't know if both Touche Ross and Deloitte came from England. Ernst &amp; Young wasn't founded by a Scottish accountant since this firm was also the result of a merger of two well established firms.</p>
<p>I think this section, assuming we want to keep it here and not on a separate page, should indicate where all of the multi-national firms came from, and how they all grew through international mergers. A nice flow chart history of the mergers would be pretty.</p>
<p>The other option would be to pull this section and just refer to a seperate page on the Big Four.--<a href="../../../f/c/o/User%7EFcoulter_2835.html" title="User:Fcoulter">Fredrik Coulter</a> 00:43, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have deleted the following section as I dispute its accuracy:</dd>
<dd>"The Big 4 accountancy firms can all trace their history back to firms in Europe, from which they have descended through a long line of mergers. Many of the originating firms were from the United Kingdom. As British trade interests expanded, correspondent firms were established throughout the world by the organisations."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Big 4 are a mixture of international merged firms. Of those whose names remain in the firms, Ernst, Young and Marshall (M in KPMG) set up practices in USA and Tohmatsu was Japanese. Only PwC's main constituents were entirely founded in the UK.</dd>

<p>There was a mystery character in UK accounting history - someone by the last name of Edwards (partnered with Price, Coopers Brothers articled with him, Touche was the exception who has done work on his own. Forerunners of Ernst and Whinny have changed their names since very early on but Waterhouse appeared to have articled under them for a few years, then the Arthur Andersen himself also work briefly under Price Waterhouse and Company US office. virtually all forerunners of big 4 today are more or less were related in the same circle.</p>
<p>The modern accounting / accountancy history was so colourful it may worth a page of its own.</p>

<p>Is "accounting" a profession? To "profess" a thought is to go out into the world as an individual and express your own ideas and opinions - you are then open to scrutiny as an individual in the world based on the results of the implementation your own ideas and opinions. Firstly, perhaps only 5% of accountants actually have this luxury in the real world of corporations and large practices; current organisational hierarchies simply do not accomodate professional behaviour in its true aspect. Secondly, the societal view of those few accountants that actually personally and individually profess, is seriously degraded due to recent ineptitudes such as Enron's balance sheet. Thirdly, the majority of the work done by the majority of "accountants" requires less skill than a mediocre high school student. In a real, today's world, modern office, practical look at the "profession" of accounting, they seem to have very little to "profess". Simply knowing how to set up a link on an Excel spreadsheet seems an especially cheap definition of a modern professional. The pretense of simply accepting accounting as a profession because of the historic analogy has to be dropped until we can accomodate its actual influence, and moreover those of its individual members as individuals, in a true objective professional light.</p>
<p><br />
Whoever wrote this either thinks the entire world has an IQ &gt; 150 or has obviously never taken any professional accounting exams, at least not in the UK anyway. I agree it may not really be a profession except for those are practically law experts (tax gods etc) but I wouldnt hardly say "the majority of the work done by the majority of "accountants" requires less skill than a mediocre high school student". As regards to the depth of the work involved thats why theres different job titles i.e. accounts clerk/accounts assistant/accounting technican/assistant accountant/accountant/financial controller etc etc at least in the UK anyway.--lincs_geezer 03:56, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course it's a profession. Picking apart the word "profession" is not a good way of determining what is and isn't one. Word meanings change over time.. I hope you are never in a situation where you have to take apart "inflammable" to figure out what it means. I don't know how it is in the UK, but CPA's in America do not spend their time dicking around in Excel (they bill far too much per hour to be doing routine work). <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 19:30, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The argument is falacious from the beginning. Accounting is a profession for two reasons:</p>
<p>1. It has its own body of specialized knowledge and standards (GAAP, GAAS, etc.). 2. Accountants are recognized as such not only by themselves, but by outside authorities, like governments and legal authorities.</p>
<p>Accountants as a group practice many forms of the profession:</p>
<p>1. Certified Public or Chartered Accountants (CPS's) are accountants who audit, review or compile financial statements and profess an opinion on their fairness. This is considered the purest and highest form of the profession by many and is universally recognized as a position of trust (not withstanding Enron and Wroldcom). 2. Managerial Accounants (Certified Managerial Accountants or CMA's) practice accounting within organizations for the most part and provide decision support and analysis to management. They also prepare the statements audited by the CPA's. These are members of the management team and spend a lot of their time managing not only numbers, but people and resources as well. Other forms of this include Internal Auditors. 3. Forensic Accountants (often also CPA's and/or CMA'Sas well) do internal auditing inside companies or other organizations (usually large ones). 4. Academic Accountants are instructors at colleges and universities and form and ivory tower of the profession.</p>
<p>I have been and am three of these at one time, a CPA, CMA and I teach accounting and management part time. Accounting is certainly a profession; I have been doing it for 23 years and I do a little more than set up links in spreadsheets. Knowing where, how and why do put the numbers in the spreadsheets, develop complex models of cost behavior, make judgements about materiality, relevance and other issues are all part of the job, not to mention managing a department, advising the governing body and management and interfacing with banks, governmental agencies and other organization make up my day. No, beginning accountants mostly do not do these things, as they are learning the basics, but once you have been doing this as long as I have you are a professional.</p>

<p>The general tone of the above suggests that most of the contributors, whether they be participating in whatever it is or be looking at it from a distance seem to see some level of 'bean counting'. I would like to suggest that a real Accountant sees himself as something much more.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the story about the company needing an accountant. The three finalists were given the same question: What is 2 + 2. The first said "eveyone knows that it is 4" and was dismissed. The second said "I think it is 4, but I would like to use a calculator to make sure" and he also was dismissed. The third responded "You would be amazed at how many think it is 4. Tell me, What did you have in mind?". He was hired on the spot.</p>
<p>This story will be thought of as a joke by those who have not looked at the purpose for hiring an accountant. To believe that everyone who looks at the same thing will see and understand it the same way, is to believe something other than the truth. It is this writers current belief that accountants, whether they are on a company payroll or hold themselves out as consultants are basically advocates for those who pay them, possibly even more so than are attorneys. I am an accountant who does mostly tax work. When a client asks me to prepare a financial statement, the first thing I ask them is "what are you going to use it for". IMO an accountant that would not ask that question is not going to be delivering what is being ordered. To allow this to happen IMO would constitute malpractice, especially since at least some of the clients are not aware of what can be done with a set of numbers and are therefore can be misrepresented without their knowledge. While it is true that some people who hold themselves out as accountants do not realize this, it is my belief that those who are experienced and have considered their real responsibility will be aware of this.</p>

<dd>I agree with your statements. In the U.S. a simple compilation that you refered to above would require an accountant to adhere to SSARS set forth by the AICPA. You don't go to school for 5 years and take 14 hours of professional tests to count, you go to school for five years and become a CPA to become a professional.--<a href="../../../h/2E/a/User%7EH.al-shawaf_9241.html" title="User:H.al-shawaf">H.al-shawaf</a> 00:38, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is so much diversity in the practice of the profession, as I have come to understand. Now that I am in the private sector and working exclusively for a group of companies, I now have the chance to view Accounting in another perspective, with the issue of financial statement reporting and confidentiality. While tax reports and its practice is a separate and distinct part of being an Accountant, the issue of "what are you going to use it for" also applies to what I am doing right now.</dd>

<dd>Some may only be 'counting the beans' and may consider it as a 'job', but its like saying there is nothing beneath the tip of an iceberg. As a profession, there is a variety of specialization for Accountants to get involved with. Many have come to realize this issue and is now taking advantage of what they can offer in terms of services to various parties. <a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModelwatcher_31d7.html" title="User:Modelwatcher">Modelwatcher</a> 08:12, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><small>RECENT EVENTS</small></p>
<p><small>Since 2002, the global step of reduction of costs and optimization of resources became a legal constraint, an obligation for all the highly-rated corporations or unquoted in the stock exchange.</small></p>
<p><small>Everything began with the law SARBANNES-OXLEY in the United States in 2002 who returned compulsory internal control. From 2003, Canada and European Economic Community took measures aiming at identical objectives:</small></p>
<p><small>1- The realization and optimization of the operations of reduction of costs and management of the performance;</small></p>
<p><small>2- The reliability of the financial information of costs and performances;</small></p>
<p><small>3- Correspondence to laws and to current regulations, notably standards of management of the quality;</small></p>
<p><small>4- The implementation of the rules of good governance “to play collective”&#160;:</small></p>
<p><small>-Every individual member of the company contributes to his level of responsibility in the internal control;</small></p>
<p><small>-The responsibilities of the staff of frame vary according to hierarchical levels;</small></p>
<p><small>- The general manager assures ultimate responsibility; he is responsible for the system of internal control;</small></p>
<p><small>-The directors of the various units are responsible for the internal control bound to the objectives of this one;</small></p>
<p><small>-The financial executives and their teams play a role of dominating piloting: they follow and analyze performances, by report not only in objectives bound to financial information, but also to those bound to the operations of the company and to the legal obligations.</small></p>
<p><small>These measures which impose the internal coherence as base of the management put company in front of a major technological challenge: the integration of their system of internal control.</small></p>
<p><small>Internal control directed towards “realization and optimization of the operations of reduction of costs and management of the performance" gets organized indeed around the notion of inductors of costs, the unforeseen phenomenon, the abnormality or the dysfunction which provokes an increase of costs. By opposition the inductor of activity is the event which activates the activity of the company.</small></p>
<p><small>To understand difficulty recovering, it is necessary remember yourself that the most known methods of management arise from the cost accounting which depends on the financial accounting itself. So very wide-spread methods such as the ABC (ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING), the ABM (ACTIVITY-BASED MANAGEMENT), “Cost killer””, etc., rest on the inductor of activity and not on the inductor of costs.</small></p>
<p><small>It is only very recently that multi-field searches in management drove to the normalization of the inductor of costs and to its standardization through the new technologies of information and the communication.</small></p>

<p>It would seem alright to include a short comparison of Managerial and Financial accounting here. However, these 2 subjects are very broad and many accountants practice either Managerial or Financial and seldom is the case when both are given the task to practice both.</p>
<p>With more than 2 years experience working for PWC, in the field of audit and later under management consultancy, I cannot emphasize how different both of these accounting fields are.</p>

<p>Why doesn't accounting have a wikiproject? I mean, it's a large study field, it has numerous articles and categories, and most articles NEED A LOT OF WORK. Maybe we can improve them by inviting all wikipedians who are accountants, auditors, or any other related profession into an organized project.

<p>This article mixes the processes and methods of accountancy (or accounting) with the profession or occupation of accountant and with the typical terms for businesses that do accountancy (or accounting). In the U.S., an accountant works for an accounting firm and does accounting. In the U.K., an accountant works for an accountancy (or accountancy firm) and does accountancy. Some U.S. schools award degrees for accounting, some award degrees for accountancy. U.K. schools award degrees for accountancy. The person doing this sort of work is always called an accountant, never an accountancy. I think the uses of the terms should be made explicit in the article, because the way the article reads, it's extremely confusing and mixes topics. --<a href="../../../s/u/e/User%7ESueHay_9b16.html" title="User:SueHay">SueHay</a> 13:30, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
