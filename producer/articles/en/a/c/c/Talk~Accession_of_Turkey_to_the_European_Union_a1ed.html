<p>"Turkey also stresses its involvement in European history for about 1000 years, through the Ottoman Empire and as the seat of the Eastern Roman Empire. It considers itself a European state. A prevalent point of view in Turkey, echoed by its prime minister Erdoğan, is that the EU seems to be a "Christian club", although the foundation of the European Union never claimed to be on religious grounds. However, this argument appears less strong than the previous ones. Many EU-citizens regard this reasoning as suspicious."</p>
<p>What is suspicious? The Christian club claim or Turkeys involvement in Eruo history. This is ambiguous and needs redoing. <a href="../../../d/r/d/User%7EDrDisco_2351.html" title="User:DrDisco">Disco</a> 12:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This 'Christian Club' notion is hardly reserved to Turkey - international observers and indeed European politicians themselves have expressed the opinion that it is, or in the case of the latter, that it should be. Given how almost every article and debate regarding this topic explicitly mentions Turkey's Muslim character as an important factor, it would be fair to say that 'Christian Club' is diplomatic speak for 'Do Not Want A Muslim Country Club'. This is often countered with the observation that Bosnia will probably be a member one day. It could be argued in turn that this is because a country of Bosnia's circumstances will have very little influence, but this would be POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article uses a quote from Giscard d’Estaing mentioning that Turkey would be the end of Europe - it was at this time he coined the phrase 'Christian Club' when talking why Turkey should not join, and there is much by way of commentary to suggest this is a prevalent view in Europe. It is not a notion of Turkey's invent, as the paragraph would lead one to believe. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_212.175.240.82_3c77.html" title="Special:Contributions/212.175.240.82">212.175.240.82</a> (talk) 08:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

My ISP is dynamic, I have no choice when I turn off my computer. *rolls eyes* You began by blanking my edits; I inadvertantly removed your edit, my apologies. I wonder if you are able to give an apology. Nonetheless, you began this by blanking my edits, that is clearly vandalism. Gadaffi is a major International figure who had an interview with the Italian media. This is arguably very relevant, even if you as a Turk may not want to hear it.

Giscard d'Estaing's quote is included because he happens to be European. Gaddafi is a joke, and there is no point in his quote being included. This is not a question of being a Turk or not, so cut down on the paranoia.

<dd>From an Australian point of view (can I claim to be neutral here?) Gaddafi's quite had no place in the article. Although I am uncomfortable with the idea that it is only because he is non european non turk. The reason his quote had no place was because he was using the EU-Turk debate for other political means. Turks or EU can be quoted because their opinion is relevant. Non-Turk-non-EU personalities can be quoted, but only if they specifically bring something to the debate. At least, that is how I see it. <a href="../../../d/r/d/User%7EDrDisco_2351.html" title="User:DrDisco">Disco</a> 11:22, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it is not for us to say that Gaddafi's quote has or hasn't a place in this article. I saw that the user properly referenced the quote and it is an opinion on Turkey EU accession, like it or not. Also, this idea that only European and Turkish opinions can be included is one of the more ridiculous ideas I've heard yet on Wikipedia. I will re-add the quote unless someone finds a citation that says the quote was not made, or there is a consensus on removing the quote. Valid edits can't just be blanked because another editor disagrees with the <i>opinion</i>. regards. 192.45.72.26 00:26, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why revert any explicit mention of Turkey’s military presence in Cyprus in the “Arguments used against Turkish membership” section? As stated, one country’s nonrecognition of another poses a logical barrier to political confederation between the two. The military occupation of one such nation by the other poses similar barriers of comparable gravity. In this case, an entity called “Republic of Cyprus,” whether legitimate or not, is an EU member State in the estimation of both itself, inasmuch as it exists, and the EU. The Republic of Cyprus claims that over a third of its territory has been occupied by the military forces of Turkey. Turkey’s military investment in Cyprus is maintained to prevent certain people on the other side of the line, who call themselves “The Republic of Cyprus,” from coming over and taking back the whole island, which they claim is their territory. The UN has sponsored a ceasefire, but no peace treaty has yet settled the dispute. As in similar situations (e.g., Korea) this is often perceived as a technical state of war. Despite this awkward circumstance, Turkey seeks to become an EU member State too. Despite talks, Turkey has stated it will not remove its military forces from the island of Cyprus. This issue poses a salient barrier to the proposed confederation of Turkey with the “Republic of Cyprus”—one that goes one major step beyond simple nonrecognition of the latter state by the former. 66.24.243.60 12:12, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In any case, this article will be rewritten in two-three weeks, so I wouldn't worry too much about its mess at the moment. Btw, the problem with Cyprus (at the moment) is not Turkey's non-recognition of it, but rather Turkey's refusal to open its ports to Greek Cypriot traffic.

<p>I think that the reference to the Republic of Cyprus as "located in the South" is inaccurate. In fact, the Republic of Cyprus encompasses the whole island (as supported by Wikipedia's article on Cyprus). However, the island is occupied in the north.

<dd>Not relevant, the only problem in TR-EU relations is, at the moment, Turkey's refusal to open its ports to Cypriot Greek traffic. This RfC is irrelevant to this article, this dispute is for Cyprus related pages. If you ever find a European Commision official source asking Turkey to recognize Cyprus, then we can think about it. In any case, I don't understand what the rush is, this article needs to be completely rewritten in any case. So just chill... Whatever the version, they will be both deleted or merged to the point of non-recognition in an eventual re-write. As I said, this article is about TR-EU accession, not the Cyprus dispute. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 09:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I strongly disagree that the traffic issue is the only problem. Turkey's occupation and non-recognition of the Republic are two high-profile barriers to TR-EU accession. Therefore, the RfC is relevant. The article needs to have its basic geopolitical facts correct. If you are so chilled, let me make the change without overriding it.

<dd>Well, if you find me an official European Comission demand for Turkey to recognize Cyprus, feel free to share it. The only issue in EU-TR accession is the ports issue at the moment. The resolution of the Cyprus dispute concerns fundamentally UN, not the EU. In any case, the bogus RfC that you called for is about the wording of one sentence. RfCs are not called that easily, it has been only one day since you put up your first post. Please learn how the wikiprocess works, RfCs are not called for one day after the statement of a user; they are called for after long disputes that have lasted for a long time. Nothing will happen, don't worry. This article will be rewritten in any case. You are beating a dead horse here I am afraid.

<dd>Your contentions about the "only issue in EU-TR accession" is just your opinion. You shouldn't deny the rest of us making contributions that we feel are relevant and important. The RfC indeed is about the wording of one sentence, but it is a fundamental point for many people. If you think this change is so minimal, why don't you let it through?

<li>According to [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia:Cyprus</a>], the <b>Republic of Cyprus</b> is divided into 6 districts: Famagusta (Gazimağusa), Kyrenia (Girne), Larnaca (Larnaka), Limassol (Leymosun), Nicosia (Lefkoşa) and Paphos (Baf). These districts span the island of Cyprus (except the UK Sovereign Base Areas). Therefore, the claim that the Republic of Cyprus is "located in the South" is factually incorrect. I suggest that it is also inflammatory. For both reasons, the statement can not remain in its current form. Courtesy of Dhavlos, I have proposed the following re-write: "Turkey refuses to acknowledge the Republic of Cyprus (an EU member) as the sole authority on the island, but instead recognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the north". I think that’s as objective as possible. Silo7 07:56, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article is still like some wild zombie, I ran across only one or two articles in worse state in Wikipedia than this one.lol There is so much irrelevant information and tidbits that have nothing to do with the title - It doesn't mention even one piece of useful information about the current <i>general</i> state of accession, let alone the specific negotiations on chapters etc. The structure "for" and "against" is nothing but an invitation to edit-war, really..

Things that are not in the TR-EU accession protocole shouldn't be in here: bilateral relations of Turkey with other countries should be in their respective articles, and only their repurcussions on the accession should be mentioned. Please do not add random stuff like "all Europe will be Islamized by the end of the century" or "Greeks are persuing the Megali Idea" - it is more than simple trolling: none of these have much to do with this article... <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 07:07, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Probably just saying "the whole accession idea is but a joke" would be closer to the truth but it would not be encyclopedic, either&#160;:-) <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 10:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nhahaha&#160;:) As is, we might as well rename the article to "Opinions about the accession of Tr to Eu"! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 07:21, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
