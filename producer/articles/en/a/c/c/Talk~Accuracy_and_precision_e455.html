<p>I don't see any references to GRR (Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility), which is an efficient method of quantifying precision error. I'd like to start an article on that, does anyone oppose to this suggestion? tks. <a href="../../../m/l/o/User%7EMlonguin_16f4.html" title="User:Mlonguin">Mlonguin</a> 16:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This only works in the case that you have many samples. More generally accuracy describes how closely to the truth something is, and precision describes how closely you measure or describe something. <a href="../../../n/r/o/User%7ENroose_706d.html" title="User:Nroose">Nroose</a> 18:30, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I don't like how precision is defined in the article as <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repeatability.html" title="Repeatability">repeatability</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repeatability.html" title="Repeatability">Repeatability</a> is closer to the idea of reliability. In the texts and sites that I've read, precision is defined in terms of the smallest increments of the number scale shown on (or by) the measuring device. So, a ruler whose smallest increments are mm allows the user to report measurements to that level of precision. I think the article is using the term for when the measuring "device" is the act of collecting a set of data that yields a statistical result. Reading down to the bottom of the article, I do find the more conventional usage of the term <i>precision</i> described after all. It would be good to find this usage mentioned at the top of the article. Also, the term <i>valid</i> used early in the article isn't necessarily the same as the familiar idea of <i>validity</i> in the social sciences. (In those disciplines, the concepts of <i>reliability</i> and <i>validity</i> are discussed in texts, with many subtypes of each.)</p>

<p>That values *average* close to the true value doesn't make those individual values accurate. It makes their *average* an accurate estimate of the true value, but that is not the same thing. If a meteorologist gets the temperature forecast wrong by +20 degrees one day, and -20 degrees the next, we don't say he's accurate because the average is right. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 02:05, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well....I guess we need to be clear here. Is accuracy a property of an individual measurement, or of a population of measurements? Obviously you cannot define the <i>precision</i> of an individual measurement. I think <i>accuracy</i> is the same in this respect. <a href="../../../i/k/e/User%7EIke9898_2b0c.html" title="User:Ike9898">ike9898</a> 13:54, May 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, it is possible to talk meaningfully about the expected precision of individual measurements, from a probabilistic standpoint. It works something like this (I'm a bit rusty here, apologies in advance for any errors):</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let A be some property we want to measure. Let {M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, ...} be a sequence of attempts to measure that property by some means, all of them under consistent conditions. For the moment I'm going to suppose we have a large number of M<sub>i</sub>; I'll get back to this later.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Each M<sub>i</sub> can be represented as the sum of three components:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>M<sub>i</sub> = A + S + E<sub>i</sub></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here, A is the true mass of the coin, S is the <i>systematic</i> error, and E<sub>i</sub> is the <i>random</i> error. S is the same for all M<sub>i</sub>, defined as mean({M<sub>i</sub>}) - A, and E<sub>i</sub> is defined as M<sub>i</sub> - A - S.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>E<sub>i</sub> varies according to <i>i</i>, but when the sequence {E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>, ...} is examined, it behaves as if all terms were generated from a single random distribution function E. (Basically, E is a function* on the real numbers**, such that the integral of E(x) over all real x is 1; the integral of E(x) between x=a and x=b is the probability that any given 'random number' from that distribution will lie between a and b.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The precision of our measurements is then based on the <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variance.html" title="Variance">variance</a> of E. It happens that the mean value of this distribution is 0, because of how we defined S and hence E<sub>i</sub>. This means that the variance of E is simply the integral (over all real x) of E(x)*x<sup>2</sup>, and the expected precision of any individual measurements can be defined as the square root of that variance***.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>*Possibly including <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirac_delta_function.html" title="Dirac delta function">Dirac delta functions</a>.</dd>
<dd>**Technically, "real numbers multiplied by the units of measurement", but I'll ignore units here.</dd>
<dd>***Possibly multiplied by a constant.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, supposing the number of M<sub>i</sub> is *not* large - perhaps as small as just one measurement. Expected precision of that measurement is then the answer to the question "if we took a lot more measurements of similar quantities, under the same conditions, what would the precision be?" (Actually *calculating* the answer to that question can be a tricky problem in itself.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Time for an example. Suppose we're trying to weigh a rock on a digital scale. When there's no weight on the scale, it reads 0.0 grams. We test it with known weights of exactly 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 50.0, and 100.0 grams, and every time it gives the correct value, so we know it's very reliable for weights in the range 0-100 grams, and we know the rocks are somewhere within that range.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But, being a digital scale, it only gives a reading to the nearest multiple of 0.1 grams. Since a rock's weight is unlikely to be an exact multiple of 0.1 grams, this introduces an error. The error function from this cause is effectively a square function with value 10 between -0.05 &amp; +0.05, and 0 outside that range, giving it a variance of 8.3e-4 and so a precision of about 0.03 grams. Which is to say, "for a randomly chosen rock, we can expect rounding to cause an error of about +/- 0.03 grams".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Getting back to the arrows, the precision of a given arrow is effectively how predictable that single arrow is - if you know that on average the archer aims 10 cm high of the bullseye, how close to that 10-cm-above-the-bullseye mark is the arrow likely to be? See <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_error_probable.html" title="Circular error probable">Circular error probable</a> for another example of this concept. When talking about a specific measurement or arrow, 'precision' is meaningfully applied <i>before</i> the fact rather than afterwards.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's a bit like the difference between "the coin I'm about to toss has a 50% chance of being heads" and "the coin I've just tossed has a 0% chance of being heads, because I'm looking at it and it came up tails.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whew, that was long; I hope it makes some sort of sense. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 00:40, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't like the arrow analogy. Analogies are supposed to make concepts clearer by reference to something that is easier to understand. I find that the arrow analogy is more confusing than the actual concepts of accuracy and precision. This is because the actual concepts are discussed in terms of single observations, but the analogy uses a distribution of observations. I don't see how precision can be modelled with a single arrow unless you show a very fat arrow being less precise than a very sharp arrow because the fat arrow covers a wider area at once, such as the difference between a ruler that shows only cm versus one that shows mm. As for using a set of arrows, any one of those arrows can be called accurate, but using an average position as a measure of the accuracy is kind of weak as far as the analogy goes. Also, I think the clustering of arrows together better describes the idea of reliability, rather than precision.</p>

<p>I don't think precision and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repeatability.html" title="Repeatability">repeatability</a> are quite the same. <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repeatability.html" title="Repeatability">Repeatability</a> unequivocally involves time, whereas precision may not.

<dl>
<dd>In measurement system analysis, at least in gauge calibration work, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repeatability.html" title="Repeatability">repeatability</a> is the variation in measurements taken with the same operator, instrument, samples, and method at pretty much the same time. <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reproducibility.html" title="Reproducibility">Reproducibility</a> is a variation across operators, holding the instrument, samples, method, and time constant.

Maybe precision is about the granularity of some representation of an ideal, like <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precision_%28arithmetic%29.html" title="Precision (arithmetic)">precision (arithmetic)</a>, while accuracy is some statement about the quality of the correspondence between the ideal and the representation. 70.186.213.30 18:14, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provides the following definitions</p>
<p>Accuracy: The closeness of agreement between a test result and the accepted reference value.</p>
<p>Trueness: The closeness of agreement between the average value obtained from a large series of test results and an accepted reference value.</p>
<p>Precision: The closeness of agreement between independent test results obtained under stipulated conditions.</p>
<p>Reference: International Organization for Standardization. ISO 5725. Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results. Geneve: ISO, 1994.</p>
<p>In the case of a random variable with a normal distribution, trueness can be interpreted as the closeness of its mean (i.e. expected valuee) to the reference value and the precision as the inverse of its standard error.</p>

<dd>I found a phrase in Merriam-Webster's Unabridged that I like: minute conformity. That covers both senses of precision that people describe: degree of closeness in a set of measured values, and smallest increments of a measuring scale on a measuring device. Anyhow, I see in the article that standard deviation has become a standard way to quantify precision, though one could consider average absolute deviation. Now because of the inverse relationship between precision and deviation, I suppose precision could be defined in those inverse terms. As deviation approaches infinity, precision approaches zero, and vice versa?207.189.230.42 07:40, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
