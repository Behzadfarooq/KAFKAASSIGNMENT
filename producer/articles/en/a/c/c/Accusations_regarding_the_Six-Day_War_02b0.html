Yitzhaki claimed that after the war, he conducted a study proving that in six or seven separate incidents, approximately 1,000 unarmed Egyptian <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoners_of_war.html" title="Prisoners of war">prisoners of war</a> were killed by IDF units. He told Israel Radio that he "submitted the study to then chief of general staff <a href="../../../y/i/t/Yitzhak_Rabin_b27b.html" title="Yitzhak Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a>, but he, as well as the upper echelons of the army, knew and swept it under the rug." It emerged subsequently that Yitzhaki was a member of <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafael_Eitan_8ce9.html" title="Rafael Eitan">Rafael Eitan</a>'s <a href="../../../t/s/o/Tsomet.html" title="Tsomet">Tsomet</a> Party. <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meir_Pa%27il_e9e1.html" title="Meir Pa'il">Meir Pa'il</a>, who had employed him as an assistant during research in the IDF archive, speculated that Yitzhaki was seeking to divert public attention away from revelations by retired general Arye Biro concerning his and Eitan’s involvement in the killing of 49 PoWs in the 1956 war. <sup id="_ref-post19aug_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-post19aug" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-nytimes21aug_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nytimes21aug" title="">[2]</a></sup> Yitzhaki said "It annoys me that everyone is making an issue about that one case, when everyone knows there were so many events like it". <sup id="_ref-jpost17081995_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jpost17081995" title="">[3]</a></sup> The allegations received widespread attention in Israel and throughout the world and later resurfaced in a book called <i>Body of Secrets</i> (pp. 201-202) by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bamford_0d9c.html" title="James Bamford">James Bamford</a>. <sup id="_ref-nytimesreview_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nytimesreview" title="">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-bamfordreview_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bamfordreview" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Yitzkhaki’s claim that up to 1,000 prisoners had been killed was not substantiated, in the ensuing national debate in Israel more soldiers came forward to say that they had witnessed the execution of unarmed prisoners and a long-suppressed public reckoning began. Gabby Bron, a journalist on the tabloid, <i><a href="../../../y/e/d/Yedioth_Ahronoth_65e5.html" title="Yedioth Ahronoth">Yedioth Ahronoth</a></i>, said he had witnessed the execution of five Egyptian prisoners. <sup id="_ref-bron_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bron" title="">[6]</a></sup> <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Bar-Zohar_cb8e.html" title="Michael Bar-Zohar">Michael Bar-Zohar</a> confessed that he had personally witnessed the murder of three Egyptian POWs by a cook <sup id="_ref-zohar_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-zohar" title="">[7]</a></sup> and Meir Pa'il said that he knew of many instances in which soldiers had killed PoWs or Arab civilians. <sup id="_ref-pows_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pows" title="">[8]</a></sup> In the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> article in which Yitzhaki’s claims spread around the world <sup id="_ref-laub_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-laub" title="">[9]</a></sup> it was noted that "Rabin, who was chief of staff when some of the 1967 killings allegedly were committed, walked away today when a reporter shouted a related question. His office later issued a statement denouncing the killings and calling them isolated incidents". However, leading Israeli military historian <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uri_Milstein_0771.html" title="Uri Milstein">Uri Milstein</a> was reported in the same article as saying that there were many incidents in the 1967 war in which Egyptian soldiers were killed by Israeli troops after they had raised their hands in surrender. "It was not an official policy, but there was an atmosphere that it was okay to do it," Milstein said. "Some commanders decided to do it; others refused. But everyone knew about it." <sup id="_ref-post_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-post" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to a <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> report of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_21.html" title="September 21">21 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> the Egyptian government announced that it had discovered two shallow mass graves in the Sinai at El Arish containing the remains of 30-60 Egyptian prisoners shot by Israeli soldiers during the 1967 war. Israel responded by sending Eli Dayan a Deputy Foreign Minister, to Egypt discuss the matter. During his visit Dayan offered compensation to the families of victims, but explained that Israel was unable to pursue those responsible owing to its 20-year <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_limitations.html" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a>. The Israeli Ambassador to Cairo, David Sultan, asked to be relieved of his post after the Egyptian daily <i><a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Shaab_a413.html" title="Al Shaab">Al Shaab</a></i> said he was personally responsible for the killing of 100 Egyptian prisoners, although both the Israeli Embassy and Foreign Ministry denied the charge and said that it was not even clear that Sultan had served in the military. <sup id="_ref-nytimes21sep_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nytimes21sep" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Declassified IDF documents show that on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_11.html" title="June 11">11 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> the operations branch of the general staff felt it necessary to issue new orders concerning the treatment of prisoners. The order read: "Since existing orders are contradictory, here are binding instructions. a) Soldiers and civilians who give themselves up are not to be hurt in any way. b) Soldiers and civilians who carry a weapon and do not surrender will be killed... Soldiers who are caught disobeying this order by killing prisoners will be punished severely. Make sure this order is brought to the attention of all IDF soldiers". <sup id="_ref-bowen276_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bowen276" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to Israeli sources 4338 Egyptian soldiers were taken captive by IDF. 11 Israeli soldiers were taken captive by Egyptian forces. PoW exchanges were completed on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_23.html" title="January 23">23 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>. <sup id="_ref-exchanges_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-exchanges" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Capt. Milovan Zorc and Miobor Stosic, a military liaison official, who were members of the Yugoslav Reconnaissance Battalion that formed part of the 3,400-strong UNEF deployed as a buffer between Egypt and Israel and witnessed the war, have cast doubt on claims that Israel executed Egyptian prisoners of war in the area where they were stationed. They said that if an Israeli unit had killed some 250 POWs near the Egyptian town of el-Arish they would likely have come to know about it.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/c/Accusations_regarding_the_Six-Day_War_02b0.html" title="Edit section: Allegations of U.S. and British combat support">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Allegations of U.S. and British combat support</span></h2>
<p>Some Arabs believe that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> provided more support for the Israelis than the American and British governments admit. Claims of American and British combat support for Israel began on the second day of the war. Radio Cairo and the government newspaper <i><a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Ahram_fe6d.html" title="Al-Ahram">Al-Ahram</a></i> made a number of claims, among them: that U.S. and British carrier-based aircraft flew sorties against the Egyptians; that U.S. aircraft based in <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libya.html" title="Libya">Libya</a> attacked Egypt; and that U.S. spy satellites provided imagery to Israel. Both Syria and Jordan broadcast similar reports on Radio Damascus and Radio Amman. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Oren_099b.html" title="Michael Oren">Michael Oren</a> believes that the purpose of these claims was to secure Soviet support. If this were true, it would in many ways mirror claims Israel made during this time in attempts to get U.S. support. In reaction to these claims, Arab oil-producing countries announced either an oil embargo on the United States and Britain or suspended oil exports altogether. <sup id="_ref-oren216_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oren216" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>One thing that contributed to this belief, other than general U.S. support for Israel, was U.S. intelligence-gathering during this period. Although this intelligence gathering was not disputed, the question arose as to whether the intelligence was handed over to the Israelis, perhaps to help them coordinate attacks. The U.S. government denies doing this.</p>
<p>High school and lower grade textbooks in Egypt claim that American and British troops fought on behalf of Israel during the Six-Day War. The following example comes from ‘Abdallah Ahmad Hamid al-Qusi, Al-Wisam fi at-Ta'rikh (Cairo: Al-Mu'asasa al-‘Arabiya al-Haditha, 1999), p. 284.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States' role: Israel was not (fighting) on its own in the (1967) war. Hundreds of volunteers, pilots, and military officers with American scientific spying equipment of the most advanced type photographed the Egyptian posts for it (Israel), jammed the Egyptian defense equipment, and transmitted to it the orders of the Egyptian command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_9.html" title="June 9">9 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, Egyptian President <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser_2db4.html" title="Gamal Abdel Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a> stated in his resignation speech (his resignation was not accepted):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is now established is that American and British aircraft carriers were off the shores of the enemy helping his war effort. Also, British aircraft raided, in broad daylight, positions of the Syrian and Egyptian fronts, in addition to operations by a number of American aircraft reconnoitering some of our positions... Indeed, it can be said without exaggeration that the enemy was operating with an air force three times stronger than his normal force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the war ended, the Egyptian government and its newspapers continued to make claims of collusion between Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States. These included a series of weekly articles in <i>Al-Ahram</i>, simultaneously broadcast on Radio Cairo by Muhammad Heikal. Heikal attempted to uncover the "secrets" of the war. He presented a blend of facts, documents, and interpretations. Heikal's conclusion was clear-cut: there was a secret U.S.-Israeli collusion against Syria and Egypt.</p>
<p>Both London and Washington issued strenuous denials of these claims.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her Majesty's Government are shocked by reports emanating from the Middle East ... that planes from a British aircraft carrier have been involved in the fighting. This is a malicious fabrication. There is not a grain of truth in it. It is the policy of Her Majesty's Government to avoid taking sides in this conflict and to do everything they can to bring about a cease-fire as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, these claims, that the Arabs were fighting the Americans and British rather than Israel alone, took hold in the Arab world. As reported by the British Representative in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, a country at odds with Egypt as a result of the Yemen war:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Abdel Nasser's allegation ... is firmly believed by almost the whole Arab population here who listen to the radio or read the press ... Our broadcast denials are little heard and just not believed. The denials we have issued to the broadcasting service and press have not been published. Even highly educated persons basically friendly to us seem convinced that the allegations are true. Senior foreign ministry officials who received my formal written and oral denials profess to believe them but nevertheless appear skeptical. I consider that this allegation has seriously damaged our reputation in the Arab world more than anything else and has caused a wave of suspicion or feeling against us which will persist in some underlying form for the foreseeable future ... Further denials or attempts at local publicity by us will not dispel this belief and may now only exacerbate local feeling since the Arabs are understandably sensitive to their defeat with a sense of humiliation and resent self-justification by us who in their eyes helped their enemy to bring this about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A British guidance telegram to Middle East posts concluded: "The Arabs' reluctance to disbelieve all versions of the Big Lie springs in part from a need to believe that the Israelis could not have defeated them so thoroughly without outside assistance."</p>
