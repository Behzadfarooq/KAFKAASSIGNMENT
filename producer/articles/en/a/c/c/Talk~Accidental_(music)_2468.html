	    <p>The symbols sharp, flat, natural etc are not called accidentals. "Accidentals" refers only to the use of such symbols to depart from the key signature. I've consulted 4 dictionaries of music, which give no generic term for them. The closest is <i>The Oxford Companion to Music</i>, which has a table of "Names of Inflections of Notes" at the front, but in the actual entry for "sharp" etc just calls it a symbol.</p>
<p>If we want to cover shaprs, flats &amp; naturals on one page, I suggest the name "Note inflection symbols", but we would need to specify that such a term is merely a Wikipedia invention for convenience. -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a></p>
<p>Harvard Dictionary of Music begins its entry for Accidental with</p>
<dl>
<dd>The signs used in musical notation to indicate chromatic alterations or to cancel them.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So this definitely agrees that the symbols themselves are accidentals. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> 00:25, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My rewrite still requires some work on the Turkish system, which I know nothing about, and the derivation of the symbols from medieval times.</p>
<p>I removed the following because it didn't seem to fit the topic, and in any case is simplified to the point of uselessness:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The rules for which accidentals to choose may vary according to the type of music: modal, diatonic or chromatic, and also whether the transcriber is aiming for strictness or clarity, for example C flat versus B in the key of D flat. Nonetheless, some general rules for choosing between flat or sharp accidentals include:
<ul>
<li>When descending, use flats.</li>
<li>When ascending, use sharps.</li>
<li>Try to use the same kind of accidentals -- sharps or flats -- used by the key signature.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I also removed the following due to dubious accuracy; my experience is that C# is <i>higher</i> than Db:</p>
<dl>
<dd>On a piano or other <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_temperament.html" title="Equal temperament">equally tempered</a> instruments with fixed tuning, a sharp and a flat are the same distance from the natural note in either direction (so that C sharp is the same as D flat - they are <a href="../../../e/n/h/Enharmonically_equivalent.html" title="Enharmonically equivalent">enharmonically equivalent</a>), while instruments with flexible tuning such as violins or cellos are often played so they more closely approximate <a href="../../../j/u/s/Just_intonation.html" title="Just intonation">just intonation</a>, meaning sharps tend to be lower and flats higher (so that C sharp is slightly lower than D flat).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The first part of this statement (about instruments with fixed tuning) is certainly correct. If there's disagreement about the second part, couldn't the statement be revised simply to say that C# and Db (for example) may not be the same? <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 14:19, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I also removed this because I couldn't figure out what it means (perhaps could be summarized in a few sentences about inconsistent use of symbols):</p>
<dl>
<dd>In some of the autographs of the 17th and 18th one does not notice the incoherence of the modern accidental notation, in which the value of the altered note does not depend on the key signature contrary to the value of the unaltered note, which, among other things, makes <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sight_transposition.html" title="Sight transposition">sight transposition</a> more awkward that it ought to be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In such scores (e.g. autographs by J.S. Bach) the value of the altered note <i>does</i> in fact (as it ought to) depend on the key signature. For example a flat sign before B means Bb in the key of C major but Bbb (B double-flat) in the key of F major. Similarly a sharp sign before A means Ab in the key of C major but A natural in the key of Eb major. A natural sign before B means B natural in the key of C major but Bb in the key of F major and it needs to be used only if the B had been previously flattened or sharpened. (Generally speaking the natural is always used to restore the value of the note to that of the key signature, never to <i>cancel</i> an accidental in the key signature.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not only does this manner of notating accidentals avoid the awkwardness in <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sight_transposition.html" title="Sight transposition">sight transposition</a> alluded to above, but it also almost never requires the use of double-flats and double-sharps. Also the natural sign is always used to restore the value of the note to that of the key signature, never to <i>cancel</i> an accidental in the key signature.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Modern editions of course always change this style of marking accidentals to the modern style (in the case of full scores, not necessarily in the case of a figured bass, see below) even if the original score is notated in the old manner. But this style can still be seen in some editions for the notation of <a href="../../../f/i/g/Figured_bass.html" title="Figured bass">figured bass</a> chords even today (or at least quite recently, long after this style of notation had been abandoned for scores.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, I removed this from the hexachord discussion:</p>
<dl>
<dd>(It might also have helped that H was the letter which followed G so that it completed the alphabetic series A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, but that is <i>not</i> the reason Germans use H for B natural, it is at best an <i>a posteriori</i> justification; rather the real origin is that stated above, namely a deformation of a square B)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry but I seriously do not understand the sentence quoted below. Are you simply trying to say that G# is two semitones away from Gb&#160;? Or are you inferring that a Gb becomes an F if there happens to be a G# in the same measure. I'm no expert but I do know a little bit about writing music -- and that does not sound right.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p><br />
<i><b>Note that in a few cases the accidental might change the note by more than a semitone: for example, if a G sharp is followed in the same measure by a G flat, the flat sign on the latter note means it will be two semitones lower than if no accidental were present. Thus, the effect of the accidental has to be understood in relation to the "natural" meaning of the note's staff position.</b></i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that passage is unclear. What it intends to say is that although a flat sign normally lowers the note by a half step (from what the note would be without the accidental), if the prevailing accidental (whether from the key signature or a preceding accidental) is a sharp, the effect of the flat is to lower it two semitones: from the sharp to the natural, then to the flat. In fact, if there was a previous double-flat on the same note in that measure, the effect of the flat might be to <i>raise</i> the note, cancelling the double flat. I'm not entirely certain this information needs to be included at all, but that's what it's supposed to say. Editors are encouraged to edit it for clarity. —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 04:35, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The sharp is a variant of the natural sign, originally used to raise the Bb to B -- the two signs were used interchangeably in the 15th-16th centuries, and the natural sign was sometimes used to indicate F#. The flat sign was sometimes used to cancel a sharp -- even as late as Bach. A sign resembling our modern double-sharp was also used to indicate sharp.

<p>"Since about 1700, accidentals have been understood to continue for the remainder of the measure in which they occur, so that a subsequent note on the same staff position is still affected by that accidental, unless replaced by an accidental of its own. Notes on other staff positions, including those an octave away, are unaffected."</p>
<p>I do not claim to be the world's biggest music expert, but my understanding is that the position an octave away <i>would</i> be affected by the same accidental. So if middle C is sharped by an accidental, and then the C an octave above that were to appear later in the same measure with no accidental, it woul also be sharped. Maybe this is just something where different people have different standards, though. I also had the understanding that if the key signature has F sharped, then an F with a flat symbol would still be F-flat, not F-natural, although I can see how the latter standard would aid in sight transposition. <a href="../../../g/l/m/User%7EGLmathgrant_7bf5.html" title="User:GLmathgrant">GLmathgrant</a> 18:20, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For your first question, accidentals only affect their own octave. If a C in one octave is sharped, a subsequent C in another octave in the same measure must have a sharp; however, if it's not meant to be sharped, most editors consider a courtesy natural mandatory. In jazz it's quite common for a note to have different accidentals in different octaves, even in the same chord (e.g. an <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altered_chord.html" title="Altered chord">A7-alt chord</a> would contain both a C sharp and a C natural), although editorial standards in jazz notation are, shall we say, lax.</dd>
<dd>An F with a flat sign in a piece whose key signature contains an F sharp (or when an F is sharped earlier in the measure) is considered an F-flat in modern notation, but in 17th- and 18th-century notation it often meant F-natural. —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 22:40, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should there be something on the different ways to annotate? For instance, unicode, &lt;alt&gt; combinations in Windoze, any special key combinations to the Mac, etc.... I remember reading somewhere on Wikipedia that there is a stylistic guidline for how to annotate, and one way is recommended above all others, but I forgot where I read it...</p>
<p>Just a humble suggestion.... <a href="../../../n/d/c/User%7ENDCompuGeek_acac.html" title="User:NDCompuGeek">NDCompuGeek</a> 06:58, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd say no. I think, by the way, "annotate" is not the word you're looking for. Anyway, sharp and flat signs are just particular instances of special characters, and "how to do special characters on your computer" is not really within the scope of an article on music. As for stylistic guidelines for Wikipedia, see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28music%29_2040.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (music)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (music)</a>. -- <a href="../../../r/s/h/User%7ERsholmes_de0b.html" title="User:Rsholmes">Rsholmes</a> 11:51, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
