However, it is one of the earlier Star Destroyer concepts.</p>

<p>The <i>Acclamator</i> was designed by <a href="../../../k/u/a/Kuat_Drive_Yards_fcee.html" title="Kuat Drive Yards">Kuat Drive Yards</a>, the wealthiest starship builders in the galaxy and owners of many other important starship builders like Kuat Systems Engineering and <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rothana_Heavy_Engineering_f16c.html" title="Rothana Heavy Engineering">Rothana Heavy Engineering</a>. It was Kuat's Rothana yards that produced many of the Acclamators, along with almost all of the Republic's ground units used during the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_Wars_%28Star_Wars%29_b249.html" title="Clone Wars (Star Wars)">Clone Wars</a>. While Kuat Systems Engineering (KSE) produced the <i>Venator</i>-class Star Destroyer, the Eta-2 Actis <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi_interceptor.html" title="Jedi interceptor">Jedi interceptor</a>, the Delta-7 Aethersprite <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi_starfighter.html" title="Jedi starfighter">Jedi starfighter</a>, the <a href="../../../v/-/w/V-wing.html" title="V-wing">V-wing</a>, and the Unstable-Terrain Assault Transport (<a href="../../../u/t/-/UT-AT_d057.html" title="UT-AT">UT-AT</a>), Rothana Heavy Engineering (RHE) constructed the <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-TE_a8c4.html" title="AT-TE">AT-TE</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-HE_a295.html" title="AT-HE">AT-HE</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-RT_f97a.html" title="AT-RT">AT-RT</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-OT_e280.html" title="AT-OT">AT-OT</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-XT_c8ba.html" title="AT-XT">AT-XT</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/h/SPHA-T_cd3c.html" title="SPHA-T">SPHA-T</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/a/LAAT_7f89.html#LAAT.2Fi" title="LAAT">LAAT/i</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/a/LAAT_7f89.html#LAAT.2Fc" title="LAAT">LAAT/c</a> gunships, Infantry Support Platforms (ISPs), and the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_vehicles_in_Star_Wars_738f.html#TX-130s_fighter_tank" title="Minor vehicles in Star Wars">TX-130S Fighter Tank</a>. The <i>Acclamator</i>s transported each and every previously mentioned weapon to the corners of the galaxy during the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_Wars_%28Star_Wars%29_b249.html" title="Clone Wars (Star Wars)">Clone Wars</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>Acclamator</i>s, due to their design as a troop transport meant to land on a planet's surface, had a lighter weapon system than most of the Separatist starships and Republic cruisers to come. This does not mean the <i>Acclamator</i> lacks defenses: the primary weapons of an <i>Acclamator</i> are 12 quad <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbolaser.html" title="Turbolaser">turbolaser</a> turrets that are removable and are easy to place on various locations on the ship. For support, the <i>Acclamator</i> also has 24 laser cannons mounted on the ship's perimeter to scatter attacking starfighters or pirates. For planetary bombardments, the <i>Acclamator</i> also has 4 heavy missile/<a href="../../../p/r/o/Proton_torpedo.html" title="Proton torpedo">proton torpedo</a> launchers. These weapons are more than enough to destroy smaller frigates or starfighters, and before landing on a planet, <i>Acclamator</i>s are often used to attack and destroy fleeing freighters and ships. The planetary focus of the <i>Acclamator</i> greatly affected its design: the turbolasers are not as accurate as the weapons on most other ships, and the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser_cannon.html" title="Laser cannon">laser cannons</a>, while great for destroying starfighters, are too weak to seriously damage capital ships. Both the missile launchers and the turbolasers take several minutes to reposition in order to have the greatest firing arc against capital ships. As the Clone Wars progressed, almost all of the <i>Acclamator</i>s had starfighter and cruiser escorts, since the <i>Acclamator</i> could carry enough weapons to place a siege on an entire planet, but was vulnerable to attack while doing so.</p>
<p>Unlike the <i>Venator</i>, <i>Victory</i>, and <i>Imperial</i> Star Destroyers of the Galactic Civil War and the late Clone Wars, the <i>Acclamator</i> was designed to carry a huge complement of ground vehicles. Around the opening of the Clone Wars and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Geonosis_6493.html" title="Battle of Geonosis">Battle of Geonosis</a>, one Acclamator could carry over 16,000 <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_trooper.html" title="Clone trooper">clone troopers</a>. Three hundred-twenty <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speeder_bike.html" title="Speeder bike">speeder bikes</a>, mostly the 74-Z models produced by the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aratech_Repulsor_Company_0779.html" title="Aratech Repulsor Company">Aratech Repulsor Company</a>, were stored aboard for <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconnaissance.html" title="Reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> duty, although the AT-RT walker and <a href="../../../b/a/r/BARC_speeder_06fd.html" title="BARC speeder">BARC speeder</a> would eventually replace them. Eighty Republic Gunships performed the role of air transports, while 48 AT-TE walkers and 36 SPHA-T walkers rounded out the invasion forces. During the middle and end of the Clone Wars, many <i>Acclamator</i>s were modified to carry several squadrons of <a href="../../../v/-/1/V-19_Torrent_starfighter_b14d.html" title="V-19 Torrent starfighter">V-19 Torrent starfighters</a> and space-capable Republic gunships. During the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Muunilist_2a5f.html" title="Battle of Muunilist">Battle of Muunilist</a>, <i>Acclamator</i>s carried V-19s and LAAT/ls and released them in space, causing a massive dogfight with an invading Separatist force. Interestingly, some <i>Acclamator</i>s were used to transport <a href="../../../o/r/p/Orphan.html" title="Orphan">orphaned</a> children from civilian casualties to <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bespin.html" title="Bespin">Bespin</a>, as Bespin served as a sanctuary for orphans during the Clone Wars. Many famous people, including <a href="../../../b/o/b/Boba_Fett_68c2.html" title="Boba Fett">Boba Fett</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurra_Sing_82f6.html" title="Aurra Sing">Aurra Sing</a>, ended up in these ships.</p>
<p>The other systems of <i>Acclamator</i>-class vessels, particularly concerning speed and defense, are what makes this troop transport unique in the Republic and later Imperial starfleets. The <i>Acclamator</i>s uses a redundant, criss-cross <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deflector_shield.html" title="Deflector shield">deflector shield</a> array that provides shield to where the ships is receiving the heaviest laser fire. However, the shields are rarely activated in this manner because it places a lot of strain on an already overtaxed generator. The shields of an <i>Acclamator</i> are strong enough to hold off most battleships, but many <i>Acclamator</i>s have a better chance of running than surviving a direct assault. The <i>Acclamator</i> has the fastest <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperdrive.html" title="Hyperdrive">hyperdrive</a> ever built for a capital ship: a 0.6 hyperdrive array (3,500 G) that takes up the entire fin-like structure that protrudes from the stern of the vessel. 0.6 is unusually fast for a ship that is 752 meters long, allowing a ship 28 times the size of the <i><a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_Falcon_baaa.html" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i> to enter and exit hyperspace at almost the exact same time. (The <i>Falcon</i> has a 0.5 hyperdrive; the lower the number, the better, and .1 is a very slight difference.) This ensured that the fleet invading <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geonosis.html" title="Geonosis">Geonosis</a> arrived in minutes after departing from <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamino.html" title="Kamino">Kamino</a> and Rothana, and many lives were saved and many droids demolished by the timely arrival of these behemoth carriers.</p>
<p>The <i>Acclamator</i>s participated in almost every battle during the Clone Wars, particularly during the opening stages. On <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28R-S%29_8bca.html#Rhen_Var" title="List of Star Wars planets (R-S)">Rhen Var</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashyyyk.html" title="Kashyyyk">Kashyyyk</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28T-V%29_b9a6.html#Thule" title="List of Star Wars planets (T-V)">Thule</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28R-S%29_8bca.html#Raxus_Prime" title="List of Star Wars planets (R-S)">Raxus Prime</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geonosis.html" title="Geonosis">Geonosis</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/u/Muunilist.html" title="Muunilist">Muunilist</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28H-J%29_b0d7.html#Jabiim" title="List of Star Wars planets (H-J)">Jabiim</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatooine.html" title="Tatooine">Tatooine</a>, <i>Acclamator</i>s transported many Republic ground vehicles and, the majority of the time, were the main reason behind the Republic victories. The <i>Acclamator</i>s use huge, retracting doors in the bottom of the ships to act as loading ramps when depositing vehicles. During the second year of the Clone Wars, the Republic tried to turn <i>Acclamator</i>s into <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_carrier.html" title="Aircraft carrier">carriers</a> by adding smaller hangars, but with the advent of the <i>Venator</i>-class Star Destroyer, the need for a starfighter carrier was nullified, and the <i>Acclamator</i>s returned to troop transport.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/c/Acclamator-class_assault_ship.html" title="Edit section: Post-Clone Wars">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Post-Clone Wars</span></h3>
<p>After the Clone Wars, almost all of the <i>Acclamator</i>s underwent serious modifications. Many of the <i>Acclamator</i>s were melted down and used for scrap - few modern Imperial warships lack armor plating derived from a decommissioned <i>Acclamator</i>. Some of the <i>Acclamator</i>s were used as freight transports, and a few of them still served under the Empire to do what they were made for - the transport of ground vehicles and infantry. A few of these ships were modified for starfighter transport; some Imperial versions were modified to carry up to 4 squadrons of starfighters, such as TIE Bombers and TIE Fighters - since Acclamators were outdated ships even in the Galactic Civil War, it was rare to see them shuttling more advanced craft like TIE Interceptors or TIE Defenders. Unfortunately, the <i>Acclamator</i>s that didn't end up becoming parts of another ship were turned into <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slave</a> ships, known as "slavers", since they were used to transport the thousands of slaves the Empire obtained from various sieges of backwater planets. Because the <i>Acclamator</i>s could carry almost double the number of infantry an <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyer could, they were deemed perfect to shuttle the scum of the Empire's backbone and slave force. Still others, as <i>Acclamator</i>-class frigates (Mark II), were used as sub-Star Destroyer capital ships at least up to a few years prior to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Yavin_6f1b.html" title="Battle of Yavin">Battle of Yavin</a>. Even by the time of the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar during the <a href="../../../y/u/u/Yuuzhan_Vong_68ce.html" title="Yuuzhan Vong">Yuuzhan Vong</a> invasion, <i>Acclamator</i>-class ships were still being scrounged up and pressed into duty as combat warships.</p>
<p>There appear to have been several variants of the <i>Acclamator</i> dedicated for space combat rather than planetary assault. One example may be the <i><a href="../../../r/a/n/Rand_Ecliptic_aa29.html" title="Rand Ecliptic">Rand Ecliptic</a></i>, which had two docking bays that had openings on both port and starboard. Other examples, with a ventral hangar bay similar to later Star Destroyers, were seen orbiting an unnamed world around the time of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Naboo_7371.html" title="Battle of Naboo">Battle of Naboo</a> in the <i>Star Wars Tales</i> comics. The <i>Acclamator</i>-class assault ship (Mark II) was upgraded for space combat, and it seems probable that these ships were those redesignated as <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frigate.html" title="Frigate">frigates</a> at some point before the Battle of Yavin.</p>
