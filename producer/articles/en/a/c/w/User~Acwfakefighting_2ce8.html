	    <p><b>ACW Fake Fighting</b> is an "amateur" professional wrestling promotion which operates in the state of Missouri. The company has previously operated as <b>Midwest Championship Wrestling</b> (1999-2003), <b>Alternative Championship Wrestling</b> (2003-2004), and <b>Apartment Championship Wrestling</b> (2004-2005) before settling on the name <b>ACW Fake Fighting</b> in February 2005. ACW owner Nolan Woodford decided to take the word <i>wrestling</i> out of the title of the company for legal reasons and to ensure there was no misunderstanding in the new direction of the product. The initials <b>"ACW"</b> don't currently stand for anything.</p>
<p>As of 2006, the official headquarters for ACW Fake Fighting are located in Columbia, Missouri.</p>

<p>Some say the roots of ACW date back to around 1990, upon the formation of the <b>DWF (World Wide Wrestling Federation</b> - Please don't ask how they came to those initials out of that) in Ballwin, Missouri. Co-founders Shane Vunkannon and Brian Whitaker wrestled each other and their friends in their respective basements, even forming their own belts. It was at this time that, at the age of 5, Vunkannon's younger brother, Nolan Woodford, battled his brother for the first of many times.</p>
<p>In 1995, Woodford and his mother moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico. The DWF had long-since become defunct. In 1998, Woodford started his own small "promotion" with his middle school friends called the <b>BPWF (Bosque Prep Wrestling Federation)</b>. This consisted of a handful of students wrestling each other in empty classrooms during the lunch hour. There were even a couple of championship belts - simply foam replica World Wrestling Federation championship belts. The BPWF didn't last very long, as school officials cracked down on it, especially after one student got hurt getting kicked down a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>In early 1999, Woodford moved back to Florissant, Missouri - where big brother, Shane, also lived at the time. No doubt, they continued their tradition of watching wrestling and beating on each other whenever possible. Woodford had retained one of the old BPWF foam belts and decided to give it a facelift. After changing the belt around some, he declared it the <b>MWCW Hardcore Heavyweight Championship</b> and gave birth to <b>Midwest Championship Wrestling</b>.</p>
<p><a name="Midwest_Championship_Wrestling" id="Midwest_Championship_Wrestling"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/w/User%7EAcwfakefighting_2ce8.html" title="Edit section: Midwest Championship Wrestling">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Midwest Championship Wrestling</span></h2>
<p>The first night of MWCW's existence took place on March 17, 1999 outside of Woodford's then-home in Florissant. He, his brother, and mutual friend, Dave Wiseman, were simply hanging out together when the first match in MWCW history took place. It would pit Vunkannon, under his long-used name of <b>Studd</b> against Wiseman, or <b>"Dangerous" Dave</b> to crown the first ever MWCW Hardcore Heavyweight Champion.</p>
<p><a name="Crowning_of_a_Champion" id="Crowning_of_a_Champion"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/w/User%7EAcwfakefighting_2ce8.html" title="Edit section: Crowning of a Champion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Crowning of a Champion</span></h3>
<p>"Dangerous" Dave defeated Studd in the front yard to win the championship. The celebration was not to last long, however, as Woodford - under his recently-acquired persona of <b>White Chocolate</b> - made an impromptu challenge for the belt. "Dangerous" Dave accepted and made his first title defense just as soon as he'd won the belt. Unfortunately, the fatigue of having one previous match was too much as White Chocolate made "Dangerous" Dave submit to a Sharpshooter to win the belt. "Dangerous" Dave's title reign remains on record as the shortest Heavyweight title reign in ACW History, and it's the only time that the title has changed hands twice in one day.</p>
<p>Over the summer of 1999, many people gathered at Studd's home to watch WWF Monday Night Raw every Monday night. Every now and then a battle would break out between members of the MWCW roster. On one of these particular nights, White Chocolate accepted the challenge of Studd. After Studd had made a couple of failed attempts to win the title, his best chance came on August 9, 1999 when Studd defeated White Chocolate to capture his first MWCW Hardcore Championship. This was the first screwjob in ACW history, as Studd put White Chocolate in the Figure-Four Leglock. White Chocolate did not submit, but referee Tim Miller ended the match and awarded the title to Studd in controversial fashion.</p>
<p>Less than three weeks later, Studd and White Chocolate met on August 28, 1999 in a Best Three-Out-Of-Five Falls Match. White Chocolate defeated his brother to become the first two-time champion in ACW history. This match took place on the birthday of Studd and Choco's mother, who was away in Las Vegas and unable to witness the awesome action.</p>

<p>As MWCW entered the new millenium, Nolan Woodford had planned the first ever MWCW supercard to take place in the spring of 2000. Woodford was moving to Kirkwood, Missouri, which is where his cousin, Chad Alley, resides. Woodford asked Alley for permission to use his backyard to build a ring and put on a show, and Alley agreed.</p>
<p>The plans were put into the works for the show to be held in May 2000. The main event of Studd vs. White Chocolate in ACW's first-ever Ladder Match for the Hardcore Heavyweight Title was booked. Also there were plans of establishing a Crusierweight Championship as talent from <b>New Revolution Wrestling</b> - a short-lived backyard wrestling federation in Ballwin, Missouri - agreed to come in and work the show.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as ring plans began to come together, Alley had a falling out with MWCW. Without a backyard to use, Spring Fever was postponed and eventually cancelled.</p>

<p>After Spring Fever was postponed, White Chocolate defended his title against Studd as promised - but it wasn't in a Ladder Match. On May 8, 2000, White Chocolate was defeated for the second time, this time via an inside cradle. Studd became the two-time MWCW Hardcore Heavyweight Champion.</p>
<p>With the disapointment of the cancellation of Spring Fever, hope for the expansion of MWCW began to diminish in the eyes of Nolan Woodford. While he, his brother, and a couple friends would still horse around from time to time, MWCW more-or-less self-destructed. Nothing was ever made official, so Studd remained the title holder.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2003, MWCW was closed and the championship belt changed. A new title belt was created and dubbed the <b>ACW Hardcore Heavyweight Championship</b>, taking the lineage of the MWCW championship with it.</p>
<p>The first defense of the new title was scheduled for June 15, 2003, as a group of people gathered at the "ACW Arena" in Kirkwood, Missouri for the <i><a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_Bad_Blood_aa8d.html" title="WWE Bad Blood">WWE Bad Blood</a></i> Pay-Per-View. After that show ended, Studd defended the title against White Chocolate. After an epic encounter, Studd submitted to a modified Bow and Arrow and White Chocolate captured the championship for a record third time.</p>
<p>White Chocolate would continue to hold the title for another nine months until things changed in ACW...</p>

<p>A record crowd was gathered at the ACW Arena for the weekend of <i>WWE <a href="../../../w/r/e/WrestleMania_XX_66b6.html" title="WrestleMania XX">WrestleMania XX</a></i>. Many new characters were introduced into the ACW family during this weekend, including Nintendo, Buddy Christ, Melvin Root, Commissioner Meschede, Jim Tennings, and ACW Senior Official The Masked Assassin.</p>
<p>One final rematch between White Chocolate and Studd was booked for this show, but there would be much more in store for ACW. It was the morning of the scheduled match and Pay-Per-View that White Chocolate grabbed Melvin Root and his camcorder. While Nintendo was working at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schnucks.html" title="Schnucks">Schnucks</a> grocery store, White Chocolate - wearing the belt - challenged him to an impromptu fight in the parking lot. This segment would be the first ever aired on ACW TV.</p>
<p><a name="ACW_TV" id="ACW_TV"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/w/User%7EAcwfakefighting_2ce8.html" title="Edit section: ACW TV">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">ACW TV</span></h3>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/w/User%7EAcwfakefighting_2ce8.html" title="Edit section: Episode One">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Episode One</span></h4>
<p>With the development of ACW TV, all of the new members of the ACW roster found their way onto the show. When Nintendo returned from work, he cut a promo on White Chocolate and was then booked in a match for a brand new ACW Championship - the <b>Wu-Tang Triple Crown Championship</b>. (The name of the title pays homage to a skit on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chappelle%27s_Show_7f8c.html" title="Chappelle's Show">Chappelle's Show</a>.) He was booked against Melvin Root in the first-ever <b>Sticky Note Death Match</b>.</p>
<p>However, due to an injury sustained earlier in the weekend in an actual professional wrestling match, Melvin withdrew himself. Commissioner Meschede would announce that interviewer Buddy Christ would be forced to take part in this match. With no time to prepare for the dreaded Sticky Note Death Match, Nintendo defeated Buddy Christ with an inside cradle to become the first and only Wu-Tang Triple Crown Champion in history. The title was suspended indefinitely after Nintendo left ACW in Spring 2005.</p>
<p>Also on this episode, White Chocolate defeated Studd to retain the ACW Hardcore Heavyweight Championship in the evening's main event. Studd countered an attempted F-5 with a DDT. This set up a Texas Cloverleaf attempt, but White Chocolate countered with an inside cradle for the three-count to retain the title. The most shocking moment in the match came afterwards, when Nintendo turned heel on his former friend Studd and joined forces with White Chocolate.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/w/User%7EAcwfakefighting_2ce8.html" title="Edit section: Episode Two">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Episode Two</span></h4>
<p>A second episode of ACW TV was filmed just a few days after the first was. There was only one match booked on this show, a dreadfully long encounter between two new ACW superstars who would become mainstays in the promotion - Slick Rick and O.D. White Chocolate officiated this match as the winner would challenge for his title at <b>ACW Backwash 2005</b>. After a twenty minute encounter, both men pinned each other and White Chocolate ruled there was no winner; therefore, there was no number one contender. Commissioner Meschede interrupted the proceedings and declared otherwise, saying both Slick Rick and O.D. would get the title shot!</p>
<p>This episode also contained footage of a drunken White Chocolate getting into confrontations with random spectators in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>It also contained a vignette for a superstar named <b>Buzzard</b>, but he was never heard from again after it shot.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Slick Rick vs. O.D. match was simulcast on <i>The Ace of Spades</i> radio program, which White Chocolate hosted on Tuesday nights in Columbia on a pirated radio station.</li>
<li>ACW owner Nolan Woodford, who produced ACW TV, was kicked out of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Missouri-Columbia_d3fe.html" title="University of Missouri-Columbia">University of Missouri-Columbia</a> Student Support Center after this episode for editing inappropriate material and lying about his intent. Apparently it's for schoolwork only.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/w/User%7EAcwfakefighting_2ce8.html" title="Edit section: Episode Three">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Episode Three</span></h4>
<p>Without a nice place to edit ACW TV, the quality of Episode Three is not nearly as great as the previous installments in terms of production values. This episode is referred to as "The Godzilla Episode" due to the fact that the audio and video rarely synced up properly throughout the episode.</p>
<p>In the opening match, White Chocolate defeated Melvin Root in a Ladder Match to retain the ACW Hardcore Heavyweight Championship. In ACW's first-ever Ladder Match, White Chocolate merely Irish whipped Melvin Root and climbed up the ladder to retain the title.</p>
<p>Vignettes also aired for the debuts of new ACW characters - Former WWE Superstar <b><a href="../../../k/a/t/Katie_Vick_e1ac.html" title="Katie Vick">Katie Vick</a></b> as well as <b>Hot Carl</b>. While Vick, much like Buzzard, never surfaced, Hot Carl immediatly made his debut. He was defeated by Slick Rick, who had the support of <b>Larry Classic</b> in his corner.</p>
<p>In the evening's main event, Nintendo defended the Wu-Tang Triple Crown Championship against the <b>"Ironman" Mark Stone</b> in a Two-out-of-Three Falls Match. The two combatants split the first two falls - a thumb war and a wrestling figure match. The final fall was a brawl in a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> parking lot. This ended with Stone pinning Nintendo to seemingly capture the title. However, in one of ACW's most heralded finishes, Stone took his face off to reveal that he was, in fact, Nintendo all along and, thus, Nintendo retained his championship.</p>
<p>As that week's host, Buddy Christ, concluded the show, White Chocolate interrupted him. The two set a match for the next week and White Chocolate kicked Buddy Christ down the stairs, thus setting up the most notable feud in ACW history.</p>

<p>Matches for a fourth episode of ACW TV were filmed, but never put together as a polished product. These matches saw White Chocolate successfully defend his ACW Hardcore Heavyweight Championship against Buddy Christ as well as O.D. defeat Hot Carl.</p>
<p>Many other matches and segments over time were filmed for ACW TV, but the third episode was the final to be officially put together under the tag of "ACW TV".</p>
<p>After his match for the never-aired fourth episode of ACW TV, Buddy Christ decided to acknowledge his Mexican roots and go by the name <b>Benny Martinez</b>.</p>

<p>On April 23, 2004, ACW's most famous match to date took place. This bout was the second meeting between White Chocolate and the newly-named Benny Martinez for the ACW Hardcore Heavyweight Championship. This bout would be dubbed "The Duel in the Dorm" as it took place inside McDavid Hall in Columbia, Missouri.</p>
<p>The encounter saw both men fight throughout the dorm including a dorm room, stairwell, bathroom, shower, and lounge area. Dozens of spectators found themselves witness to a chaotic battle that saw White Chocolate win with a sickening DDT. Most everyone who has ever witnessed this match say it is the greatest in ACW history and has yet to be topped.</p>
<p>This long bout was also the debut of ACW's mysterious color commentary man, who announces most of the ACW matches despite not having a name or having ever been seen.</p>

<p>Backwash was the first scheduled ACW supercard, to take place at the ACW Arena in May 2004. A little known fact is that two matches were shot for this event, including Nintendo successfully retaining the Wu-Tang Triple Crown Title against Studd and White Chocolate successfully retaining the ACW Hardcore Heavyweight Championship in a Triple Threat Match against Slick Rick and O.D. However, both matches - especially the main event - were deemed awful even by ACW standards. The event was cancelled and those matches never saw the light of day.</p>

<li>Flaming Chair Match (Special Guest Referee: Garlito Galapogos Gay): O.D. <u>def.</u> Slick Rick</li>
<li>ACW Hardcore Heavyweight Championship: Benny Martinez <u>def.</u> White Chocolate [c]</li>
</ul>
<p>The first ACW supercard that was done successfully was held on Sunday, October 24, 2004. This was the first of many events to be held at the "Forest Village Center" in Columbia, Missouri - which is now home to ACW headquarters.</p>
<p>The opening bout saw Slick Rick and O.D. settle their long-heated issue in the first-ever "Flaming Chair Match". This was not what you would expect, though, as the special guest referee was ACW newcomer <b>Garlito Galapogos Gay</b> - the man who claimed he would "come in the face of people who don't want to be gay." O.D. defeated Slick Rick after hitting him with a bong and set him up for the flaming chair. Garlito informed everyone that the flaming part was him giving Slick Rick a lapdance!</p>
<p>The evening's main event was scheduled to be Benny Martinez's final shot at White Chocolate and the ACW Title. Another epic encounter between these two men ended in a nearby cemetary, where Benny hit his trademark Bensault off the cemetary wall to become ACW Hardcore Heavyweight Champion! This match also featured the first balcony dive in ACW history, as White Chocolate eyepoked Benny Martinez off of a balcony during the match. However, Benny survived the fall and became champion.</p>

<p>At the advent of 2005, ACW opened up its own personal website utilizing its new name - <a href="http://www.acwfakefighting.com" class="external text" title="http://www.acwfakefighting.com" rel="nofollow">www.acwfakefighting.com</a>. ACW management decided to go in a different direction and take the name "wrestling" out of the title, but keep the name of a memorable past couple of years for ACW. Therefore the name <b>ACW Fake Fighting</b> was born, and was here to stay.</p>

<p>In January 2005, White Chocolate met O.D. for the first time in documented ACW history in a match to determine a new #1 Contender to Benny Martinez' newly won ACW Hardcore Heavyweight Championship. The most memorable spot of this very drunken encounter saw White Chocolate dive off of the balcony at the Forest Village Center and put O.D. through his new creation - <b>The Twelve Table Tower of Taboo</b>. Despite the damage done to O.D., he still managed to win the match, making White Chocolate submit to one of O.D.'s trademark moves - The Crippler Crossforehead.</p>
<p>This set the stage for ACW's first supercard event of 2005.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wu-Tang Triple Crown Championship: Nintendo [c] <u>def.</u> Hot Carl</li>
<li>White Chocolate <u>def.</u> Sid</li>
<li>Slick Rick <u>def.</u> Garlito Galapogos Gay</li>
<li>ACW Hardcore Heavyweight Championship: Benny Martinez [c] <u>def.</u> O.D.</li>
</ul>
<p>The opener of this event - held in February 2005 at the Forest Village Center - saw Nintendo defeat Hot Carl (thus continuing Hot Carl's winless streak) to retain the Wu-Tang Triple Crown Championship.</p>
<p>The second match was the first-ever White Chocolate Invitational, which saw the former three-time ACW Champion put his coveted 1992 Ellisville Athletic Association Little League Baseball Gold Medal on the line against any challenger. That challenger was former WWF and WCW Champion <b>Sid</b>. White Chocolate, however, had a plan as he pulled out a gun and shot Sid, allowing for an easy pinfall victory.</p>
<p>The third match was set up at <i>The Great Columbian Bash</i>, as Slick Rick wanted revenge for getting a lapdance from Garlito. Garlito's ACW in-ring debut was unsuccessful, as Slick Rick picked up the victory.</p>
<p>The evening's main event pitted Benny Martinez against O.D. for the first time ever in ACW history, and it was for the ACW Hardcore Heavyweight Championship. Slick Rick got involved with this match, looking to rekindle the old feud with O.D. - but he actually cheap-shotted Benny instead! Slick Rick and O.D. formed the <b>Teramizu</b> stable and O.D. pinned Benny Martinez to seemingly win the title.</p>
<p>However, Benny had a trick up his sleeve and got up to scream "I Won!" after the match. Amazingly enough, there was a clause in the contract for this match - The "I Won!" clause - that meant that Benny therefore retained the title! This didn't stop him from a beatdown, though.</p>

<p>ACW's next supercard was scheduled after the fallout from "No One Cares" - but, after nearly a year, still hasn't been held.</p>
