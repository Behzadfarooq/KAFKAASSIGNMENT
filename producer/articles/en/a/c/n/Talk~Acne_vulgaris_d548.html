<hr />
<p>Male hormones, secreted oil, and skin particles don't "cause" bacteria, so I have trouble with bacteria being labeled an effect of acne. In the absence of the bacteria, pimples don't appear. Also, in the case of benzoyl peroxide at least, treatment can't be considered finished (until the hormone/skin oil causes subside) and acne will reappear within days if treatment is stopped. <a href="../../../y/a/t/User%7EYath_6387.html" title="User:Yath">Yath</a> 17:08, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I guess whoever originally wrote that sentence meant to say that the bacteria are not the 'root cause' of the problem, as they are themselves caused by blockages in the hair follicles of the skin: without the blockages caused by the build-up of sebum, etc., there would be no bacteria, and consequently no pimples. I agree with you, though, that the text was a bit misleading as it was written. I've had a go at a rewrite, which (hopefully) is a bit clearer.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I also agree with what you say about about benzoyl peroxide treatment, and I've altered the text accordingly. <a href="../../../r/_/l/User%7ER_Lowry_a00e.html" title="User:R Lowry">R Lowry</a> 21:01, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wrote some of those changes, the bacteria is the result of other things, but without it, no pimple, so it is a cause. Killing the infection gets rid of the pimple. I agree with changes to what I wrote.--203.166.57.11 00:05, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm wondering whether it's the cause of things too- it wouldn't surprise me if the presence of the bacteria didn't damage the skin and thus cause the skin to make more sebum; the skin would be trying to protect itself from damage. But the bacteria eats the sebum and emits chemicals that cause even more damage, so it's a vicious circle.</p>

<p><i>Consumption of heat damaged foods. Proteins exposed to heat are altered in such a way that digestive enzymes are unable to break them down into constituent amino acids.

<p>Anybody heard about acne being reduced by sun exposure? I think I heard and read quite a bit about that in my time. It seems sun rays change the sebum chemically as well as plainly heating it and it can flow outwards easier.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've read (I can't remember the source, but it was scientific) that although sun exposure in the short-term reduces acne, by killing bacteria and heating the skin, long-term exposure weakens the skin's ability to fight bacteria. The skin is particularly helpless if sunburnt. For this reason, nearly all dermatologists strongly recommend that their patients, including acne-prone ones, wear sunscreen during extended sun exposure. --<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostLeviathan_302f.html" title="User:LostLeviathan">LostLeviathan</a> 05:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's a good news/bad news kind of deal.</p>
<p>The blue light in sunlight kills P.Acnes; this improves acne in the short-term.</p>
<p>However the UV light damages the skin, and then acne comes back worse than ever when P.Acnes recolonises.</p>
<p>I heard a claim that 90% of people had worse acne after sun exposure in the long term, but I have never tracked it back to the literature to check.</p>
<p>That's what the ClearLight/Dermalux lamps are about- they don't produce much if any UV light.</p>

<p>Okay, obviously the "sex/masturbation causes acne" myth needs to be addressed, but the current paragraph feels very uncertain. It states:</p>
<p><i>Sex. Rumours have had it that both celibacy and masturbation are causes for acne. This is not the case. It is notable however that masturbation and any other sexual activity affects hormone levels and thus bodily oil production.</i></p>
<p>My particular objection is to that last sentence, which contradicts the main sentence since it suggests that masturbating or not does have <i>some</i> effect on acne. Just for a start, are there any credible studies that show the effect masturbation has on hormone levels? If not, then that last sentence should be deleted. --<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostLeviathan_302f.html" title="User:LostLeviathan">LostLeviathan</a> 05:53, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems obvious to me that sexual arousal, as well as stress/anger, raises androgen levels and thus stimulates bodily oil production. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Stas_bfd3.html" title="User:Karl Stas">Karl Stas</a> 10:03, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But sexual arousal&#160;!= sex/masturbation. It's a tad difficult to suggest avoiding sexual arousal, stress and anger. So whether or not physical/emotional responses can affect hormone levels hardly bears any relevance to the question as to whether there's a correlation between sex/masturbation/celibacy and acne. â <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshmodai_83ab.html" title="User talk:Ashmodai">talk</a> Â· <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ashmodai_a208.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ashmodai">contribs</a>)</sup> 01:44, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re. acne and diet, I already can pinpoint the flaw of the study design. Perhaps the reason people who eat a bad diet have no significant different # of acne is because they can from a genetic basis. A better study design would be to have a prospective study on the effect of diet on the acne-prone people.

<dd>(Skim) milk <i>has</i> been linked to acne <a href="http://www.healthypages.net/newsstory.asp?newsid=4902" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.healthypages.net/newsstory.asp?newsid=4902" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Also, the absence of acne in non-westernized hunter-gatherer tribes, which cannot be explained by genetic factors, have led some researchers to speculate that a diet link to acne <i>does</i> exist. Dr. Alan C. Logan points to the low dietary omega-6âomega-3 ratio in these tribes, as well as to the absence of milk in their diet <a href="http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/139/7/942" class="external autonumber" title="http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/139/7/942" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This contradicts Perricone, who claims that fatty acids (such as omega 3) actually reduce acne. Milk, fish and seafood also contain iodine, which can also cause acne. IMHO, the whole "misconceptions" section should be rewritten because it is over-simplified (see also my remarks on acne and hygiene, acne and sex). <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Stas_bfd3.html" title="User:Karl Stas">Karl Stas</a> 13:11, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re: Re. acne and diet, more mention should be made of the study linking hunter-gatherer populations with no incidences of acne and a different diet in comparison to what most Westerners with acne eat. Also, the theory of IGF-1 and acne that researcher Loren Cordain has proposed should be addressed, which would make up a decent basis for a diet-acne connection.</p>

<p>Again, a "myth" in the article that I have some objection to. I've commented it out; the text read:</p>
<p><i>Acne is not caused by dirt... It</i> is <i>useful to clean your skin, but doing so will not prevent acne. Anything beyond very mild cleaning will make your skin worse because you'll damage it.</i></p>
<p>The last part is true; it is possible to clean excessively, irritating the skin and possibly increasing acne. But, how can it be claimed that cleaning your skin will not prevent acne? Can you name a dermatologist who does not recommend that acne patients wash their face on a regular basis? Furthermore, many things that the skin can be exposed to <i>do</i> cause acne. I'm not sure about "dirt" in the strict sense, but if your face is visibly dirty, I'd say the odds are good that something on it is comedogenic. Cleansing also can help reduce the cell build-up that clogs pores. Perhaps a better myth would be "It is impossible to clean your skin too much"? --<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostLeviathan_302f.html" title="User:LostLeviathan">LostLeviathan</a> 06:40, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Acne goes on about 2 mm below the surface of the skin within the tiny pores. It's essentially impossible to clean out the pores with any kind of cleanser. You cannot clean out or unclog the pores by washing- the pores are way too small.</p>

<dd>I never said that acne was caused by <i>dirt</i>. What I'm saying is that when a pore gets clogged, a comedone is formed, which may then get inflamed by the P.acnes bacteria. Contrary to what you say, the mechanisms underlying acne are fairly well understood. Androgens cause sebum overproduction. As a result, dead skin cells remain "glued" to the skin and start clogging the pores. A comedo (blackhead) or papule (small bump) is formed, which then gets inflamed by the P.acnes bacteria, naturally present on the skin.</dd>
<dd>There is some truth in you assertion that <i>excessive</i> washing stimulates sebum production and may overdry the skin. I concede that soaps and cleansers can also irritate the sebaceous glands, actually worsening acne. But this does not mean that acne patients should avoid washing their skin. I wash my skin twice a day with a mild, non-comedogenic cleanser containing a small percentage of salicylic and citric acid, to good effect. I would certainly recommend washing twice a day with lukewarm water.</dd>
<dd>I'm not convinced that skin oil actually protects against UV light, as you seem to imply. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Stas_bfd3.html" title="User:Karl Stas">Karl Stas</a> 09:57, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't directly. Washing removes the top layer of dead skin for a day or so, this normally protects the skin from the sun (SPF2-3 IRC). Hence washing increases any sunlight damage that may occur. And other common acne medications do a pretty thorough job of this too- Benzoyl peroxide for example- the FDA ended up adding a safety notice about this, after it had been on the market for years.</dd>

<p>I'm really confused now. When you say the hair follicle are blocked, do you mean inside it, kind of like say a golf ball in a garden hose, if it was stuck at one of the ends it could be pulled out, but not if it was furthur down?</p>
<p>It seems to me the main problem is the blocked hair follicle. I was on acne medication once- minocin, which was to kill the bacteria in blocked pores (which I did not follow religiously, but it eventually went away), but what good would that do if the follicle is blocked and the same thing could start again. Unless, however, that the sebum would eventually build up pressure and push the blockage out. That it's the bacteria that cause pustules and red spots, and that's only if they are in the follicle before it gets blocked. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_snare_e22d.html" title="User:The snare">The snare</a> 19:55, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Benzoyl peroxide and the topical retinoids may be the best compromise between cost effectiveness and genuine effectiveness and negative side effects in many cases.</i></p>
<p>I would like to see a source for this recommendation â it seems questionable to me. Benzoyl peroxide has a peeling effect, and tends to dry the skin somewhat. Topical retinoids can also cause dryness, redness, and skin irritation. Using two such products in combination may, conceivably, make the problem of acne even worse by over-drying the skin.</p>
<p>The patient information leaflet for Retin-A recommends (and this is a direct quote) not using "skin peeling agents or toiletries which have a strong drying effect on your skin" in conjunction with the product.</p>
<p>So -- is this a reputable recommendation, or is it just something that someone posted here without thinking about the possible consequences for other people? <a href="../../../r/_/l/User%7ER_Lowry_a00e.html" title="User:R Lowry">R Lowry</a> 06:25, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wouldn't say it was indefensible. Benzoyl peroxide, at least, is relatively cheap and effective in most cases of mild acne. Also, its side effects are less severe than Roaccutane: it bleaches textiles and may cause dry skin, shedding or redness. Retinoids like Adapalene are more expensive and nobody seems to know exactly how they are supposed to work. Adapalene didn't work for me, but had no serious side effects either. Roaccutane (isotretinoin) is no doubt the most effective acne treatment, but it has rather severe side effects and it's expensive. It is therefor recommended only as a "last resort" treatment. - <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Stas_bfd3.html" title="User:Karl Stas">Karl Stas</a> 07:42, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This poll is misguided. popping a pimple doesn't remove it and isn't a treatment for acne anyway. It leaves an irritated, infected lesion, increases scarring and doesn't clear up the acne. In addition, there is the danger that the pus will get forced under the skin or deeper into the pore, worsening the infection. Here in the UK, dermatologists still recommend against popping pimples (I talked to my mother, who is a dermatologist, about this once) and they're usually not paid for treating patients. On the contrary, they'd rather not pay for the treatment. I think this poll is missing the point. Popping pimples may be the fastest way of relieving immediate pain from a pimple, but it does not 'remove' it and does nothing to prevent others. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthflux_0692.html" title="User:Truthflux">Mike C</a> | <a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthflux_8442.html" title="User talk:Truthflux">talk</a> 09:15, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps what he meant to say is, "What is the fastest way to get rid of a whitehead?" I'd like to know this as well. Popping obviously gets rid of it immediately, and over-the-counter treatments like Clearasil claim 3 days. I think it's really the whiteheads and shininess that bother people the most, not necessarily just the red spots. Oh, and I wouldn't recommend this as a great way to treat acne, but I'm currently receiving chemotherapy for <a href="../../../h/o/d/Hodgkin%27s_Disease_a70a.html" title="Hodgkin's Disease">Hodgkin's Disease</a>, and by golly my acne cleared right up!&#160;:) I just hope it stays that way after I'm done with the chemo... --<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdhombre_7569.html" title="User:Birdhombre">Birdhombre</a> 17:49, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a new ingredient on the market called Praventin, which supports a clear complexion from the inside Praventin â¢ is a bioactive protein complex rich in Lactoferrin, and derived from whey. It is patent pending for an application in supporting a clear complexion by enhancing the bodyâs natural defenses. In a recent consumer study with teenagers it was demonstrated that oral supplementation with Praventinâ¢ promoted a clear complexion, as assessed in table 1. Oral supplementation with Praventinâ¢ resulted in a considerable improvement in skin condition. In table 2 a median decrease of 71% in blemishes after one month and 95% after two months is reported. Improvements were observed regardless of gender, age, or baseline appearance. Two weeks of Praventinâ¢ use resulted in a clearer complexion, as illustrated in figures 1 and 2. The 44 teenagers were asked a set of questions about how they believed Praventinâ¢ had supported skin health. â¢ 76% saw visible differences in their complexion, among them were fewer blemishes, a reduction in redness, and less oiliness, consistent with a healthier complexion. â¢ 83% stated they would like to continue taking Praventinâ¢. The subjects reported no adverse side effects. As demonstrated in the study, Praventinâ¢ can be used to support a clear complexion benefiting the physical and emotional well-being of young adults.</p>

<p>I also have reservations about the following passage added by the same anonymous user: "The most likely mechanism of plugging is a failure of terminal differentiation, the same process whereby leaves undergo a metabolic process that separates them from their twig or stem. Failure of this process may be linked to the anoxia produced by increased pressure in the lumen of the duct. This pressure in turn is produced by the hormone-induced overproduction of the duct lining cells. There is a very tight wrap around the duct preventing over-expansion, so internal pressures are thought to build up as a result. There is to date only circumstantial evidence to support this explanation but there is no conclusive proof of this theory." No reference is given. The language is very academic, I suspect a copyvio. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Stas_bfd3.html" title="User:Karl Stas">Karl Stas</a> 21:16, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>. However, if you must pop a pimple make sure that the yellow pus is above the skin level. To do it safely without leaving any scar tissue, clean the area around the acne with a liquid antiseptic to minimize the risk of contamination. Then take a needle and sterilize it with alcohol and run it briefly through a flame to make sure the remaining microbes are dead. Next, take the sterilized needle and gently prick the top of the pimple's surface carefully enough not to poke it too far. Finally, use a clean piece of gauze, hold it over the pricked pimple, and apply gentle pressure on the sides of the pimple to extract the infected pus. If the pus does not come out with minimal pressure, then STOP immediately! Do not forget to apply an antibiotic ointment on the acne after doing this.</p>

<p><b>Anything beyond very gentle cleansing can actually worsen existing lesions and even encourage new ones by damaging or overdrying skin.</b></p>
<p>But on the other hand:</p>
<p><b>Exfoliating the skin. This can be done either mechanically, using an abrasive cloth or a liquid scrub...</b></p>
<p>What gives? Are we to scrub rougly? Or not to scrub at all?</p>

<dl>
<dd>However, this does not prove that such foods aggrovate already present acne. Foods high in sugars and fats can increase sebum production, and other foods can affect hormone production.</dd>
<dd>Spicy foods and such like can affect the intestines and the proper disposal of toxins, causing a buildup of toxins in the blood, which can aggrovate acne. Diet then, it seems, is not sufficient in causing Acne but does aggrovate the condition in someone who already has acne, or is genetically predisposed to it. To say diet does not affect Acne at all is ignorant.</dd>
<dd>Foods with a low glycemic index like wholemeals reduce sugar rushes in the body and keep sebum production in balance (it is necessary for some sebum to be produced to keep the skin moisturised). Foods that aid in digestion like fruits and vegetables maintain the balance in the gut, helping the breakdown and removal of toxins and prevent them from entering the blood. They also contain vitamins and minerals that aid in the proper functioning of the bodies tissues and organs. Herbs like milk thistle, red clover, burdock and dandelion help to detoxify the liver. It has been sugested that acne ultimately arises from improper liver functions which are not able to maintain sugar levels in the blood and to remove toxins efficiently. Toxins build up in the blood and sebum is overproduced. These two factors combine to produce Acne.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The possible role of high-glycemic foods is already mentioned in the article. The uncorroborated claim that a "buildup of toxins in the blood" can aggravate acne seems dubious. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Stas_bfd3.html" title="User:Karl Stas">Karl Stas</a> 16:35, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know about anyone else, but i'm i the only one who seems to have noticed that Acne.org is a COMMERCIAL LINK.....here is a direct quote from the site "Drugstore.com gives me 10% of every order made from this page. Please bookmark this page for future orders. Currently the bandwidth charges for acne.org are around $1000 per month". Now if this seems to be ok with everyone, why not other commercial sites or a site with some guy with excellent marterail but has a few google adds on it.</p>
<p>Come on people...........Acne.org is a commerical site for the purposes of making profit, So why in the world is it added to external link section everywhere??????</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess we have to look at whether it adds to the information in the article or not. The information on precisely how to use benzoyl peroxide correctly- I've personally seen this nowhere else. And I don't find it to be heavily commercial. The guy 'Dan' who runs it does make money from the site and from a <b>dirt-cheap</b> benzoyl peroxide he sells. But he's not pushing it down people's throats to my estimation, and he also links to other guys products that he makes no money on. If you type 'acne' into google -that's the first link; and I don't have a sense that they've paid to be there, that should tell you something. Still, the guy has to pay for the bandwidth somehow I guess. *If* the article subsumes the information on BP usage, then I would agree to remove it; otherwise I don't feel it should be removed right now.

<dd>acne.org promotes its own programme, and I would suggest that single individual's websites are generally inappropriate for wikipedia.
<dl>
<dd>There's absolutely no wikipedia rule against linking to single individual's websites- you just made that up. And it's a .org, not a .com website.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 02:52, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not claiming its any wikipeda rule, I just personally think commercial sites rarely add additional information that is of greater benefit than the free advertising they get, unless the article specifically is about that company (eg Coca Cola, The Atkins Diet, Walmart) or has special notability.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 04:38, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Look, as a very close analogy, the wikipedia links to Atkins sites. Atkins has a diet regimen and make money from their diet too. This is no different. Except <i>he's not even charging to find out what his regimen is, he's got free videos and information telling you it exactly.</i> The regimen is just a way to use standard benzoyl peroxide you can buy in any chemist/drug store, so that it works well. <i>But you don't have to buy anything from him at all.</i> So he has a regimen, and he sells supplies you could use, <i>or not</i>, big deal. This is not bad or wrong. I don't see that this is really what the commercial rule is talking about.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 02:52, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm less worried (re right or wrong) about an individual's site trying to help others, its more that I see a problem of notability or of giving especially good additional information to a wikipedia article. To put it another way, what is so special about this site compared to the other 2,240,000 hits from a search for 'Acne support' on Google&#160;? Hence the point I raised next about larger national organisations being preferable in my opinion - as they have multiple sources of info (review of current research articles, patient-written factsheets, input from professionals (dermatologists, paediatricians, specialist nurses, school nurses etc), surveys carried out by the group, and sufferers writing to ensure patient-useful information and support).</dd>
<dd>As far as acne.org goes, it credits its nice pictures from the NIH site, but that site (<a href="http://www.niams.nih.gov/hi/topics/acne/acne.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.niams.nih.gov/hi/topics/acne/acne.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.niams.nih.gov/hi/topics/acne/acne.htm</a>) has more information.
<dl>
<dd>It has information on the disease of acne, but far less on using BP.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 08:10, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I disagree that acne.org suggests a better technique for using BP; the advice to build up gradually and apply after washing is included in its prescribing datasheets &amp; product information sheet (or at least it is in the UK). The site correctly, and with care to emphasise, urges people to build up its use slowly (once a day and then increase frequency), but to my patients I stress an even slower build up (apply for just 2 hours for a couple days then increase by 2hours every 2 days until can apply and leave on overnight). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 04:38, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's not precisely the way he tells you to do it, and I'm not convinced that your way works as well. 2.5% is much easier to aclimatise to anyway, and upping it a couple of hours a day is probably overkill, so the person gets more acne in the meantime. 5% BP was far worse like that. You also failed to mention when and how to use moisturiser. These little details make BP work much better and reduce side effects (that frequently stop people using BP). There's also quite a few issues around what kind of moisturiser to use, how much of that to use; as well as exactly how much BP to use at each stage. This stuff may very well be explained in detail elsewhere on the web, but I haven't seen it. It's all a rather delicate balancing act between frying the bug and not frying your skin.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 08:10, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not why its being linked though. It's just subtleties of what is presented, that I don't think you've fully grasped.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 08:10, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Look, I'm cool with it being removed, but to get there we need to either explain a detailed BP application guide in the wiki or link to it.

<dd>A National Acne/Dermatology patient group which is non-commercial &amp; non-profit making would be better, but still questionable to fill up wikipedia with these. They give secondary rather than primary sources of data, so unless they are exceptionally good, are generally not helpful to expand on articles (anyone is free to do searches with Google). If the aim is to allow people to contact local support groups (vs provide additonal info) then remember wikipedia is not just for US or UK readers and we surely are not going to start to list for all conditions all support orgs in all English speaking countries (Canada, Carribean, Ireland, Australia, NZ, UK, etc, or even for each separate USA state org)&#160;?</dd>
<dd>Might I propose that any suggestions for additonal links require active support from other editors (rather than assume passive agreement if no-one bothers to comment)&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 01:50, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The hidden comment on the Links section requests discussion before adding new links (yes I was probably being was a little pedantic by not applying this to decision to delete), but there is little more than just a single proposer for each of the proposed links on this talk page.

<li>re Acne.org - Hmmm, you are winning me around. I would though include the site not under External links, but rather as a Reference to a modified BP last sentance of: <i>"It may though cause local irritation and dryness, so should be introducted slowly"</i>. I would be very apprehensive about specifying in wikipedia <i>"and also apply moisturisers"</i>, for the wrong product could end up blocking pores even further. I can't see how to add cautions about this and indicate what might be the correct type of moisturiser, without an inappropriately overly-long explanation, the quick solution is a reference. I also suggest linking not to the site's homepage as for an External Link, but as a reference directly to the advice at <a href="http://www.acne.org/regimen-instructions.html" class="external free" title="http://www.acne.org/regimen-instructions.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.acne.org/regimen-instructions.html</a> (or its preceeding page). PS indeed always start at 2.5%&#160;:-)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>re acne-resource.org - dispite its '.org' web name, it is just a misleading, alarmist, biased push to Truderma cloaked in support-information respectability
<ul>
<li>Its published by DTC Health whose own <a href="http://www.dtchealth.com" class="external free" title="http://www.dtchealth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dtchealth.com</a> site lists Truderm as one of their products.</li>
<li>Truderm is just an expensive multistage cleanser, exfoliator, &amp; toner before "<a href="http://www.truderma.com/about-truderma/miracles-benzoyl-peroxide.html" class="external text" title="http://www.truderma.com/about-truderma/miracles-benzoyl-peroxide.html" rel="nofollow">The Miracles of Benzoyl Peroxide</a>" 2.5% &amp; salycylic acid.</li>
<li>For example of push see the product <a href="http://www.acne-resource.org/acne-articles/acne-comparison.html" class="external text" title="http://www.acne-resource.org/acne-articles/acne-comparison.html" rel="nofollow">comparison</a>'s "TrudermaÂ® comes out on top once again" (hardly surprising statement from the manufacturer) against just salicylic acid, roaccutane &amp; retin-A, and seems to suggest only product warnings, cost, side-effects (repeating that of the warnings) distinguishes these with no indication of appropriateness for mild or severe degrees of acne.</li>
<li>On the <a href="http://www.acne-resource.org/how-to-prevent/prevent-index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.acne-resource.org/how-to-prevent/prevent-index.html" rel="nofollow">prevention</a> page the link titled 'Prescription Medications for Ane' infact goes to another version of <a href="http://www.acne-resource.org/how-to-prevent/prevention-acneFIXXX-MAY%20BE%20DUPLICATE%20COPY.html" class="external text" title="http://www.acne-resource.org/how-to-prevent/prevention-acneFIXXX-MAY%20BE%20DUPLICATE%20COPY.html" rel="nofollow">Prevention</a> where it states "Vitamin supplements play a major part in preventing and treating acne" - this is unsubstantiated, has no scientific basis and would be disputed by most doctors.</li>
<li>Finally under <a href="http://www.acne-resource.org/how-to-prevent/prescription-dangers.html" class="external text" title="http://www.acne-resource.org/how-to-prevent/prescription-dangers.html" rel="nofollow">The Potential Dangers of Prescription Medications</a> I am not surprised to see it leading with Isotretinoin and highlighting the most severe side-effect first, then a 'Drug-Free / Safer Options' section again plugging Truderm, before moving on to the risks of antiobiotics &amp; hormonal therapy.</li>
<li>Acne-resource.org is not impartial, indeed see the disclaimer at the bottom of each page <i>"These statements have not been evaluated by the food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease"</i> - the use of the word 'This' (singular) shows the legal status of this promotional site.</li>
<li>So in summary, I think whilst some of the description is OK, much of the advice is wrong or cosmetics-industry biased, the review of treatments misleading &amp; alarmist and the site little more than a commercial company's plug. This is a bad site to include in our article <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 13:58, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have been persuaded of merits of acne.org (see above) - the description on shaving/wash/BP application routine is a good guide and makes no direct mention of his bulk-sized cheep product in the discussion.</dd>
<dd>I have though in expanding the info on BP use (including the relevant subpage vs homepage of acne.org as I had suggested above), transfered the references given to the newer <b>&lt;ref name="xxx"&gt; reference details &amp; links &lt;/ref&gt;</b> style. It makes reading the article in edit mode somewhat clumsy, but allows for duplicate references to the same reference and requires no manual ordering in the reference section as this is done for one with the markup <b>&lt;references/&gt;</b>&#160;:-) The article now has full details of its references rather than having to follow a link to find out.</dd>
<dd>To generate the PubMed reference details I used an automated tool, see description in WikiProject Clinical Medicine (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Clinical_medicine#References" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Clinical_medicine#References" rel="nofollow">here</a>) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 02:33, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManjubalaw_e2eb.html" title="User:Manjubalaw">Manjubalaw</a> "...wrong eating habits and chronic constipation" I dont think its nonsense....Irregular hours of eating, excessive starch consumption, too much of sugar, fried and fatty foods are also common causes of acne. Chronic constipation is another cause of acne vulgaris. If the bowels do not move properly, the waste matter is not eliminated as quickly as it should be and the bloodstream becomes surcharged with toxic matter. The extra efforts of the skin to eliminate excess waste result in acne and other forms of skin diseases.</p>
<p>I propose to add the largest non-profit <a href="http://www.acneisdead.com" class="external text" title="http://www.acneisdead.com" rel="nofollow">acne home remedy</a>website currently on the internet.

<p>In the recent votes, 5 voted for redirect and 3 for merge. A single sentance definition is all that is required - the rest seems uncited drivel: whilst it may describe acne being on the back, it needs verification that it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>hereditary ? Needs citing that to a greater degree than acne vulgaris is weakly associated</li>
<li>is a disctinct condition</li>
<li>needs distinct treatment (acne over face + neck + upper chest is equally as extensive and likely to be easier to treat with single oral antibiotic capsule a day vs cream applied twice a day).</li>
<li>more resistant to treatment - nonsense, there is nothing unique at this location in the body. Yes the skin is thicker and makes penetration by topical agents harder, but skin thickness variation is not unique to the back. The skin thickness varies over the face * upper chest too and may require different topical "aggressiveness" in the thicker ares and a "lighter" approach in the thinner areas. (we don't distinguish acne on the thinner skin of the temples from that on the cheeks)</li>
<li><i>"Bacne is also one of the many side effects of steroid usage"</i> - why single this out for duplicate mention (already covered in <a href="../../../a/c/n/Acne.html#Causes_of_acne" title="Acne">Acne#Causes of acne</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>A quick search for 'Bacne' indicates on Google 26,100 hits of which the top listing sites are for the more cosmetic/advertising-linked sites that this article has already had edit conflicts over, wikiditionary &amp; wikipedia itself. This is just over 0.07% of the 36,000,000 hits for acne itself. Finally PubMed (listing of much of world's medical journals/research) gave an impressive <b>0</b> hits !</p>
<p>Lets mention that acne on the back may require stronger topical agents in response to this area's thicker skin and that oral agents may therefore prove more effective and be easier to comply with, than trying to apply topical creams to this inaccessable location (depending upon whow flexible one is !). The rest, I think, should be copyedited out as duplication &amp;/or speculation. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 17:34, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have mild to moderate acne, but I had this one deep-rooted zit that just wouldn't go away despite the topicals and anti-biotics.

<dd>I don't think it would be relevant to add to the article. Cortisone was used in the senario you described to calm down a single specific chronically inflammed area within the skin. One might similarly so treat <a href="../../../k/e/l/Keloid_scar.html" title="Keloid scar">keloid scar</a> formation or a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granuloma.html" title="Granuloma">granuloma</a>. However it is not treating a person's overall acne, indeed more general steroid application as a cream over the whole face does not form part of acne treatement, and I suspect would in the longterm both worsen the condition as well as causing the well recognised steroid skin thinning. High enough doses of steroids by mouth can cause <a href="../../../c/u/s/Cushing%27s_syndrome.html" title="Cushing's syndrome">Cushing's syndrome</a>, one of whose features is development of acne. Hence I don't think a specific decission by your dermatologist, to treat a specific complication from acne, needs form part of a general encyclopaedic entry. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 13:44, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, did not mean to suggest unusual or off-license use of a drug, but it is uncommon (vs all the patients who are successfully treated within General Practice and never need to see a dermatologist or ever then require this), and applied to an individual spot rather than to the overall acne a patient might have.

<dd>Aside from the fact that wikipedia does not give medical advice.... I think this is wrong place although not sure where to relocate for now. If a patient were to pick at an acne spot and develop a secondary staphloccus infection requiring <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flucloxacillin.html" title="Flucloxacillin">flucloxacillin</a> antibiotic, this is a specific treatment for an infrequent complication. Yet flucloxacillin has no effect on the general progress of a patient's acne, and it not included in current list of antibitics used in the normal treatment of acne. Likewise the main treatment group of "Hormonal" is/was about overall manipulating a patient's acne through use of the contraceptive pill or anti-androgen hormones. I'm tempted to move the paragraph to the section on treatment for acne scars, although the point of local steroid injection is to pre-empt scar formation. Perhaps a new section prior to that mentioning both local steroid injection and antibiotics for secondary infections (i.e. a sort of 'misalaneous treatment section') ? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 04:46, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does it seem to anyone else that acne, which common and "natural" in the 21st century, is totally absent from man's history overall? When was the last time you saw an old (pre-1900) picture of someone with acne? When have you seen cures for it in ads in old (19th century or earlier) newspapers? Where is it mentioned in old/ancient medicine? What about in literature? You would expect an event so "essential" to adolescence to have appeared as a rite of passage in <i>some</i> culture, but there is no mention of it!</p>
<p>So, does anybody have any information on why acne might not have appeared until around the 20th century? <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.174.244.253 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.174.244.253_87aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.174.244.253">contribs</a>) 03:09, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>There's a mention of pigmentation "scars" in the article - I think this is called "hyperpigmentation" by dermatologists and applications of Hydroquinone or another skin-lightening chemical will improve the skin's appearance over time. Does anyone know of an actual medical article to cite for this?
