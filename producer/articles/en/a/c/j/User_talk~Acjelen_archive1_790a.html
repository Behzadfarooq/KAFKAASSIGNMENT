<p>Dude.</p>
<p>Clearly it's OK to write "After Lawrence graduated him," but that's NOT the prevalent style among professional writers. It's ridiculous to imply that the intransitive "graduating" does not convey meaning equal to your antiquated transitive. The intransitive incorporates the same meaning with better effect, preserving Sawyer as subject and thus balancing the sentence. Yes, this style is subjective, but the consensus of stylebooks and the world's best journalists suggest mine was the better choice.</p>
<p>Pedantically yours,</p>
<p>(insert smiley here)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wow. Journalists. I guess I don't give a lot of weight or credence to the opinions of the "Fourth Estate". Nonetheless, I'm obviously on the losing side of this issue. Perhaps my next thing will be the equally misguided use of "technology". -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 06:21, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>EDIT: This is not about politics, so don't let your biases cloud your judgment. I'd hope that as a librarian you'd recognize that news stories are easy to quantify, and, more importantly, you'd understand that (most) journalists know a fair bit about the craft of writing. Some probably even penned novels and essays on your shelves.</p>
<p>Or don't. Ignore convention. I'm sure Wikipedia will make an excellent literary stylebook.</p>
<dl>
<dd>My concerns with journalists are not political, at least not in any right-left kind of way. I just don't see the press as a separate class (or "estate") in society to be afforded special privileges or granted power over language. If the Associated Press has a special way it wants its writers to use English, that's fine. I'm not sure why I or any other non-AP writer needs to know about it. Of course, I may take things to the extreme. I had to take fewer anthropology courses in college because I refused to use APA citation style. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 20:11, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>EDIT2: This begs the question: what sources guide your decisions? Intuition? During this discussion your complaints have evolved (first grammar then meaning then you throw in a non-sequitur about the opinions of journalists) but you've not cited a single source related to word usage.</p>
<p>AP style is not a "special class." Hogwash. I referenced it because it's universally accepted, it's easy to document and it facilitates clear &amp; concise writing. I also cited Merriam-Webster usage but you continue to ignore that. I imagine it wouldn't be difficult to find similar agreement in the OED or some other elitist reference work.</p>
<p>So I'll ask again: what resources led you to your initial correction of the term "graduating"?</p>
<p>Incidentally, I'm also curious to know if there is an accepted stylebook for Wikipedia--other than intuition, that is.</p>

MERRIAM-WEBSTER ONLINE(<a href="http://tinyurl.com/b5qet" class="external free" title="http://tinyurl.com/b5qet" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/b5qet</a>): "USAGE: In the 19th century the transitive sense (1a) was prescribed; the intransitive 'I graduated from college' was condemned. The intransitive prevailed nonetheless, and today it is the sense likely to be prescribed and the newer transitive (sense 1b) the one condemned. All three are standard. The intransitive is currently the most common, the new transitive the least common."</p>

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS STYLEBOOK AND LIBEL MANUAL: "Graduate is correctly used in the active voice: She graduated from the university.

The article in question is Melissadolbeer's original research based on an account by <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome.html" title="Jerome">Jerome</a> which is almost universally considered to be an error confusing 3 different gospels (<a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Nazarenes_878c.html" title="Gospel of the Nazarenes">Gospel of the Nazarenes</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a>, and <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Ebionites_858f.html" title="Gospel of the Ebionites">Gospel of the Ebionites</a>). It also contains material presenting <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eusebius.html" title="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>'s views of what was <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Canon_d086.html" title="Biblical Canon">Biblical Canon</a> - better discussed at those two articles, and the entire source text of the alleged Gospel, which is otherwise almost universally split into the 3 seperate texts above. The source text was already on WikiSource, and what was salvagable from the remainder of the article was merged to the above 5 articles, and <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a>, at the suggestion of <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">User:Wetman</a>. It exists only to support Melissadolbeer's original research thesis. Melissadolbeer's claims of abuse against me, 81.156.177.21, doc, Slrubenstien, etc. are simply down to the fact that we have at one time or another merged the article elsewhere leaving only a redirect, or have voted to delete it at VFD. The above comment by the sockpuppet has been pasted by it into a vast number of user pages, an act which essentially constitutes excessive disruption to Wikipedia, simply because Melissadolbeer refuses to abide by the process of VFD. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 19:09, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if the law actually says that anywhere in so many words. However this seems to be a reasonable inference that can be drawn from some of the people who held this title e.g. younger brothers of first-born sons who died young. Also under the normal laws of succession of all titles, if the Duke predeceases the monarch but leaves children, the title goes to his oldest surviving son. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 10:47, 2005 Apr 10 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dang. My apologies for taking like a month to get back to you. I oughta log in more often&#160;:p</p>
<p>Anywho, yes, those two are among the cities given credence as possible birthplaces of Memorial Day. What in reality was happening is that the country was recovering from a war that resulted in a staggering loss of life. Many found similar ways to commemorate the dead and celebrate the end of the bloody and brutal conflict, and that's why so many cities claim to be the holiday's birthplace. The two given the most official notice are Waterloo and Boalsburg; Boalsburg for being one of the earliest cited celebrations and Waterloo for being the first to make it an official citywide holiday. In regards to Charleston, from a paper I recently wrote on the topic:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>These small town accounts are far from definitive. In contrast, historian David Blight cites the first major celebration of something resembling what came to be called Decoration Day as occurring in Charleston, South Carolina, on May 1, 1865. The ceremony was carefully planned and incredibly elaborate. Beginning about a week before, freedmen began converting a local symbol of white power and the Southern aristocracy â the plantersâ track â into a graveyard for former slaves who died fighting for freedom. The ceremony was specifically tailored so that it would be ââ¦as South Carolina and the United States never saw before;â those involved wanted to make it so grandiose that it might leave an impression on all those who would see it. It took place at the track on May 1, 1865, beginning with three thousand newly freed school children marching around the track, singing John Brownâs Body, and carrying armfuls of roses. Three hundred newly freed women followed the children carrying baskets of flowers, wreaths, and crosses. The adults marched around the track while the children sang patriotic songs, and then a very serious, complex, and lengthy dedication was given by local ministers. The entire procession was a simultaneous celebration of freedom and mourning for those who had been lost. --<a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthpaw018_4bcc.html" title="User:Southpaw018">Southpaw018</a> 00:32, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The law isn't as prescriptive as to say "everyone must have their father's surname", but it's certainly governed by the law to some extent. For instance, if a man and woman with children divorce and the woman is given sole custody of the children, she cannot change the children's surnames to her maiden name, as the courts will not let the children have their patronymic surname taken away for no good reason. And if a husband and wife who have not taken the same surname have children, the children automatically have the father's surname, and a court order would be required if the parents wished otherwise. Once people are adults, of course, they can take whatever surname they want. But in any case, using a title as a surname does not indicate that the person concerned actually thinks it is a surname. It is common practice amongst the British nobility in informal situations to use the title as a last name: "John Smith, 7th Viscount Somewhere" will often call himself "John Somewhere" amongst friends. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 6 July 2005 08:43 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would guess that amongst friends, he will simply be "John". Whereas, truly, in some semi-official situations, he will be "Somewhere" or "John Somewhere". Queen Vixtoria's dad signed himself as "Kent and Strathearn" (without first name, without any more surnames nor titles). <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 7 July 2005 13:05 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, the version you have looks more organized, and it has everything it needs from the original article. It's true that the important thing is that we give all of the information about the term, despite what some people what to leave out. If you put up that article, things should be fine - and if anyone has a problem with it because they want to ignore some of the facts, that's too bad!

<p>Hi Ac-this is good to see, and in my opinion you're taking this article in the right direction.

<li>In retrospect, the article is not too badly organised as it is. The page, I think you would agree, is now definately a disambiguaion page. However, even though english is my native language, when trying to decipher various meanings of a word, I never use "noun" or adjective". I can see the advantage of using these, as to remove any preduduce in the order of entries, but I find it confusing. The "See also" section is not really for free assoctiaion. I will make some minor changes, and perhaps you can adjust them for me. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 05:06, August 23, 2005 (UTC)

<p>I can see a plausible editoral case that "USAian" isn't necessary in describing the Miller test, since readers can click on the link to find out the USA-only jurisdiction (I don't agree, since I think indicating jurisdicational scope is worthwhile to mention in that sentence; I'll leave the edit though).</p>
<p>But what on earth could make the adjective "ridiculous" or "offensive"?! Are you one of those people with a strange antipathy towards towards the adjective? I've encountered some people who believe falsely that the neologism is recent of "hackerish" (it actually dates back about 150 years, though never in predominant use). Or do you think it self-evident to all the world that everyone knows the Miller test is a USA thing?

<p>Are you sure it's better that way?..... without my explanation it just seems like that's randomly in there and out of place. This is because people who don't know much about Jesus don't know that this happened just before Christ's death.</p>

<p>Hello Acjelen. I am not a new anonymous user, I have edited the Jesus article and other articles many 1000s of times.&#160;:) Secondly don't remove the Islam info from the intro. The intro is meant to summarize what is coming in the rest of the article. So you either move the repeated info of Christianity too or you leave both Islam and Christianity in the lead sentence. Both religions hold importance to Jesus and saying that the reference to Islam should be shortened to insignificance is biased. Thanks. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 04:35, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I cannot imagine that I was the first Wikipedian to call you "anonymous user" instead of "anonymous editor". I have not removed the Islam info from the intro. The intro is very long (a good five or six paragraphs) and Islam is treated very well, too good for some editors in the last couple of days. I suppose Islam should be mentioned in the first paragraph, but the paragraph on Islam later in the intro needs to stay. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 04:47, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay hope you are done writing this time. So the paragraphs are fine then. Also, I think that irrelevant info about Christology is not necessary in the intro? Especially because it does not fit into the paragraph and can go later into the article. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 04:50, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see how Christology doesn't belong in the intro to the Jesus article. Anyway, the point of that paragraph is to keep the debate about whether Jesus is God or not out of the "other gospel claims" article. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 04:51, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What do you mean? Christology does not fit into the paragraph at all and really isn't something that should be put into an intro. It can come later in the article such as in the Life and teachings section. My main concern with you was the removal and movement of Islam information, a religion in which he is also of major significance. Aside from that if you have small edits to make that do not move the paragraphs or remove Islam info that is fine with me. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 04:54, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I keep changing the paragraphs around because I've been editing the Jesus article for the last couple of days, though it has been one of the most stressful things I've done. It seems to me that one should finish a treatment of claims or arguments about Jesus in Christianity before treating Jesus in Islam. Since the intro is making Christological statements about Jesus, it might as well mention Christology. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 05:06, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I mentioned the christology info in the intro of the section below since that section describes his life. Secondly the last paragraph of the intro shows how perspectives of Jesus vary in not only christianity but in other religions (such as Judaism) too. That is the point of the last paragraph. The second and third paragraph are filled with info about Jesus in christianity. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 05:09, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
