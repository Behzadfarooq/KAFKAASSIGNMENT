<p>I've restored the "urban legend" of forced name changes, with an explanation that it is, indeed, largely an urban legend (but with the caveat that some immigrants did adopt Anglicized names upon entering the U.S.).

<dd>That's cool. As a librarian, it is always nice to hear about others' pleasures in discovery through research. The Norwegian immigrant family in my own background changed their first names to appear more English. For a family last name (as they hadn't had one before), they used the Anglicized version of the wife's brother's last name. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 17:23, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Because the image used is specifically the flag of Quebec I renamed the template from "French Canadian" to Quebecois. It's not entirely the same thing since there are small numbers of French speakers in other provinces, but I'm not sure what image or symbol you could use to represent French Canadians in general. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 08:09, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I noticed that. Thank you. Very quickly fixed, if you don't mind me saying. Aren't French Canadians generally of Quebecois ancestry? I suppose a French-speaking Canadian who does not trace his ancestry to Quebec could create another template with that ancestry: Haitian, Algerian, and so forth. The provinces all have their own <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Canadian_decb.html#French-Canadian_flags" title="French Canadian">French-Canadian flags</a>, but there doesn't seem to be a general one. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 08:17, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The overwhelming majority of French Canadians are in Quebec, but historically the presence of French speakers in other provinces predated the establishment of Canada as a country and the modern provincial boundaries. However I believe that presence is numerically small and steadily declining percentagewise in most areas outside Quebec. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 10:03, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My own grandfather was born in Manitoba, but his ancestors were from Quebec. Someone did note on the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template_talk%7EUser_Quebecois_be3a.html" title="Template talk:User Quebecois">template talk</a> that Acadians living in Canada today are French-Canadian without being Quebecois. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 10:13, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings from the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Great White North</a>! I hope you're well. I apologise for having to change and revert your compromise at <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="America (disambiguation)">America</a>: however, a spurious listing of multiple items <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">unnecessarily complicates the issue and term</a>. In a disambig page, we needn't list <i>every</i> possible constituent (geographic or ethnocultural) of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">Americas</a> – e.g., <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_America_31c5.html" title="Middle America">Middle America</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, <a href="../../../i/b/e/Ibero-America_e0eb.html" title="Ibero-America">Ibero-America</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-America_aae9.html" title="Anglo-America">Anglo-America</a>, et al. – only those that will help clarify possible ambiguity. In this instance, this is only true (geographically) for:</p>
<dl>
<dd>(1) the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">two</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continents</a> and associated lands in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Hemisphere_4a04.html" title="Western Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a>, and</dd>
<dd>(2) <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">the country</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In support of this, both the Oxford and Webster's dictionaries list <i>only</i> <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a> as constituents of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a>/America without at all elaborating, as do any number of atlases. So, even indicating <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central America</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_America_144f.html" title="Northern America">Northern America</a>, et al. may be excessive. Similarly, a visitor can consult the relevant links to learn more about the various definitions and distinctions.</p>
<p>I apologise if this seems brusque, but <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_b869.html#Continents.2C_subregions.2C_and_Template:Region" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions">this is part-and-parcel of my 'quest' to organise and clarify these various definitions/concepts, et al. in Wp</a>. Whenever there's doubt or ambiguity, I'm defaulting to UN categorisations: they aren't perfect (particularly for <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcontinental_nation.html" title="Transcontinental nation">transcontinental nations</a> like <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>), but at least they're neutral.

<p>Hello again! Mindful of <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a>, your contributions there, and our discussions thereof, I've drafted a 'provisional' article with definitions and maps of prominent entities containing <i>America</i>. I'd very much like your input on its talk page, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Is the proposed article title sufficient: "...in/of the Americas", "Regions of the Americas", etc.?</li>
<li>(2) Are there any notable territories I'm missing, or are the definitions deficient somehow?</li>
<li>(3) Can you suggest a way to better render the maps? I've a vision of how I want them to appear (two columns on the right side of the article), but my knowledge of the coding to get there is admittedly limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember this is a draft, not public.&#160;:) Once I get feedback from you and others (over the next few days), I will place this as a legitimate article and include links in appropriate articles.</p>

<dd>I'm not exactly sure what you mean. Wikipedia has extensive and comprehensive treatment of the non- and differently-canonical books of the Bible. There's no question that some Christian denominations differ in what texts are included in the Bible and their order. Also, some Bible publishers respond to this by publishing different versions of their titles. WP should cover these facts and the reasons behind them in the same neutral way it tries to cover everything. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 22:09, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is a convention on Wikipedia (<a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a>) for determining the titles of articles. The set of books differing between the "Catholic" Bible and the "Protestant" Bible are generally called the Apocrypha. In fact there is considerable treatment of Christian and Jewish religious texts on Wikipedia, regardless of their status in the various canons. Many Christians from Protestant churches might be surprised that you consider the exclusion of the Apocrypha from the Bible as hostile; they might not even know about it. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 04:27, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Acjelen, the article you once created on "Amorica (legend)" is apparently up for deletion, because of lack of sources. People think it's a hoax.

Large parts of it were interpretations, assumptions and projections that do not belong on wikipedia. Instead of removing it altogether (perhaps keeping the wikipediable parts in), editors have tried to wikify it and incorporate it into the article.

<p>She is never named that. The Native Americans call her "Sister" and "Daughter" or "she", Smith never calls her anything. When she comes to live with the whites and when she goes to England, they call her "Princess" or "My lady". There is one scene when she has come to live at Jamestown, and an English woman has been hired to serve as her maid, and the English woman says, "And you are called ..." but the man introducing them stops her and says, "She doesn't go by that name any more."

<dd>If we're going to expand the article beyond being a definition, I am worried about limiting cultural heritage to something that nations have, as opposed to cities, states, ethnic groups, <i>etc.</i> Also, the definition is very narrow in what makes up cultural heritage, in this case physical items "worthy of preservation for the future".

<p>Hi Acjelen,</p>
<p>thanks for your modifications to the Romanza disambiguation page. I just wanted you to know why I reworded the part "includes a song titled "Romanza" (I guess the other modifications are clear; but don't hesitate to ask if you want to): the reason is that <i>Romanza (album)</i> is just a greatest hits album with a few, live, unpublished performances; "Romanza (song)" actually belongs to Bocelli's previous album (entitled <i>Bocelli</i>). I reworded the sentence to avoid that it could be taken as an original song giving title to the whole album. I don't know what the situation is instead about Ron Murray's CD. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGennaro_Prota_b0f2.html" title="User:Gennaro Prota">Gennaro Prota</a> 00:20, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well the only restriction to the English-language Wikipedia is that it is <i>written</i> in English. There are plenty of editors who want to contribute to the English Wikipedia with a "Spanish-speaking" world view for instance, but in the English language. Indeed, this page used to be a collection of polemicals about what an American should and should not be (see history of <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_the_word_American_8aee.html" title="Use of the word American">Use of the word American</a>). So my point in adding the phrase "names in English include" was that the Indigenous peoples of the Americas are called a variety of names in several languages, but at least three in English include American (or a portion of that word for Amerindians). Yesterday I was listening to NPR. They reported on some protests by Indians in Ontario. It took me a long time and a fair amount of reasoning to realize that it was First Nations people rioting and not Canadians with ancestry in South Asia. So I always try to be specific. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 18:42, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>l already have done a fair amount of research into the Pioneer Woman Statue in Denton including many back-and-forths and even a visit with the librarian there. This is part of the reason that I'm so biased towards librarians in Texas, and most anywhere else for that matter. Anyway, what I'm looking for is info on the sculpture contest [who held the contest, who were the judges, who entered, etc] that produced the work now seen. I am about to burst forth with the definative treatment of statues of pioneer women in America and Denton is one of the main spokes of that wheel. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 23:28, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since <i>romantic</i> is the adjective form of <i>romance</i>, it should redirect there. It think the issue is a matter of structure rather than use. Generally in Wikipedia the adjective form redirects to the noun form. While many editors will link "romantic" for the flowers/candles kind of romantic, just as many will link for the ruined abbey/field of daffodils kind.

<p>Thank you for the link. But it still seems incorrect to me. While that might be the belief in Britian now and is fairly recent. It certainly does not apply to Princess Diana. A title does not just make you royal, you also need the royal blood line. That is the way it use to be anyway. It was required for Prince Charles to marry someone who was a virgin and with a strong lineage. Diana was a direct descendent of King Charles II and of a arstocratic family. So, she was picked for her bloodline. Kate Middleton's family has no royal blood or any arstocrats, that does not mean she will not get to marry William. The British Royal Family really really needs some new blood. It is just a question of will the marriage be allowed if the family follows the same protcols.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd be surprised if Ms. Middleton is not descendent from a royal Stuart somewhere, let alone someone like Edward I. If anything, she would be the continuation of a pattern set by the Queen's father when he did not marry a foreigner. All of the Queen's children have British spouses, as did her sister, and most of her father's siblings. One uncle even married an American! That Ms. Middleton's father is a business owner instead of a peer is more natural progression than revolution. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 02:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Well, Queen Elizabeth's uncle did get to marry an American, but he was forced to give up his throne for her. The royal family did not approve of their marriage because she was not of royal blood but also because she had been divorced.</p>
<p>I do not believe that Kate's Middleton's family has any royal descent. She would be considered a commoner. Princess Diana, again, was picked for her royal bloodline and her family was close friends with the royal family. Up until Prince William went to college, Kate's family had never met the royal family or been in any contact with them. The only reason Kate and William are together is that he went to her college. If Prince William had not went to her college I doubt they would be dating or know each other.</p>
<p>If Kate Middleton had any royal descent, someone would have mentioned it somewhere. The fact is she does not. The only pattern, as you said, she would continue is that she is British. But, that is understandable as their are very few royal families left.</p>
<p>Now, that is not to say William and her could not get married. Prince Charles was forced to marry Princess Diana, it was not for love and because of that the marriage did not last and it ended badly. Therefore, the royal family may allow William and Harry to marry who they want.</p>

<p>I've reverted your edits to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_University_4db1.html" title="Indiana University">Indiana University</a>. Unlike other system universities with WP articles (e.g., <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_76d5.html" title="University of Wisconsin">University of Wisconsin</a>), Indiana University does not redirect to the main campus (the historical site and the campus associated with athletics and thus (unfortunately) a lot of press attention). Since this is not the case (and since I don't know that I necessarily agree with making it so), I think that the primary campus should be in bold. Also, the primary campus's official name is "Indiana University", so putting "Bloomington" after it is incorrect. This is something which is being discussed on the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_University_Bloomington_7806.html" title="Indiana University Bloomington">Indiana University</a> talk page, if you're interested in weighing in. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope">Merope</a> 19:46, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

(Not to mention that the Bloomington campus still retains that as its official name.) I won't fight you on that. I just don't want "Bloomington" added to the end of the university since 1) that is not it's name and 2) it makes it sound like a regional campus, and not the world-class institution it is. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope">Merope</a> 20:04, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For some reason I was very angry and snappish earlier today. If I seemed short at all, I apologize. While I like piping, I don't want it used to "cover-over" wrong-headed article titles. I also don't like so-called parent companies, i.e. entities given birth to by their supposed children for legal or other reasons. Having the Indiana University System page at Indiana University and the actual university at Indiana University Bloomington, but piped as Indiana University pressed both of those buttons. You were doing the good hard work fixing the redirect on the article Edgar Meyer and I should have left it alone. I will now, but I think someone should fix this problem. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 21:46, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, don't worry about it! I was pretty bitchy myself, mostly because I spent all day looking up alumni in the IU database and making sure their WP articles linked to the correct page. (I think I put in 300 edits today alone -- slow day at the office!) Anyway, I imagine some of the IU people will come to the discussion and we can figure something out. Or maybe I'll get over the fact that my beloved alma mater is trying to become a corporate entity and just allow the disambig page. *sigh*</dd>

<p>I see your point in general; but this is a very brief overview of the history of one of 72 counties. In that regard, I thought a brief reference to some Indian history of the region was germane. Here's a sentence from the Wikepedia entry for "Potawatomi": "The Potawatomi are first mentioned in French records which suggest that, in the early 17th century, they lived in what is now southwestern Michigan. During the Beaver Wars, they fled to the area around the Bay of Green Bay to escape attacks by the Iroquois and Neutral Nation." Also, don't forget that one of the most popular parks in Door County is named "Potawatomi State Park," and I suspect that many people will wonder why it is so named when today the native American populution of Door County is .6% Reason--negotiation under the Indian Removal Act of 1830. That was my reason for the inclusion in the history overview. Let me have your thoughts. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossp_da33.html" title="User:Rossp">Rossp</a> 22:40, 30 August 2006 (UTC)rossp PS--Here's an entry from the web I found: "Estimates of the original Potawatomi population range as high as 15,000, but 8,000 is probably closer to the truth. Although they had undergone 30 years of war, relocation, and epidemic, the French estimated there were about 4,000 in 1667. Since all Potawatomi bands had gathered into four villages near Green Bay [later became Wisconsin] at that time, this probably was fairly accurate. Later estimates vary between 1,200 to 3,400, but the Potawatomi had separated into many bands, and these estimates failed to list all of them. Accurate counts were not possible until the Potawatomi had been moved to Kansas. In 1854 the Indian Bureau listed 3,440 on the reservation, but some had left with the Kickapoo for northern Mexico. The report also mentioned 600 "strolling Potawatomi," who had avoided removal and were somewhere in Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin."</p>

<p>Hi Acjelen,</p>

<p>I removed KingLloyd's "welcome" post because it is HUGE and would keep me from seeing other posts. Had I not looked at the history of my talk page I would never have seen your additional comments! I have once again removed that huge and all too colorful "welcome" post, please do not put it back. However, thank you for the advisement on not editing the page - as for regular comments I do not and did not plan to edit anyone's out.</p>
<p>As for <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disciple_%28Christianity%29_8cad.html" title="Disciple (Christianity)">Disciple (Christianity)</a>, If you disagree with the content, then please add your own research to the article - but I hope that your unsupported comment to me is not simply a reaction in disagreeing with what I have added to the article. If you believe I have added original work, please indicate where I have done so, so that I can edit the article and learn from our interaction. Please show what is not justified by citation or reference. Please be as rigorous in your rebuttle as I have been in my actual additions. In my perspective, every word I have added to the page that is not from the source material given (reference to and quotes from Luke 14) is simply a contraction. Please note that that contraction is from source material not only cited but given verbatum on the page, not only from the Christian scriptures (St. Luke and St. Paul) themselves but from published Christian ethicist, Lee C.

<p>I see you knocked off the trail template and category for Pony Express. I didn't put them on there to begin with but I'm curious about the logic. The Trail obviously follows the route of the Pony Express and thus they are pretty close to one and the same. The Pony Express Trail in fact currently redirects to Pony Express. I suppose there could be separate articles but the trail article doesn't exist right now and it would be splitting hairs and inviting inconsistencies between the articles if it was created. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmericasroof_3ff1.html" title="User:Americasroof">Americasroof</a> 18:20, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I noticed that after I had changed the template. My reasoning follows: (1) the Pony Express was an unsuccessful but well-known business venture, not a trail or a road; (2) any "Pony Express Trail" recognized by the U.S. government deserves its own separate article; (3) the template I removed from the Pony Express article can go on that article; (4) redirects can be easily redirected to the appropriate article and see references created so that readers and editors will be able to find the right one. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 18:30, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the explanation. I personally would prefer the template and category be put back until such time the trail article is written (right now the template sends folks to Pony Express and then disappears). Even the NPS resources are pretty skimpy. There are other precedents such as the <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oregon_Trail_4b43.html" title="Oregon Trail">Oregon Trail</a> which makes no mention whatsoever that there's a NPS historic trail. Putting the template on the article might encourage somebody to write the article.<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmericasroof_3ff1.html" title="User:Americasroof">Americasroof</a> 02:41, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi, I note from the talk page and edit history of this article that you were involved in previous discussion of what coverage questions of Prince Harry's <b>parentage</b> should have in the article. I have removed the present discussion of the topic as POV and unsourced:</p>
<p><i>Ever since Harry was born, there have been rumours about whether the Prince of Wales is truly his father. Diana admitted to having an affair, and most believe this affair was with <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hewitt_67c0.html" title="James Hewitt">James Hewitt</a>. It has also been noted that although William bears a resemblance to both his parents, Harry looks nothing like Charles but bears a striking resemblance to Hewitt. It was rumoured that Diana was considering a paternity test but decided against it before her death.</i></p>
<p>I have started a discussion on the talk page as to how best to include the claim <i>neutrally</i> in the article and to find sources for both sides of the debate. If the subject is still of interest to you, your contributions would be very welcome. - <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 02:32, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
