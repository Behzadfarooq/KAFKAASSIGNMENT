<p>This sentence is inaccurate: "Also, the lost play <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achilles_%28play%29.html" title="Achilles (play)">Achilles</a> by <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aeschylus.html" title="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> was rediscovered in 2003." Achilles was originally a trilogy, not a single play. A restored version was staged in Greece in 2003, not discovered. The restored version was put together out of fragments of the trilogy to form a single play. MOst of those fragments have been extant for decades, not recently discovered. Part of it was discovered wrapping a mummy in Egypt, but I have not been able to find out which part. Unfortunately, I don't know enough details to rewrite the sentence myself.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.190.242.110 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.190.242.110.html" title="User talk:66.190.242.110">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.190.242.110_6af2.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.190.242.110">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>It should be noted that I think the proper pronounciation of achilles is actually something like A-SHEEL. The westernized version is A-KILL-EES, but I'm rather confident that the european roots of this name are somewhat influenced by French pronounciation. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.144.226.150 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.144.226.150_8156.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.144.226.150">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<hr />
<p>How so? Greek consonants have changed pronunciation over the centuries. In particular it looks like chi, now pronounced somewhat like "sh", used to be pronounced "kh", which is why the Romans wrote it as "ch". The rest of the westernized version is just a matter of using the English values for the vowels. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Grosse_d1d0.html" title="User:Josh Grosse">Josh Grosse</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosh_Grosse_06b4.html" title="User talk:Josh Grosse">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josh_Grosse_5bb2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josh Grosse">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<hr />
<p>My two cents' worth to this pronunciation business: the chi (χ) will be pronounced 'k' by Anglophones and Italians, 'sh' by the French, 'kh' (guttural voiceless fricative, same as the -j- in Spanish 'Juan') by the Dutch, the Germans, and indeed the (modern) Greek. The original value of the consonant is believed to be /k//h/, that is, k + plosive als in English 'cut'.<br />

<p>I'm not familiar with these topics but I wish to point out the new section about the meaning of Achilles' name. Besides having an all-caps title and being all boldfaced, it feels rather unclear, possibly POV and possibly lifted verbatim from another website (including the underlying HTML code).

<p>To clarify everyone about the pronounciation of the name i can give you an example of the correspondence of each letter to english. The real name that we (Greeks) are saying is "Αχχιλεύς" which is getting to "Αχχιλέας" when it comes to contemporary greek language. Thus if i can say that the syllabus "χχι" equals to chi like Chania or Chalkida the greek cities. It is more accurate therefore to write it "Achileas". The problem with that is the pronounciation. Being in UK now I can realise how difficult for other people is to pronounce greek related words.</p>

<p>The sexual nature of the relationship between Patroclus and Achilles is by no means definite. It cannot be understood as sexual in nature when a variety of scholars do not agree. To say it is so absolutely is not correct. Please read the original greek. Or take a look at a variety of sources, the wikipedia entry for the Iliad being one of them.

<dd>It is clear the majority of ancient Greeks regarded them as homosexual lovers. The idea that it was platonic is a modern invention. 67.41.236.211 4 July 2005 20:07 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's not entirely true. It's a mistake to think they either were or weren't lovers - as mythical characters, they don't have to be consistent. In the <i>Iliad</i>, there's no reference of a sexual connection, and I think the idea appeared relatively late as far as the mythology goes. It was definitely common by the time of Alexander, though. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Grosse_d1d0.html" title="User:Josh Grosse">Josh</a></p>
<p>The majority of ancient Greeks from the time it appeared all the way until Christian times regarded them as homosexual. However it is true it does not state it in graphic details within the work itself. At the same time many Greek felt there was no need because it was so common that educated persons would read between the lines. See the discussion at the Illiad article, it contains direct quotes. 67.41.236.211 4 July 2005 23:41 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The page really should say something more about the relationship between Patroclus and Achilles. The NPOV thing to do is to present the evidence of both sides. Homer can be read either way (although Thetis does remind the grieving Achilles that the love of women is a good thing too). Aeschylus's lost play <i>The Myrmidons</i> apparently had the two in a "lover-beloved" relationship of the type that was typical of 5th century Athens, with Patroclus as the (younger) beloved; Plato refers to this as an error in his <i>Symposium</i>, saying that Achilles was the beloved. Xenophon disagrees with both Aeschylus and Plato, saying the two were not lovers at all. As Josh says, at the time of Alexander it was pretty universally accepted that the two were lovers. It's an important part of the myth in many aspects, and even though some don't like it it's POV-pushing to exclude it completely.</dd>

Excuse me but WHAT does it matter what their relationship was "generally regarded in ancient Greece". It's a myth, Achilles is defined BY and within the myth, not by a general perception, and within the text of this myth, the Iliad, there is NO proof of homosexuality. ONLY the text itself should be considered in defining this relationship. Any conclusion on Achilles' sexuality should be removed immediately, only a neutral mention of the ancient Greek perception stated. This is common sense, please do your job of furthering truth and knowledge with a clear, objective mind, without influence from agenda or preconception.</p>
<p>And to the user who is being self righteous about living free and unmolested... nobody will be sympathetic for you if you disregard truth and scholarship. Your time would be better spent reading Greek philosophy drawing from it such axioms as Know Thyself that will help you in your life's struggles, whatever they may be, and leaving Achilles alone.<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 128.61.42.109 (<a href="../../../1/2/8/User_talk%7E128.61.42.109.html" title="User talk:128.61.42.109">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.61.42.109_1c56.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.61.42.109">contribs</a>) 03:14, March 8, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Er... the article as it stands <i>does</i> mention the post-Homeric view, neutrally, and says nothing one way or the other about homosexuality in Homer. Exactly what are you objecting to? Is this about anything in the article, or are you just upset that any homosexual associations are sullying the reputation of Achilles, even here on the talk page?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The thing about a myth is that it isn't static. Different generations bring different perspectives on it. Homer wasn't the first to tell the story of Achilles, just the first whose work survives to the present. The presentation of the character in Homer is the most important, of course, but not the only one worth mentioning. The view of Achilles in the Classical era (5th century BCE) is significant, and deserves the mention it currently has in the article. Indeed, it would be "denying truth and scholarship" to exclude it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I said above, the <i>Iliad</i> can be read multiple ways. You're right that there is no "proof of homosexuality" — but neither is there proof of its absence. The subject is controversial, but not the be-all and end-all of the character; that's why I've created the sub-article <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achilles_and_Patroclus_2407.html" title="Achilles and Patroclus">Achilles and Patroclus</a> to discuss it.

<p>No other complaints for now, however, your statement that there is no proof of the absence of homosexuality shows a flawed reasoning in my opinion.

<dd>Fair enough. I should perhaps have said that there is evidence which can be read as supporting a homosexual interpretation, although not definitively. Above, I mentioned Thetis' otherwise odd comment to her grieving son about the love of women; there's also the bit when Achilles wishes all the other Greeks dead so that "we two alone" might share the victory over Troy. As I say, not <i>proof</i>, but <i>suggestion</i>. The post-Homeric writers weren't creating a love affair out of whole cloth — Homer did give them material to work with.</dd>

<p>It was never Achilles intention to allow Patroclus to go out of the camp, he was only to push the trojans back by rallying the Myrmidons and the rest of the Greeks. Patroclus just gets carried away, there was never any sort of plan for a proper assault.</p>

<dd>*sigh*. You just watched "Troy". Aargh. If you just read the Iliad as well. The movie "Troy" is inspired in its very basics from the Homeric epic poem called "Iliad".</dd>
<dd>As for whether he was a "real guy or just a fictional character", he's a mythological character. So, you'll have to define "fictional". You'll have to define "real". Achilles is supposed to be the son of the goddess Thetis, so if that deity never existed does that automatically make him fictional? What if there was once some guy who was named Achilles but never shared any of the famous qualities of Achilles at all? Point is we don't know how much of what Homer wrote are fictionalized stories based on actual facts -- same as we don't know how many of the other myths and epic poems may be based on some shadow and rumour of real events.

There are more modern references than Densuşianu, though; I've added one (Hedreen 1990) to the references.

It also looks like Leuke starts off as a mythical place, which is then localized as the black sea island.

<p>Achilles belongs here first because he was interpreted that way by the ancient Greeks (post-Homeric) - who might not have been able to decide wether Achilles or Patroclus was the eromenos, but were sure that one of them had to be, and also because of his "fling" with Troilus. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 01:17, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here's why: Achilles' name is Achilles. Greeks, archaic and classical, only had one name; the patronymic is simply an epithet (a descriptive adjective), no more part of Achilles' name than "swift-footed".</p>
<p>The lines from the <i>Iliad</i> don't seem to belong in the "name" section to me; it seems good to have them in the article, but perhaps in the "Achilles in the Trojan War" section (which should really have an Iliad subsection). <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 18:53, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, in the opening paragraph, Achilles' name should appear in the Roman alphabet, with the Greek given in parentheses, just like all the other Wikipedia articles about Greek heroes and gods. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 19:01, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the assertion that Achilles "loves" Briseis is problematic. It makes it sound as if the the <i>Iliad</i> is some sort of love story, and there's little evidence that Achilles has any romantic feelings for Briseis. At <i>Iliad</i> 9.341-343 Achilles says: "Do they then alone of mortal men love their wives (<i>alokhoi</i>), these sons of Atreus? Nay, for whoso is a true man and sound of mind, loveth his own and cherisheth her, even as I too loved her with all my heart, though she was but the captive of my spear." Hainsworth comments: "This is all that we hear from his own lips of Akhilleus' finer feelings for Briseis; it is a pity that he should make this declaration, emphatic though it is, only in a context where his rhetoric requires her to be raised to the status of the <i>alokhoi</i> of the Atreidai so that his loss may be equated with that of Menelaos..." (<i>The Iliad: a Commentary</i>, v. 3, p. 108) There's considerable room here to doubt what Achilles' feelings are towards Briseis, and to see this passage only as an argument to equate the theft of Briseis with the theft of Helen. See, for instance, Donna Wilson's analysis of this passage in her <i>Ransom, Revenge, and Heroic Identity in the Iliad</i>, pp. 87-89, which concludes: "Achilleus' conflict is over status; the woman is represented merely as the occasion."</p>
<p>Some other passages are worth considering. At 9.394-7, Achilles says that Peleus will find him a wife if he returns to Phthia; apparently Achilles isn't too romantically attached to Briseis. At 19.54-64, Achilles wishes that Briseis had died before he and Agamemnon quarreled; has Achilles forgotten that he loves Briseis, perhaps because he is so affected by Patroclus' death? Or did he not love Briseis in the first place? Also, Achilles doesn't say that he loves Briseis in Book 1, nor does he call her a "wife" (<i>alokhos</i>) there, even though she is a subject of discussion. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 07:01, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These are very interesting points, and potentially add lots of nuances, but the nuances don't change the fact that (as you yourself quote) Achilles says he "loved her with all my heart". To conceal that statement is to censor Homer, it seems to me. We may wish the Iliad was all about honour, but it's more complicated than that. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 09:50, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps we could find a wording that acknowledges both Achilles' claim of love during the embassy and the other, more equivocal evidence. How about saying, "Angry at the dishonor (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis), Achilles refused to fight..."? That recognizes the statement at 9.341–343, but also keeps the question of honor at the forefront, which is appropriate since that's what the vast majority of Achilles' rhetoric focuses on. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 17:12, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Josiah's proposed wording is fine with me, but I'll say that I would prefer to remove the mention of 9.341-343 entirely. The question is not whether Achilles says he loves Briseis, but whether his words can be taken at face value. The quotes I've provided show that some scholars don't think Achilles' claim is evidence of a romantic attachment. To deal properly with different views of what Achilles' claim means would take a paragraph or two, at least; it's been discussed in a few articles and books. At some point, I'd like to add that discussion, but I'm not sure whether it belongs in <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achilles.html" title="Achilles">Achilles</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briseis.html" title="Briseis">Briseis</a>, or <i><a href="../../../i/l/i/Iliad.html" title="Iliad">Iliad</a></i>. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 18:36, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The word Wetman is translating as "golden" in Homer is ξανθος (<i>xanthos</i>). There's some disagreement among translators about how best to convey that word in English when it refers to human hair; it's often used of horses, and in that context means "bay" or "chestnut". Menelaos' standard epithet is "καρη ξανθος Μενελαος", which is often translated as "red-headed Menelaos". It appears to be used for <i>any</i> light-colored hair. Robert Fagles translates the passage Wetman refers to as "Rearing behind him, Pallas siezed his fiery hair". Robert Fitzgerald says "red-gold hair", and G.S. Kirk's Cambridge commentary on the <i>Iliad</i> even translates the passage as "Athene took him by his <i>brown</i> hair".</p>
<p>Since the meaning of the word is unclear, it's a bit tenuous to base an entire ethnographic theory on it. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 00:32, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll take the blame for the "xanthos" edit - I was just not signed in at the time.

<dd>I think that "golden-haired" is probably fairly accurate, if you stop to think about the actual color of gold. Gold can vary quite a bit in color, and is often closer to bronze than true yellow in hue — it's really only in comparison to other metals that it looks yellow. We have a cultural association of "gold" with blonde hair, but I tend to doubt that Achilles looked like he used peroxide (Brad Pitt notwithstanding). The old-fashioned word "fair" may be the most accurate; the point is that Achilles (and Menelaos) had hair that was lighter in shade than most Achaeans. We can't really be more specific than that. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 03:38, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, Nagy (<i>Best of the Achaeans</i> 209-210) notes that in Homer <i>xanthos</i> describes either heroes who are immortalized (Rhadamanthys, Menelaos) or divine beings--Achilles' horse Xanthos is the offspring of Zephyr (the west wind) and a harpy, the river Scamander is the offspring of Zeus. Being <i>xanthos</i> would then have less to do with physical appearance or ethnic origin, but is a marker of divinity or divine favor. The <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>, of course, insist that Achilles does not become immortal, but outside of Homer Achilles enjoys a blessed afterlife on the White Island, sometimes with his wife <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medea.html" title="Medea">Medea</a>.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Akhilleus_16d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Akhilleus">contribs</a>) 01:27, August 24, 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

As for the Achilles/Medea pairing on the White Island: I usually think of that (and the White Island story in general) as sort of the ancient equivalent of slash fiction, pairing up random characters because someone thought "that would be hot".

<p>Well, whatever Wetman is trying to imply, there's nothing wrong with putting a physical description based on Homer in the article, as long as we account for the ambiguity of translation. I was going to do it myself just so that Wetman would stop making vague insinuations about "suppression" and "indoctrination" and the like, but couldn't decide where the best place was; a description of the adult Achilles seems out-of-place under "Birth", random anywhere in the "Trojan War" section, and it's not a significant enough detail to go in the lead. I don't think it really deserves a section of its own either. Any thoughts? —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 02:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apparently we don't have Wetman to kick around anymore. This is one of the stranger things to develop a persecution complex about, but whatever. Anyway, what I'd really like to see is a discussion of artistic representations of Achilles: there are a bunch of vase paintings of him, and there must be sculpture. Textual descriptions of his appearance would fit well in such a section. However, I know that I won't have time to get to this any time soon, so for the time being, maybe we should just create an "Appearance" or "Physical description" section and add the visual evidence later. If anyone gets to the visual evidence before I do, I think <i>LIMC</i> (the <i>Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae</i>) would be a good source to start from. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 03:14, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One of our cheekiest editors has deleted this reference to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a>'s description, because he doesn't <i>like</i> it: "In the tradition that Homer was drawing upon, Achilles was blond ("Athene stood behind him and seized him by his golden locks", <i>Iliad</i> i) and hairy-chested ("In his shaggy breast..." <i>ibid</i>). I won't struggle to return it to the article. Quite disgraceful behavior. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 12:59, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I take it you're referring to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Achilles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68530506" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Achilles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68530506" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>? As I understand it, Akhilleus removed that not because he "didn't like it" but because saying Achilles was "not of Mediterranean stock" constitutes <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> (and dubious research at that). Homer says Achilles' hair was <i>xanthos</i> — he doesn't say anything about his "stock" (at least not in the sense you seem to be implying). If you want to reinsert the description without the questionable ethnography, you can do so; however, we should probably note the ambiguity of the meaning of <i>xanthos</i>. (See <a href="#Suppressing_Homer.21" title="">above</a>.) —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 19:55, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just wanted to point out that this page does not cite its sources. (i.e book and chapter.) I had to write an essay about Achilles, but this article was useless to me because I had to cite mythological text I got my statement from.

<dd>Thanks for your comment. "A lot of work" is true, but, you're right, it's got to be done.

<dd>I think Ecyd girl's comment is one of the most useful pieces of feedback I've seen on Wikipedia. I've taken an initial stab at adding some sources, but as you both say, it's a lot of work. If anyone else is doing the same thing, Timothy Gantz's <i>Early Greek Myth</i> is an immensely useful place to find references for the original sources. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 21:21, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
