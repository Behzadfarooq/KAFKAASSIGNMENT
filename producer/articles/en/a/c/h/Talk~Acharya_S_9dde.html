---The policy states that an editor must not perform more than three reversions, in whole or in part, on a single Wikipedia article within a 24 hour period-- "four reverts in just over a day is still breaking the policy". Was not Jame's 4th revert in the next day?</p>
<p>This does not imply that reverting three times or fewer is acceptable. In excessive cases, people can be blocked for edit warring or disruption even if they do not revert more than three times per day. "So the 3 revert rule does not always apply. How is it decided when the less-than-3 rule is excessive and edit warring?"</p>
<p>I am sure you know your job better than I as do two editors who have warned the ONE editor in here about messing up their work without even discussing it here (I gather they are admins). It is clear this cagey editor knows just how to stay under the radar apparently.</p>
<p>Sounds like quibbling? Just seeking fairness, balance and peace. Pleased to see that you prefer Jame's vs. as a good working structure, which may be improved upon by reasonable people. Peace out.--68.146.186.180 10:47, 16 May 2006 (UTC)toothfairy</p>

<dd>Charles, you blocked me for 4 reverts in 27 hours (even though AJA refuses to discuss his changes, thus leaving me little choice but to revert!) Only days later AJA continues to revert without comment, making <b>5</b> reverts in 30 hours, completely ignoring your warning above. I have to wonder why it is I get blocked while AJA does not.

<p>I contributed this recently. It's not fluff; it's Acharya herself explaining her positions and as such is at least as relevant as any number of positive and negative reviews. Nonetheless, it lasted for perhaps five minutes. I didn't mean to offend against anyone's belief system, and hope that wasn't the reason.</p>
<p>On the subject of reviews-- couldn't a better quote from Barbara Walker be used? She is an author of substance and acomplishment, however all this tells us is that she 'nodded her head.' Some of us nod, others may shrug.</p>

<p>Nice dodge, but then, I was questioning as to whether you were being influenced by personal considerations rather than logic or reason... which is the very definition of ad hominem itself. That's sort of a catch 22 if ever there was one. You didn't answer the question, is it possible that your Christain beliefs influenced your decision especially in light of having ignored those rampant reverts previously posted? If you feel that having your beliefs questioned are an ad hominem attack, perhaps you have discovered the perfect way to excuse them while using them.</p>

<li>Looks like AJA prefers to make his edits without discussion on this page. He is merely whittling away at edited quotes from others, while leaving his favorite "negative" quotes untouched. I guess that is called "editing". I will find a source for Barbara Walker and re-edit it in when I do, so it is properly sourced.

<dd>I don't think there's any problem with providing the full name of the author; it's a fact that is reasonable for us to report. However, we need to have some sort of confirmation from a reliable source that the name is correct. A <i>very</i> cursory Google search doesn't turn up an online source for the name, just a bunch of Wikipedia mirrors and one or two forum postings. Provided we can cite a good source – on- or off-line – there's no reason not to mention this important fact about the Acharya S pseudonym. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 04:36, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In a sense yes, as it helps show the damage done. This site <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_scraping.html" title="Web scraping">scrapes</a> their content from wikipedia. So even though Acharya's full name was eventually removed from wikipedia, it has been automatically spread all over the net. I understand that privacy invasions and harassment are taken quite seriously when wikipedians are the target. Why ZAROVE gets away with a topical ban and a slap on the wrist for violating it is beyond me. Nevermind the extraordinary personal situation the author is in. Acharya S is in hiding because her child was kidnapped, and the kidnapper jumped bail and is still on the loose. I can't understand why any admin, knowing this, would still allow ZAROVE to harass and ridicule her for so many months. Look at all the <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_evidence_cb12.html" title="User:^^James^^/evidence">crap</a> he got away with. He was allowed to do so because <i>technically</i> since Acharya S is not a wikipedian, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> doesn't apply, as Charles appears to reaffirm above! <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">^^James^^</a> 07:46, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had no idea of the circumstances - as a mum of 3 she has my sympathy that these nuts are hounding her. I agree that wikipedia should take this more seriously - editing here is quick and easy and well linked but setting up a website takes knowledge and time which most people don't have. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 12:31, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My understanding – please, correct me if I'm mistaken – is that the kidnapper was the boy's estranged father. If that is the case, it strikes me as pointless to conceal the author's name, because the kidnapper already knows it. Obviously if ZAROVE (or someone else) decides to start trying to post addresses, credit history, phone numbers, or other harrassing information it should be removed without delay. Under the circumstances, edits of that nature will rightly be met with a swift, harsh response.</dd>
<dd>For the purposes of our article, however, we're left with the question of what information is verifiable. The identification of Acharya S as D. Murdock goes back to 2001, as indicated by Murdock herself: <a href="http://www.truthbeknown.com/firesponse.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.truthbeknown.com/firesponse.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The rest of the name still needs a verifiable, reliable source; until we have such, I'm not sure that we can support inclusion of the full name. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 12:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good point - the father should know her real name and the info here will not change that. However as the site I provided was a wiki echo we can't use it as a RS so maybe just sticking with what the author has confirmed is best. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 12:50, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, my understanding is that her full name was made public by Zarove here on wikipedia. He did not source it, and claimed it was <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. I consider his releasing her full name to be a privacy invasion in itself. He also made other threats, and was eventually dealt with, but inadequately it seems. (Note: I am not contesting the inclusion of "D Murdock".)</dd>

<dd>The other point I was trying to make was about the constant stream of personal attacks and vitriol directed towards Acharya S here in the talk pages. Would that be tolerated anywhere else in wikipedia? And considering the extraordinarily stressful situation the author is in, isn't it just a simple matter of decent humanity not to allow such attacks? Yet it went on for months. And even now... in the section above this one, a user is essentially asking for permission to personally attack Acharya S here on the talk page, and Charles appears to grant it!

<p>---Hello folks! I added a new section called "Acharya's Views on Spirituality". Essentially this is a simple introduction to her personal views of the "spirituality" part of religon. However, Acharya S' views on religon also extend into the realm of it's socio-political underpinnings, as it affects the world today..ie. war, women, children, the environment etc. Acharya S, the person, is just not only "Christ-myth" or religion-myth oriented, but her views proceed from this into many arenas. Just a hint there could be more added to round out the "person", which is what this titled page is about as the author of a controversial hypothesis.--<a href="../../../r/p/s/User%7ERpsugar_c3a3.html" title="User:Rpsugar">Skull</a> 22:42, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have confirmed that this review @ Amazon was written by David P Bergland the Libertarian candidate for the Presidency and the author. One will note that at Amazon, that the "real" status is confirmation of the use of a real name (via credit card for eg.). I took the liberty of reaching Mr. Bergland through a Libertarian site and he responded thus:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dear Rene:</p>
<p>Yes. I am the one and only David Bergland who wrote the review of "Suns of God" on the Amazon site. Acharya might have told you how that came about, but I will repeat it here. While reading the book, I came across an abbreviated reference and sent her an email requesting additional information. She graciously replied and also asked me if I would post a review of the book on Amazon; so I did.</p>
<p>I assume you have checked the entry on me in Wikipedia. It is a succinct and accurate report. If you need additional information, let me know. I would like the quote from my review to remain in the Wikipedia entry on Acharya, so whatever I can do to help, just ask.</p>

<dd>No, it is not irrelevant at all. It is an example of how her work is viewed by others, as is the fact that her work is not accepted by mainstream scholarship. That scholars in the field do not even bother to review her work is a strong sign that experts do not even consider it worthwhile looking at. Such facts are noted when discussing scholars all of the time. This is an article, after all, about a person who professes to be a scholar, and her standing in the academic community gives one a good idea of what kind of work she does. Opinions of other scholars matter. They are not sufficient to prove good scholarship, but they are a very good sign that one is performing relevant, reliable work, even if that work is controversial.--<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerwasp_a0a7.html" title="User:Killerwasp">Killerwasp</a> 00:58, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
