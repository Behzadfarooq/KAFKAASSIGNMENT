<p>I am not Darren Ray, despite what Ambi would like to say. What humor you must have. Some editors obviously can get what they want. My edits are good and I would love to do more some time. Ambi did not like the checking of her edits which are often unfair and poorly written. She uses swear words including on this page and insults others in her edit summaries. But I am now <b>"blocked indefinitely."</b></p>
<p>My crime is knowing Darren Ray, and liking him. I see Ambi who is willing to run down her political enemy is not revealing her name. Why?</p>
<p>I ask that people look at my contributions, I have done a lot.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to speak to me direct please leave details here. Disgustedly yours</p>

<p>I believe that you are either a sockpupet of Darren Ray, Ben Cass or are specifically acting on their instruction to disrupt Wikipedia.

<dd>I'm inclined to let them have their petty victory and pat themselves on the back tonight and we can redress this tomorrow. The way things are going we are either going to have a successful afd or arbitration, either of which is almost certainly going to see the end of this article.

<p>Spare me the rhetoric. It says that he was accused of something (which he was). It says that the same scandal claimed the career of an MP (which it did). It says that there was no further evidence of wrongdoing on Nguyen's part, and thus nothing happened (which was true).

<p>Please quit this partisan crap. If you'd put your efforts into making sure we have a neutral article about Carli, instead of a "Carli-through-the-eyes-of-a-Unity-partisan-who-hates-his-guts" article, then I'd be long gone. It may surprise you, but I'm hardly a fan of Carli either. There are far more useful and far more important people on all sides of politics that deserve attention, so I'm pretty (deletion) sick of having to fend off dramas on this relatively unimportant SL hack. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 08:49, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Almost your every edit here has concerned the internal machinations of the ALP, and you've insisted on displaying people's factions prominently within their articles, so please do not take me or anyone else here for a fool. Partisan edits like that on <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Carli_5bfa.html" title="Carlo Carli">Carlo Carli</a> are asking to get reverted. If you come out with the same partisan material, it is going to get reverted, and if you keep it up at the rate you're going, you're bound to end up on editing probation in the not-too-distant future. On the other hand, if you quit the partisan writing and make an effort to cover people neutrally, as you're quite clearly capable of doing when your political sympathies or not involved (as your business work shows), then you're unlikely to ever get reverted - just as you don't get reverted on your business articles. In the end, it's your call. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:04, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please just talk about the sections of the article you dispute, so we can perhaps come to some form of amicable solution. I'm fed up with being reverted without any attempt at explaining why, let alone attempting to discuss or come to a consensus. Darren has shown a willingness to work towards compromise, and for the most part, he's getting just that. Reverting without explanation, however, is just taking the fast road to arbitration and a ban. That's a pain for everyone involved - please just play nice. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:35, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Questions:</p>
<p>1\ I have been banned for what reason?</p>
<p>2\ Is knowing Darren Ray a reason for being banned&#160;? I like him and am not ashamed to say this. I am not a secret anonymous person like Ambi who does not have her real name.</p>
<p>3\ Is this because he is in the different ALP faction from Ambi?</p>
<p>4\ I am not in the ALP and don't care less about it. Isee Ambi's (and her allies) bullying and reject it. She then says I must be politics obsessed. I am not at all. I don't care what you all do.</p>
<p>5\ When will someone actually tell me what is going on?</p>
<p>6\ I have done hours of work and hundreds of words for Wikipedia and being treated with no respect, courtesy just like a dumb person because I am not friends with Ambi. See what I write in my contributions<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/AChan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/AChan" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I write fairly and good articles and stop some pushing their politics agendas.</p>
