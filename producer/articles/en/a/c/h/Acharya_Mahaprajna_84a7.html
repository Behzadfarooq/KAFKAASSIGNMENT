	    <p><b>Acharya Mahapragya</b> (born <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>) is a <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jainism.html" title="Jainism">Jainist</a> religious leader. He is the tenth and the current Acharya of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terapanth.html" title="Terapanth">Terapanth</a>. He succeeded Acharya Tulsi as the Acharya of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terapanth.html" title="Terapanth">Terapanth</a> in 1994. He is known for the Preksha Dhyan, Ahimsa Yatra and Surat Spiritual Declarations.</p>
<p>H.H. Acharya Mahaprajna is a writer, poet, philosopher, and social reformer. Having spent over seventy-five years of his life as a monk, Acharya Mahaprajna's life has been unswerving in its pursuit of learning and its application. In keeping with the tradition, which has nourished him, he has spent these years walking the entire length and breadth of the country, learning as it were, not only from the texts and wisdom of yore but also from every being he interacted with on his path. His experiences and insights which have found expression in his writings, both prose and poetry, have formed the basis of his understanding of human nature.</p>
<p>Traditionally Jain monks tread the ground with care, sweeping away any possible living being that may happen to lie on their path before they tread that way. Acharya Mahaprajna treads with care not only on the ground he walks on but also on ideas and beliefs distilling such wisdom as would lead to the spiritual well being of people marked by righteousness and equanimity.</p>
<p>Acharya Mahaprajna is the tenth Spiritual Head of the Terapanth Jain community. Initiated at the age of ten, Acharya Mahaprajna under the tutelage of his guru Acharya Tulsi, spent his formative years learning the scriptures of Jainism and of other religions and philosophies. His broad-based learning encompassed Western philosophy and a study of cultures and societies across the world. He also delved into related disciplines of science, economics and psychology while he mastered the ancient languages of Sanskrit and Prakrit in addition to Hindi and Rajasthan.</p>
<p>Acharya Mahaprajna critically edited the 32 basic Jain Agamas for the first time, from Ardhamagadhi-Prakrit. Nearly half of these canonical texts has also been translated with critical annotations by him into Hindi.</p>
<p>On the basis of his understanding of the different religions he feels that every religion presents an aspect of truth and collection of all these truths may perhaps lead us to greater progress. This led to his new and contemporary exposition of a fundamental principle of tolerance found in Jaina philosophy, which is anekanta. Demystifying the principle of anekanta Acharya Mahaprajna interpreted it in terms of relativity in all spheres of life, be it an opinion or mutual interdependence of all beings. He, thereby, derives his formula for peaceful co-existence, equanimity and a positive outlook.</p>
<p>Acharya Mahaprajna has undertaken a detailed study of economics. Not denying that even religion has its economic principles, he identified two principles that can lead to a life of sustainable development on the planet: the idea of `limits to having' where he suggests an attitude of concern, which can foster restraint in materialism. And secondly purity in the means of production to prevent misuse of resources.</p>
<p>Strong logic and expansive knowledge laid the foundation for his philosophy. It reinforced his belief in nonviolence as the fundamental religion of mankind. All his research and work emphasized the importance of conduct as the determining quality of humankind.</p>
<p>Acharya Mahaprajna practices the philosophy he preaches. As a teacher he imparts to his students the importance of living the philosophy one learns. He spends at least four hours daily teaching the monks, nuns and lay nuns.</p>
<p>Imbuing his philosophical quest with the spirit of scientific inquiry he has identified that all attitudes and behaviours of man are intrinsically controlled by the subtlemost level of consciousness through various biological processes. One's own effort can bring about a transformation in them. It is this idea that he has probed into through meditation and evolved the technique of Science of Living.</p>
<p>A Monk</p>
<p>Nathmal, as his parents had named him, was the only son of businessman Tolaram and his wife Baluji. He was born on 14 th June 1920 in the village of Tamkor , Jhunjhunu district, Rajasthan. Even as Nathmal was playing with his friends, a sage passing through the village prophesied that this young boy would one day be a leader among men. A few years later destiny saw Nathmal initiated into monk hood on 18 th February 1930.</p>
<p>Being an antar-mukhi ascetic in nature, Acharya Mahaprajna lives within himself. He has observed periods of complete isolation where he has sought answers and refined his understanding of the world.</p>
<p>Believing that both science and spirituality are quests for truth and so they must work together to get there and bring benefits to mankind, Acharya Mahaprajna imbues his quest with scientific enquiry.</p>
<p>Emerging from years of spiritual penance Acharya Mahaprajna enunciated a technique of meditation and contemplation for bio-chemical and bio-electrical changes in the body called Preksha Dhyan. Through this technique it has been observed that endo-crinal hormones can be balanced and emotional intelligence can be enriched, negative emotions can be overcome, metabolic activities can be regulated and stress can be effectively managed. Chronic conditions of heart ailments, diabetes, hypertension etc., have found beneficial results. Medical researches on the technique of Preksha meditation reveal new dimensions everyday. In pedagogy, Preksha meditation as part of the Science of Living programme, has proved to be useful not only as a learning tool but also to bring about a transformation of the heart. It forms the basis of Value education programmes and has won acceptance with many educational bodies like NCERT, NCTE and others.</p>
<p>According to him, the institute of `education' has to fulfill the task of complete transformation of human consciousness. It should result in a peaceful, happy and healthy life for the individual. Such individuals will build a non-violent and dynamic society. Acharya Mahaprajna has detailed out his ideas in his `Manifesto on Education.'</p>
<p>In the year 1955, Acharya Mahaprajna was nominated to function as the Chief Secretary of the Terapanth Community. In 1978, his extraordinary achievements in the world of letters won him the title of "Mahaprajna". On 4 th February 1979 Acharya Tulsi nominated him as the Yuvacharya or his successor. Acharya Mahaprajna was called upon to assume full charge of the Sangha of monks and nuns and as the spiritual leader of the community on 18 th February 1994 and a year later on the 5 th of February 1995 he was formally consecrated as the tenth Acharya of the Terapanth Community.</p>
<p>Acharya Mahaprajna has unstinted devotion to his teacher and Guru Acharya Tulsi. In his dedication, he feels, lies the secret of his moral and spiritual strength.</p>
<p>Acharya Mahaprajna still walks from village to village, adhering strictly to all the rigours imposed on a Jain monk. Applying his learning to his own life has brought him respect from one and all and even the President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who said in his message that, " I am seeing in our country, a great sage, who has been performing "Tapas" for the 75 years. Through the intense Tapas, he has freed himself from passion, anger, love and hate. Presence of such great souls in the country, spreads peace and promotes spiritual prosperity. He is a beacon light that attracts lesser mortals towards him to become an enlightened soul.</p>
<p>"There are three characteristics of his Tapas: Walk, acquire and give. He walks with undeterred dedication and concentration; acquires knowledge from every one he meets as well as from nature; and radiates hope to society through his writings, actions and practice."</p>
<p>A Social Reformer</p>
<p>According to Acharya Mahaprajna Indian culture has always admitted that man can transform himself through penance and resolve. Reducing this idea to very practical capsules, Acharya Mahaprajna's guru and predecessor, Acharya Tulsi launched the Anuvrat movement where anu means small and vrat means vows. The essence of the movement was to inculcate self-discipline and self-restraint. Anuvrat Mahasamiti and Anuvrat Nyas are two organizations working towards the propagation and promotion of Anuvrat. Anuvrat Vishva Bharati which has earned accreditation from UN has taken the programme internationally and the well known Ladnun Declaration, the Rajasmand Declaration are a few outcomes of the same.</p>
<p>As Acharya Mahaprajna places greatest emphasis on nonviolence an Ahimsa samvay has been formed as a forum where various organizations working in the field of enhancing ahimsa and moral values as well as individuals working in the field join to address the issue. Jain Vishva Bharati Institute is a deemed University set up with the inspiration Acharya Mahaprajna to expressly offer education and training in such ideals. Acharya Mahaprajna is the anushastha or spiritual guide of the University.</p>
<p>Nonviolence is not just a principle for social interaction it is the secret of a healthy life. Inspired by this philosophy Acharya Mahaprajna set out on an Ahimsa Yatra on 5 th December 2001. He has travelled through four states of India taking with him the cause of non-violence. He played a prominent role in bringing peace and assuaging conflicts in strife ridden Gujarat in the year 2002.</p>
<p>Training in Nonviolence is an important aspect of Acharya Mahaprajna's teachings and all through his walk of over 6000 kilometers during the Ahimsa Yatra he has imparted this training to millions of villagers.</p>
<p>Believing as Acharya Mahaprajna does in the truth in all forms of thoughts and beliefs, he invited fifteen spiritual leaders from nine different religions during his Ahimsa Yatra, to draw up an agenda to prepare an enlightened citizen. This charter was presented to the President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam as the Surat Spiritual Declaration (SSD). The SSD galvanized different parts of India and the spiritual leaders came forth to institute a Foundation for Unity of Religions and Enlightened Citizenship (FUREC) as the platform for all their actions. With Acharya Mahaprajna and Dr A.P.J.Abdul Kalam as the benefactors, the Foundation is drawing support from all corners.</p>
<p>A Writer</p>
<p>His conviction in the principle of nonviolence made Acharya Mahaprajna sensitive to the subtleties of life. His works of fiction, poetry and creative writing are inspired by this sensitivity. Imbued with philosophy, his writings are characterized by brevity and intensity. His training as a monk taught him restraint and he applied it to his writings as well expressing a lot without actually saying it.</p>
<p>One verse from the book Sounds of Silence reads:</p>
<p>This is wisdom Sun and shade inseparable, yet never one.</p>
<p>The importance of peaceful co-existence has been his refrain and so it finds expression even in a casual observance of nature. Nature has been his teacher several times and one such lesson on usefulness is couched in the following words from his book `Akshar ko Pranam":</p>
<p>I worship the Neem that sitting on the chariot of the wind roams and reaches me. No enthusiasm in my mind to worship the wish-fulfilling tree All endowing though it may be. Like life and death this schism can never be bridged.</p>
<p>Learning from the whole as it were,Acharya Mahaprajna is also a great teacher, with his clarity of thought and simplicity in expression.</p>
<p>Often a verse or thought of his captures the essence of a discourse from the Gita or the Upanishads, the Agamas and other such texts. He has put them down in succinct prose also, like this one from his book EVERYDAY: a collection of thoughts of each day, which reads:</p>
<p>"What is desire? An expression of one's own incompleteness?"</p>
<p>"If the attempt to erase darkness is not successful try to search for light within it. Darkness will subside automatically."</p>
<p>Acharya Mahaprajna has worked with all forms of literature. He has revelled in the art of playwriting in the form of traditional Sanskrit dramas like Asru Veena and Ratnapalacharitam. Using the imagery within the language of Sanskrit and weaving the wisdom of nature with man's power that lies beyond the mind Acharya Mahaprajna has delved freely and easily into the world of fiction. His plays, conscious of stagecraft and of the viewer's involvement takes him or her from the mundane to the sacred with the ease and felicity of an artist.</p>
<p>He has several books to his credit.</p>
