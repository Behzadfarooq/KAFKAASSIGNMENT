<p>I don't know about the opening paragraph. I don't think the humour is really 'surreal'. 194.247.239.180 14:01, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree. There are enough elements of magical realism and absurdity to definitely qualify surreal humour.

<dd>Also, I just looked at the "Roast Beef in Heaven 1" section. There is a bit where he notices that the door says <i>C.

<dd>Antaeus is correct - the strip is December 2, 2002. Roast Beefs line is "When I was born, I wasn't really developed all the way. They couldn't tell if I was gonna be a man or a lady." -- curious_jp</dd>

<p>I love Achewood. Bunches. But no comic is perfect. In the spirit of NPOV, would it make sense to link to anything that criticizes Achewood? Anecdotally I know of people saying that the arcs are too long or you have to read from the beginning to understand things, etc. JUST AN IDEA! <a href="../../../j/d/7/User%7EJD79_8d62.html" title="User:JD79">JD79</a> 03:48, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Linking to a criticism of an ideology is acceptable practice, but this is wikipedia. It is here to state objective facts, not review art. I believe criticisms would be unnecessary. <a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpsenaut_2953.html" title="User:Ipsenaut">Ipsenaut</a> 04:32, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose so, though some of the pages on Religion and Political Thought have links to specific criticisms. However, I will concede the point that criticisms of things like Christianity, Nihilism, and Socialism are all widely-studied fields in and of themselves, whereas criticism of Achewood rests solely with people that just don't like fun. <a href="../../../j/d/7/User%7EJD79_8d62.html" title="User:JD79">JD79</a> 01:47, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recent edits removed some of the <tt>&lt;div style="clear: both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</tt> markup, calling it "bogus HTML". To see what those tags were for, try viewing the page while making the text size extremely small; you'll see that the floating pictures for Pat and Teodor now bump into the following sections in an ugly way. If you removed the tags in a section that has less text, like Lyle's, the problem would be apparent at a normal text size. Not "bogus", just a useful precaution when you have text wrapped around pictures - so please don't remove the rest of the tags. ←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 21:08, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Those tags are exactly what's in the {{clear}} template. If you type {{subst:clear}} you'll get the same thing (and it's really not a great idea to use templates without "subst" for minor formatting like that, as it makes the server do extra work). Regardless, there's no reason to remove valid HTML without checking what it does first. ←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 22:57, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Somebody should cull the list of minor characters, because it's getting kind of ridiculous. I think only characters who have appeared in multiple story arcs should be included (and who weren't the primary subject of the arcs they were in), i.e. the Tenmen, Nice Pete, Todd, Little Nephew, the robots, and so on. Also Molly should be considered a minor character. 132.236.113.119 19:04, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Molly is definitely a major character, IMO. She's at least as prominent these days as, say, Pat. I say the eight major characters should stay as is.</dd>
<dd>I count 30 minor characters on the list (counting collective entries like The Tenmen as one each). I'd say start by culling it to 25. I nominate these characters for deletion:
<ul>
<li>Andy (least prominent robot character; never even has a spoken line AFAIK)</li>
<li>Barry Bass</li>
<li>Leo Fontanette (I wrote most of his bit, so I'd be sort of sad to see him go, but he wasn't around for long)</li>
<li>Magreaux dog (doesn't even deserve to be listed, much less have his own article)</li>
<li>Milklin Honniker</li>
</ul>

<dd>List of characters in Achewood article is a good idea, actually. You could include as many characters as you wanted in that. And maybe separate articles for major characters, though we'd have to come to an agreement on what a "major character" is.

<dd>It is never directly stated that Vlad is Polish, but in a comic that appears in the paid archive and also in the back of book 2 as a bonus comic, he mentions that "In Poland ... the women are paying as much as 50 Zloty to sleep with man with basic Hotmail account."

<p>Does anyone know to properly pronounce <i>Achewood</i>? I think this is important information to have in the article.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that Chris's official answer is that it's pronounced "Aik-wood" like "headache". I've always said "ash-wood". I don't want to email him with such an insipid question and I figure someone already has a reference for this.</p>
<p>It's definitely (head) ache-wood. Ash-wood makes no sense. Achewood is what you get if you drink Achewater. And it's sort of a pun on Oakwood.</p>
