<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reply to el Lobo</span></h2>
<p>&lt;&lt;<i>That you assume to hold the power of life or death over this article bespeaks the arrogance of belief, prejudice, and bias.</i>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>If you mean the single-person you, I do not. If you mean the plural you, most definitely. And why not? We are the Wikipedians who collectively make up the Wikipedia. On the other hand, you (single-person you) do seem to assume you hold the power of life or death over this article. You are free (if not welcome), to list this article for speedy deletion. However, this article clearly does not meet the criteria, and I seriously doubt any administrators will take you up on it.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<i>Just because two thirds of this nation are Christian</i>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Fortunately, you don't have to gain the consensus of the nation - or since Wikipedia is international, the English-speaking world. You don't even have to gain the consensus of the entire Wikipedia - which would tend to tilt the odds in your favor, since non-Christians are disproportionately represented here. You just have to reach a consensus with the other contributors to this article - many of whom are not Christian. You aren't, I'm not. Not sure about the others. They might be Christians, they might not be. (Might as well lay down your cards people - the pro-Acharyans are going to accuse us of being biased anyway.) It would not be wise for you to simply assume that everyone who disagrees with Acharya is a Christian. While we are on the subject, what are <i>your</i> religious beliefs?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<i>adament an opponent to prejudice, belief, bias, hate, racism and subjectivity.</i>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Wow, I get to flex my philosophical muscles!</p>
<ul>
<li>Prejudice - actually, prejudice is pro-survival. We are wired by millions of years of evolution to come to snap judgements. It is better to come to a nearly-correct decision at once (that the orange-and-black stripped object over there is a dangerous predator) than to make a correct one after hours of reflection (that's a good way to wind up as kitty chow). Of course, we owe to ourselves to double-check our prejudices. I'm willing to revaluate my beliefs about Acharya, anytime you are willing to try to convince me.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Belief - I believe that I'm sitting in front of a computer right now. I believe that I am human. I even believe that I exist. Are you saying I shouldn't believe these things?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bias - bias helps us to come to snap judgements. We are hard-wired to be biased - experiments have shown that we have emotional reactions to even nonsense strings of syllables. But, just as we have an obligation to doublecheck our prejudices, we have an obligation to overcome our bias - if we have a reason to do so.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hate - So, would you say that it is wrong to hate prejudice, belief, bias, hate, racism and subjectivity? Though I would say that it is wise to love the sinner, hate the sin.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Racism - your opposition to it is commendable. But I fail to see how it applies in this situation. What race would you say that your fellow contributors belong to? Are you saying that we are discriminating against Achayra because she is a WASP?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Subjectivity - As my ethics prof says, "ought implies can". If you say that we ought not to be subjective, you are implying that we can be otherwise. I disagree. We will always be influenced by our prejudices, our biases, our pre-existing beliefs. But we might be able to affect how much we are influenced by those things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Re: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alteripse#Acharya_S_2" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alteripse#Acharya_S_2" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alteripse#Acharya_S_2</a></p>
<p>If I were engaged in a conspiracy, I would take care for the conspiracy to be kept secret. I have the ability to privately email other Wikipedians - a form of communication that others would be hard pressed to intercept. You will also note that the first person I suggested we "recruit" into this "conspiracy" was James, a pro-Acharyan. A most odd choice for an anti-Acharyan conspiracy!</p>
<p>My intention was to break up the two combatants. It was clear to me that Zarove and James were engaging in an escalating cycle of mutual recrimination. I hoped that by approaching them seperately, we might be able to broker a compromise. Unfortunately, schoolwork caught up with me, and I was unable to put this plan into action.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<i>As an example: the introduction of the Noahide Laws without referencing where you obtained the information is an example of slanting the article to make it seem that she is antisemitic.</i>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Actually, I'm fairly sure that even the original version of that passage included a link to Acharya's article. And I repeat, you are welcome to suggest alternative langauge.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<i>It is worthy of note that she has criticisms of Buddhism and Islam, as well.</i>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>That doesn't mean that she can't be antisemitic in addition to hating (or at least criticising) other religions as well. Accusations of antisemitism are rather touchy, but she is accusing Jews of taking part in the shadowy "New World Order". Shades of the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion" there.</p>
<p>Back to the task at hand - my rewrite of the Criticism section. My ethics as a scholar-in-training don't include an obligation for objectivity. But they do include an obligation for honesty and self-criticism. That means taking the objections of my ideological opponents (who might well be my personal friends - personal animosity is not required in a scholarly debate!) into consideration. My ethics also include the need for peer-review. So, I say again, you will be given every opportunity to raise objections, and we will do our best to address those objections. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 19:59, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Going through the Criticisms</span></h2>
<p>I'm starting to read over the big honking stack of printouts. I've just gotten to Acharya's response to Robert Price. Apparently Acharya believes that the Masons were the instigators of the Christ Conspiracy. Robert Price scoffed at that. Her reply, in part, was that "For modern examples of masonic connection to religion, all one need to do is investigate Mormonism and the Jehovah's Witnesses." Firstly, could somebody get me some Advil? Secondly, could el Lobo, or AJA, or somebody who has actually read her stuff outline her proposed narative of the Christ Conspiracy? I think providing this outline in the article just gained a whole new level of importance for me. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 22:31, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Back to the point about "She bills herself as...", I'm reading her response to Holding, and she says "my own credentials - meager in quantity but not in quality - are far greater than Holding's..." This suggests that I might be right in my hypothesis that it was Paranoia Magazine that was engaged in puffing up her reputation, not her. Can anybody find an example of her labeling herself as a historian, religious scholar, linguist, and archeologist?</p>
<p>From what I've seen, her critics begin by attacking her most plausible propositions, and working down from there. I think we ought to do the opposite, start with the most implausible and work towards the more plausible. To do that, I think I'm going to need that outline. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 23:22, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is Acharya responding to the same criticism I just read? She quotes Holding as saying "S is for Stench" and "low-rent intellect". I used Firefox's find feature on Holding's criticism, and neither turned up. I thought she might be referring to this: <a href="http://tektoonics.com/parody/achyvssheila.html" class="external free" title="http://tektoonics.com/parody/achyvssheila.html" rel="nofollow">http://tektoonics.com/parody/achyvssheila.html</a> But same thing. What's going on here? <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 23:45, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to Mike Licona, "The thesis of The Christ Conspiracy is that pagans and Jews who were Masons from the first and second centuries got together and invented the account of Jesus and his disciples in order to create a religion which it was hoped would serve as a one-world religion for the Roman empire. This religion would be a collage of all other world religions and combined with astrology." Does anybody have anything to add to this statement? <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 00:30, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Whoever you are... I have not made a change in this page since the 19th. The last edit was by AJA. Before you go jumping the gun with false accusations and making warnings, I would point out to you that in the real world there are consequences for ones actions. To be accused unjustly, just might cause someone to become more resolute, determined and stubborn and get exactly what it is you are warning against. Your vandalism is 100 times beyond the one you accuse of.</p>

<dd>A biography is an account of the of the events that comprise a person's life. Without their cooperation, to do that, they would have had to have lived a life somewhat public in nature. Putting the pieces of a persons life together means that you would have to interview their relatives, friends, associates and aquaintances. Not an easy chore and one that is very time consuming. Verifying what oters say about someone else is a daunting experience. Just making simple reports on an incident can take hours of unraveling who said what about whom. A brief bios, as I have mentioned previously, for the purposes introducing an author to an audiance, should be geared to show who they are, the reason the bio is being written and how that concerns what they have authored.</dd>

<p>I am a cautious person. Trust does not come easy to me, it has to be earned. I know CYA when I hear it. Way too many years in the trenches. You cannot be serious when you say you desire to exhibit scholarship after having declared your intention to not read the very material you (laughingly) critique. Read the books... then critique. By the way, most of the material you are seeking has been, point by point, covered in these discussions. Use your scholarly abilities to read them, it won't take long, and you can eliminate most of your questions. Then, if you have any questions, ask me and I will endeavor answer them or will look them up for you.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Finished reading the criticisms</span></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, it does look like I'm going to have to read the books. I was hoping to <i>assist</i> others who had actually read the books, but that doesn't look like it's going to work. After going through the criticims, I've managed to gather a partial impression of her actual thesis:</p>
<p>She believes that a conspiracy involving free-masons, pagans, and Jews fabricated not only the gospel accounts of Jesus and the story of Jesus' life, but also the story of the apostles, and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul.html" title="Paul">Paul</a>, and apparently <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a>. She says Paul's letters were fabrications, forgeries. She argues that not only the sections from <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavius_Josephus_3997.html" title="Flavius Josephus">Flavius Josephus</a> that <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus_on_Jesus_9e8f.html" title="Josephus on Jesus">deal with Jesus</a> were fabricated (which has at least some support with mainstream scholars, although according Mike Licona they are in the minority), but also the passage that deals with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a> - something that virtually no scholar believes. (The only reason I put in the "virtually" is because there is always the lunatic fringe...) She also apparently states that Josephus was a freemason (therefore probably part of the conspiracy). She also states that Tacitus' passage on Jesus (see <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacitus_on_Jesus_7fcc.html" title="Tacitus on Jesus">Tacitus on Jesus</a>) was a fabrication, added by a Christian editor, on the basis that nobody cited it until the 15th century. This allegation seems to be unique to Acharya.</p>
<p>One of her major burdens of proof would be to provide evidence for the existence of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> before the 17th century.</p>
<p>She states that, in addition to more likely candidates, certain obscure forms of Hinduism and Buddhism were "plagiarized" in the fabrication of the Christ Myth. If Mike Licona is to be believed, these branches were either influenced by Christianity, or at least post-date the writing of the Gospels.</p>
<p>There is some discussion about astrology, that the twelve tribes of Israel were based on the twelve signs of the Zodiac, that Judaism had its origins in moon worship, and that the "fish sign" of Christianity was selected because it symbolized that Jesus marked the beginning of the Age of Pisces. Other than the last, I'm not sure how this ties into her larger thesis. All of these allegations are debatable.</p>
<p>It says something about this dispute that nobody saw fit to mention the bit about the freemasons. Are there any other surprises lurking for me around the corner? I'm already aware, vaguely, of her comments about beings from beyond the third dimension. Anything else?</p>
<p>At any rate, what I think we should do, in the long term, is this: have a rather lengthy section on her thesis, and intergrate the criticisms of her thesis into that section. We can save criticisms about Acharya's person for a different section.</p>
<p>For now, I suggest we concentrate on writing a section on her thesis, and save criticising it for later. Unless there are objections, I think I'll put what I wrote above into more neutral language and use that. So, el Lobo, do you have anything to add to the above? It's not perfect, but it'll have to do until I can actually read the books.</p>
<p>As for your comments:</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<i>I know CYA when I hear it.</i>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Hmm. Yes, I suppose you could describe my self-enforced rules of conduct as CYA. I do like it when ethical principles have the backing of enlightened self-interest.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<i>Way too many years in the trenches.</i>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>You don't say? What is your background? Tell us about yourself.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<i>You cannot be serious when you say you desire to exhibit scholarship...</i>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Oh, I do <i>desire</i> to exhibit scholarship. That is not to say that I'm any <i>good</i> at it. I'm still in training. Although this is my sixth year of college, I'm still only the equivalent of a junior.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<i>Whoever you are... I have not made a change in this page since the 19th. The last edit was by AJA.

The good wikipedian who left you that message was not <i>calling</i> you a fag. And, no, the person who vandalised the article most likely did not deliberately steal your IP address. Most likely, you are being dynamically assigned one by your <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_service_provider.html" title="Internet service provider">internet service provider</a> every time you log on to the internet.

<dd>Regarding Masonry... do quote where Acharya states a "belief" "that a conspiracy involving free-masons, pagans, and Jews fabricated not only the gospel accounts of Jesus and the story of Jesus' life, but also the story of the apostles, and Paul, and apparently John the Baptist."

<p>My background is immaterial. I write the words to stand on their own merit. I am inconsequential to them. Read them for what tehy say. What you do with them is beyond my control. I won't be around all that long to own up to them anyway. I have to apologize for not making myself clear on that warning notice. In my opoinion, wikipedians are far too quick to pull out these warnings prior to any discussion of them. I neglected to reflect that (as I have been told myself) that this is what these discussion pages are about. My only excuse is that I wrote it between 4:30 and 5 AM after a restless, sleepless night.</p>

To AJA... just thought a little medicine might serve to illustrate what the current version looks like. With few exceptions, the whole piece is slanted. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Most of what is posted is unneeded, unwarranted and is designed to smear the author in an effort to dissuade the reader from reading the books. "The most common type of vandalism is the replacement of existing text with obscenities, page blanking, or the insertion of other wholly irrelevant content. Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Apparent bad-faith edits that do not make their bad-faith nature inarguably explicit are not considered vandalism at Wikipedia." After all... by your reckoning, what you did to what I wrote is exactly what I did to yours which makes you the vandal now.</p>

<p>My comment as to the timeline of Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity was in response to "She states that, in addition to more likely candidates, certain obscure forms of Hinduism and Buddhism were "plagiarized" in the fabrication of the Christ Myth.

<p>and intellectual honesty which is contrary to how this article has been handled. For my part... it should be asked why is this article published on Wikipedia? From what I can see, it exists because two books were written. Without those books, the author would not be mentioned. So, it should tell about the books with a cursory bio about the author but only as it pertains to the books and that should be all. Short, sweet, to the point, listing only that information that would aid a reader who is so inclined to check into it.

<p>So, now you feign reading minds. You do not know what I wish... but by your own observation declare what you wish were true.

You set the standards according to your own judgment which was preordained by your own beliefs. Under these circumstances, this article should never have been allowed to stand.

I know you are a smart and I hope a fair man. I find your site at Wiki interesting. You are obviously very talented. Now why does anyone have to put up with the incompetents here, who do practice bias and call people names...like buffoon and nutcase? They insist on being demeaning and derogatory to Acharya, her viewpoint and anyone who tries to put it in balance. No one in their right mind objects to valid or even invalid criticism so long as reasonable counterpoints are put in place for balance. Play fair and let the reader decide. I dont see that happening here and at other sites I have been. I am not an expert at this editing here at Wiki Charles, but I am good at stating a case without bias and presenting balance.

The Michael Licona story might expand to something useful, I don't know. As I say, I'm not ruling on content, but the article needs to have a reasonable overall shape. One known weakness of the wiki model is that when edit wars occur, the rest of an article tends to get neglected. I'm particularly aware of this in the case of this page.

<dd>In the first place, if you're excluding personal quarrels, you'd have to exclude any criticisms at all because that woman makes everything a personal quarrel. It's apparently the only mode of discussion she has. You finally added a link to the Licona article, although, for some reason I don't understand, you link to her rebuttal but not his rebuttal of hers. The thing is, in your "criticisms" section, the only person deemed worthy of mention <i>agrees with her thesis</i>. That's not neutral. Furthermore you altered what the generic "critics" say so that they don't even dispute her accuracy! A thing based on secondary sources can be fine, as long as the secondary sources are good. A thing based on outdated and fringe sources has serious problems. While I'm at it, the new Life section puts all the "impressive" stuff first before getting around to mentioning she only has an undergraduate degree in liberal arts in the second paragraph.

<p>Consideration of the use of the term "critic" in the Criticisms (the act of criticizing, especially adversely) category... it means to make harsh or carping judgments; a faultfinder. In light of this it is not difficult to see that the whole category is contrived to serve but one purpose... even if it pretends to a balance with opposing views. It's all in the presentation, in how it is said. It is not difficult to read between the lines. "All the fun's in how you say a thing." -Robert Frost</p>

How exactly is discussing various theories relating to the etymology of the word 'solomon' a valid criticism? <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">^^James^^</a> 05:49, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is simply the same Liableous soprt of claim hat you alledge we make. You have no real evidence that I wrote a peice to smear Dorothy. In fact, if you rad through any version,even those I personally edited, you iwll find not one hint of my personal beleifs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you look at what you or James have done, you will see plenty of partisain rambligns in an attemto to remove her claims that woudl reveal her for what she is, acceptabc of her self promotional claims abotu herself withotu queasiton, refusal to allowtour own argumetns for such inclusion in the article proper, and removal orf all critism.</p>
<p>So, rather than Hypocriticlaly attack me and sya I only wanted to push my beleifs, look at reality. You do nohtign but try to push your beelifs, and rmeove anyhtign that woudl cause one to pause and consider that perhaps this is not thebest source.</p>
<p>I have not crtiissed Doorthy's work in this artilce, neither have I done anyhtign to advance my beleifs. I merley report on her beleifs. You, on thd other hand, promote her beelifs. I also report on the known facts of her life. ( Which I didnt getfrom her ex-Boyfriend, by the way, I called courthouses and her school and such. I did a peice pn her. So let her call the FBI, what I did was a absic background search.)</p>

<p>Actually this isnt true at all. What I do is postinformaiton, such as that her son wasabducted in 2005. She posted th elink on her own website. it was removed here. I also post thather works arent tkenseriosuly in Academia. Thats pretty danged evident. I also posted that her beelif was that Jesus was a SOlar Myth andeven went so far as to rpelicate her entire list of claims.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;<i>Regarding Masonry... do quote where Acharya states a "belief" "that a conspiracy involving free-masons, pagans, and Jews fabricated not only the gospel accounts of Jesus and the story of Jesus' life, but also the story of the apostles, and Paul, and apparently John the Baptist." You state that she "believes" this... any proof that this is a fact?</i>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Is there any <i>evidence</i> that she has this belief? (There is an <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemological</a> difference between "proof" and "evidence", just to nitpick. Even if I had a signed note from Acharya saying that she holds these beliefs, that would not be proof, because it could be forged. It would, however, be fairly strong evidence.) At least in the criticisms, there is evidence to support this statement.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Freemasons</b>: Mike Licona states, "The thesis of The Christ Conspiracy is that pagans and Jews who were Masons from the first and second centuries got together and invented the account of Jesus and his disciples in order to create a religion which it was hoped would serve as a one-world religion for the Roman empire." Acharya, in her rebuttal, doesn't see fit to challenge this characterization. Further, he expends an entire section on Freemasonry. In her rebuttal, Acharya does not rebut the allegation that she believes that Masons were involved, but rather defends her allegations that they are. For example, she states that "In addition, in establishing the Masonic connection to Christianity, I reproduce a long excerpt from Thomas Paine's 'Origin of Freemasonry.'"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>He also quotes Acharya as saying "The historian Josephus certainly knew of the Masons and allegedly was one . . ."(108) This demonstrates that Acharya believes that the Masons have been around since at least the first and second centuries AD.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even assuming that Licona is flat out lying, Acharya's words in her response show that she believes that there is a Masonic connection to Christianity. The above quote demostrates that she believes them to have been around for much longer than is commonly suspected. At most, he is lying about Acharya claiming that they were involved in the original conspiracy. Acharya saw no reason to contradict him in this statement though. In short, I see no reason to doubt Licona's characterization of Acharya's thesis as stating that freemasons were involved in the creation of the "Christ Conspiracy". My main confusion is this: does Licona mean (pagans and Jews) who were free-masons, or pagans and (Jews who were free-masons)?</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Paul</b>: Again, according to Mike Licona: "She believes that all of Paul’s letters are forgeries. In support of this position she quotes Joseph Wheless: "The entire ‘Pauline group’ is the same forged class . . . says E. B. [Encyclopedia Biblica] . . . ‘With respect to the canonical Pauline Epistles, . . . there are none of them by Paul; neither fourteen, nor thirteen, nor nine or eight, nor yet even the four so long "universally" regarded as unassailable. They are all, without distinction, pseudographia (false-writings, forgeries). . .’"(48) She also quotes Hayyim ben Yehoshua who writes, "we are left with the conclusion that all the Pauline epistles are pseudepigraphic" and he also refers to Paul as a "semi-mythical" figure.(49) Again, this is a position that no major scholar takes."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose it could be that she believes that Paul was only <i>semi</i>-mythical - that there was a historical Paul, but his letters are forgeries and virtually everything we know about him is false.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>The Apostles</b>: I have no evidence to submit, except to note that 1) Mike Licona's summary of Acharya's thesis characterizes it as saying that, 2) Acharya didn't see fit to rebut the point, 3) if Acharya is going to say that Paul, who appears later in the mainstream historical narrative and had no personal interaction with Jesus, is (semi)-mythical, then I see nothing preventing her from claiming the same for the earlier apostles who are recording as having interactions with the mythical Jesus.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>John the Baptist</b>: Again, Mike Licona: "Murdock's claim is grossly naïve as well as false. Josephus’ passage on John the Baptist(73) is regarded as authentic and is hardly disputed by scholars. Edwin Yamauchi, Professor of History at Miami University writes, "No scholar has questioned the authenticity of this passage, though there are some differences between Josephus's account and that in the Gospels . . ."(74) New Testament scholar, Robert Van Voorst of Western Theological Seminary likewise comments that the passage by Josephus on John the Baptist is "held to be undoubtedly genuine by most interpreters"(75) and that "scholars also hold [it] to be independent of the New Testament."(76) John Meier, professor of New Testament at The Catholic University of America writes that Josephus' mentioning of John the Baptist is "accepted as authentic by almost all scholars" and that it "is simply inconceivable as the work of a Christian of any period."(77) Jewish scholar, Louis Feldman of Yeshiva University and perhaps the most prominent expert on Josephus comments on this passage: "There can be little doubt as to the genuineness of Josephus’ passage about John the Baptist."(78) Therefore, Murdock's comment that this passage has "been dismissed by scholars and Christian apologists alike as forgeries" is demonstrably false.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"The reasons for accepting the authenticity of this passage are: (a) The style and vocabulary belong to Josephus. (b) If a subsequent Christian editor added the passage, we would expect a comment about John's preaching regarding the Messiah who was Jesus. (c) An interpolator would most likely not have included the discrepancy between the Gospels and Josephus in terms of the reason John was executed."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I seem to recall that Josephus is the only source we have on John the Baptist outside the Gospels that was written close to the time that he lived. (My memory might be shaky on this.) Since no scholar believes that this passage of Josephus was fake, the only reason I can see for her to allege that it is is if she wants to imply that John the Baptist is mythical. Admittedly, my evidence on this point is rather shaky, hence the "apparently".</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Does Acharya believe this?</b> Actually, I have considered the possibility that all of this is a truly massive practical joke on the part of Acharya. However, that would be a violation of <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanlon%27s_Razor_789c.html" title="Hanlon's Razor">Hanlon's Razor</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll admit that I have not read Acharya's books. However, based on the evidence present in her critic's writings and in her own responses to those critics, I must concluded that her thesis is much as I have described it. If anybody who has actually read the book wishes to dispute my characterization of her thesis, my ears are wide open.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<i>Mike Licona must not be aware of the timeline of christianity... Hinduism dates to around 5000 BC <a href="http://hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/h_antiquity.htm" class="external free" title="http://hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/h_antiquity.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/h_antiquity.htm</a> and Buddhism to circa 500 BC <a href="http://www.aboutbuddhism.org/history-of-buddhism.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.aboutbuddhism.org/history-of-buddhism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aboutbuddhism.org/history-of-buddhism.htm</a></i>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The emphasis here is on <i>certain obscure branches</i> of Hinduism and Buddhism, not Hinduism and Buddhism themselves. The phrase "certain obscure branches" is my own, not Licona's, and it may be that, at least for the Hinduism branches, they are not all that obscure.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Krishna</b>: In Licona's reply to Acharya's response to his first article: "Regarding your “Christian sources,” Lundy and Georgius, even if you are correct, Lundy and Georgius write of their contemporary experiences with present-day Hindus. This does nothing to support your position that Hindus in antiquity worshipped a crucified Krishna. Hindu traditions on the life of Krishna come from the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhagavata_Purana_0034.html" title="Bhagavata Purana">Bhagavata Purana</a> and the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harivamsa.html" title="Harivamsa">Harivamsa</a>, which as I pointed out in my paper, both post-date the rise of Christianity and, therefore, do nothing to support your thesis.(57)"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Buddha</b>: From Acharya's rebuttal to Licona: "One aspect that demonstrates my knowledge of the orthodox story, which, naturally since it is readily available, long preceded my becoming aware of the contested information, is the fact that I cited these same contested characteristics. The same may be said concerning Buddha, which is obvious from my numerous footnotes, in particular as concerns the contested motifs, and from my statement on p. 109 of The Christ Conspiracy:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"'Because of this non-historicity and of the following characteristics of the Buddha myth, which are not widely known but which have their hoary roots in the mists of time, we an safely assume that Buddha is yet another personification of the ancient, universal mythos being revealed herein.' (Emph. added.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"For the intelligent, it should have been obvious that I know very well the orthodox tales of these various godmen. Hence, Licona is either being deceptive in his presentation of the facts or he is not as clever as he likes to think."</dd>
</dl>
<p>From Licona: "In your rebuttal and citing your own words from The Christ Conspiracy, you write of, “this non-historicity and of the following characteristics of the Buddha myth, which are not widely known [ital. yours] but which have their hoary roots in the mists of time . . .”(58) We still have yet to learn from where you get your “not widely known” information. You simply quote others who many times turn out being terribly wrong and unscholarly in both their exegesis and reasoning."</p>
<p>This is what I gather Licona is getting at: Acharya's characterizations of Buddhism and Hinduism are, on the whole, false. In the case of Krishna-worship, they might be true of certain sects, but the origins of these sects post-date the writing of the gospels, and therefore either represent a convergent, but independent, development in two religious traditions, or are else borrowings from Christianity. Assuming that Acharya's "not widely known" information pans out, the same might be true of Buddhism - not true for the vast majority of sects, but possibly true for certain sects. It has yet to be determined whether these hypothetical sects pre- or post-date the gospels.</p>
<p>At any rate, the dispute over the possible Eastern origins of certain themes of Christianity is merely a sideshow. What should be focused on is her allegation that large chunks of the New Testament are the fabrications of a conspiracy. While her allegation that Eastern religious traditions were used as source material by the conspiracy is interesting (because it would mean that this ancient conspiracy had far greater knowledge of India than what we think the Romans had), but I don't suppose it matters too much where the conspiracy got their material from. Her allegations of borrowing from Eastern traditions has about the same level of interest as her allegations that the sections of Tacitus dealing with the Christians are interpolations of later Christian editors. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 20:49, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Quite a mouthful there, but is it yours? You say you haven't read Acharya's work, but you sure like to blowhard a plenty through other mouthpeices. You really expect someone to explain every point to you?! Your carping adds about as much validity toward the subject as as a fart in a windstorm. I could just as well pontificate endlessly over a critique of Micheal Licona through his hostile detractors, without ever having read or studied his works. I guess that would make me an expert on him and his views!</p>
<p>The mature thing to do is to become familiarised with all sides and develope an overall knowledge of the subject, that way you can do your OWN thinking on a just basis. It is not up to you or I to make the decision about who is right or wrong, only to allow others to see and decide for themselves. Apparently, you don't want to do that for yourself, perhaps because of some preconceived hostility toward one view vs. another?

I have no truck with beliefs... the facts are fine with me. The only time I have removed anything was to deonstrate what you were doing. In all other instances, I included what was posted and did so with a refutation to it. If what you have posted was not the best sourse, then saying so with appropriate data is precisely what should be done.</p>
<p><br />
You have posted what others have said with impunity but in your comments on these pages have made your meaning clear. Show one instance where I have promoted anything of her let alone beliefs. You called the courthouse? What courthouse would that be? Who did you speak to there that passed on such information? You called her shool? What school? Who did you speak to there that passed on information about her? You did a basic background search? Just what does that consist of?</p>
<p><br />
Your denial is seen in your responses to the material and the author. It is unspoken but crystal clear in your comments on them and your inability to accept any counter to what you have to say of them. I am not privy to what transpired between you and James but from what was said, you threatened him and he responded in kind... go back and read what was said. Correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p><br />
As proven by your posted responses such as your constant harping of credentials, pen names, listing of opinions instead facts, inclusions of inappopriate personal information etc. and the fact that you have consistenly cried foul about any contention clainming it is to make her look good which is your excuse to remove it.</p>
<p><br />
What you have attempted to do is to have a one sided debate. That you should desire to post anything in regards to her family is just plain wrong. the fact that you are incapable of seeing that shows your level of commitment. Show where she is not taken seriously by academia. The very fact that she was accepted as a fellow in the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion demonstrates her acceptance in acedemia because it is a very elite group that consists of highest of acedemia. I know you fought that tooth and nail but had to finally capitulate. Not sure what the jesus myth has to do with this list but I would point out that belief has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><br />
For a journalist, you certainly are lacking in concepts... apparently, you have no idea what bullying and harrassing are about. A better command of the language, personal professionalism, principle, honesty, integrity, fairness, objectivity, and enough pride to endeavor to present a readable article are easily come by... all you have to have is the desire.</p>
<p><br />
Her legions of devotees? For all practicle purposes hter are two and the bulk of that has been me. Against how many? And you accuse me of bullying. How many have been deleted for improper behavior? And I harrass? It is a pecularity how blinders work... all that can be seen is where it is looking.</p>
<p><br />
Ha ha... thank you.</p>
<p><br />
No, I am not saying that anyone is conclusively right or wrong. From the very first instance all that is said is that she presents a thesis, a theory, an observation based on a whole set of comparisons. Personally, it is my opinion that she is very deligent scholar but that is my opinion and this is the very first time I have said anything of my thoughts on the matter. Does she venture into areas that I hold are of beyond the boundaries of my own observations? Sure... but she has that right just as do you but that should not (as opposed to you) sully the points that she makes that are valid.</p>
<p>Zarove... if the article is not about the books, then remove the criticisms that you have so steadfastly maintained. For that matter, outside stating she wrote them, remove all mention of them and see what is left. You have tried unsucessfully to perpetrate this ruse numerous times and it has yet to work. Why don't you just drop it.</p>

Zarov...who do you think you are fooling! I went back to the beginning of this talk page. You keep saying its about "Acharya"..not about her books or her views, yet right from the beginning of your own arguements and that of the others is the deliberate attempt to focus on her views! There you are with complete arguements attempting to "focus on her work" by misrepresenting details not only about her work, but her also. You keep repeating yourself...its about her..not about her views, but over and over, you come back to them with distortions. Do you really think people won't go back and read them. --<a href="../../../r/p/s/User%7ERpsugar_c3a3.html" title="User:Rpsugar">Skull</a> 07:08, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Some problems w/ the criticisms.</p>
<ol>
<li>re: "little primary research". How many times must this be brought up? Maybe AJA or Zarove could <i>define</i> primary research for us, to show they even know what it is.</li>
<li>re: "heavy reliance on outdated or fringe sources". Who said this? In reference to what? What is meant by "outdated" exactly? How does it square with <a href="http://www.truthbeknown.com/bibliography.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.truthbeknown.com/bibliography.pdf" rel="nofollow">reality</a>? Since the christ-myth theory is itself fringe, ie non-mainstream, how exactly is this a criticism? And isn't it a logical fallacy?</li>
<li>re: "show ignorance on what she writes, in particular of the Hindu and Buddhist traditions. ". Who said this? In reference to what? Was this in reference to the <i>book she wrote on the subject</i>??</li>
<li>How is Robet Price's embarrassment pertinent?</li>
<li>re "Solomon" reference: Isn't Acharya merely discussing various theories relating to the etymology of the word 'solomon'? What's wrong with that? How can Price possibly justify using this one flimsy example to characterize her whole book?</li>
<li>Why is the brief aside of "professional jealosy" considered pertinent? Couldn't you pick a more substantial example from Acharyas rebuttle? Ditto for her comments in response to Prices 'embarrassment'. Isn't this focusing on personality exchanges at the expense of substance?</li>
<li>re: "JP Holding, has no integrity" This quote is clearly taken out of context.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to reemphasize that while these criticisms are being applied to her work in general, they are based entirely upon book reviews of her first book.</p>
<p>Also, she attended the ASCSA, that should be included. Her essay should be included. The life section is a jumbled mess, it should be reorganized. Where it characterizes certain authors as her "main" references, can that be shown to be <a href="http://www.truthbeknown.com/bibliography.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.truthbeknown.com/bibliography.pdf" rel="nofollow">true</a>? Where is that info from? Does it apply to her whole body of work? Please cite sources.</p>
<p>I've revamped the article to reflect much of this perspective. <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">^^James^^</a> 20:53, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since someone has considered it fair to use the words of Robert Price's blanket statements, it is only fair that a response to his critique be given also outlining the silliness of it and the lack of ethics on his part. So I am going to edit the article with a response from Acharya to reflect this disingenousness: to wit this link--<a href="http://truthbeknown.com/firesponse.htm--" class="external free" title="http://truthbeknown.com/firesponse.htm--" rel="nofollow">http://truthbeknown.com/firesponse.htm--</a><a href="../../../r/p/s/User%7ERpsugar_c3a3.html" title="User:Rpsugar">Skull</a> 23:33, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Let's Focus on the work, not the person</span></h2>
<p>I think it is a mistake to <s>attack</s> focus on Acharya S herself. Let's focus on her ideas. It seems clear from the various pieces I've managed to read that she isn't just a Christ-mythist, but also a Christ-conspiracist. No, I haven't read her book, but I've just put in for it over Inter-Library Loan. I suppose we could wait for me to read it, but I'd rather save some time: Can somebody please tell me what Acharya's thesis was? Yes, "Christianity absorbed some elements of other religions" is part of it, but that's not the whole of it. She clearly states that Christianity was the result of a conscious conspiracy which deliberately plagarized elements of other religions. That puts her into an entirely different realm from the Christ-as-a-myth people such as Dr. Price.</p>
<p>Yet the article has been reworked to remove any evidence of the Christ Conspiracy concept. From the article, it appears that Acharya is just another member of the Christ-as-a-myth mob, albeit one with the odd notion that Eastern traditions went into the mix that formed the basis for Christianity.</p>
<p>I have no interest in "settling" the Christ-as-myth/Christ-as-a-conspiracy debate. But we owe it to our readers to at least outline what the debate <i>is</i>.</p>
<p>I believe that if we show Acharya's true thesis in all of its glory, a seperate Criticism section will be at best just icing-on-the-cake, at worst, beating a dead horse. There will be no need to use vague comments like "poor scholarship" and "lack of primary sources". The results of such faults will be available for anybody to see.</p>
<p>The same goes for the biography section. She could be a little furry blue creature from Alpha Centarui for all I care. So I propose that we simply use the resume she provides at the end of her "Reponse to Wikipedia", properly citing it. It'll have to be reworked a bit - I don't think we need to tell the world who her advisor was. We can always verify it at our leisure later. We might also want to tag on the bit about her religious history (also properly cited).</p>
<p>Any objections to any of that?</p>
<p>And yes, I do want her thesis spelled out for me. I'm going to read her book anyway, so why not save some time? <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 17:06, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Her THesis</span></h2>
<p>Basically, in a nutshell...</p>
<p><br />
1; The whole of all world religion's are based on Astrology, what she calls "Astro-theology".</p>
<p>2: The story of a Dying and raising saviour is very ancient,and all the elements found in Christian mythology predate Christendom, and are found, whole cloth, in earlier stories. IE&lt; Horus had 12 disiples, preached a semron on the mound, walked on water, was crifcified between two theives, and rose fom the dead.</p>
<p>3: The ancient ( SMart, peaceful, Goddess worhsipping) Pagans knew this was all a drama personifyign the sun.</p>
<p>4: The evil vile corrupt ROman State, run by Freemasons, Jews, ect, then wante dot unify the ORman Sttae so created a "Super" verison by combinign varisu myths into a signel eprson. ( Which makes no snece as each of the saviour socmbined each had ifential lvies ot eahc other andwhere actulaly the same person...the sun...)</p>
<p>5: They then forcedeveryoen to beelive in this myth as a rela hisotircal eprson.</p>
<p>6: Thoe who opposed 5 where slaughtered, peopel where forced to convert, sacred groces dedicate dot hee Goddes where desogyeed, and most of Ancient Literature was burned, resultign in ignroance and oppresion and widespread Illeteracy, due tot h evil, vule, corurpt HCurhc imposign tis iwll on anyoen who dared disagree.</p>
<p>7: The CHruch ocntinued to controle peopel brignign onthe Dark Ages. But the Heirarchs, suchas the Pope,knew the truth.</p>
<p>8: The evil corurpt Church then destroyed countless civilisaitons.</p>
<p>9: Now, vlaient, brave,and super intellegent Acharya S has revealed THE TRUTH! all a the risk of her own life!</p>
<p><br />
That abotu sums it up, you can read the basic outline here.Its the artivle that her Didiples want desperatley int he linsk section. It also is the whoel reasonthey are devoted to her.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">On this note.</span></h2>
<p>James continues to revert the aritlce ot a Biased presentaiton.</p>
<p><br />
1: The content is changed so as to word it in such a way as to minimalise the Conspiracy content and make Acharya seem far more reasonabel than she actulaly is.Word choice and often content are removed, or reworded.</p>
<p>Omitted are sections which Reference her point blank assertions thateven her followers know will sounds insane to most.</p>
<p>2: The Links section now contains three links to her website. THis is far more than any other wikipedia article.</p>
<p>3: Spakign fo this, they add her "Rebuttal" to Lucadia (Sp?) after hsi review. This not only is reduntant as we have a link to her site, btu the same is alreayd linked above in the main article. Likeise, in true Dishoenst fashion, they link to her rebuttsal, but not to his rejoinder.</p>
<p><br />
4: THey rmeove an unflatterign link. ( As they attmepted to before, with the Tekton article and RisenJesus one.) THe link is an E-Mail exchange soemoen had with the Author. THey remove it as it reveals that she cannot answer direct critism. ( I know, I know, they will say its "Itrrelevant" and hows "Zarovesneed ot smear." But if we have two Paranoia mag links, why not this?)</p>
