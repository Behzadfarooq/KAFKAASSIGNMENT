	    <p><b>== Is Eucharist really the blood and body of Christ? ==</b></p>
<p>At gospel according to John 6:54 it is written, "Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day". Why did Jesus compared his body and blood only to bread and wine and not to anything else? There couldn't have been a better illustration. It is written, "Jesus took bread and wine and said this is my body and blood." He meant to say his body was made the way bread is made and his blood was made the way wine is made. God had sifted Jesus' ancestors like grain from chaff in thousand years of captivity. The bodies of his ancestors were crushed the way the grain is crushed. They were beaten and thrashed in slavery in a way fine particles of grains are kneaded. They were baked in desert for 40 years. Only forty thousands survived to reach the land of Canaan. It was a kind of ethnic purification; in which only one woman most pure and virtuous had conceived Christ. For the reason Jesus had compared his body to bread. Let us see how wine is made? Jesus' blood was made like wine is made. Like grapes are crushed to make wine the bodies of his ancestors were crushed in slavery. His ancestor's blood had fermented in captivity like grape juice is fermented to produce wine. Bread and wine comprise only the most pure elements of grain and grapes; like wise Body and blood of Christ was made of consecrated elements of his ancestors. Bread is baked in oven; likewise body of Christ was baked in his passions. Wine is distilled to purify it further; likewise Jesus' soul was purified in passions. In death the soul the consecrated elements of his ancestors had changed in Holy Spirit; and had conjoined to the pure spirit of God. Jesus had asked his followers to eat his body and drink his blood and he asked them to do this in his memory. Please note he had asked them to do two things: first to eat his body and drink his blood. Second to do this in his memory. Those who merely eat his body and drink his blood will not have eternal life; but those who do this in his memory would have eternal life. The Eucharist helps us to recall Jesus' passion</p>
