<p>The first <i>Achewood</i> strip ("<a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=10012001" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=10012001" rel="nofollow">Philippe is standing on it</a>") was released on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. The strip sets the tone for the rest of the comic, with its nonsensical humor and surprising visual punchline. In this particular strip, <a href="#Cornelius_Bear" title="">Mr. Bear</a> and <a href="#T.C3.A9odor_Orezscu" title="">Téodor</a> are discussing Téodor's confusion over a <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drum_machine.html" title="Drum machine">drum machine</a>. Mr. Bear informs Téodor that there is an instruction manual. However, <a href="#Philippe" title="">Philippe</a> is standing on it.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of the comic, there is no distinguishable underlying storyline — aside, perhaps, for the general passing of time and development of the comic's characters and their interrelationships. Onstad's preferred method of story-telling is to develop his characters through one-off strips and short story arcs. Strips are humorous, relying upon inane and chaotic humor as well as social stereotypes, occasional burlesque literary and historical references, and strong characterization of the comic's many quirky individuals. As the humor often depends on an in-depth knowledge of the characters and their interactions, new readers may appreciate the series more if they start their reading earlier on in the series and progress chronologically from there.</p>
<p>Chris Onstad has self-published <a href="#Bibliography" title="">fourteen books</a>: seven collections of Achewood comics, two books by character Nice Pete ("A Wonderful Tale" and "A Hilarious Comedy"), four <a href="../../../z/i/n/Zine.html" title="Zine">'zines</a> by another named Roast Beef, and an Achewood cookbook with recipes from several of the main characters.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2002 <i>Achewood</i> 's "Sunday Edition" became part of the online <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_comics.html" title="Alternative comics">alternative comics</a> anthology <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serializer.html" title="Serializer">Serializer</a>. In their review of serializer.net, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Comics_Journal_4e9b.html" title="The Comics Journal">The Comics Journal</a> wrote: "It's a pleasure to see strips like Achewood's "Sunday" strip ... use the newspaper format for far more daring, entertainingly perverse work ... would be perfectly at home at a good alternative weekly or a great college paper."</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_30.html" title="April 30">April 30</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Onstad introduced a new feature to the <i>Achewood</i> universe — an advice column written by the character <a href="#Ray_Smuckles" title="">Ray</a> called <i>Ray's Place</i>. This column has served to further develop the Achewood canon by allowing prose related to the characters to be written. The column has developed characters, mainly as perceived by Ray. It also allows for an interaction between reader and character, a novelty in comic art.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2004.html" title="July 2004">July 2004</a> saw the introduction of several in-character <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blogs</a>. The main characters all began writing (using <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogger.com.html" title="Blogger.com">Blogger</a>) to speak to their audience. This unique perspective further advances character development allowing the daily, often mundane, events of the character to find their way to the audience. Onstad stated in an interview that he found the blogs easier to maintain than the strip, as they do not require as much refining. This method of breaking the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> has been extended further with the opening of a forum <a href="http://www.buyawhiteguyasubscriptiontoebony.org/forums/index.php?showforum=14" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.buyawhiteguyasubscriptiontoebony.org/forums/index.php?showforum=14" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> supposedly maintained by one of the characters, Emeril.</p>
<p>In late 2004, it was announced that Checker Book Publishing Group was to release a a collection of <i>Achewood</i> comics later that year.<sup id="_ref-bostonherald_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bostonherald" title="">[1]</a></sup> Checker had signed Chris Onstad to a three-book deal that was to begin in <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2004.html" title="November 2004">November 2004</a>. However, the deal was canceled soon after due to creative differences.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/h/Achewood.html" title="Edit section: Etymology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h3>
<p>According to the official website, "achewood" was used by slaves during the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States of America</a> <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">antebellum</a> in the production of "achewater", a now outlawed Southern drink with psychedelic properties, similar to the use of wormwood in the production of absinthe. This liquor would induce melancholia in the drinker, hence the name. This etymology is fictitious.</p>
<p>Some fans speculate that the title is an allusion to <a href="../../../a/2E/a/A.A._Milne_5e21.html" title="A.A. Milne">A.A. Milne's</a> <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Acre_Wood_55f8.html" title="Hundred Acre Wood">Hundred Acre Wood</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/h/Achewood.html" title="Edit section: The Underground">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Underground</span></h3>
<p>The Achewood Underground is an underground version of the human city above, inhabited and run by animals both stuffed and real, as well as several robots (although their presence in The underground could be debatable). The underground has its own businesses and establishments that parallel those above ground, and its inhabitants often steal or borrow things from their human counterparts aboveground. Aside from Achewood, it is assumed that most cities around the world have their own undergrounds as well. <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=10102003" class="external autonumber" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=10102003" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p><a href="http://raysmuckles.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://raysmuckles.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Ray's Blog</a></p>
<p>Ray Smuckles is a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">cat</a> (more specifically, an <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Curl_e1ff.html" title="American Curl">American Curl</a>, a breed that, appropriately enough, originated from <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakewood.html" title="Lakewood">Lakewood</a>, California) with expertise in such diverse fields as <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooking.html" title="Cooking">cookery</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>, underground street dancing, piano playing, <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entrepreneurship.html" title="Entrepreneurship">entrepreneurship</a>, and <a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman.html" title="Woman">women</a>. Ray made his first appearance on January 10, 2002. Along with his best friend Roast Beef, Ray is the central character of the strip; their relationship lies at the heart of Achewood. Ray can be identified by his designer glasses, a <a href="../../../g/-/s/G-string.html" title="G-string">thong</a>, the occasional <a href="../../../f/u/r/Fur_coat.html" title="Fur coat">fur coat</a>, and a gold medallion which once belonged to the fictitious Incan Fun God, "<a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06012005" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06012005" rel="nofollow">King Chochacho</a>." Ray often speaks of his heritage: his mother's family, the Culpeppers, are French Catholic Southern gentry, while his father's, the Smuckles, are a diverse collection of tough, philosophical underworld characters (more below).</p>
<p>Ray tends to be lucky, acquiring money in a variety of ways, including a record contract with Sony (after selling his soul to the devil for a piano that grants the buyer musical genius <a href="http://achewood.com/?date=11042002" class="external autonumber" title="http://achewood.com/?date=11042002" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), an auspicious eBay purchase of vintage erotica valued at 600 million dollars, and various business ventures. Through eBay Platinum Reserve, he now owns <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airwolf.html" title="Airwolf">Airwolf</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Moon_5784.html" title="Keith Moon">Keith Moon</a>'s head, and the world's biggest laser. He enjoys throwing lavish parties with unusual themes. Ray drives a <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadillac_Escalade_f14e.html" title="Cadillac Escalade">Cadillac Escalade</a>. He is very generous to his friends and to people in general, but on an entirely random basis and interspersed with long periods of outright rudeness and total insensitivity. He also has a very serious obsession with <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketel_One_9c62.html" title="Ketel One">Ketel One</a> and zinfandel alcohols. Although Ray personally obtained his musical skills from a deal with the devil, we know there has been at least one other musical genius in his lineage, his paternal grandfather Antonyne Cheops Smuckles, better known as the legendary bluesman Rustmouth Chafings.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he has a weakness for gambling, and often loses up to thousands of dollars while playing golf and pool with his friends. Ray has a penchant for prank calls, whether outgoing (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marmaduke.html" title="Marmaduke">Marmaduke</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathy_%28comic_strip%29.html" title="Cathy (comic strip)">Cathy</a>) or incoming (<a href="../../../t/e/l/Telemarketing.html" title="Telemarketing">telemarketers</a>). He also has a sexual <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetishism.html" title="Fetishism">fetish</a> for women sitting on birthday cakes, although recently he has shown to have lost interest, and become a 'breast man'. Ray drinks alcohol throughout the day; numerous strips imply that he is an alcoholic, and his physician, Dr. Andretti, has repeatedly warned him that he is in severe danger of becoming <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diabetes.html" title="Diabetes">diabetic</a>. He recently learned his father, Ramses Luther Smuckles, won the 1973 Great Outdoor Fight, which inspired Ray to enter. Ray defeated all other entrants in the GOF except for Roast Beef (see below), and demolished the Fight grounds when he discovered that Fight regulations required that he beat Beef to unconsciousness in order to win.</p>
<p>Ray also writes the advice column "<a href="http://www.achewood.com/raysplace.php" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/raysplace.php" rel="nofollow">Ray's Place</a>" on the Achewood site, though there is a disclaimer at the bottom warning that the advice is in fact from a cartoon cat.</p>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>Ray was originally introduced as a minor supporting character, part of a trio of cats (along with Roast Beef and Pat) who were always seen together, and fancied themselves "the dirtiest dudes in town" due to their reputed penchant for foul language. As time passed, Onstad began to give the three cats individual personalities, and before long the focus of Achewood began to move away from the four stuffed animals living in the Onstad residence and onto Ray and Beef. The increasingly abrasive Pat remained in a supporting role, eventually turning the trio into a duo.</p>
<p>Ray is a member of a syndicate of other flamboyantly rich, jive-talking cats, including AKKOLADE and Bensington Butters, his rival. They spend their time on theme parties, weekend retreats and plotting to sabotage the other members' images.</p>
<p>Ray also witnessed the possible death of the surreal performer Cartilage Head, a lanky man with a skull-like, semi-malleable head, after being invited to dine with the performer after the show ended (Ray had hesitantly received his ticket from Roast Beef, and was seemingly the only member of the audience), where when attempting to mold his head he instead pushed too far and snapped it. Witnessing this, Ray fled from the room and jumped out a nearby window, where he found and drove off in an old <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model-T_d9e0.html" title="Model-T">Model-T</a> belonging to Cartilage Head. Following directions inside Cartilage Head's wallet, Ray drives to 921 Elden and enters the building, where his photo is taken and he falls unconscious. He wakes up the next morning to find a small photo holder on himself with a card inside with his frightened picture and text reading "I Proved Myself A Coward Who Would Desert A Dying Man."</p>

<p>It seems that Roast Beef has had a desperately unhappy and impoverished childhood. <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06302005" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06302005" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=07222005" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=07222005" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=04192005" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=04192005" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> He has seemingly incurable <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">depression</a> and/or <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avoidant_personality_disorder.html" title="Avoidant personality disorder">Avoidant personality disorder</a>, and considers <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> often, though no one seems to care. Recently however, his depression seems to have improved, particularly since meeting Molly. For a long time he lived in a trailer with his abusive grandmother, Gramma K. Recently, he has moved out of the trailer and into Ray's pool shed. His <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech_balloon.html" title="Speech balloon">speech balloons</a> use a slightly smaller font than that of other characters and rarely include <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punctuation.html" title="Punctuation">punctuation</a>, to emphasize his timidity and unique manner of speech. Roast Beef sometimes sports an impressive vocabulary and will, on occasion, sprinkle words such as "insatiable" or "phenomena" into his normally slang filled dialogue.</p>
<p>He has been shot at least four times. One shooting <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=09162002" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=09162002" rel="nofollow">lodged a bullet in his spine</a>, which grants him permanent <a href="../../../w/i/-/Wi-Fi_fa52.html" title="Wi-Fi">wireless Internet</a> access (though this has only been mentioned once <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=09232002" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=09232002" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> since, and he still uses physical computers to access the net). Another shooting resulted in his cardio-pulmonary system being replaced by that of an <a href="../../../a/i/b/AIBO_7761.html" title="AIBO">AIBO</a>. He has also been shot at least one additional time by Ray and <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06032004" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06032004" rel="nofollow">once fatally by Lie Bot</a> (who was masquerading as Ray's uncle Culpepper).</p>
<p>Roast Beef's birthday is <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=04222002" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=04222002" rel="nofollow">April 22nd</a>. Some of his accomplishments include a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_program.html" title="Computer program">program</a> that determines how many eggs and how much milk you need to buy in a given week, and another that determines the amount of loose change lying around your house and makes a reservation at a restaurant accordingly. He is perhaps the world's greatest historian of the Great Outdoor Fight, and drove Ray to compete (and win) in the 2006 Fight. He also managed to get into the fight himself by hacking the fight's <a href="../../../d/a/t/Database.html" title="Database">database</a>. He drives a 1965 <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Galaxie_1f19.html" title="Ford Galaxie">Ford Galaxie</a> (powered by Ford's rare <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_FE_engine_9d6b.html#427_SOHC" title="Ford FE engine">427 SOHC V8</a>) that was a gift from Ray. He has also gone to the moon, by stealing Pat's home-made rocket, and to the afterlife, via various methods including vomiting into an <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_AC_power_plugs_and_sockets_cbcc.html" title="Domestic AC power plugs and sockets">electrical outlet</a>. He has also produced his very own <a href="../../../z/i/n/Zine.html" title="Zine">zine</a>, titled <i>Man Why You Even Got To Do A Thing</i>.</p>
<p>Roast Beef has written a number of poems, both in the strip and on his blog. A recurrent theme involves concealed weapons disguised as foodstuffs, and these conclude with a (presumably screamed) 'OHHH SHIIIT!' Poems not utilising the theme of weapons in food do not correlate with the above explanation, indicating that Roast Beef has a distinct fear of the hidden weapons.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.brianmpalmer.com/onstad.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.brianmpalmer.com/onstad.htm" rel="nofollow">Onstad</a>, Roast Beef is one of several important <a href="../../../f/o/i/Foil_%28literature%29.html" title="Foil (literature)">foils</a> to the increasingly central character of Ray. Ray's consistent optimism, sexual bravado, unwavering confidence, privileged upbringing, simple attitudes, and good luck makes him seem on the surface a complete antithesis of character to Roast Beef. Regardless, the two have been close friends since childhood, and it may be observed that as the strip progresses, each occasionally adopts the attitudes and perspectives of the other. The two do, of course, have a few points of dissent: Roast Beef is somewhat more sympathetic to Little Nephew than his Uncle Ray, and has taken issue with Ray's alcoholism.</p>

<p>Philippe is a naïve young otter who resides in the house with Cornelius Bear, Lyle and Téodor, as well as Chris and Chris's family. His housemates collectively raise him with <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=10192005" class="external text" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=10192005" rel="nofollow">varied success</a>, with Téodor acting as a nurturing mother, Lyle as a neglectful big brother, and Mr Bear as a stern but gentle father. He is separated from his mother, who lives in an undisclosed location, but they talk on the phone frequently and have a close relationship. As is the case with Roast Beef, Philippe's father is deceased. From time to time Philippe's mother sends him <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=06102002" class="external text" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=06102002" rel="nofollow">unusual presents</a>.</p>
<p>Though he is five, Philippe has had an exciting life. He has <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=02042002" class="external text" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=02042002" rel="nofollow">made friends with a french fry</a>, <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=10152002" class="external text" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=10152002" rel="nofollow">been married to a flower</a>, had a frightening encounter with a serial killer (Nice Pete), been <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=07222002" class="external text" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=07222002" rel="nofollow">possessed</a> by the soul of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Idol_d44e.html" title="Billy Idol">Billy Idol</a>, <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=01292004" class="external text" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=01292004" rel="nofollow">run for president</a>, and <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=12042002" class="external text" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=12042002" rel="nofollow">accidentally killed a robot</a>.

<p>Philippe enjoys hugs and is very <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=05022002" class="external text" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=05022002" rel="nofollow">gullible</a>.

<p>Most often referred to as Mr. Bear, he is a scholarly and fatherly figure to much of the cast, being much older than most of them - he was married to his first (now deceased) wife, Iris Gambol, sometime before 1967. <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06092006" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06092006" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> He is unafraid to enjoy a good drink, and tends to be more erudite and romantic than the rest of the cast. It has also been implied that he has been imprisoned, and has had German, French and Austrian cellmates<a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06132006" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06132006" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.

He wears <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pince_nez.html" title="Pince nez">pince nez</a> and is most often attired in an elegant dressing gown.<a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=12042001" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=12042001" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Although originally from <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=09092003" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=09092003" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> he now lives at 62 Achewood Ct. Recently, he was shot by Pat, but survived. During his recovery, he spent his time writing eloquent closed captions for the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spice_Network_255c.html" title="Spice Network">Spice Network</a>. Mr. Bear has been seen driving an <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini.html" title="Mini">Austin Mini</a> with the driver's seat on the right-hand side, indicating it was originally sold in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Bear seems to command respect from nearly every member of the cast — with the noteworthy exception of the brash and petulant Lyle. This can be seen in almost every strip in which they both appear. <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=01042002" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=01042002" rel="nofollow">[14]</a><a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=06052003" class="external autonumber" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=06052003" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=09022003" class="external autonumber" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=09022003" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=11042003" class="external autonumber" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=11042003" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></p>
<p>Despite a reputation for class, Mr. Bear seems to have low standards when it comes to employment. At various times, he has been a writer of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance_novel.html" title="Romance novel">genre romance novels</a><a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=04262004" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=04262004" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, a closed captioner for the Spice Channel <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=12152004" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=12152004" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> and a paid lecturer for <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa_International_ed5b.html" title="Mensa International">Mensa International</a><a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06302006" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06302006" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. More recently Cornelius has become the proprietor of an English pub, a joint venture between himself and Ray. The naming of said pub has been the subject of much deliberation between the two characters although at the time of writing it was designated "The Dude and Catastrophe" <a href="http://corneliusbear.blogspot.com/2006/10/pub-name-backpedal.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://corneliusbear.blogspot.com/2006/10/pub-name-backpedal.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>.</p>

Though he is Belarusian, the name Orezscu seems to be Romanian in origin.

Mostly he hangs around the house watching porn with Lyle.

<p>Pat is one of the three original cat characters, along with Roast Beef and Ray. Over the years his role has receded into the background, but his is still a formidable presence. He is generally unpleasant — he typically plays the antagonist — and seems to hate anyone that does not live up to his impossibly high standards of behavior. He seems to suffer from <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obsessive-compulsive_personality_disorder.html" title="Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder">Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder</a> and has some <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anger_management.html" title="Anger management">anger management</a> problems, for which he attends a support group.</p>
<p>Pat's interests in <a href="../../../v/e/g/Veganism.html" title="Veganism">Veganism</a>, <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zen.html" title="Zen">Zen Buddhism</a> and his unusual stances on various social issues seem to be driven less by an appreciation of the philosophies, but more by a desire to feel superior to his friends, and indeed the rest of the world. He will often boycott companies at the slightest perceived provocation; for example, he claims to have stopped buying <a href="../../../k/l/e/Kleenex.html" title="Kleenex">Kleenex</a> brand tissues after he accidentally pulled three tissues out of a box instead of one, and stopped shopping at <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whole_Foods_Market_76f7.html" title="Whole Foods Market">Whole Foods</a> because of disgust with a female employee's visible armpit hair. His elitist, negative attitude extends to a particular focus on barbers and hairstylists, as well as toll booth operators, Mexican motorists <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=12022004" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=12022004" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, and employees with disabilities <a href="http://journeyintoreason.blogspot.com/2004/07/people-allow-worst-things-about.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://journeyintoreason.blogspot.com/2004/07/people-allow-worst-things-about.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>.</p>

He is on the run after escaping from jail (he was convicted for shooting Roast Beef, and later shot Mr Bear too, probably by accident <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=11222004" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=11222004" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>), but it doesn't seem to have affected his lifestyle due to Ray's connections getting him off the hook. He lives quite comfortably on the lam with "Nice Pete," a serial killer he met in jail. Interestingly, given recent speculation about Pat's sexuality, Nice Pete also attends his support group, implying that the two are quite close. He drives a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Mustang_816d.html" title="Ford Mustang">Ford Mustang II</a>, and his favorite movie is <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memento_%28film%29.html" title="Memento (film)">Memento</a>. After being electrocuted due to a prank by Lyle and Philippe, he temporarily became much nicer <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=09242003" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=09242003" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>.</p>
<p>Pat disowned his entertainer father, Simon Reynolds, when the latter declared he was a homosexual <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=08022006" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=08022006" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Simon has made efforts to reconcile with his son, which Pat has disgustedly repulsed <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=08122005" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=08122005" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. The entire topic of his father is off limits to Pat, suggesting repression issues. The comic has hinted at this complexity of his character for some time (e.g. <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=07082005" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=07082005" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>). Recently, his latent homosexuality was forced out into the open with the discovery of a magical Mexican camera <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=07312006" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=07312006" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> that depicts a person as how they feel about themselves, rather than an actual photo of the person. Both Pat and his father are homosexual due to the curse of Gladdington castle <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=08072006" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=08072006" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, wherein an ancestor of theirs was cursed such that all of his sons and their sons thereafter would become homosexual at the age of 26.</p>

<p><a href="http://mollysanders.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://mollysanders.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Molly's Blog</a></p>
<p>A cat, and Roast Beef's on-and-off girlfriend. Molly was born in seventeenth-century Wales. She died in the wreck of the <i>Gwynqeathe</i> and went to Heaven, where she was able to keep up on developments in the living world and become interested in modern technology. <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=01232007" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=01232007" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> Roast Beef first met her in Heaven after being shot by Pat. Molly now resides on Earth, living in the pool shed with Roast Beef. Roast Beef's lack of social skills often means their relationship is strained, but Molly's extraordinary patience and tolerance (and Beef's willingness to go along with her sexual adventurousness) often win out. Molly may have been a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programmer.html" title="Programmer">programmer</a> while in Heaven (presumably self-taught), but since she died long before computers and coding were invented she has no "earthly" qualifications as such. She has been currently working in the service industry since coming back to life; she has implied in her blog that she is unable to get better work because she does not have a social security card <a href="http://mollysanders.blogspot.com/2005/01/nowhere-to-go-but-wendys.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mollysanders.blogspot.com/2005/01/nowhere-to-go-but-wendys.html" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. This is perhaps due to the fact that she is legally dead. She has held jobs at various bars and restaurants, including <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applebee%27s.html" title="Applebee's">Applebee's</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/c/Taco_Bell_fcda.html" title="Taco Bell">Taco Bell</a> (from which she was fired), and The Smoke (a local bar in the underground). For a time, Molly worked at an "upscale tex-mex place" called Butte, until a fire forced its closure. Molly <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=01202005" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=01202005" rel="nofollow">was involved in</a> sandwich porn for Vlad when she worked at his Subway restaurant. Molly has now secured a job at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starbucks.html" title="Starbucks">Starbucks</a> which she claims makes her "the hub of Achewood's social universe." She has been running the "Achewood A-List" off and on since December 2005 (officially named on December 19, 2005 <a href="http://mollysanders.blogspot.com/2005/12/achewood-list-for-december-19-2005.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mollysanders.blogspot.com/2005/12/achewood-list-for-december-19-2005.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>).</p>

<dt>Chris Onstad (<a href="http://chrisonstad.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://chrisonstad.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Blog</a>)</dt>
<dd>Creator of the Achewood strips. Though not a comic strip character in the strictest sense, he has appeared in at least three comic strips (from the neck down) and seems to be able to communicate with the stuffed animals and cats that make up the Achewood cast. (Sometimes <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=09012005" class="external text" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=09012005" rel="nofollow">by telephone</a>, when serving as Roast Beef's publisher.) During the '05 holiday season, he <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=12212005" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=12212005" rel="nofollow">cajoled a naked and sleepless Teodor</a> into helping him pack Achewood merchandise for shipping.

<dt>Charley "Little Nephew" Smuckles (<a href="http://charleysmuckles.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://charleysmuckles.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Blog</a>)</dt>
<dd>Ray's nephew, often at odds with Ray. Little Nephew is very impressionable. At one time a <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">hip hop musician</a> <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=10142003" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=10142003" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> (creating the album <i>Fuck...

At one point, he began imitating his uncle Marion, and later became a <a href="../../../g/o/t/Goth_subculture.html" title="Goth subculture">goth</a> <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06292004" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06292004" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>. It is assumed that he is no longer part of the goth clique as his recent blog entries have returned to pre-gothic levels of crassness. Little Nephew has most recently been seen selling <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint_%28cannabis%29.html" title="Joint (cannabis)">joints</a> in competition with Lyle and Ray. He has expressed interest in pursuing a relationship with Molly, without success. Until recently, he worked at Starbucks with her. He is currently employed as a delivery boy by "Colonel Luigi's", a fusion pizza place notable for the half Italian, half Chinese heritage of the proprietor, Luigi Wong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Chucklebot</dt>
<dd>A robot who specializes in making people chuckle. During Téodor's party early in the comic, Chucklebot admitted to be gay. This has been the cause of mockery from Lie Bot in subsequent performances, though Chucklebot is a fair match for him.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Emeril LeGoinegasque and Robert L. "Spongebath" Dane (<a href="http://emerillg.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://emerillg.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Emeril's Blog</a>)</dt>
<dd>Two cats that Ray and Beef seem to be familiar with. Emeril is basically a cat that looks like <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emeril_Lagasse_4ad6.html" title="Emeril Lagasse">Emeril Lagasse</a>. In the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt_attribute.html" title="Alt attribute">alt-text</a> of a 2004 <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06032004" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06032004" rel="nofollow">strip</a>, it was suggested that Emeril is a <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melungeon.html" title="Melungeon">Melungeon</a>. His speech appears to follow the syntax of a bastardized <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_English_5313.html" title="Middle English">Middle English</a>. Spongebath is a rather large cat that doesn't seem to do or say much and gets around by means of what appears to be a scooter. They are fans of The Tenmen, a musical group made up of cats with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rickenbacker.html" title="Rickenbacker">Rickenbacker</a> musical equipment (even the drum). On recycling day, they like to go <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trashspotting.html" title="Trashspotting">trashspotting</a> with Roast Beef.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Leo Fontanette</dt>
<dd>A cat of Italian origin ("Fontanettini") who owned the Caddy dealership over in Pintado, and went to the same gym as Ray. When Leo and Beef met during Beef's first visit to the gym, Beef broke the code of the establishment and committed a major faux pas by complimenting Leo on his "rockin'" thighs. Shortly thereafter, Leo drove his car into a cornfield in a fit of rage (while cursing Ray and Beef), and died there from a heart attack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Leon Sumbitches</dt>
<dd>Dr. Leon Adoso Sumbitches (<a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA pronunciation</a>: <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[su:m 'bæ tʃæ]</span>), AKA Brian Wheat, is, according to a fictitious Wikipedia article appearing in the March 15, 2007 strip, the heir to the "legendary Adoso family oil fortune." He is also the composer of <a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Train" class="extiw" title="uncyclopedia:Gravity_Train">Gravity Train</a>, a song about the struggles he feels as an old man approaching his final days. Dr. Sumbitches contacted Ray on March 5, 2007, in an attempt to expatriate some portion of the family's fortune, a scheme highly resonant of many Nigerian email scams. When Sumbitches discovered the truth about Ray's tongue-in-cheeck responses concerning opening an African <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burrito.html" title="Burrito">burrito</a> chain, he told him personally about his disappointment and informed him that he had just lost the opportunity of inheriting part of the fortune.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Lie Bot</dt>
<dd>A robot that tells lies much of the time. He intersperses snippets of truth as well, so it can be hard to tell when he is actually lying — in fact, despite his name and knowledge of previous lies, the non-robot characters invariably believe him. His attitude moves from playfully cynical to displaying actual evil intent (While masquerading as Ray's Uncle Culpepper, he steals Ray's girlfriend and shoots Roast Beef). Phillipe is often the main victim of his lies. A running joke of the series features Phillipe asking Lie Bot what the saddest thing in the world is, only to be horrified by his answers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Michael "Showbiz" Kazenzakis</dt>
<dd>Roast Beef's deadbeat twin brother, he is identical to Roast Beef but with hair pulled back into a ponytail. He and Ray seem to have also been friends during childhood, spending much of their time making up cocktails. He is perpetually in deep debt to the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockford_Fosgate_6adc.html" title="Rockford Fosgate">Rockford Fosgate</a> Company, a car-audio manufacturer, despite his lack of a car. Showbiz tends to be unwilling or unable to hold down a steady job, generally working as a dishwasher or similar unskilled position although he occasionally panhandles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Milklin Honniker</dt>
<dd>A cat who has had an unfortunate time attempting to sell things door to door (car seat covers, bird roasters, Jehovah's Witnesses membership, and books for children in "nontraditional family situations"). Most recently he was trying to convince Roast Beef to become a Jehovah's Witness. Ray decided to give him business advice, which Milklin gladly followed. He took out an ad in "Reminiscence" Magazine<a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=10132005" class="external autonumber" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=10132005" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>.</dd>

His motherless upbringing in rural West Virginia was highly dysfunctional and Onstad's strips about Nice Pete are done in the style of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Faulkner_788f.html" title="William Faulkner">Faulkner</a>. He was once cellmates with Pat. In person he tends to be quite pleasant, though temperamental. He has written several pieces of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">fan fiction</a>, and is currently working on a <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> consisting of several short chapters which can be read in his blog, and <a href="http://www.achewood.com/shop/books_awt.php" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/shop/books_awt.php" rel="nofollow">is now for sale</a>. He is available for services involving self-mutilation, for a price. Apparently lives with Pat. Brain and butt cheeks were "hella stabbed" by a USB vegetable cutter. He drives a 1961 Ford Econoline with a manual transmission, which he has used to kill his dentist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Penny</dt>
<dd>A woman with whom Téodor had an online relationship. The two have never actually met, though Penny did give Téodor what appears to be a sweater with the letter 'T' on it. He wears the sweater in almost every strip in which he appears.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Philippe's Mother</dt>
<dd>A river otter, probably stuffed, who is Philippe's mother. She has a habit of sending Philippe various things mostly having to do with how Philippe is a "Special Boy." Is a widow and seeing someone new, much to Philippe's dismay, and was also hit on by Vlad at one point. A guest strip by Drew Weing depicting the "filming" of Achewood revealed her to be an abusive "Mommy Dearest" type stage mother; it was given high praise by Onstad but was never firmly established to be <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>. According to Philippe in The Achewood Cookbook, she lives somewhere in Iowa.</dd>

Son of legendary bluesman Antonyne Cheops "Rustmouth Chafings" Smuckles, who died at Ramses' wedding.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Simon Reynolds</dt>
<dd>Pat's father, a friendly bohemian children's entertainer. Years ago, Pat performed with him in an act known as "Dreamwheel and the Child", but once Simon came out as a homosexual Pat rejected him, forcibly moving him to Portland, Oregon. Simon traces his sexual orientation back to the story of the Gladdington Castle curse of 1328, where the King of England, with his dying breath, condemned the entire male lineage of the Reynolds family to become homosexual upon turning 26. He reappeared in Achewood to help his son adjust to the effects of the curse, with relative success, but Pat seems no more accepting of his father than before, instantly criticising him for being a poor representative of the homosexual community. Simon's lover is a man named Marcel.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Sondra Smuckles</dt>
<dd>Raymond's mother. Her speech is often peppered with gentle admonitions of her son, advice on manners, and <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=01182006" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=01182006" rel="nofollow">bizarre folk wisdom</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Syndicate, the</dt>
<dd>A group of animal entrepreneurs, including Ray Smuckles, Bensington Butters, and AKKOLADE, although there are possibly more. Each member of the group tries to outdo the others by performing more and more outrageous publicity stunts, although there is a fair share of underhanded tricks and pranks as well, in order to shake up opposition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>The Tenmen</dt>
<dd>A local three-piece band. Made up of black cats and playing exclusively Rickenbacker instruments, the Tenmen have played local bars, Ray's parties, and the Great Outdoor Fight. Roast Beef is a huge fan, although Ray, apparently, is not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Tina</dt>
<dd>A cat with whom Ray has an on-again, off-again relationship. For a time, Tina lived with Molly, who considered her to be "the very definition of <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowest_common_denominator.html" title="Lowest common denominator">lowest common denominator</a>." Tina's birthday is <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=03012002" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=03012002" rel="nofollow">March 2nd</a>, though she'd have <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=09262002" class="external text" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=09262002" rel="nofollow">another one at September 26th</a> as far as Ray's concerned.</dd>

<dt>Todd Todd Todd Todd Todd T. Squirrel</dt>
<dd>Todd is an illiterate, drug-dealing, often violent squirrel. His illiteracy has probably led him to be one of the few recurring characters to not have a blog. He is a heavy drug user (and dealer), and has a characteristic stuttering problem. He drives a miniature squirrel-sized <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van.html" title="Van">van</a><a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=11212001" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=11212001" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>, and is friends with Philippe. He put on some weight during a stint in prison<a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=01122005" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=01122005" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> but then lost the weight from having sex <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=07192006" class="external autonumber" title="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=07192006" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>. Todd purportedly came into being when a stork dropped a burrito into a volcano<a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=11292005" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=11292005" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>. 100 minutes later, Todd emerged, not knowing who he was. The stork, thinking that Todd had eaten the burrito, called Todd an "asshole" and a "jerkwad". Todd took this as an explanation of who he was, and consequently became a jerkwad. He then strangled the stork, whose lifeless body morphed into Todd's van. Todd died in November 2006 after forgetting to store food for the winter because he was busy watching <i>America's Funniest Home Videos</i> <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=11092006" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=11092006" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> but he later came back to life after serving a mandatory three month stint in heaven <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=02082007" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=02082007" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>.

It has been suggested that whatever they collect should probably not be placed in one's mouth. They are described as bearing fourth-degree burns from the fire and thus only leave their abandoned railway tunnel home on moonless nights to do their "collecting".</dd>
