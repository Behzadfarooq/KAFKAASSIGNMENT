<p>The relationship between <b>Achilles and Patroclus</b> is a key element of the myths associated with the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trojan_War_017a.html" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a>. Its exact nature has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the <i><a href="../../../i/l/i/Iliad.html" title="Iliad">Iliad</a></i>, it is clear that the two heroes (who are also <a href="../../../c/o/u/Cousin_chart.html" title="Cousin chart">first cousins once removed</a>) have a deep and extremely meaningful friendship, but the evidence of a romantic or sexual element is equivocal. Commentators from the classical period to today have tended to interpret the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. Thus, in <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_century_BC_f46f.html" title="5th century BC">5th century BC</a> <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a> the relationship was commonly interpreted as <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">pederastic</a>. Contemporary readers are more likely to interpret the two heroes either as non-sexual "war buddies" or as an egalitarian <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> couple.</p>
<p>The Ancient Mediterranean world had vastly different attitudes toward gender and sexuality than those found in <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st_century.html" title="21st century">21st century</a> <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> or <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Although <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece_c34a.html" title="Homosexuality in ancient Greece">sexual relations between men</a> are well attested, there was no term for, or concept of, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> as an exclusive or lifelong sexual orientation. In addition, much of what is known about ancient Greek sexual practices and beliefs is based on writers and artists who lived at least 200 years after the epics of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a> were created; it is unknown how much these practices and attitudes changed from the time Homer's epics were originally sung and the time that these later writers and artists recorded their work.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/h/Achilles_and_Patroclus_2407.html" title="Edit section: In Homer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In Homer</span></h2>
<p>In The <i>Iliad</i>, the death of Patroclus is the prime motivation of Achilles' wrath, the subject of the poem. Although Homer does not dwell on the relationship in great detail, it underpins a great deal of Achilles' actions. Achilles' strongest interpersonal bond is with Patroclus, whom he loves dearly. As <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Nagy_928e.html" title="Gregory Nagy">Gregory Nagy</a> points out,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Achilles ... in his own ascending scale of affection as dramatized by the entire composition of the <i>Iliad</i>, the highest place must belong to Patroklos.... In fact Patroklos is for Achilles the <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">πολὺ φίλτατος ... ἑταῖρος</span> — the <b>‘hetaîros</b> who is the most <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philia.html" title="Philia">phílos</a></b> by far’ (XVII 411, 655).<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<i>Hetaîros</i> means companion or comrade; in Homer it is usually used of soldiers under the same commander.)</p>
<p>Achilles is tender to Patroclus, callous and arrogant towards others. Although most warriors fought for personal fame or their <a href="../../../c/i/t/City-state.html" title="City-state">city-state</a> (including Achilles), at certain junctures in the <i>Iliad</i>, Achilles emphasizes his relationship with Patroclus above all else. He dreams that all Greeks would die so that he and Patroclus might gain the fame of conquering <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy.html" title="Troy">Troy</a> alone. After Patroclus dies, Achilles agonizes touching his dead body, smearing himself with ash, and fasting. He laments Patroclus' death using language very similar to that later used by <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andromache.html" title="Andromache">Andromache</a> of <a href="../../../h/e/c/Hector.html" title="Hector">Hector</a>. Achilles returns to the battlefield with the sole aim of revenging himself upon Hector, Patroclus' killer, even though the gods had warned him that it would cost him his life.</p>
<p>In the <i>Oxford Classical Dictionary</i>, David M. Halperin writes,</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Homer, to be sure, does not portray Achilles and Patroclus as lovers (although some Classical Athenians thought he implied as much (<a href="../../../a/e/s/Aeschylus.html" title="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> fragments 135, 136 Radt; <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symposium.html" title="Symposium">Symposium</a></i> 179e–180b; <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aeschines.html" title="Aeschines">Aeschines</a> <i>Against Timarchus</i> 133, 141–50) ), but he also did little to rule out such an interpretation.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>From the times of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_Greece_4866.html" title="Classical Greece">Classical Greece</a>, and especially in <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenism.html" title="Hellenism">Hellenism</a>, to the time of the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> the relationship of Achilles and Patroclus was most often seen as <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece_c8cb.html" title="Pederasty in ancient Greece">loving and pederastic</a>,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> despite the fact that it is not possible to designate the roles of Homer's Achilles and Patroclus along pederastic lines. (Achilles is the most dominant, and among the warriors in the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trojan_War_017a.html" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a> he has the most fame; Patroclus performs duties such as cooking, feeding and grooming the horses, and nursing yet is older than Achilles. Both also sleep with women.)</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_century_BC_f46f.html" title="5th century BC">5th century BC</a>, <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aeschylus.html" title="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> in his now-lost or destroyed tragedy <i><a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrmidons.html" title="Myrmidons">The Myrmidons</a></i> clearly regarded the relationship as a sexual one and assigned Achilles the role of <i><a href="../../../e/r/a/Erastes.html" title="Erastes">erastes</a></i> or protector (since he had avenged his lover's death even though the gods told him it would cost him his own life), and Patroclus the role of <i><a href="../../../e/r/o/Eromenos.html" title="Eromenos">eromenos</a></i>. He tells of Achilles visiting Patroclus' dead body and criticizing him for letting himself be killed. In a surviving fragment of the play, Achilles speaks of a <i>“devout union of the thighs”</i>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> wrote the <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symposium.html" title="Symposium">Symposium</a></i> about <a href="../../../3/8/5/385_BC_20c5.html" title="385 BC">385 BC</a>, and by then an established tradition viewed Achilles and Patroclus as lovers. In the <i>Symposium</i>, Phaedrus holds the two up as an example of divinely approved lovers. He also argues that Aeschylus erred in saying that Achilles was the <i>erastes</i>, "for he excelled in beauty not Patroclus alone but assuredly all the other heroes, being still beardless and, moreover, much the younger, by Homer's account." However, Plato's contemporary <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophon.html" title="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>, in his own <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symposium_%28Xenophon_dialogue%29_7299.html" title="Symposium (Xenophon dialogue)">Symposium</a></i>, had <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates.html" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> argue that Achilles and Patroclus were merely chaste and devoted comrades.</p>
<p>Evidence of this debate is found in a speech by an Athenian politician, <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aeschines.html" title="Aeschines">Aeschines</a>, at his trial in <a href="../../../3/4/5/345_BC_960f.html" title="345 BC">345 BC</a>. Aeschines in placing an emphasis on the importance of <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">pederasty</a> to the Greeks argues that though Homer does not state it explicitly, educated people should be able to read between the lines. <i>“Although (Homer) speaks in many places of Patroclus and Achilles, he hides their love and avoids giving a name to their friendship, thinking that the exceeding greatness of their affection is manifest to such of his hearers as are educated men.”</i> Most ancient writers followed the thinking laid out by Aeschines.</p>
<p>Since Homer does not use the terms <i>“erastes”</i> and <i>“eromenos”</i>, it has been argued that their relationship was not pederastic but rather <a href="../../../e/g/a/Egalitarian.html" title="Egalitarian">egalitarian</a>. In Homer's <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionia.html" title="Ionia">Ionian</a> culture it appears homosexuality had not taken on the form it later would in pederasty.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> However some scholars, such as <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Sergent_56fa.html" title="Bernard Sergent">Bernard Sergent</a>, have argued that it had, though it was not reflected in Homer. Sergent asserts that ritualized man-boy relations were widely diffused through Europe from <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prehistoric_times.html" title="Prehistoric times">prehistoric times</a>.</p>
<p>Attempts to edit the text were undertaken by <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristarchus_of_Samothrace_7e21.html" title="Aristarchus of Samothrace">Aristarchus of Samothrace</a> in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> around <a href="../../../2/0/0/200_BC_143d.html" title="200 BC">200 BC</a>. Aristarchus, who has been called <i>“the founder of scientific scholarship”</i>, believed that Homer did not intend the two to be lovers. However he did agree that the <i>“we-two alone”</i> passage did imply a love relation and argued it was a later interpolation. The majority of ancient and modern historians have accepted the lines to be an original part.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> and his intimate friend <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hephaestion.html" title="Hephaestion">Hephaestion</a> passed through the city of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy.html" title="Troy">Troy</a> on their Asian campaign, Alexander honoured the sacred tomb of Achilles and Patroclus in front of the entire army, and this was taken as a clear declaration of their own love. The joint tomb and Alexander's action demonstrates the perceived significance of the Achilles-Patroclus relationship at that time (around <a href="../../../3/3/4/334_BC_5b77.html" title="334 BC">334 BC</a>). See <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hephaestion.html" title="Hephaestion">Hephaestion</a> article for more detail and citations.</p>

<p>According to Greek mythology, Achilles and Patroclus are related on their respective paternal sides: <a href="../../../a/e/g/Aegina_%28mythology%29.html" title="Aegina (mythology)">Aegina</a> was Patroclus' paternal grandmother, and Achilles' great-grandmother.</p>
<p>Aegina, the daughter of the river god <a href="../../../a/s/o/Asopus.html" title="Asopus">Asopus</a>, was the mother of <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menoetius.html" title="Menoetius">Menoetius</a> by <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_%28mythology%29.html" title="Actor (mythology)">Actor</a> and the mother of <a href="../../../a/e/a/Aeacus.html" title="Aeacus">Aeacus</a> by <a href="../../../z/e/u/Zeus.html" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menoetius.html" title="Menoetius">Menoetius</a>, mortal King of <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus%2C_Greece_0d91.html" title="Opus, Greece">Opus</a>, was the son of Actor and Aegina, and the father of Patroclus. Aeacus, immortal King of the island <a href="../../../a/e/g/Aegina.html" title="Aegina">Aegina</a>, was the son of <a href="../../../z/e/u/Zeus.html" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> and Aegina, and the father of <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peleus.html" title="Peleus">Peleus</a>, Achilles' father.</p>
<p>Therefore, Patroclus was first cousin to Achilles' father Peleus, and Achilles' first cousin once removed. Arguably, this means that any romantic or sexual relationship between the two was <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html#Sexual_relations_between_cousins_and_other_distant_relatives" title="Incest">incestuous</a>. Incestuous relationships are common <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html#In_mythology" title="Incest">in mythology</a>.</p>

<p>Aside from the social importance of the pair's relationship, its exact nature has profound literary and artistic implications. As <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Dover_bd6f.html" title="Kenneth Dover">Kenneth Dover</a> points out in his <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Homosexuality_7873.html" title="Greek Homosexuality">Greek Homosexuality</a></i>, knowing whether Achilles was <i>erastes</i> and Patroclus <i>eromenos</i>, whether the opposite was true, or whether their love was egalitarian, is crucial to the thematic makeup of the Iliad. If indeed Achilles was the lover, then the lesson Achilles learns from Patroclus' sacrifice is rooted in a startling role-reversal: in death, the student becomes the teacher. The change in Achilles' character then hinges on having believed that only glory mattered, and learning otherwise by losing the only thing that mattered more to him than acclaim. Patroclus, the <i>eromenos</i>, in leading the Myrmidons, is elevated beyond the moral caliber of his mentor, and Achilles is redeemed only when, having reflected on his follies, he returns Hector's body to Priam.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, Patroclus was the lover, then his death represents a deliberate lesson to his pupil, Achilles. In this case, the teacher had to die in order to redeem the student, and the pivotal change in Achilles' character occurs when he resumes leadership of the Myrmidons and takes the field against Hector despite his grievance with Agamemnon.</p>
<p>Of course, if Achilles and Patroclus represent an egalitarian homosexual pairing, then the time and nature of Achilles' pivotal character development are shaded with gray and open to interpretation.</p>

<p>Many modern scholars tend to either hold up the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus as the first model of homosexual love in literature or assert that it was an entirely non-sexual relationship. Both positions usually reflect the speaker's position in contemporary <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_war.html" title="Culture war">culture wars</a>.</p>
<p>The novels of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Renault_72ca.html" title="Mary Renault">Mary Renault</a> contain frequent references to Achilles and Patroclus, usually presenting the pair as a model for homosexual love. (She also refers to Alexander's homage mentioned above.)</p>
<p>Elizabeth Cook's 2001 verse novel <i>Achilles</i> is not sexually explicit, but a romantic relationship can be inferred. She writes of Achilles, "He also knows the body of his cousin Patroclus." In the beginning of the novel, when Odysseus visits Achilles in the underworld, "He stands apart with Patroclus, his beloved through all eternity, and Patroclus — who loves Achilles, but not so much as he is loved — waits for Achilles to move." The relationship is intensely intimate, and certainly exceeds the common bounds of friendship.</p>
<p>The film <i><a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy_%28film%29.html" title="Troy (film)">Troy</a></i> glossed over the relationship and presented Patroclus as a younger relative of Achilles, without any romantic or sexual aspects.</p>
<p>The musical <i><a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_Awakening_%28Musical%29_31d3.html" title="Spring Awakening (Musical)">Spring Awakening</a></i> includes an offhand reference where one boy entreats another to 'play a little Achilles and Patroclus.' The two characters are later shown engaged in a homosexual relationship.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christa_Wolf_3c1e.html" title="Christa Wolf">Christa Wolf</a>'s novel <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassandra.html" title="Cassandra">Cassandra</a>, Achilles is stated as a homosexual man who would go after young man, whom he actually desires, and young woman, to show he was like everyone else. Patroclus is briefly mentioned as the sole man who could get Achilles to feel truly passionate about defeating Troy, and upon his death Achilles butchered several Troy captives - including two royal children - as a sacrifice.</p>
