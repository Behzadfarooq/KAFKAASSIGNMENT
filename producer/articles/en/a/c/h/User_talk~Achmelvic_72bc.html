<p>So if plenty of people have done it, how come its not listed in the pub crawl section (prior to me listing it then, and its not listed on the internet.There are plenty of other pub crawls on Wiki, don't be so boring.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Didn't mean to sound arsey but meant plenty of ppl have probably done pub crawls of wetherspoons in cities around the UK, if ya want to tell people about yours then that's grand but Wikipedia isn't the place to do it, it's an factual encyclopedia not a forum for people to talk stuff they've been up to. The other crawls on the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pub_crawl.html" title="Pub crawl">pub crawl</a> article are well recognised routes, whilst unfortunatly yours sounds more like something you and your mates have made up. If you want to tell ppl about your crawl then why not create a website about it with suggested route, photos etc and try to make it into a semi-offical crawl for others to do, then add a link from the pub crawl article, sure you'd get more people interested in it then as well. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 08:03, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, you just added some info about the Monaro car. It doesn't really belong on a disambiguation page - see the manual of style for further info about what these pages do and how they should be set out: <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_cc35.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)</a>.

<p>Hi. I am a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">bot</a>, and I am writing to you with a request. I would like to ask you, if possible, to use <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summaries.html" title="Edit summaries">edit summaries</a> a bit more often when you contribute. The reason an edit summary is important is because it allows your fellow contributors to understand what you changed; you can think of it as the "Subject:" line in an email. For your information, your current edit summary usage is 5% for major edits and 11% for minor edits. (Based on the last 150 major and 150 minor edits in the article namespace.)</p>
<p>This is just a suggestion, and I hope that I did not appear impolite. You do not need to reply to this message, but if you would like to give me feedback, you can do so at the <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathbot_Feedback_on_the_summary_bot_b1e3.html" title="User talk:Mathbot/Feedback on the summary bot">feedback page</a>.

<p>Sorry, I got the idea from the articles relating to <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield.html" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> and surrounding area (see, for example <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dore_and_Totley_df50.html" title="Dore and Totley">Dore and Totley</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stocksbridge_and_Upper_Don_cbd3.html" title="Stocksbridge and Upper Don">Stocksbridge and Upper Don</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fulwood.html" title="Fulwood">Fulwood</a> etc), which was recently a feature article, and I thought it was a good idea. 'It' being to have a template relating to county durham areas on all pages for ease of navigation, with articles on electoral districts (which are strictly defined) containing info on the respective communities within them. These communities are mentioned promently in the first sentence so that people being redirected there know that they are in the correct place. Areas deserving seperate article could still have them, with a link to that main article in the district article (and vice versa).</p>

<p>Hi! I noticed you renamed the Theakston (brewer) page to Theakston (brewery). That is fine. But you did a redirect instead of a rename. This leaves the history behind. You then made matters even worse by claiming you created the article. I have made such errors myself, and loads of other people have as well, so don't worry about it. But in future it would be better to use the move feature - or at least to say that that the article was redirected from elsewhere.

<p>There is no such thing as the UK railway network.</p>
<p>There are two major systems in Great Britain (including IOW) and Northern Ireland. The systems are different; they is regulated differently, operated differently, run on different gauge track, and so have different rolling stock, and are not connected (trains can't swim). In short, specifying "UK" rail network is rather naive. — <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 10:23, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you're talking about the Wikiproject I've just created one of the whole points of it is to try and allow a single place for these kind of topics to be discussed, just because it is a project on the whole of the UK doesn't mean that the articles will be structed that way. I'm hoping that it will produce a better forum for us all to discuss such issues and not have the current unhelpful situation of this same issue being talked about on the talk pages of different articles with no real connection or consistancy. Whilst i agree that there are two systems or networks the wikiproject is not trying to claim that there is only one at all, it's to co-ordinate articles better for the whole of the United Kingdom. Plus all other Wikiproject are the UK as a whole, not simply part of it --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 10:26, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed you had changed some of the info boxes for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chew_Stoke_2871.html" title="Chew Stoke">Chew Stoke</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chew_Magna_a800.html" title="Chew Magna">Chew Magna</a> etc for the "correct" ones - I didn't know there was a correct one to use! Do you have a quick &amp; easy mechanism for doing this? If so could you do all the other ones linked from the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chew_Valley_9fd0.html" title="Chew Valley">Chew Valley</a> page or in the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChew_Valley_aeb5.html" title="Template:Chew Valley">template</a> <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodw_1052.html" title="User:Rodw">Rod</a> 19:00, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for pointing that out! I use Firefox and it looked fine in that but not right in IE which is a first for Wiki that I've seen, when I checked the other towns that I added infoboxes to this morning and <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowestoft.html" title="Lowestoft">Lowestoft</a> was doing the same thing. Having played about this them it looks to be due to there being an image inserted on the next line of the code aligned to the right, by moving this to the left of the page it appears to work ok in IE. Again thanks for spotting it, I'll have to check page in IE as well as firefox when I edit them in the future. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 12:24, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, whilst they have made a bit of bad job of it, such as the website URL and logo not stating it consistantly all the time and most announcements still being the old ones from Arriva days, the name of the company is First TransPennine Express, albeit plenty of places still list it as TPE. All TOC names are simply brands made up by their owners, the official franchisee name that the DfT signs with is most of the time not the one that the services are operated under, eg Virgin Trains or GNER are simply brandnames but are the ones that the customer/passenger sees. I've simply removed the last few links to TransPennine Express to bring them into line with all the other ones around Wiki, probably almost a hundred-odd amongst the articles on the stations they serve etc, to give more consistantcy. And it tells the owners of the franchise in the First TPE article which seems a more appropriate place for such details. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 13:06, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's true, and i understand your edits. This is why I didnt revert them but add the link name. Annoucements have <b>just</b> been changed at Sheffield Station and ommit the First part of it. You are right to replace the links and include the <i>First</i> part, but let's try and remain partial and informative. You remove the Cross Country Trains link name from the Sheffield Station article, i was trying to make a point, but it does look ridiculous. I don't see why First should be included in the link names, it confuses people more than inform them, telling them First is the operator, when it isn't. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_scarlet_6377.html" title="User:Captain scarlet">Captain scarlet</a> 13:16, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Achmelvic. A couple of years back I had come to the realisation that the categorisation of UK railways was in a terrible state - mainly because it had got so complicated. I began to try to see where it was at, and started to put together a sorted-out conclusion. I didn't get too far, although it was still complicated; but neither did I know to whom I should address my conclusions. Now that you have begun this project, I am able to show just how complicated it is, by showing what categories there are. Even so I am aware that there are many more: hence the fact that I have just added about ten new ones! And I am convinced that there are yet more. Some are almost on the whim of a particular author.</p>

<p>Removal from Merseyrail articles - fair enough; main purpose in removing them was just to try and decrease the clutter (anticipating that the Merseyside stations template may also be disappearing soon).

<p>Hi Alchmevic. I see that you have a had a house moving, so am not suprised that you haven't had a chance to answer my note above. As you can see from the large list of categories I have unearthed this does seem to need some sorting out ... and that will be a mammoth task. Is that not what should be done first though, before the minutiae of individual topics within the UK railways articles? Otherwise I see the danger that more categories will appear, making it even more of a mess! <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Shearan_04a2.html" title="User:Peter Shearan">Peter Shearan</a> 06:31, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you look at the intro for the article as it existed before I alterered it, it casually mentions the Pennines in the last bullet point, without giving any explanation as to what these are or a link&#160;: which is just bad style. Now, it does. Also the revised sentence "including services linking northwest and northeast England across the Pennines" is true&#160;: I assume you'd allow Manchester to Newcastle/Middlesbrough to fall under that definition. In some contexts all Yorkshire is considered to be northeast, though - and the text wasn't saying <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_West_England_8c09.html" title="North West England">North West England</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_East_England_39af.html" title="North East England">North East England</a> but northwest England and northeast England. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 08:04, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Achmelvic, I recently split the article about the town of Reading, into articles about the town and the Unitary Authority that bears the same name. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_UK_subdivisions_1394.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject UK subdivisions">Objections have been raised to this</a>, and also to similar changes you have made to Middlesborough and Ipswich. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Pascoe_ece4.html" title="User:Alan Pascoe">Alan Pascoe</a> 21:50, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am unsatisfied with the wording on <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough.html" title="Middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a>. The split of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough_%28borough%29.html" title="Middlesbrough (borough)">Middlesbrough (borough)</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough.html" title="Middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a> is justified on the basis that the former is supposedly smaller than the latter, yet the wording on the latter now says "is the principal location in the borough of Middlesbrough". This is self-contradictory. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 15:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To me that doesn't read as self-contradictory, the addition of 'principal' is the key. It is saying that it is the main location or settlement in the borough but NOT all of the borough is part of Middlesbrough (the town). If it read as claiming that Middlesbrough (the town) is the same as the Borough of Middlesbrough then it would be wrong. <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darlington_%28borough%29.html" title="Darlington (borough)">Darlington (borough)</a> is similar, Darlington (the town) is very much the principal location/settlement in the borough (and hence giving it the name) and making up probably more 90% of the population but there are other places within the UA's borders, like Middlesbrough (the borough), but the towns and boroughs are not the same thing. IMHO all of England should have town articles seperate from Local Gov articles about borough/districts which may share the same name, exactly because they tend to deal with different information. Albeit I'd be the first to admit that this can have problems such as defining where towns/cities start or end in seperation to, often historical, borough boundaries: i.e. does it come down to local perseption/identity outside what the local gov boundaries state? We're stuck dealing with official definitions and then what is considered on the ground/in real life, which is a perenial philosophical problem for both WP and the academic world. Either way it's a hornets nest but just because a borough shares the same name as a town which may make up the majority of its population doesn't nesessarily make them the same thing. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 17:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think you are understanding my point here, or perhaps I am misunderstanding you. The justification for splitting <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough_%28borough%29.html" title="Middlesbrough (borough)">Middlesbrough (borough)</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough.html" title="Middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a>, as I understand it, is that places like South Bank and Eston are in <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough.html" title="Middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a> the town, but not <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough_%28borough%29.html" title="Middlesbrough (borough)">Middlesbrough (borough)</a>. Ie that the town is <i>larger</i> than the borough. Now, you are saying that the justification is that the town is <i>smaller</i> than the borough. Which is it? It can't be both at once, can it?</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've absolutely no problem at all with splits based on towns being <i>smaller</i> than the borough - if you look at my <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_English_districts_to_disambiguate_425a.html" title="Wikipedia:List of English districts to disambiguate">Wikipedia:List of English districts to disambiguate</a> that I made back in the day, I did most of those splits, and I placed <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough_%28borough%29.html" title="Middlesbrough (borough)">Middlesbrough (borough)</a> in a "to consider" category, as I did Darlington and Hartlepool&#160;: these I thought were borderline cases, like <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preston.html" title="Preston">Preston</a> which we have still yet to split (but would be particularly troublesome as the ONS definition here is truly weird)</dd>

<dd>My problem with Middlesbrough articles is mainly that someone has been putting an unsourced prescriptivist viewpoint that Middlesbrough = a larger urban area, on articles about Middlesbrough and inserting nonsense and in some cases outright fabrications to this. Perhaps you had been unaware of this? <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 18:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know there is the issue of Middlesbrough (the town) being considered to extend further east outside the border of the borough and that the actual border with Redcar &amp; Cleveland cuts off places like Eston &amp; South Bank from being in Middlesbrough (the borough). My concern is that even given this the borough itself does include places to the south that aren't in Middlesbrough (the town). Therefore the borders of the borough do include places other than Middlesbrough but at the same time not all of Middlesbrough itself is included within the borough! Bit of a mess with the boundaries around there really: for example once (or if) the huge planned developments promoted by the <a href="http://www.stocktonmiddlesbroughinitiative.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.stocktonmiddlesbroughinitiative.com/" rel="nofollow">Stockton-Middlesbrough Initiative</a> long the Tees go ahead the actual built-up area will merge with Stockton with only the A19 forming any kind of division. And the whole business isn't helped by the fact the even local people and businesses aren't often sure where they are offfically part of, partly due to the various changes there have been, <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teesside_Park_9476.html" title="Teesside Park">Teesside Park</a> is a good example. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 20:09, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But are there really definitions of Middlesbrough that include South Bank &amp; Eston; but would exclude Nunthorpe? The sort of "Greater Middlesbrough Empire" edits we are getting seems to maximise the size of Middlesbrough and would be unlikely to cede ground. But anyway, yes. The current boundary basically (the railway line, then Normanby Road, then Spencer Beck) would have been based on the wards of Teesside which ended up in the various bits&#160;: I don't know to what extent they have been realigned after 1974 - i suspect not much. I do wonder about those ward boundaries were set, though (after all, Teesside was only 6 years old at that point), and how they related to the pre-1968 situation. It would be great if we could find a source so we could describe exactly the differences between the county borough of Middlesbrough that and the non-metropolitan district. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 21:39, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there, I'm currently considering making a wikiproject called <b>Wikipedia:WikiProject Tyne and Wear</b> and I'm just wondering if you would be interested in joining if and when It's created as I noticed from a user category you live in County Durham.

If you have any questions, comments please tell me on my talk page and if you know any other users who maybe interested in joining please feel free to tell them as it will need a few members in order to make it run smoothly. I will also be willing to create the project page and templates etc if there are enough active members.

<p>Hi - thanks for your work on the <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoking_ban.html" title="Smoking ban">smoking ban</a> page. I quite agree that having details of bans by country in that page is unnecessary given that there's a separate page listing the bans - but if you're going to remove the whole section, you really need to (a) leave a summary in place and (b) integrate the deleted information into the other article. If you don't, a great deal of other people's work gets lost in the edit histories. I'm going to do it now, but do think about it next time!

<p>I am reverting your edits that removed RAF Menwith Hill from the USAF in the United Kingdom template... my justifications are as follows...</p>
<ol>
<li>RAF Menwith Hill is currently run by the 424 Air Base Squadron (ABS) which is part of the 501 Combat Support Wing (CSW). This organization is aligned under United States Air Forces in Europe.</li>
<li>Similar to other RAF bases run by the USAF (to include Mildenhall and Lakenheath)... it is on long term lease from the MoD to conduct operations in the UK.</li>
<li>The MoD operations going on at Menwith Hill may be in concert with the USAF, but Menwith Hill is most definitely part of the USAF in the United Kingdom.</li>
<li>The fourth and most compelling case would be in the following link directly from the RAF website... <a href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/downloads/documents/raftoday2004.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.raf.mod.uk/downloads/documents/raftoday2004.pdf" rel="nofollow">Royal Air Force TODAY</a>. If you scroll down to current bases, the directly administered ones controlled by the USAF have a #3 superscript and Menwith Hill clearly has one.</li>
