<p>This is an excellent scientific treatment. Thanks,</p>
<p>Now, can anyone describe what industry and goverment are doing to ameliorate the problem? I'd like to see at least a reference to <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emissions_trading.html" title="Emissions trading">emissions trading</a> or fines or scrubbing or reductions of output or whatever.</p>

<p>I believe that this idea is a world wide epidemic and it needs to be stoped at all costs.this needs to be related to polution and global warming. (cole)</p>
<pre>
  I am tempted to put a tag disputing either the accuracy or the POV of the article, but I won't as of yet because that might prove to be quite controversial.
</pre>
<p><br />
Furhermore, I miss the placing of the widespread attention to this perceived phenomenon withing the context of the envrionmental-conscious 80s.</p>
<p>Also, there should be some descriptions of Nictrification, and attention paid to the publications in Nature of january 27th 1994 regarding the role of calcium potassium Sodium and magnesium in counterbalancing the SO2 en NOx emitions.</p>
<p>There is a lot more to be said on this topic, quite a lot of the suppositions about Acid rain were alledgedly based on junkscience but sadly I miss the neccesary background to contribute in a sensible way to the article. --<a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomedae_bf2b.html" title="User:Lomedae">Lomedae</a> 18:54, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that this article should be tagged for accuracy or POV.</p>
<p>"Since public interest groups can retire the licenses by purchasing them, the net result is a continuously decreasing and more diffused set of pollution sources. At the same time, no particular operator is ever forced to spend money without a return of value from commercial sale of assets"</p>
<p>Which emission trading agreements allows public interest groups to buy licences? Some examples would be good. The statement on the effectiveness of emission trading systems is an opinion, rather than fact and should be removed. For a full explanation of its merits, or otherwise, the page points to emission trading.</p>
<p>POV should definitely be removed. The favourable references to emission trading should be removed, but I'll first give the emission trading entry a makeover. Can someone provide a reference to the bold assertion of the environmental advantage of nuclear power? If not, I'll remove the reference. I suspect it is a half-truth at best. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 10:43, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides ... diffuse into the atmosphere and react with water to form sulfuric and nitric acids</i></dd>

<p>Sulphur dioxide is oxidation state 4. Sulphuric acid is oxidation state 6. It can't be a case of just reacting with water, there must be further oxidation. Likewise, which nitrogen oxides? I think largely NO and NO<sub>2</sub> (oxidation states 2 and 4). Nitric acid is oxidation state 5.</p>

<dd>According to my book, nitrogen oxide forms acid rain by the following reaction.</dd>
<dd>nitrogen oxide + water → nitric acid + nitrous acid</dd>
<dd>Is it correct?</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I want to know how sulfur trioxide forms in air? According to my teacher, sulfur trioxide cannot be formed without catalyst even there is excess oxygen.</dd>
<dd>My teacher also told me that dissolving sulfur trioxide into water is very exothermic (and that's why it is not done in the Contact Process). If sulfur trioxide in air dissolves to form acid rain, will the rain water be heated and vaporized?Momoko</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The current explanation is misleading. A large fraction of oxidation of SO2 occurs in raindrops and involves reactions in the liquid phase with hydrogen peroxide, ozone and manganese. Most emissions are in the form of SO2 or H2S. Oxidation in the gas phase occurs via reaction with the <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydroxyl.html" title="Hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> radical. I will improve this when I get time (unless someone else gets there first. There are several steps to the reactions so I need to get my atmospheric chemistry book out to check they are right. In the meantime I'll remove the misleading information.</dd>
<dd>On nitric oxide the main reaction is in the gas phase NO2 + OH -&gt; HNO3. Another reaction is the nightime process of N2O5 reacting with water on the surface of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Particulate.html" title="Particulate">particulate</a> to give nitric acid.--<a href="../../../n/h/s/User%7ENHSavage_61bf.html" title="User:NHSavage">NHSavage</a> 08:56, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This section had recently been changed incrrectly with the reation of sulfur trioxide with water changed to sulfur dioxide. This meant it resembled the old incrorrect version. there was a lot of vandalism on the article and I missed this important change which happened 31st Oct. sorry about that.

<p>Once again, I ask: what is the <b>evidence</b> that human-caused emissions of pollutants (like <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulfur_dioxide.html" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a>) has significantly increased the acidity of rain anywhere? Or that reducing emissions has decreased the acidity of rain?</p>
<p>I'm not questioning the <b>theory</b> - the chemical process seems rather straightforward. But I'm looking for something nontechnical which our readers can dig into. Something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>1920 - rain acidity in the U.S. Northeast was measured at pH of 6.4 by scientists with the Blah Blah Blah agency.</li>
<li>1980 - after 60 years of sulfur dioxide emissions from power plansts in Ohio and neighboring states, rain acidity increased to a pH of 6.1 [Blah agency report, 1983].</li>

<li>Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions return to earth (in a process called deposition) in various chemical compounds.</li>

<dd>It represent any third body. In Earth's atmosphere this is almost always N2 or O2. If you consider the reaction with just two bodies reacting together to give a single product e.g. OH + NO2 = HNO3 then it is impossible to conserve both momentum and energy simultaneously just by looking at the velocity of the product. The extra energy becomes internal energy in the product and this will tear the new molecule apart unless it colides quickly with some other molecule 'M' to remove this energy. This M is the conventional representation of this process in chemical kinetics. This also has a big effect on the speed of the reaction, giving it a pressure dependence as well as a temperature dependence. I will try and a short note to this effect in the article soon (and I will have to think about writing an article for wikipedia on this as I can't find anything to link to).--<a href="../../../n/h/s/User%7ENHSavage_61bf.html" title="User:NHSavage">NHSavage</a> 08:23, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have just reverted back to the version of the 29/3. Apart from a lot of vandalism two other changes have been made.</p>
<p>1) In the early 1800's, a famous inventor by the name of Janakan set forth to discover the chemical basis behind acid rain (UofT Acid Rain Catalogue, 1997). (by User:Thakkarbhavik).</p>
<p>I am prety sure this is spurious. I apologise if this is true but I have never heard of Janakan and a google search on his name and acid rain finds nothing relevant. If it is correct please explain what the (UofT Acid Rain Catalogue, 1997) is and how I can get a copy. --<a href="../../../n/h/s/User%7ENHSavage_61bf.html" title="User:NHSavage">NHSavage</a> 13:34, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>2) What can I do to help? (by lots of different anonymous users). This is general advice on "beign green", parts of it are not at all relevant to acid rain - e.g. go CFC free (especially as CFCs are now banned everywhere). As regards acid rain I suppose some of the changes in driving style are relevant as nitric acid is still a major problem. However it is really out of place.</p>
<p>3) History and trends section went AWOL after all the vandalism.</p>

<dd>I am a bit worried by this edit but I don't have time now to do a proper change to the article. In particular I am worried by the selective use of one sentance from the Environmental Literacy Council webpage (<i>"the effects of acidic precipitation were not as great as once feared"</i>) which is taken out of context (elsewhere it mentions that 10% of eastern lakes and streams had been affected by acid deposition). This is a short summary of a 98 page report (which I have not read but will try and skim). It is also not really evidence to my mind that this organisation believes that acid depostion is not a serious issue. If the early fears were that every lake in the US would die then clearly the effects were not as bad as that. If there was serious damage to 10% of Eastern lakes then this seeems a big problem. I do not plan to make any edits immediately but I feel it is important that we do not give the impression of there being widespread skepticism about acid rain which I feel would be misleading.</dd>

<dd>I do actually disagree. <i>"Acid deposition also includes direct deposition, in which acidic fog or cloud is in direct contact with the ground; and dry deposition, in which ions become attached to dust particles and fall to the ground"</i>. <a href="http://www.epa.gov/region1/eco/acidrain/intro.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.epa.gov/region1/eco/acidrain/intro.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. It is illogical to include dry deposition of acids in an article on acid precipitation. Dry deposition occurs in the abscence of precipitation (hence the name). Acid rain is the commonly used term so there is a case for this article to be called this (the original title). Otherwise it has to be Acid deposition.--<a href="../../../n/h/s/User%7ENHSavage_61bf.html" title="User:NHSavage">NHSavage</a> 19:09, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Uncle Ed wrote when flagging this as NPOV: <i>"should fairly describe whether acid rain has ever caused any harm and/or whether this harm is important enough to pass laws to reduce emissions and thereby reduce this harm"</i></p>
<p>Can we agree to narrow this down a bit? As I see it, the main issue which you see as not being neutral is the question of the cost/benefit analysis of emission reductions? Can we just label the section on "Prevention methods" as NPOV not the whole article? Your main concern with the "Adverse effects" section seems to be the lack of references - this is well flgagged up by the citation needed templates but it might be worth slapping a {{Unreferenced}} tag on it. I can start to work on providing references for this section in that case. The discussion of trends and their relation to emissions reductions is very poorly dealt with - I think there need to be seperate sections for the history of the research and the measured trends.</p>
<p>The "Prevention" section seems the ideal place to note any oppposition to emissions controls and probably the most controversy prone also. One of Singer's articles you cited actaully argues that it was right to make the initial effort to reduce emissions of acid precursors it is jus that the final 1% is too expensive to clean up. I am not an expert in this area but I would be suprised if there is not more controversy about this out there on this sort of level. Environemtal science only has to deal with a very complex system, political science has to cope with confliciting priorities and ideologies as well....</p>

<p>I don't claim to be an expert in the field, but this passage in the introduction paragraph seems to include a couple of errors. First off, we have:</p>
<p>Acid rain is defined as any type of precipitation with a pH that is unusually low.</p>
<p>As a lower pH indicates a stronger acid this seems to make sense. A couple lines later we have:</p>
<p>Therefore a pH of &gt;5.6 has sometimes been used as a definition of acid rain.</p>
<p>This seems to read a pH GREATER than 5.6 has been used to define acid rain. This seems irrational as a pH greater than 5.6 is approaching a neutral pH. A couple lines later we find the same issue again:</p>
<p>However, natural sources of acidity mean that in remote areas, rain has a pH which is between 4.5 and 5.6 with an average value of 5.0 and so rain with a pH &gt;5 is a more appropriate definition.</p>
<p>Going to alter this to read a pH of &lt;5.6 and pH &lt;5. If this is incorrect, go ahead and revert back.</p>
