<p>Hard rock band <b>Acid Binge</b> was formed during the winter of 1990 in a suburb of Providence known as Johnston, RI. Original lineup included vocalist Stanley Luchka, guitarist Jason Greenhalgh, bassist Patrick Gilbert and drummer Neil Anderson. Although the band is probably best known for their acohol and drug induced rampages, during which, anything could happen, the women, the drugs and the nightlife are all reflected in their music.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Early Days</span></h2>
<p><b>(1990 - 1993)</b></p>
<p>The idea of "rough" hard rock band <b>Acid Binge</b> initially came from guitarist Jason Greenhalgh. In a time when highly technical, drug-free, corporate music was growing in popularity in the "holier than thou" circles, Jason envisioned a band which held all of the classic rock n' roll ideals above everything else, "Sex, Drugs and Rock n' Roll", but more importantly, that <i>everyone</i> involved to enjoy themselves (not just the audience).</p>
<p>Jason called close friend and vocalist Stan Luchka to help assemble the band. This was no easy task as the entire band must have the same outlook on the whole idea as they did. Immediately, bassist Patrick Gilbert and drummer Neil Anderson came to mind, having performed on various projects together, talented and visionary musicians, both had a reputation of putting on some of the most raucus performances to hit the Providence area at that time. Together, the four of them created one of the most easily recognizable sounds to come out of New England at that time. The band was assembled and almost at once, the band had a following. Rumors of the band's music and demeanor spread disturbingly fast. Although many hadn't yet heard the band's music, everyone knew who they were and spoke as if they did. The idea became reality. The band was was quickly making a name for itself with heavily charged riffs and vocals, not to mention a talent to offend many who listened with rude lyrics, sexually offensive gestures and motions during performances and an abrasive demeanor presented all too well by each member. However, in 1993, before <b>Acid Binge</b> was able to expand beyond the local club scene, the band separated. Conflicting interests and persuit of different side projects caused the early demise of the band. <b>Acid Binge</b> was disbanded.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Latter days</span></h2>
<p><b>(1997 - 2007)</b></p>
<p>In late November, 1997, Jason received a call from an old friend and fellow guitarist Dave Snyder asking if he would fill in for the guitarist of their band <b>Backwoods</b> as they had a coming show in December and the other guitarist had left the band to persue a career in floral arrangement. At that time, the band included two members of <b>Acid Binge</b>, Stanley Luchka and Patrick Gilbert. The show took place on December 5, 1997 at The Living Room, Providence, RI, to a full house, with 3 original members of <b>Acid Binge</b>. The band was so well received that the set extended fifteen minutes into the headliner's set, at the demand of the audience. After the show, the band was asked to play several more shows over the course of the next three months, three with top billing. Unfortunately, that night would be the last show that Patrick would play with <b>Backwoods</b>. Patrick left <b>Backwoods</b> to persue other ventures, leaving a vacancy for a bassist. At that time, another show was scheduled for January 1, 1998 at a club called The Oasis in Attleboro, MA. Members of <b>Backwoods</b> decided not to go on using the name without Patrick playing the bass, so the name <b>Voodoo Groove</b> was adopted for the Oasis show with Berto Sanchez playing bass. The show quickly turned into disaster when Berto, at the urging of the audience, dropped his pants during his signature "behind the head" bass solo. The police, already in the club as a result of noise complaints from neighboring houses, quickly put an end to the show and escorted Berto to the Attleboro police station where he spent the night. That would be the only show that Sanchez would play with the former members of <b>Acid Binge</b> and <b>Backwoods</b> as in keeping with the original vision of extreme excess, Sanchez was killed in an auto wreck on US 95 two weeks after the show at The Oasis. There were two prostitutes in the car with him at the time of the accident, and his blood alcohol level was reportedly at .16. Because of this tragedy, the remaining members decided to disband. Over the next eight years, each continued to work on other musical projects, occasionally together.</p>
<p>It wasn't until December of 2005 that Patrick called Jason to ask if he would like to put <b>Acid Binge</b> back together again, this time with Dave Snyder playing guitar also. Immediately the band began writing new music with Stanley occasionally on vocals, Jason and Dave on guitars, Patrick on bass and this time, Scott Cerra on drums with Neil Anderson occasionally sitting in, in Scott's place due to other side projects.</p>
<p>The band is currently focusing all of their attention to completing their album "<b>Back On The Binge</b>" and is planning to tour again in mid 2007 to much excitement.</p>
