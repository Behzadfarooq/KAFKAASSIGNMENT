<p><i><a href="../../../a/c/i/User%7EAcidsaturation_d8a6.html" title="User:Acidsaturation">Acidsaturation</a> said</i>: Hi there, I'm getting in touch as you've done recent work on the self-harm article. I've done a fair bit of study on this subject recently, so reckon I'm in a position to go through and get a good load of citations in there. What I propose, is moving to using the ref tag to make this easier, and then I'll go through and get citations in, and replace some of the "some people" type areas with referenced viewpoints, trying to get multiple view is where there are opposing views. Obviously this'll involve a bit of rewriting and adding so I wondered if you have any feedback on this before I start.</p>
</div>
<p>For a while now I've believed it's important to get some referenced opinions in the self-harm article, and making it easy to read without making it difficult to merely see the photoshopped image.</p>
<p>The ref tagging is definitely the next thing to get done, with the &lt;/references&gt; tag at the bottom of the article rather than numbered links. As you can tell, for several people this article has become a sore point, and to have it sorted would be a good job. Thank you for deciding to take it on, and I'll see what I can do to help. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobo192_c260.html" title="User:Bobo192">Bobo</a><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobo192_2f09.html" title="User talk:Bobo192">.</a> 17:12, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yep i agree, i've been doing minor changing but i think a whole redo whould be good. Thanks&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinB_9ced.html" title="User:DinB">DinB</a> 17:41, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Introducing more references will be a good thing. There's a lot of information that seems, in my opinion, to be true, but is only based on personal experiences and anecdotal evidence, so it would be good to base it on some actual research. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 09:58, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cool. I'm picking up a book today that cites many of the major studies, as well as being one of the major UK meta-analyses, so I'll get started over the next week. Anyone who want's to help a good thing would be to proof read after, as I may shuffle stuff a bit (if e.g. there's bits in the same section that could be referenced from one source) so anyone wanting to check any cut and paste bits I do would be good. <a href="../../../a/c/i/User%7EAcidsaturation_d8a6.html" title="User:Acidsaturation">Acidsaturation</a> 15:52, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's some very good work. Plus you've been able to retain a lot of the work which was previously available, which is nice. I've performed a minor copy-edit, nothing at all fancy, just a little touch-up, and it's now looking like a solid article. Thank you for your work in this are.

<p>Copy as requested:</p>
<p>I'm in a bit of a quandry about this article. It's proposes for deletion, which I oppose on the grounds that it's only similar to a list of musicians. However, I'm also wary of putting so many links to sites about people who are basically breaking the law as I think this kind of creates a nice directory for those who'd try and stop us doing what we do to find out more.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to say try and provide a bit of info on the systems but not publish their links here? Wholesale advertising of soundsystem links and too many details on such a public arena seems to me to be inviting trouble. People I know who run systems have been F****** over by things like this happening. <a href="../../../a/c/i/User%7EAcidsaturation_d8a6.html" title="User:Acidsaturation">Acidsaturation</a> 19:41, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If they have an incriminating website then I think they should take it offline instead of removing links to it! But, that said, I think that a whole article linking to sound system webpages may not a very good idea for reasons you suggested (I don't wanna piss the rigs off) and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files</a> so maybe it is just best to link to <a href="http://www.squatjuice.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.squatjuice.com/" rel="nofollow">Squatjucie</a>, <a href="http://guilfin.ddict.co.uk/extra/freeparties.php3" class="external text" title="http://guilfin.ddict.co.uk/extra/freeparties.php3" rel="nofollow">Guilfin</a> and <a href="http://partyvibe.com/freeparties/links.html" class="external text" title="http://partyvibe.com/freeparties/links.html" rel="nofollow">Partyvibe</a>.

<dd>Like I said, I'm in a bit of a quandry, 'cos as a cultural thing I think it's important that it's recognised what the soundsystem stands for and a list does shoe that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is, like I said, having so many links somewhere like this is a bit of a directory which authorities could easily find and read. Sadly any website for a rig that does free parties is "incriminating" in a sense and if you have a look at the <i>[removed for privacy reasons]</i> forum they's had a bit of unwanted attention already and the site is suspected of being monitored. This is inevitable if the medium of the internet's gonna be used, but...</dd>
<dd>After being sat in a room with some of <i>[removed for privacy reasons]</i> the week some fool gave their site address to mixmag and watching the blow-out i'm just a little concerned. Also Another Northern rig was busted at their home last month too, so it's a bit hot at the moment.</dd>

<dd>hi acidsaturation, so i made the list page a list without external links ... probably it better like that and a rex suggests, then it fits better the wikipedia format. i agree ppl should be careful with what they say and to who, but yeah, i agree with rex that if there is a site online it can already be monitored, and just a list (which will hopefully feature present and dead sisdems and should become pretty massive in time, there a shockin number of sisdems out there) doesnt give too much info. also, i think we get stronger by creating our own alternative history. there already was a project to list sisdems on network23 a few years back, then iguess it disappeared, hopefully with wikipedia then the list will stay for a longer time...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>just for completion this is what i wrote on the list discussion page...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yep, i changed the page to just a list, rather than a list of external links, so there is no need for the deletion notice. i actually think that in a way having the links is more useful, but in other ways as you already mentioned elsewhere, it better like this. links get broken over time also. i agree the list functions in the same way as a list of rock and roll bands or breakcore artists and thats why i wanted to make it.</dd>

<p>Cool - I totally agree as a listing project it's a good idea. I think wikipedia is just a little mainstream to hold too much info - at the moment at least.</p>

<p>Hoi Acid Saturation,</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_free_party_sound_systems.html" title="List of free party sound systems">List of free party sound systems</a> is a candidate for deletion. Here is the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_free_party_sound_systems_15b4.html#.5B.5BList_of_free_party_sound_systems.5D.5D" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of free party sound systems">link</a>. It's a bit annoying since we already discussed it once on the talk page, and to me it is clearly notable, verifiable, useful etc etc. Anyway, your contribution to the debate is of course welcome. You made some nice points in favour of the page before I seem to recall... <a href="../../../m/u/j/User%7EMujinga_2c8b.html" title="User:Mujinga">Mujinga</a> 00:52, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
