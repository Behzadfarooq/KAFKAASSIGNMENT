<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/i/Acid_house.html" title="Edit section: Further history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Further history</span></h2>
<p>Acid house may have started in Chicago, but it quickly moved across the Atlantic to the United Kingdom, where it became the foundation for the early <a href="../../../r/a/v/Rave.html" title="Rave">rave</a> scene, which adopted the yellow smiley symbol to represent acid house music and rave culture.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Acid house began influencing UK pop music, emerging in a somewhat sanitized form in songs like <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bananarama.html" title="Bananarama">Bananarama</a>'s "Tripping on Your Love" and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samantha_Fox_5abf.html" title="Samantha Fox">Samantha Fox</a>'s "Love House", and appearing as remixes of pop songs on <a href="../../../1/2/22/12__single_1275.html" title="12&quot; single">12" singles</a> by mainstream acts. It also manifested in the number-one hit "<a href="../../../t/h/e/Theme_from_S%27Express_8a60.html" title="Theme from S'Express">Theme from S'Express</a>" by electronic band <a href="../../../s/27/e/S%27Express_f817.html" title="S'Express">S'Express</a>.</p>
<p>In the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, however, news media and tabloids devoted an increasing amount of coverage to the hedonistic acid house/rave scene, focusing on its association with psychedelic drugs. The sensationalistic nature of the media coverage and its relentless questioning of the meaning of "acid" in "acid house" makes it impossible to gauge the actual prevalence of drugs at early raves and acid house parties. The coverage is widely believed to have ultimately contributed to the banning of acid house, during its heyday, from radio, television, and retail outlets in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Musically, acid house eventually moved away from its almost exclusive reliance on the TB-303, but continued to remain true to its roots of repeated sound sequences being shifted and warped by modulation over time.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/i/Acid_house.html" title="Edit section: Etymology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>There are conflicting accounts about how "acid" came to describe this new style of house music.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>It is a celebratory reference to <a href="../../../l/s/d/LSD_cccf.html" title="LSD">LSD</a></i> — some feel that early producers of the new style of house music, as well as people at <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightclub.html" title="Nightclub">nightclubs</a> where the music was played, enjoyed the drug and its interaction with the music. No citations are available to confirm or deny this explanation. <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis_P-Orridge_c715.html" title="Genesis P-Orridge">Genesis P-Orridge</a>, principal member of the experimental music collective <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic_TV_afa7.html" title="Psychic TV">Psychic TV</a>, is believed by some to be a primary source of this claim. P-Orridge made various claims of responsibility for inventing the term and the style of music, but at least one former member of Psychic TV disputes all of the claims,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> and in an interview in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> documentary <i><a href="../../../b/e/t/Better_Living_Through_Circuitry_2255.html" title="Better Living Through Circuitry">Better Living Through Circuitry</a></i>, P-Orridge admitted that it was a clerk in a Chicago record shop who used the word "acid" to describe the most experimental, bizarre house records that were on hand and that P-Orridge asked to be shown. In the interview, P-Orridge reported having an epiphany, while listening to those records, that the music was not very psychedelic, except by virtue of its tempo. Afterward, the music and imagery of Psychic TV records was very deliberately influenced by the acid house style and was quite celebratory of LSD in particular. P-Orridge later claimed to have been the first to introduce psychedelic elements to the music.</li>
<li><i>It is a celebratory reference to <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychedelic_drug.html" title="Psychedelic drug">psychedelic drugs</a> in general</i> — some feel that <a href="../../../e/c/s/Ecstasy_%28drug%29.html" title="Ecstasy (drug)">Ecstasy</a> (MDMA) was more popular and prevalent than LSD among musicians and nightclub patrons in the mid-1980s. No citations are available to confirm or deny this explanation. There are many citations of Ecstasy being prevalent in post-Chicago U.S. nightclub and UK <a href="../../../r/a/v/Rave_party.html" title="Rave party">rave party</a> scenes of the late 1980s, but acid house had already been named by then.</li>
<li><i>It was used in Chicago, at the time, to describe house music in the style of "Ron Hardy's Acid Track".</i> — Before Phuture's "<a href="../../../a/c/i/Acid_Trax_cbf1.html" title="Acid Trax">Acid Trax</a>" was given a title for commercial release, it was played at a nightclub by DJ <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Hardy_48cc.html" title="Ron Hardy">Ron Hardy</a> and was called "Ron Hardy's Acid Track" (or "Ron Hardy's Acid Trax") by some, because it was so "hot" (immediately popular) that it "burned the dance floor like acid". Phuture's title followed, and the term Acid House came into common parlance to describe house music with similar affectations, without regard to possible drug influence. No citations are available to confirm or deny this explanation.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li><i>It was used in Chicago, at the time, to describe house music that contained many samples of other recordings</i> — the use of such samples was considered unscrupulous by some, so it is believed by some that the term "acid" or "acid burning" was merely meant to have a harsh, unpleasant connotation. This explanation, sometimes including aspects of the others, has been widely repeated in the press<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> and even in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> However, there are at least two reasons why it may not be true: 1. Early house music producers did borrow sounds from each other's recordings, but the majority of acid house music tended to consist of fully original compositions. 2. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, UK Libertarian advocate <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Staines_edcd.html" title="Paul Staines">Paul Staines</a> wrote, "<i>I made up this explanation at a press conference held to launch the Freedom to Party Campaign at the Conservative Party conference in October 1989. I was attempting to desperately play down the drug aspect in a forlorn attempt to discourage anti-party legislation, reasoning that the British public might accept massive noisy parties, but thousands of teenagers on drugs were definitely not acceptable. This, incidentally, is the most successful lie I have ever told. Japanese music journalists have solemnly repeated it to me in the course of interviews and from MTV to ITN it has been broadcast as a fact. Only once was I caught out, when at a seminar held at the DMC World Disc Jockey Mixing Championships, a DJ from Chicago stood up and told the 1,000 or so people in the hall that I was talkin' a complete load of fuckin' bullshit —which I was.</i>"<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> However, some feel that Staines, like Genesis P-Orridge, is not a reliable source of information.</li>
<li><i>It is a colloquialism intended to suggest that the music itself was enhanced and transformed in a manner suggestive of the effects of LSD.</i> Some believe that the addition of the squelch and deep bass of the TB-303 synthesizer to house music makes it sound like the music itself has been subjected to the effects of LSD, or that it induces LSD's effects in those who listen and dance to it. No citations are available to confirm or deny this explanation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the term <i>acid house</i> was coined and began to appear alongside these varying explanations, many participants at acid house themed events made the psychedelic drug connotations a reality<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> This coincided with an increasing level of scrutiny and sensationalism in the mainstream press<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup>,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> although conflicting accounts about the degree of connection between acid house music and drugs continued to surface.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

In the article, Cheeseman writes, <i>"Phuture was me and two other guys, Spanky and Herbert J." remembers Pierre. "We had this Roland 303, which was a bassline machine, and we were trying to figure out how to use it. When we switched it on, that acid sound was already in it and we liked the sound of it so we decided to add some drums and make a track with it. We gave it to Ron Hardy who started playing it straight away. In fact, the first time he played it, he played it four times in one night! The first time people were like, 'what the fuck is this?' but by the fourth they loved it. Then I started to hear that Ron was playing some new thing they were calling 'Ron Hardy's Acid Trax', and everybody thought it was something he'd made himself. Eventually we found out that it was our track so we called it 'Acid Trax'. I think we may have made it as early as 1985, but Ron was playing it for a long time before it came out."</i></li>

Most Americans say it began in Chicago, where DJs at smaller, private parties and membership-only clubs (particularly one called The Warehouse) began aggressively mixing records, adding their own electronic percussion and sampling tracks, making music that — like the home-made vinaigrette at an Italian restaurant — was called "house." The fast disco and hip-hop — influenced recordings would sample pieces of music that were called bites" so (others spell it "bytes," to indicate that these are digital samples that can be measured in terms of RAM size). Especially evocative bites were called acid bites." Thus, music of the house, made up of these acid bites, became known as "acid house." When this sound got to England, it was reinterpreted, along with its name. Folklore has it that industrial (hard, fast, high-tech, and psychedelic) music superstar Genesis P. Orridge was in a record store when he saw a bin of disks labeled acid," which he figured was psychedelic music— tunes to play while on LSD. He and his cohorts added their own hallucinogenic flavor to the beats and samples, and British acid house was born.</i></li>

Some DJs say the term came from the distinctive buzzing sound of one of the primary technical components, the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. ("Hear that?" Chicago DJs are fond of asking. "</i>That <i>is the sound of acid.") Genesis P-Orridge of Pyschic TV claimed that he saw the description on a bin in a Chicago record store, was disappointed to find out that it meant acid as in "corrosive," and set about making psychedelic music that actually fit the bill. Paul Staines of England's Freedom to Party Campaign admitted the story he told a fringe meeting at the 1989 UK Conservative Party conference — that acid house came from the Chicago street slang "acid burn," meaning to steal or sample another piece of music — was concocted in a public relations effort to separate the phrase from its psychedelic connotation (no one in Chicago that I know has ever heard of the phrase). But anyone who's been to a rave can tell you that the connection between psychedelic drugs and acid house is certainly no fiction.</i></li>

The police have been swooping down on underground acid-house parties in vacant warehouses, busting, and sometimes beating, revelers. They have been egged on in semi-hysterical tones by the tabloid press, foremost the Sun, which said the discos were "evil" drug dens, and the dancers' trances the result of ingesting LSD (long known as acid in street slang) and the designer drug Ecstasy, an amphetamine derivative. "Hell of Acid Kids, Pushers Laugh as Teenagers See Terror of Bad Trip Boy," shouted a deck of headlines in the</i> Sun<i>, which is several cuts below America's</i> National Enquirer <i>in quality but enjoys considerable influence as Britain's largest-circulation newspaper. Two deaths were attributed to the dance craze. … Nobody denies drugs have been a part of the acid-house scene, as they have been a part of the disco milieu for years. But after the tabloids reported that Scotland Yard was setting up an "acid buster" team, senior police officials felt compelled to minimize the problem. They said that there was no need for such a team and that the use of LSD and Ecstasy was no epidemic. "The great majority of these parties are simply part of a style of music and dress and don't present a problem at all," said Cmdr. John Robinson, director of Scotland Yard's Public Order Branch. "At most of them, there is no heavy involvement with drugs."</i></li>
