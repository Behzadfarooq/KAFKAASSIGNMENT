<p>AC, do you have a reference (issue #/date) for that <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Groth_5deb.html" title="Gary Groth">Gary Groth</a> quote? Is it from the Peter Bagge zine "I Hate Comics?" --<a href="../../../g/o/t/User%7EGothamgazette_224c.html" title="User:Gothamgazette">Gothamgazette</a> 03:26, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ahem, that's "I Like Comics!" #1, (tho' there's a little caricature of Groth on the cover saying "I hate comics!". Yes, the quote's from there, but I was a dope and didn't check the wording, so the lead in might not be "a man should", possibly it's something slightly different. Please correct it if its mistaken; if not I'll check it soon.</dd>

<dd>At any rate, the quote seems to fit the paragraph, prior versions of which seemed a little prejudiced. --AC 07:46, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Of course. I agree that it was biased (not a Freudian slip, I promise). Thanks for digging that up!--<a href="../../../g/o/t/User%7EGothamgazette_224c.html" title="User:Gothamgazette">Gothamgazette</a> 03:05, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The attitude you're slinging at me on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7EComics_1aed.html" title="Talk:Comics">Talk:Comics</a> is getting annoying.</p>
<p>First of all, please stop calling me "Tv". Either address me by my user name, or take the trouble to find out what my first name is and use that if you want to be more informal than that. Making up a nickname for someone (especially someone you apparently dislike) is disrespectful and rude.</p>
<p>You seem to have a problem with the fact that Wikipedia has conventions and guidelines, and that I'm trying to follow them. "That's how we do things on Wikipedia" <i>is</i> sufficient reason to do it that way. It's not begging the question, it's appealing to all the prior discussions and the agreements that came out of them about how to do things here.</p>
<p>As one obvious example, there's the suggestion in the second bullet-point at the top of this page, for how to sign your comments on Talk pages, which really aids the readability of them. Either you didn't bother to read that, or you don't care, or you want to do things your own way just to be difficult. What's the deal with that?</p>
<p>I'm sorry if you don't like my style of writing here, but if you expect it to literally parrot other web sites, you're going to be disappointed, because <i>they aren't encyclopedias</i>. But Wikipedia is, which if you think about it, means it's going to include phrases that don't appear a lot in Google, because there's no need for them in other kinds of writing. There's a certain sort of precision needed for the housekeeping bits of an encyclopedia, and yeah, sometimes the result is a bit "dorky". Sorry. If you don't like the "tree of knowledge" approach, you've come to the wrong place, because that's what Wikipedia is all about.</p>

AC here, long time no see Mr. V! Thanks a heap for the helpful tip on signatures, which unfortunately I'd never seen til now. Of course if failing to employ said trifle invalidates all one could say, then we may note that you must have been too busy to sign your own message above, and thus we're all sent to nit limbo.</p>
<p>On being both annoyed and disrespected; I'm afraid that our customs differ because annoying respect is hardly oxymoronic, unnatural, or unwholesome, at least not among the more democratic tribes. To annoy a king , super-cleric, judge or imperious power is by definition (their own) rather criminal. But freedom to annoy is the democratic way, or how else could all our totally incompatible creeds and customs coexist, especially in the endless weirdness of our USA. Here to cause no offense is to have never existed at all. The song accompanying the sermon is the excellent Shagg's "Philosophy of the World", amen.</p>
<p>Anyway TV, there's no malice in it, so until somebody passes broad and sweeping annoyance-crime laws, let a rugged tolerance be your shelter.</p>
<p>On Wikipedian conservatism being it's own justification, the counter to that is as ancient as liberalism; just because it's old or customary don't make it good enough to live forever. Rather it's the constant testing of the customary that's exactly what makes any such system viable.</p>
<p>On your writing style, you'd be happily wrong, since I certainly do appreciate it. It's mostly correct, it flows along, it's usually clear, it's competant, and much better than all sorts of halting gobledygook that clogs up early revisions here.</p>
<p>BUT... it's rare for any good thing not to have it's own peculiar weaknesses, and the good that you write, although it far outweighs it's own badness even with a couple of bad free-riders thrown on the balance for good measure... isn't limitless. Concede that, and it'd be possible to inquire as to particulars rather than stonewalling at mere opinion.</p>
<p>On our encyclopedias and trees, you no comprende Senor. If anyone's interested, please check out Robert Darnton's essay "Philosophers Trim the Tree of Knowledge: the Epistomological Strategy of the Encyclopédié", which can be found in his 'The Great Cat Massacre, and other episodes in French Cultural History', 1984 Vintage Books.</p>
<p>PS: if need be it may take another year to reply. Tempus fugit...</p>
