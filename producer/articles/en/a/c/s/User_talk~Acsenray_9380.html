<p>FYI, I killed off a few of your names-only pages today before I realized what kind of collection you were creatingso you may have to re-create some of them. Personally, I find it helpful to create bios offline, then create pages and dump in the text - especially when making a bunch of pages with similar format. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 20:33, 2 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Please note that I moved your article "Rockefeller Republicans" to "List of liberal U.S. Republicans"; see Talk:List of liberal U.S. Republicans for my reasons. Note that there was an older existing article at <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockefeller_Republican_fecf.html" title="Rockefeller Republican">Rockefeller Republican</a> which I guess you were unaware of. Once links to your article are cleaned up, I suggest that "Rockefeller Republicans" be changed from a rediect to "List of liberal U.S. Republicans" into a redirect to "Rockefeller Republican".

<p>I see you've expanded the "Accusations, impeachment, and legal problems" section of the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> article. Unfortunately, I believe some of it will be considered <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">non-NPOV</a> and much of it belongs, perhaps, in other articles dealing with specific scandals (whether they currently exist or not). I have no strong interest myself in maintaining the Clinton article so please don't take this as an attack; I just figured I'd give you a friendly warning before you start seeing others reverting your edits. Also, I see that you're a journalist. You might need to try extra hard to resist turning the presidential bio pages into newspaper exposés. <code>;-)</code> See also <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_wikipedia_is_not_6c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:What wikipedia is not">What wikipedia is not</a>. - <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDcljr_a662.html" title="User:Dcljr">dcljr</a> 19:38, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You asked me to check out the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> article again. The "Accusations..." section seems fine now, except the figure $850,000 is mentioned twice.

<p>Great job with the table!</p>
<p>I did make one change in Georgia - the only state of which I am qualified to speak - from "Circuit Superior Court" to "Superior Court". Pleadings, orders &amp;c. are captioned "Superior Court of _______ County", although judges and D.A.'s normally have their stationery, signatures etc. Judge/District Attorney for the ______________ Judicial Circuit.</p>

Good to read your article on the lady challenging <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_R._Turner_e062.html" title="Michael R. Turner">Michael R. Turner</a> this year. That's my congressional district and I didn't know anything about her save her name. You've probably seen it, but I've a long list of articles I've made sizable contributions to on my user page including many in legal and political biography. For example, I put the predecessor/successor boxes on all the associate justices of the Supreme Court and wrote blurbs on all the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_Reporter_of_Decisions_5778.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions">reporters</a> save the current one who I haven't been able to find anything on.<br />
May I make one suggestion about creating new biographies? If you create articles under a nickname, e.g. <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Kindness_fe61.html" title="Tom Kindness">Tom Kindness</a>, would you put in redirects under the full name? I didn't see your Kindness article at first and started writing either under Thomas or Thomas N, then combined the two. I know I'm guilty of this as well because when I went to look at my own <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Sanders_d0b4.html" title="Charles Sanders">Charles Sanders</a> article just now, I couldn't find it because I'd entered it under <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_W._Sanders_1db4.html" title="Charles W.

<p>My apologies if I bumped into you on the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Ohio_6c55.html" title="Government of Ohio">Government of Ohio</a> article. I saw it down on my watchlist where you'd worked on it earlier today and took a look, which spurred me to make a couple revisions to the section on the State Board of Ed. I just noticed from the edit history you were on there at the same time and I probably caused you an edit conflict. I do apologize.<br />
One useful wikipedia call is to put the "inuse" template at the top of a page you are editing. That will put up a flag warning everyone to step aside because you are working. I use this especially when I'm making a lot of edits because some of our eagle-eyed contributors waste no time to start editing.

I copied the party affiliations of the Secretaries of State from the list in the back of the Ohio Secretary of State's "Official Roster of Federal, State and County Officers" (Columbus, Ohio: The Secretary, biennial). The one Secretary with no party listed in the Wikipedia article is also blank in the book. The older editions have information deleted from the newer, such as the legal descriptions of the Congressional districts from the first apportionment onward. I debating whether I want to get involved with posting that.

<li>Salve, Acesnray!<br />
Haven't seen you much lately. Hope all is well along the Potomac. Your changes to <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_McEwen_f29b.html" title="Bob McEwen">Bob McEwen</a> and a couple other articles popped up on my watchlist and I noticed you made some changes regarding numbers, changing words to numbers, and replacing the word "percent" with the percent symbol. I was taught in school to spell out numbers under one-hundred and in journalism class to always use the word percent in stories rather than the symbol and our stylebook endorses the latter while says either is acceptable on the former. See <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Number_names" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Number_names</a>.

<li>Salve!<br />
I was looking in the wrong column in the "compare versions". You changed it to "percent" from "%". Sorry about that. Some of us can't read. I'm going to make a proposal to the stylebook re spelling out numbers. To me, it just looks odd to see "24". I do recognize the AP uses numerals, but we don't have the same space concerns as they or printed reference works do. I'm going to make queries about where to post my proposal and when get it up, I'll let you know so you can offer your comments. One other thing. You've been putting up results for this months elections; will you be sure to get the final numbers when the elections are certified?

<p>Hi there!

Howdy. I've been going back and forth on whether to delete the Hagans and Riffes from the List of U.S. Political Families page, and I figured I'd drop you a friendly note before doing anything rash. The talk page on that article seems to have dried up and I never got any responses to my query about what threshhold should be set for calling a family a "U.S." family, as opposed to something else, as part of my mission to clean up and standardize that page. Neither the Hagans nor the Riffes seem to have contributed any individuals to any national political office; the number of families with multiple members active in state and county politics in all the states is enormous, especially if history is taken into account, and I can't justify trying to add all those families. While the Hagans and Riffes are no doubt notable in Ohio, I don't believe they belong on a page devoted to nationally notable families. I'm leaning toward deleting, but I'll let you have your say if you wish. Perhaps a page of Ohio political families is in order. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThehappysmith_a5ea.html" title="User:Thehappysmith">Thehappysmith</a> 04:48, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Suppose that we are electing a school board or town council where there are no districts, and the election is "at large". Suppose that there are N vacancies. The voter might have 1 vote to cast amongst the several candidates, or N votes, or 1 &lt;= M &lt;= N. Which applies in <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati%2C_Ohio_33af.html" title="Cincinnati, Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>. How many names must a voter cross off on the ballot paper?</p>
<p>If the answer is N, then the board or council is likely to be run by a landslide result, with no representation from other parties, even the second biggest party.</p>
<p>If the answer is M, then a landslide is less likely, and there is likely to be some reprentation from the second biggest party.</p>
<p>If the answer is 1, then there is likely to be wide selection of representation of big and small parties.</p>
<p>Thus the number of votes per voter is important.</p>
<p>PS I just noticed that the discussion for the Cinncinati elections left of the heading "How Many Votes per voter". DRAT.</p>

Hope this message finds you well. I saw the neat article you were working on the many Ohio towns that aren't in the county with that name (e.g. Hamilton, Warren, Butlerville, Clintonville). I had been thinking of doing something like that myself. Glad to see you put it together.<br />

<p>Salve, Acsenray!<br />
Thanks for your congrats on my election. I was delighted with the positive comments I got in the election, even if the same issue as last time was drug up. I posted a comment in support of your peculiarities article <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Peculiarities_of_Ohio_place_names_225a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Peculiarities of Ohio place names">here</a>, that cites an example of the real confusion out there re our towns not being in the similiarly named county.

<p>Hi - I made a list of users who've been around long enough to have made lots of edits but aren't admins. It looks like you haven't been around lately, but if you come back and are at all interested in becoming an admin, can you please add an '*' immediately before your name in <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_WP600_not_admins_50e3.html" title="User:Rick Block/WP600 not admins">this list</a>? I've suggested folks nominating someone might want to puruse this list, although there is certainly no guarantee anyone will ever look at it. I've marked you on this list as "inactve". Feel free to update this as well.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've completely redone the intro to the Hindustani article, based on the idea that, before Partition, the term referred to Urdu (standard Hindi didn't yet exist), and that it is but one of many "dialects" of Hindi, not the whole dialect chain, as the article presented it. Needless to say, the people who believe that Hindustani is a "mix" of Hindi and Urdu think this is absurd. I would appreciate any input you might have. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 21:16, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. The question of an article gaining feature status is not about how important the person or topic is but whether or not the article is any good.

<p>Dear fellow editor: I reorganized the references to "codified law" in the article on Statutory law (creating a separate paragraph at the end of the article) because I wanted to make sure that non-lawyers can understand that the term codified law is also used in a more narrow technical sense. I argue that the more narrow sense is the one most people (lawyers and non-lawyers alike) would run across.

<p>I was wrong about his first name. I see what happened though. I found the voteusa page that I was looking at, and it had Stickland and Ted Kulongoski, who actually is Theodore, listed one after the other. So I screwed it up.
