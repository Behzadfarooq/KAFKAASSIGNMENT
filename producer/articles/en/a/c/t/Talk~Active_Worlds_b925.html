<p>A citizen is always granted access to a public world. If a user gets banned from AW, that person is no longer a citizen (unless until unbanned), so therefore that "grant" of access no longer applies to them, meaning that line on the page is correct and no reason to change it. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTheMartian_7ed8.html" title="User:AlexTheMartian">AlexTheMartian</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexTheMartian_28b6.html" title="User talk:AlexTheMartian">Talk</a> 07:08, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would hardly say that <i>most</i> of the Wikipedia editors are AW cits (although that probably does apply to the ones who have made contributions to this article and discussion page); more likely, most have never even heard of it. OTOH, most of us who <i>are</i> cits spend our time working on other projects. (I'm spending about half my time on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> reviews.) So, if you want a new screenshot, upload one and change the link ... that's how the Wiki works!

<p>I removed the Wikia external link, with Point 9 of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" rel="nofollow">guideline</a> as my cause of action. That wiki has had zero edits for the past 30 days. -- <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossBuckle_Swami_fa57.html" title="User:JossBuckle Swami">JossBuckle Swami</a> 22:23, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You can blame it on slow progress of Active Worlds version 4.1 on part of its developer, Activeworlds Inc. Not much to add to release notes page there.&#160;:p</li>

<p>This has nothing to do with Activeworlds User:Starheart 11 January 2007</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickins_bc66.html" title="User:Dickins">Dickins</a> 08:02, 13 January 2007 (UTC) <b>Please Note:</b> As both systems where based on the Book "Snow Crash it is relevant for the reader to examine the interpretation of programmers of both systems as they do refer to virtual communities . Remember Wiki is a neutral system, therefore to delete non activeworld links is reducing the readers ability to research interpretations of the relevant book.</p>
<p>User:Starheart I removed it under the links to universes, SL is not an AW universe, but can be an external link as it is another 3D virtual system, so I left it in that section.</p>
<p>removed the reference blaxxun since there is no reference in the Wiki for it</p>
<p>added external link for PeaceCity3D</p>
<p>To what extend are external links added? Only the ones that are well known? Or try to have a complete list of all universes?</p>
<p>Does the current subscription price have to be included? I don't think its relevent, pricing is not usually quoted in other Wikipedia articles.</p>

<p>ActiveWorlds, To my knowledge, has NO advertising, including pop ups, banners, TV, radio, or any other type of advertising.</p>
<p>So why is it marked as an advertisement?</p>
<p>CompuHacker 03:18, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>no no no, it says "This article or section is <b>written</b> like an advertisement." so it is not marked for the program having advertising, it is the other way around, to some people on Wikipedia, this activeworlds article is looking like just one big advertisement for activeworlds, instead it needs to look more like a normal encyclopedia article. And I am not the one who marked it as advertisement, but I do think we probably can do without all the pricing info. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTheMartian_7ed8.html" title="User:AlexTheMartian">AlexTheMartian</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexTheMartian_28b6.html" title="User talk:AlexTheMartian">Talk</a> 06:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is AW a game? No. Please remove, I won't for fear of it being disputed. It's not a game.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I removed "Mode(s) Massive Multiplayer Online Game" as well as "Ratings G+", becuase 1. It is not a game, and 2. I believe G+ can be misleading. Activeworlds varries from G to X rating, but it all depends on which world you go to. So I do not know what is the best way of listing the rating. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTheMartian_7ed8.html" title="User:AlexTheMartian">AlexTheMartian</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexTheMartian_28b6.html" title="User talk:AlexTheMartian">Talk</a> 06:44, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
