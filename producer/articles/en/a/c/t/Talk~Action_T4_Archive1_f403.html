<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article needs work</span></h2>
<p>It's my understanding that the T-4 program was halted by Hitler because it had become something of a scandal after being publicly denounced by Clemens von Galen. This is interesting for two reasons - firstly, because it's an insight into how even the Nazis were susceptible to the demands of public opinion; secondly, because it has been argued that this scandal is what led Hitler to avoid ever signing any documents specifically ordering the extermination of Jews. If someone could get some reliable sources for this info, it could be worth working into the article.</p>

<dd>I fully agree. Three and a half paragraphs are devoted more to (admirable) Ernst Klee than to T-4 Euthanasia program itself. Even the synopsis of Klee's standard work is poor indeed. He would never have written: "Most of the participants of the T-4 Euthanasia Program became part of the Holocaust as well, ... even helping to build death camps as Belzec, Treblinka or Sobibor in Operation Reinhard, as Klee notes", because Klee knows better than most that it was the T-4 personnell that was transfered to the "Reinhardt" camps and that they not only helped to build these camps but r a n them indeed. They were not any "helpers", they were the real k i l l e r s! I hope it has not been the intention of the author(s) to make killers appear as harmless looking helpers. P.

<dd>There's been some controversy about people pushing the nazi eugenics program to be ""racial"" without providing any kind of additional information or verifiable sources. Perhaps the eugenics program was racist by only being applied to germans? I don't think that's what people think when reading the reference though.</dd>

<dd>I asume the link to be either POV pushing, someone being too eager to promote an article they worked on, or a mistake. I'll remove the statement/link, and asume it's reasonable to leave it out untill solid information is provided in the article to support such a claim. If people find this unreasonable and revert the article without needing to back up their claims I'll dispute the neutrality of the article. The same dispute is going on on the <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">eugenics</a> article partially about this topic, but I asume different/more expertised people might be watching this article.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">T-4 and the Shoah</span></h2>
<p>I reverted the following edit, as it is a gross oversimplification:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>T-4 Euthanasia Program</b> was the official name of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany's</a> <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">Eugenic</a> <a href="../../../e/u/t/Euthanasia.html" title="Euthanasia">euthanasia</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compulsory_sterilization.html#Germany" title="Compulsory sterilization">program</a> which killed some 200,000 people as the first stage of what would come to be called the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> (which killed some 11 million people).</dd>
</dl>
<p>What follows the "which" is incautious. If the Holocaust had "stages", one needs to be careful in asserting that anything that happened before the invasion of the Soviet Union necessarily led to what happened thereafter. Elements of T-4 may have been essential to the Holocaust, particularly Operation Reinhardt, but there is no evidence indicating that there was a larger plan, of which T-4 was a first step. If one follows the accounts synthesised by Browning, it was only the difficulties created by the extreme violence used by the Einsatzgruppen on somewhat independent initiative and the consonance of its purpose with the senior leadership of the RSHA that caused the SS to cast about for more efficient means of mass murder and thus to redeploy technology used by T-4. It seems far more important to introduce these distinctions as closely as possible with any statements linking this to the Holocaust than to cite statistics. <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 00:42, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Usage of the word euthanasia</span></h2>
<p>I feel very uncomfortable about the use of the word euthanasia to describe the T-4 programme. Even if this is a fair translation of the original German phrase used by the nazis, its repeated use during the article seems to justify the murders rather than pointing out that murder in the name of eugenics and euthanasia are not mutually interchangeable descriptions.</p>
<p>Not only does this clumsy use of language diminish the sadism of the crime described, but it also degenerates the concept of euthanasia - the practice of helping someone bring a dignified end to their life <i>at their own request</i>.</p>
<p>Whether or not the reader is pro-euthanasia, I think most people will agree that there is a strong difference between the two concepts on a linguistic and academic level. Mention should be made of the fact that euthanasia was used as a euphemism by the nazis, but I do not think its usage should recur later in the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Would it be sufficient to keep the word "euthanasia" in quotes? I don't think these would be scare-quotes so much as an indication that one is acknowledging a usage without having to accept it. Unless there is some recognised alternative language to be found in scholarship, I think quotation is what one would have to settle for. <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 12:53, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think its the modern usage of euthanasia which is in fact the problem. Today, it is synonymous with suicide when applied to humans. Most of the people executed under the T-4 program were biologically inferior, and the criteria applied to them was the same applied to the execution of a lame horse. The only issue here is does eugenics require the religious respect for all human life? The answer is clearly "no". While we can have a eugenics program that simply sterilizes the inferior, the result is the same: defective genes are prevented from reproducing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't see anyone using this same fervor over Spartan infanticide. The fact is while today, we may hold to the belief that all human life must be preserved, that is a modern value system and one that is grossly dependent upon our technological sophistication. Surely, it is not the value system of nature. So, why apply it to Wikipedia?</p>
<ul>
<li>I support using the term in quotes the first few times, or at least adding a line about how the <i>Nazis</i> considers it "euthanasia" but calling it such could be very problematic (the Nazis also called killing "disinfection", of course). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 00:16, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>As a disabled person I have to ask, why is the extermination of people for racial reasons termed "holocaust", while the extermination of people based on disability called "euthanasia"? "Euthanasia" means, "dying well," and is a term meant to signify terminally ill patients seeking some dignity in their deaths. The children who were mercilessly starved to death by the Nazi regime and then had their brains extracted and put in pickle jars did not "die well." This was a holocaust. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerendipodous_1fa9.html" title="User:Serendipodous">Serendipodous</a> 11:07, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The word 'extermination' probably fits better, and associating euthanasia with an extermination program given the way euthanasia is practiced nowadays is possibly POV.

<dd>I have replaced the mention of Mengele with Franz Stangl and Christian Wirth, who were definitely among the T4 personnel, and certainly went on to Operation Reinhard. Stangl helped build Sobibor, and was later commandant at Treblinka. Wirth was involved in the development of large scale gassing, first at Chelmno, and was later Inspector of all the Reinhard camps, reporting (directly I think) to Globocnik. There is an interview with Stangl in Gitta Sereny's 'The German Trauma' (and I think the same material is covered in her 'Into That Darkness). --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESquiddy_b0de.html" title="User talk:Squiddy"><small>(squirt ink?)</small></a> 14:40, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good point about it basically being a link summary for 1 article. My initial motivation for establishing a new subcategory was that the hospital articles linked to by the T-4 article (such as <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grafeneck.html" title="Grafeneck">Grafeneck</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schloss_Hartheim_61fe.html" title="Schloss Hartheim">Schloss Hartheim</a>) are currently uncategorized (except for their stub category). I was planning on doing some work to expand those articles, and my first task was going to be to categorize them. Do you have any suggestions?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, you said that "inclusion of the T-4 program as part or cause of the holocaust is disputable." <s>Out of curiosity, what is your basis for that statement? I haven't seen this dispute anywhere, and I'm not sure what it would be based on. Is it a matter of defining when the Holocust started? Or am I missing something? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryOrr_9af6.html" title="User:JerryOrr">JerryOrr</a> 15:52, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</s> Okay, I found the debate (whether the Holocaust includes eugenics/euthanasia, or just racial cleansing). Still, the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> article specifically references the T-4 program, and while the 1st intro paragraph doesn't mention disabled persons, the 3rd intro paragraph specifically does. So while T-4 being part of the Holocaust is disputable (or at least has been disputed), its inclusion in the Holocaust article would imply that the current Wikipedia consensus is to include it. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryOrr_9af6.html" title="User:JerryOrr">JerryOrr</a> 16:11, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The T-4 reference is in the holocaust article because nobody bothered to remove it. It mainly proves that nobody felt like getting into an editing conflict over it, especially calling the Kristallnacht an early element of the holocaust is somewhat rediculous.</dd>

<dd>The T-4 project is certainly a display of the nazi's lack of regard for human life.

<dd>Before digging to much further into that debate, I'd still like your (or anyone's) opinion on how to categorize, for example, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schloss_Hartheim_61fe.html" title="Schloss Hartheim">Schloss Hartheim</a>. Any input would be appreciated.</dd>

<dd>Now back to what the Holocaust encompasses... where do you get a definition of the Holocaust that is narrower than Wikipedia's "loose" definition? I'm not trying to be combative; I'm honestly just curious as to where the official scope of the holocaust is defined (and who came up with that definition). For example, <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=holocaust" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=holocaust" rel="nofollow">Dictionary.com</a> defines it as "The genocide of European Jews and others by the Nazis during World War II". Now, if you went by <b>that</b> definition, it would exclude the T-4 project (as genocide is generally understood to be based on race/ethnicity), but would <b>include</b> <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristallnacht.html" title="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> (since it was targeted at the Jews).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now I'm by no means saying Dictionary.com should be the authoritative source on the matter; my point is that it offers another variation in the scope of the Holocaust. I'd be interested to see where the scope you have defined comes from. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryOrr_9af6.html" title="User:JerryOrr">JerryOrr</a> 21:41, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thinking about it, maybe a nazi eugenics/T-4 Program subcategory of eugenics isn't that bad an idea. Regarding Kristallnacht, it wasn't genocidal in nature, and there have been bigger (race) riots in human history that did not result in genocide.</dd>

<dd>I make 3 classifications myself: genetic, racial, political. I'd say the racial exterminations are what is generally considered to be the holocaust. Much of the blur comes from the holocaust being a big cake many victimized groups want a piece from. While 100.000-200.000 deaths could be seen as a tiny portion of the holocaust, T-4 is the biggest eugenics program in human history. --<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScandum_f41e.html" title="User:Scandum">Scandum</a> 22:44, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am pretty sure that the main Nazi compulsory sterilization program was carried out under different official auspices than the euthanasia program.

<p>I just wanted to add that the line stating "...Hartheim to suffocate mostly adult victims with carbon monoxide even..." is incorrect. When you kill people with carbon monoxide you aren't suffocating them. You are in fact poisoning them and they will continue to breath in oxygen until the stop inhaling.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Volksgenosse</span></h2>
<p>The German word "Volksgenosse" means "racial comrade." The word "volk" can be used in several ways. In the well-known phase on the Reichstag, "Dem Deutschen Volk," it means all the German people. In the DDR, the Volkspolizei were the "people's police", meaning the working people in a class sense. But the Nazis used it to refer to the German race, as opposed to non-German races such as Jews. The expression "Volksgenosse" meant a "racial comrade" not a "people's comrade" in the sense socialists would have used it. See the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksgenosse" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksgenosse" rel="nofollow">German Wikipedia</a> on this. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 11:16, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

But the poster doesn't adress all "Aryans", it's focus are the German people (or here: taxpayers) (compare with "<a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkswagen.html" title="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a>", the car for the "(German) people"). That the Nazis had their own, racistic definition of "German" or "German people" is true, but still "race comrade" is the translation of "Rassengenosse" (a term also used by Hitler) and not the correct translation of "Volksgenosse". - 195.49.2.166 11:57, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">'Murder' vs. 'Killing'</span></h2>
<p>I've changed two words in the introductory paragraph relating to the use of the word 'kill' (killings and killed). Common usage of these words has depersonalized an extreme criminal program (eligible for prosecution as a "Crime Against Humanity"), albeit one that was institutionalized by the highest levels of the then-current German regime.</p>
<p>When a tree falls in a park and crushes a child playing underneath it, it would be fair (in most people's views) to describe the child's death with the verb 'killed'.</p>
<p>When a government institutionalizes mass murder for its ulterior motives, please call a spade a spade and avoid being polite by use of the word 'kill'. What they did, whether or not they issued an edict, was 'murder'. If this is less digestable to the casual reader, so be it. Mass murder should be demonized by all societies at every opportunity if we want to avoid repeating it continuously, forever. 64.231.37.251 16:49, 18 August 2006 (UTC)Zoomeri</p>

For one, it keeps the article history and talk page in a single location, and to merge in the other direction seems like hijacking the topic, ignoring all the work of previous editors. Unless there is some objection, i will revese the tags again: merge <i>from</i> <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_T4_d0b4.html" title="Action T4">Action T4</a> to this location.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 13:23, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article title and scope</span></h2>
<p>via RFC: I question the first sentence of the article: <b>T-4 Euthanasia Program</b> was the <i>official</i> name of <i>the</i> Nazi Germany eugenics program. Was there an official name for the program beyond the code name 'Aktion T-4'? T-4 was also not the full extent of Nazi eugenics programs. I hesitate to make any changes without knowing what the proper scope should be.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 20:06, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, the program didn't have an official name, since it was both illegal and clandestine. "T4" was a code name. "Euthanasia" is someone's opinion, and a false one. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:29, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've had a look at the references, and six of them (including two German-language ones) use the word <i>euthanasia</i> (or <i>euthanasie</i>). It isn't just the opinion of some anonymous IP. The use of the word euthanasia shouldn't be seen as an endorsement by wikipedia of the Nazis' program, or even of their terminology, any more than, for example, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Solution_bd4d.html" title="Final Solution">Final Solution</a>. You argue that "The involuntary mass killing of people with disabilities is not euthanasia.", but while it may not fit some people's definition of euthanasia, <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hs=vJ7&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22involuntary+euthanasia%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hs=vJ7&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22involuntary+euthanasia%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">"involuntary euthanasia"</a> gets 47.6K ghits, including sources such as the BBC, Australian Parliament House and wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 11:18, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am aware that the T4 program is widely refered to in both German and English as a euthanasia program, and that it was sometimes called that by the Nazis themselves, but that is false, and such a falsehood can't go in the heading of an article, although it should be refered to in the text. Euthanasia, properly defined, requires the consent either of the person themselves, or, if they are incapable of giving consent, of their next-of-kin or legal guardian. It is motivated by a desire to relieve a person of their suffering. Emptying out asylums and gassing or shooting the inmates for economic or eugenicist reasons, regardless of their actual condition, while deceiving the families about what is happening, is not euthanasia but murder. The Nazis themselves knew this, which is why there was never a law or even a formal Fuhrer-decree legalising it, and why elaborate deception was used. One of the reasons that T4 is frequently described as a euthanasia program is that anti-euthanasia forces hope thereby to discredit euthanasia by associating it with Nazi mass murder. This is understandable propaganda (I am incidentally myself opposed to euthanasia in most circumstances), but we cannot allow it to influence how we title articles. We should call things by their real names. "Final solution" is not a good analogy because although it is a euphemism it is not a falsehood in the same sense that calling T4 euthanasia is. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 12:12, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If people really object to my new title on the grounds that it is too long, my only other suggestion is to call the article <a href="../../../t/4/_/T4.html" title="T4">T4</a> or T4 program, and have everything else redirect to it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 03:01, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think T4 program is a suitably neutral name, it is also used by Britannica. Or Operation T4 which apprently was the code name of the project accoring to some online sources.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">Peta</a> 04:34, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fine. I will move my new text to T4 program (lower-case P because it was not a formal name), and redirect this article to it. Is everyone happy with that? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:28, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Someone who didn't know about the program wouldn't be able to tell what it means from the title. That's a bit less than ideal. Maybe Nazi Germany T4 program? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 09:41, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I provided a heading that explained exactly what the article was about and was told it was too long. Now I am told the replacement is too short. I can't please everyone. Usually at Wikipedia I find I can't please anyone, so I have given up trying. I don't think there was any other T4 program so I don't think it needs disambiguating in the title. What it needs is lots of redirects and referals from the places people are likely to look for the article. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 12:06, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From RfC:It seems silly to have such a long name. The Germans had a name for it, "Operation T4." That should be the name of the article. Anything else is superflous. As long as it is linked to from the proper articles there should be no ambiguity as to its subject matter. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_m_d217.html" title="User:George m">George</a> 17:48, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I like the current title based on a vague impresssion that it would be more recognizable to readers. Under any name the article would still have to explain the Nazi euphemism, and doing so would probably make for good intro text. Has any version been tried with a complete explanation in the lead? Otherwise <i>Operation T4</i> or <i>Nazi "Operation T4"</i> or similar.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 18:23, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>George: what German word is being translated here as "operation"? The most common German name was "Aktion-T4". I would render that as <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_T4_d0b4.html" title="Action T4">Action T4</a> or <a href="../../../t/4/_/T4_Action_dc6d.html" title="T4 Action">T4 Action</a>, or else leave it in German.</li>
<li>Eric: I will not accept any title with the word "euthanasia" in it, for reasons explained above.</li>
<li>People can't have it both ways. We either have a long title which correctly describes the content of the article, such as <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killing_of_people_with_disabilities_in_Nazi_Germany_0bc7.html" title="Killing of people with disabilities in Nazi Germany">Killing of people with disabilities in Nazi Germany</a>, or we have a short title which does not, such as T4 program. Which do we want? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 09:36, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Simple is always best. <i>Action</i> T-4 or whatever the accepted translation is would be the most appropriate name. "Euthanasia" does seem inappropriate as soft-pedaling. I was following the discussion Adam and didn't notice any information about the translation <i>operation</i> being inappropriate. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_m_d217.html" title="User:George m">George</a> 12:58, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think <a href="../../../t/4/_/T4_Action_dc6d.html" title="T4 Action">T4 Action</a> is the best English rendering.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Aktion T-4</b>. Operation T-4. Code name for the Nazi euthanasia program. Name taken from the Reich Chancellery’s address at Tiergartenstraße 4. The program first murdered German incurables utilizing carbon monoxide in mobile vans to kill more than 100,000 adults and children; later, closed gas chambers were used. The staff of T-4 subsequently provided the trained force of killers at the Operation Reinhard camps in Poland: Belzec, Chelmno, Sobibor, and Treblinka. <i>See also</i> Aktion Reinhard; Aktion 14 f 13 KZ-Häftlinge; Euthanasie.</p>

<p>An "action" was <i>not</i> an "operation." "Operation" is usually a translation of "fall" (Fall Gelb) or "unternehmen" (Unternehmen Barbarossa). If we want to use "Aktion T4" as the standard German name, then it should be translated as <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_T4_d0b4.html" title="Action T4">Action T4</a> or <a href="../../../t/4/_/T4_Action_dc6d.html" title="T4 Action">T4 Action</a>. I think the latter is better because "action" is a noun and in this sense "T4" is being used adjectively. But I will settle for the former. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 14:05, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems like such a minor issue, but we do need to get on the same page concerning verifiability and reliable sources. (Doerr 2002) <i>so far</i> seems to be definitive, what better source than "An English Lexicon of the Language of the Third Reich" could we ask for?<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 16:19, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, before finally deciding on a title we need to make sure everyone agrees on the article scope. <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killing_of_people_with_disabilities_in_Nazi_Germany_0bc7.html" title="Killing of people with disabilities in Nazi Germany">Killing of people with disabilities in Nazi Germany</a> (as you make clear in the newer text) and "the Nazi Germany eugenics program" (from the intro) are both wider scopes than 'Aktion T-4'.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 16:35, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I should apologize for not noticing that <i>action</i> was the word being used. I must have inferred <i>operation</i> from the context.

<p>With due respect to Herr Doerr, they are not synonyms. An "operation" was usually a large-scale military operation, like Barbarossa. An "action" was a party-police-SS action against a political target, such as Action Reinhard against the Jews. Aktion Silbertanne refered to above was an action against the Dutch resistance. Aktion Sumpffieber was an anti-partisan action in Byelorussia. T4, which was both illegal and clandestine, was clearly an action in this sense. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 00:20, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you thinking in German? If your intention is to preserve a non-military suggestion in the name, those of us blessed with ignorance of other languages might see 'Action T4' as doing the opposite. An action is an engagement or skirmish, even 'police action' has a more military feel than 'operation' to these ears. Anyway 'Aktion T4' seems to be translated nearly so equally to both 'action' and 'operation' as to make little difference.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 14:09, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Could we make a decision about the title? I am continuing to work on my version of the article, and it is absurd to have two articles. The most acceptable proposal seems to be to call the article <a href="../../../t/4/_/T4_Action_dc6d.html" title="T4 Action">T4 Action</a>, and to redirect this article to it. I intend doing this tomorrow my time (in about 12 hours), so those who have comments should make them. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 16:12, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Per <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a>, I would endorse <i>Operation T4</i> for a title. Now the issue of scope remains. Ifnord 17:34, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did not come here for the RFC, but I oppose remove "T4 or "T-4" moving from the title. The title of the Wiki article in German language is <a href="../../../../de/a/k/t/Aktion_T4_03cd.html" class="extiw" title="de:Aktion_T4">de:Aktion T4</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 22:34, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Andries: the current proposal is to call the article <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_T4_d0b4.html" title="Action T4">Action T4</a>, and I am about to move the other version of the article to that title, and create a series of redirects which will lead readers to that title. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 03:27, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
