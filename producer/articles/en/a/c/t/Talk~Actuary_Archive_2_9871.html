<h2><span class="mw-headline">Remuneration</span></h2>
<p>I noted someone had used the "Prospects" actuarial salary information website for the UK salaries and linked the source accordingly. However, I noted that it said a newly qualified actuary earns between £30,000 and £50,000 (a range of figures which seemed staggeringly low - I'm a year out of university and I make more than £30k). I clicked on the link to find that the article doesn't actually say that but gives the range as £44k-£64k and notes that this is solely for insurance companies actuaries. I have therefore updated the article to reflect what it says. It's very hard to find reliable salary data on the net; does anyone know a good site for finding this information?--<a href="../../../z/o/s/User%7EZoso_Jade_9110.html" title="User:Zoso Jade">Zoso Jade</a> 11:24, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>copied from my talk page</i>
<dl>
<dd>Avi:</dd>
<dd>i cant find your recent reply to me re the above captioned subjects.</dd>
<dd>the underlying risks are similar but the actuarial skill sets are quite different. for example, all the "old" guys like jack moorhead and bob meyers get involved in social insurance. the size of the risks are enormous, and the quantification is vague because of politics. look at the 9/11 WTC</dd>
<dd>years ago there was very little difference between an insurance company and a reinsurance company. but that has changed. look at the 911 WTC loss. forgot about what the contract says; judges and politicians can reinterpret them any way that is convenient for them. in my judgement, the actuarial skill set for senior actuaries in reinsurance is much more challenging than regular insurance.</dd>
<dd>since we are focusing on 'actuary' i believe it is important to show or hint at the tremendous breadth of business and societal risks that our profession has to cope with.</dd>
<dd>this seems to me also to require a new page about types of risk, and also about the tools we use that go far beyond life and other contgencies. not to mention chaos and complexity theory.</dd>
<dd>i will get back to this later in the afternoon. i am trying to fix one of my disfunctional computers. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephbrophy_bede.html" title="User:Josephbrophy">joe</a> 16:30, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hear your point about the change in focus and skill sets. I am a recently credentialed actuary, and I do not have your longer-term view. (To be honest, you were credentialed before I was born, so that sort of puts things in persepctive).</p>
<p>As for the breadth, I wholeheartedly agree, but we MUST be careful that everything is verifiable and sourced from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, and that there is no personal opinion, as that violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.</p>
<p>A new article about actuaries and risk is an <i>excellent</i> idea, and if one exists, then it calls for a brief paragraph with a link to the main article.

<p>Wikipedia has been mentioned in the UK edition of "The Actuary" a second time (in a response to the first article". Furthermore, this article is specifically mentioned and it is therefore possible a large number of British actuaries will be visiting this article in the near future. Hopefully, they will also contribute to the article.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, I have found that a few occupational articles mention fictional members of their profession. I've also noted that a number of schools and universities do the same with alumni - see <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_School_of_Economics_2cfc.html" title="London School of Economics">London School of Economics</a> where <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josiah_Bartlet_b4d1.html" title="Josiah Bartlet">Josiah Bartlet</a> is mentioned and <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton</a> has the same for <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a>. Seeing as (unfortunately) the most publicly recognised actuaries are probably fictional, do we think it is worth a mention in some small way in the article?--<a href="../../../z/o/s/User%7EZoso_Jade_9110.html" title="User:Zoso Jade">Zoso Jade</a> 09:17, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Actuarial exam accreditation/organizations in more countries</span></h2>
<p>Would it be worthwile to add other countries to the section titled "Credentialing and exams"? There is the sub-thing "Other countries", it mentions that the website of these organizations is often the easiest source for finding out about membership requirements. even if the other countries' requirements are similar to US/UK should a list of such websites be added?

<dd>The problem is that then that section would overwhelm the article. I created <a href="../../../a/c/t/Category%7EActuarial_associations_8f70.html" title="Category:Actuarial associations">Category:Actuarial associations</a> for that very reason, and I removed much of the data that was in this section to the various association articles such as <a href="../../../f/a/c/Faculty_of_Actuaries_cdb0.html" title="Faculty of Actuaries">Faculty of Actuaries</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casualty_Actuarial_Society_d90b.html" title="Casualty Actuarial Society">Casualty Actuarial Society</a>. My suggestion is to populate the specific society article with the credentialling information, and once that is done, we can see how pertinent it is here.

<dd>Agreed, but I haven't found a decent online script to prove it, so I've left that paragraph. I have removed the Fight Club reference - the narrator is a "recall coordinator" who "applies the formula", not an actuary. Google "fight club script" for evidence. --Actreal 03:30, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
