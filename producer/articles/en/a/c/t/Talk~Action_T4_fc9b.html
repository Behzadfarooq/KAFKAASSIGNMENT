<p>Look at our <a href="../../../e/u/t/Euthanasia.html" title="Euthanasia">Euthanasia</a> article. It is not defined as killing out of compassion. It is confined as killing those "perceived as living an intolerable life". That applies to the the subject here. Therefore the article should be renamed to include the word "euthanasia". Better yet, it should be merged as proposed. Nobody's going to search for "killing of people with disabilities in Nazi Germany", and it is entirely a product of your invention. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyphen5_402f.html" title="User:Hyphen5">Hyphen5</a> 13:42, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Nazis did not kill these people because they "perceived [them] as living an intolerable life." They killed them to eliminate "inferior" people from the German Volk, and to save the state the expense of caring for them. Read the article before making such remarks. The whole article is a "citation for the contention that these were not "mercy" killings." This must be one of the most heavily referenced articles at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 15:46, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, Nazi ideology considered Jews' lives "intolerable" to society. Are you denying this? Euthanasia is not a positive word (it is a <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html" title="Euphemism">euphemism</a>), so I don't understand why you are intent on disassociating it from this program. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyphen5_402f.html" title="User:Hyphen5">Hyphen5</a> 18:49, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The recent edits by 155.143.255.195 were in fact by me - I didn't realise I had been logged out. The article is now much expanded and better referenced, and thus even more educational for those in need of instruction. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 16:08, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the program was among others justified as mercy killings which is even the title of one of <a href="../../../g/i/t/Gitta_Sereny_b63c.html" title="Gitta Sereny">Gitta Sereny</a>'s book so that is a similarity with Euthanasia. (I read her book on <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Stangl_ef5f.html" title="Franz Stangl">Franz Stangl</a>). I do not think that this justification was sincere for higher ranking officals involved in the program by the way (a major difference with Euthanasia), but it may be have been sincere for people like middle and lower ranking officals such as Stangl. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 22:13, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of course the program was justified to the German public as being one of euthanasia, and the article notes that. It is also true that many of the people who carried out the program rationalised it to themselves as being euthansia. But the fact is that it was <i>not</i> a euthanasia program, it was a program conducted for both racist-eugenicist reasons and economic reasons. These people were not killed out of concern for their suffering - many of them were not suffering - but to remove them as genetically inferior from the "German Volk" and to save the state the cost of caring for them. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 03:22, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Most of the sources I have seen say he had <a href="../../../c/l/u/Club_foot.html" title="Club foot">club foot</a>, and club foot is a congenital condition. If his condition wasn't congenital it shouldn't be described as club foot. I don't have a Goebbels biography to check - the world needs a new scholarly Goebbels biography to replace Irving's book, which can no longer be cited. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:45, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>this translation seems missleading to me:</p>
<p>"60,000 Reichsmarks is what this person suffering from hereditary defects costs the community during his lifetime. Fellow German, that is your money, too. Read 'New People', the monthly magazine of the Bureau for Race Politics of the NSDAP."</p>
<p>Nazis do not think, "those persons" are suffering at all. They do not even think, "those persons" are persons. "Community" is a term, which does not exist in German. They have two kinds of "Volk": one is a racist term ("Blut und Boden" - meaning: no black people are Germans even if there are German black people), the other corresponds to "people" in the tradition of the French Revolution (egalite, fraternite, citizen ...). "Volksgenosse" means: comrade in "German race" - this has no equivalent in English.</p>
<p>More correct translation is sth. like:</p>
<p>"60,000 Reichsmarks is what this hereditary invalid costs the <i>Volksgemeinschaft</i> during his lifetime. German comrade, that is your money, too. Read 'New <i>Volk</i> ', the monthly magazine of the Bureau for Race Politics of the NSDAP."</p>

<p>In this last paragraph of the "Background" section:</p>
<ul>
<li>"It may be noted that racial hygienist ideas were far from unique to the Nazi movement, although Hitler expressed them in an extreme form. The ideas of social Darwinism were widespread in all western countries in the early 20th century, and the eugenics movement had many followers among educated people, being particularly strong in the United States. The idea of sterilising those carrying hereditary defects or exhibiting what was thought to be hereditary anti-social behaviour was widely accepted, and was put into law in the United States, Sweden, Switzerland and other countries. Between 1935 and 1975, for example, 63,000 people were sterilised on eugenicist grounds in Sweden.[9]"</li>
</ul>
<p>It mentions "social darwinism"...my understanding is that social darwinism refers to "survival of the fitist" in regards to socio-economic factors, but eugenics was based on biological factors, i.e. artificial selection. How does social darwinism fit in the context it is used in here and should it be changed to simply darwinism with a mention of artificial selection? <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbstractClass_1561.html" title="User:AbstractClass">AbstractClass</a> 13:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I had removed "social" from "social Darwinism" (after waiting 24 hours for a response to this) and squiddy reverted it saying "social Darwinism more relevant in this context than Darwinism"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd like to know the argument behind this. Eugenics is about genetic makeup of a population and uses artificial selection which is all included in Darwin's work. How is social Darwinism more relevant? I disagree and if I'm wrong I think there must be something I'm not understanding about social darwinism? <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbstractClass_1561.html" title="User:AbstractClass">AbstractClass</a> 01:34, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I didn't read the talk page before changing <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwinism.html" title="Darwinism">Darwinism</a> back to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_darwinism.html" title="Social darwinism">Social darwinism</a>. The reason I did is that social Darwinism was a widely influential <i>extension</i> of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, specifically applying it to human society. It contained several cultural assumptions which are not present in Darwin's theory:
<ul>
<li>That 'races' (understood circa 1900 as Englishmen, Frenchmen, Italians, as well as Africans and Chinese) were in evolutionary competition (which reflected imperialist ambitions very closely, which were thus given a 'scientific' justification.)</li>
<li>That there was a strong hereditary element to 'undesirable' social attributes of people, especially criminality, insanity and sexual deviance, and 'good stock' was 'tainted' by mixing with 'poor stock'. The fear of evolution going into reverse was widespread at the time (see <a href="../../../d/e/g/Degeneration.html" title="Degeneration">Degeneration</a>). This was prompted by the fear in the educated/middle-class types who made up the eugenics movement of the masses of urban poor, a class created in great numbers in the nineteenth century.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Eugenics was therefore not a biological science (although it was often seen as such in its heyday), but was a social/political movement with a (pseudo)science basis. I think that 'social darwinism' reflects this more accurately.
