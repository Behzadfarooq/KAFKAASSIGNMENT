	    <p>Jan Ryan Cantin was born in the year 1987 on the day October 15th. Jackie Cantin gave birth in their small backyard, before an assembly of woodland creatures. Jan took 7 steps, chewed off his own umbilical cord, and passed out. Robert Cantin was worried about their small, fragile son, but his worries were pacified as the young Jan stirred, and passed gas.</p>
<p>Some scholars believe that Cantin as a youngster, was directly or indirectly responsible for a number of incidents, resulting in at least 4 deaths. These were mentioned in the press as the "magic marker deaths", alluding to the messages written in magic marker on the corpses. Jackie and Robert Cantin feverishly deny that their son could have comitted any of the atrocities, as he was locked in the closet at the time. One of the messages recorded was "I am Jan Cantin and I killed this person, and then wrote this message on them in magic marker so you would know that it's me."</p>
<p>Hiding behind the Young Offenders Act of Canada, a 7 year old Jan was exhiled to Germany. There his reading tended towards Military and Art History, and he briefly visited Vienna and cited this as a shaping experience. He learned to play the violin. His parents visas expired, and so they returned to Canada, hoping it had all blown over.</p>
<p>At age 10, Jan decided his artistic and literary pursuits were a waste of time. Deciding that art and literature are tools of the bourgeoisie, he sought to forget them. Sitting down resolutely, he vowed he would not rise until he had forgotten everything he knew. He promptly forgot it all, including how to speak English, and how to defecate. His rehabilitation moved quickly, however, taking only 3 months.</p>
<p>The next 6 months were spent writing a novel he called “Life of Pi”. Under the pen name Yann Martel.</p>
<p>Jan was involved in a tragic 6 car pileup. 4 of the cars exploded violently. The entire mess of blood, burning metal, and glass, fell 100 feet into a river in the middle of January. Jan rescued his parents and swam to shore. He uttered his first obscenity. He was 11 years old.</p>
<p>When asked about his scarring encounter with Big foot at age 12, Jan comments “Holy Shit his feet are huge!” Thought the details surrounding the encounter are still foggy, some Janaeic Scholars speculate he wrestled the beast to the ground, and in a drunken stupor peed on its face. This may or may not be responsible for the beast’s subsequent fear of mankind. Jan believes “He had it coming.”</p>
<p>Jan has been spotted in 124 countries worldwide, including one session of the United Nations, where he alleged that Norway was crowding him, and called Zimbabwe “a dick.” He has been banned from an overwhelming number of these countries. He spent 2 nights in an Iranian prison, before being politely asked to leave. Jan has, to some extent, damaged relations with the United States of America. The CIA file on Jan is 11345 pages thick, containing 123,456,345 violations of domestic and International law. Public urination is the most frequent, followed by treason. He has been linked to atrocities in several countries, although there is little evidence to convict him. When asked to comment he is known to mumble self-importantly, omitting infrequent obscenities clearly. 14 major faiths have condemned he and his actions as “Indecent, and an affront to God.” Jan, in response, has said “GodfuckJesusChristdamnAllahbitchBuddhabumfuckingZoroastrianjizzyJainfuckerRastahellHindumotherbitchingVoodooJews…and don’t even get me started on Secular Christianity.”</p>
<p>Jan has also been linked to a mysterious figure, who is defending your country. When asked about his link to “Action Jan” Jan has roundhouse kicked the tape recorder, punched the reporter in the throat, and said “THERE’S NO SUCH THING MUTHAFUCKA”.</p>
<p>Some Janaein scholars maintain that Jan sightings have increased in Fredericton, New Brunswick, particularly on the Campus of St. Thomas University. He was sighted drawing dinosaurs amongst art students very recently. Osama Bin Laden has been quoted as saying “He’s planning something…I can tell.” CSIS has offered an undisclosed monetary reward for information concerning his whereabouts, and plans. CSIS also published a statement in 2004 stating “Anyone affiliated with that bastard will be punished to the full extent of the law.”</p>
<p>Artist sketches of Jan, according to witnesses describe a “devilishly handsome man, 7 feet tall, crew cut, heavily built, of Native American heritage, with a tattoo saying “JAN bitches”, and a penetrating stare.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2006, Jan became part of an underground movement known as "J.A.B." This highly secretive group was responcible for much of the urban terrorism that occured during that summer. They were often seen in their characteristic yellow collered shirts at parties in and around the Moncton area carrying their favorite weapons: Sharpie Markers, Vice-Grips and booze.</p>
