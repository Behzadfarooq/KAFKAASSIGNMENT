<p><i>Whereas the Parliament of England, after the expense of much blood and treasure for suppression of the horrid rebellion in Ireland, have by the good hand of God upon their undertakings, brought that affair to such an issue, as that a total reducement and settlement of that nation may, with God's blessing, be speedily effected...</i></p>

<p>Ten<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_1_back"><a href="#fn_1" title="">1</a></sup></span> named leaders of the Royalist forces in Ireland, together with anyone<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_2_back"><a href="#fn_2" title="">2</a></sup></span> who had participated in the Irish Rebellion’s early stages and who had killed an Englishman other than in battle, lost their lives and estates. The Act made a distinction between the rebels of 1641—who were deemed <a href="../../../u/n/l/Unlawful_combatant.html" title="Unlawful combatant">unlawful combatants</a>—as against those who had fought in the regular armies of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_Ireland_a37b.html" title="Confederate Ireland">Confederate Ireland</a>, who were treated as legitimate combatants provided that they had surrendered before the end of 1652. The 1641 rebels and the above mentioned Royalist leaders were not included in the pardon given to soldiers who had surrendered: they were to be executed when captured. <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> clergy were also excluded from the pardon, as the Cromwellians held them responable by fomenting the <a href="../../../1/6/4/1641_Rebellion_3ffb.html" title="1641 Rebellion">1641 Rebellion</a>. Their lives were also forfeit if captured.</p>
<p>The remaining leaders of the Irish army lost two-thirds of their estates. To have been merely a bystander was itself a crime and anyone who had resided in Ireland any time from October 1, 1649, to March 1, 1650 and had not “manifested their constant good affection to the interest of the Commonwealth of England” lost one-third of their land. The Commissioners in Ireland had power to give them, in lieu thereof, other (poorer) lands in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connacht.html" title="Connacht">Connacht</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Clare_1390.html" title="County Clare">Clare</a> in proportion of value and were authorised “to transplant such persons from the respective places of their usual habitation or residence, into such other places within that nation, as shall be judged most consistent with public safety.” This they interpreted liberally and ordered all Irish land owners to leave for those lands before <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">1 May</a>, 1654 or be executed. (Hence the expression, <i>“To Hell or to Connaught”</i>). Protestant Royalists, on the other hand, could avoid land confiscations if they had surrendered by May 1650 and had paid fines to the Parliamentarian government.</p>

<p>In the next of the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantations_of_Ireland_c62a.html" title="Plantations of Ireland">Plantations of Ireland</a>, the confiscated land was granted to the “Adventurers” who had joined the conquering army. (The “settlement” refers to settling of scores, not to settlers. The new owners were known as “planters.”) The Adventurers were financiers who had loaned the Parliament money during the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_52ce.html" title="Wars of the Three Kingdoms">Wars of the Three Kingdoms</a>. Many of Ireland’s pre-war Protestant inhabitants also took advantage of the confiscation of Catholic-owned land to increase their own holdings. In addition, smaller grants of land were given to 12,000 veterans of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Model_Army_f4c0.html" title="New Model Army">New Model Army</a> who had served in Ireland.</p>
