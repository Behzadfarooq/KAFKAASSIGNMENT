<p>Who put in that several students found answers to the ACT on a p2p network? A statement of that magnitutde definately needs a source being cited along with it. Unless someone can find out where that info came from, I think it should be removed --Ichiroska</p>

<p>The official title of the ACT is the "ACT Assessment". It may be noted that a google search on "ACT Examination" within ACT.com or ACTStudent.com turns up only 3 results, while "ACT Assessment" turns up 644. A search of the whole Internet shows this article as the first result out of 37,000 for "ACT Examination". Comparatively, ACT.org is the top result out of 222,000 for "ACT Assessment".</p>
<p>BTW, does anyone have anything solid that suggests that the test was ever called "American College Test"? <a href="http://www.act.org/aboutact/history.html" class="external text" title="http://www.act.org/aboutact/history.html" rel="nofollow">ACT</a> says that the company <i>itself</i> used to be called The American College Testing Program, Inc., but doesn't mention other names for the assessment itself. This information does sound verifiable, but would somebody please provide a source to confirm it? --Jack 17:51, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The official name of the test was quietly changed from "ACT Assessment" to "The ACT" sometime in the last year or so. It was never called "The American College Test." --Zoofroot 05:16, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>American College Testing (the company that administers the ACT Assessment) has no article on WikiPedia.com. ACT actually administers more than one Assessment-- while the ACT Assessment, of course, is by far the most popular. For practical purposes, ACT is the common name of the assessment, but also refers to the company itself. --Jack 18:01, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The SAT focuses on deception and tricks to fool students? This may be true, but I'm pretty sure it's not NPOV. Furthermore, can we say for sure that the ability to spot tricks is not a good (or acceptable) measure of intelligence or ability or whatever college entrance exams are supposed to test nowadays?</p>

<p>I am currently in the process of revamping this article and any suggestions would be helpful. --TAOW</p>
<p>Minor statistical inconsistency, but the article states anything above and including a 31 is the in 99th percentile, whereas when I got a 31 in late 2005, it was the 98th percentile.</p>
<p>The cumulative percentages given on score reports are based on the most recent three full academic years of scores, while the ones in the national press release are based on the most recent graduating class and only count the highest score for each student that tested more than once. Both ranks change yearly. --Zoofroot 05:33, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Note that the analogies will be removed from the SAT in March. The reference here should probably be changed soon.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The SAT does try to trick students, but this isn't a secret and stating such shouldn't violate NPOV for the reason mentioned above: the ability to identify a "trap" is an acceptable measure of academic aptitude. On both Math and Verbal sections, as the question number increases the questions not only become more difficult but "tricky" because obstensibly obvious (but wrong) answers are given as choices. Additionally, on the Math section, the wrong answers are chosen by assuming common mistakes, wheras the ACT is more likely to randomly generate incorrect answers. In this way the SAT's mode of deception is patterned and thus is more fact than opinion. Of course, this is an article on the ACT. And while we're on the subject, the SAT long favored students with highly developed verbal skills because of the vocab necessary for a high score. The ACT, because it had trig, favored strong math students. The new versions of each tests have moderated these advantages (ie, removal of analogies on SAT and inclusion of higher level math problems), but they still exist. Jordan</p>

<p>My friend told me he aquired information from Kazaa on the ACT. He got the answers and ended up with a 30 on the ACT with no help.</p>
<p>-I dont' think this is really probable. There are about 20 different test booklets, all different questions, of the same ACT test. When you take it, you are required to fill in a circle on your answer sheet saying which booklet you tested from. To guarantee a high score on the ACT by cheating, you'd have to match the answers you found with the booklet you're given, which is memorizing a little under 300 ABCDE sequences. To entirely ENSURE that you could do this no matter what booklet you are given, you would have to memorize thousands of ABCDE sequences. If you have the memory to do that, you don't need to download answers from the internet.</p>

<p>"The ACT (unlike the SAT) does not take points off for wrong answers..." It could be my "old timers" disease setting in, but my recollection of the ACT policy on guessing answers is just the opposite of this statement; you are/(were) penalized for guessing answers on the ACT and not so on the SAT. I remember distinctly NOT guessing answers on problems that I could not solve on the ACT and I ended up being one of those fortunate few in 1975? who scored a perfect 36. One of my peers who was actually a better student than I did guess at an answer (that ended up being incorrect) and scored a 35. (Yes, we were both exceptional mathematics students). Maybe there was a change at some time, but I remember this quite distinctly.</p>
<p>Tony</p>
<p>I don't know how things were back in the day, but this is how it has been for at least the last decade: On the ACT, an incorrect answer is treated the same as one you leave blank. On the SAT, if a correct answer is worth 1 point and a blank answer is worth 0, then an incorrect answer is worth -.25.</p>
<p>The ACT changed significantly in 1989; for example, the score ranges for each subtest and maybe the composite were different. --Zoofroot 05:39, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just did some recent changes, hopefully they're for the better. I added a percentiles chart, and altered the format section. This: <a href="http://www.act.org/news/data/06/pdf/National2006.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.act.org/news/data/06/pdf/National2006.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.act.org/news/data/06/pdf/National2006.pdf</a> is an absolutely excellent source of raw data directly from ACT itself. I suggest you reference that source before changing any data, of course data can be skewed to do some 'amazing' things, so I did not want to delve to deeply and do any reinterpretation and create data overload. <a href="../../../h/u/e/User%7EHuerndy_1398.html" title="User:Huerndy">Huerndy</a> 19:10, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article sates that there is no "official" conversion method for the two tests, but i was able to find one from the College Board: <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/ra/sat/satACT_concordance.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/ra/sat/satACT_concordance.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/ra/sat/satACT_concordance.pdf</a>.</p>
