<p>Acton is located at <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/geo/geohack.php?params=42_29_N_71_27_W_" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/geo/geohack.php?params=42_29_N_71_27_W_" rel="nofollow"><span title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for 42°29′N 71°27′W">42°29′N, 71°27′W</span></a></span>. According to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Census_Bureau_2c85.html" title="United States Census Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, the town has a total area of 20.3 square miles (52.5 km²), of which 20.0 square miles (51.7 km²) is land and 0.3 square miles (0.8 km²), or 1.53 percent, is water. Most of the land may be described as rocky hills. Almost all of Acton is forested, except for where it has been cleared for residential or agricultural use.</p>
<p>The current geography of Acton was created when the last wave of <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glacier.html" title="Glacier">glaciers</a> retreated approximately ten thousand years ago. Acton has nine <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drumlin.html" title="Drumlin">drumlins</a> - hills which are composed of glacial till. In addition, Wills Hole and Grassy Pond are <a href="../../../k/e/t/Kettle_%28landform%29.html" title="Kettle (landform)">kettle</a> ponds which were formed in depressions in the till formed by large blocks of ice.</p>
<p>Acton has two primary stream systems: the Nashoba Brook system including the incoming streams Butter Brook, Will's Hole Brook and Conant Brook and the Fort Pond Brook system including the incoming streams Guggins Brook, Inch Brook, Grassy Pond Brook, Pratt's Brook and Coles Brook. Both stream systems empty into the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assabet_River_517d.html" title="Assabet River">Assabet River</a>. Acton borders on Nagog Pond in the north, and there is a small artificial pond at Nara Park in North Acton.</p>

<p>While Acton Center has been the civic center of the town since the revolution, the four other villages centers earned there nomenclature from the names of their corresponding railroad station. A description of each center is below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Acton Center is the civic center of the town and is the site of the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_hall.html" title="Town hall">town hall</a>, the main <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_library.html" title="Public library">public library</a>, a children's <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playground.html" title="Playground">playground</a>, an <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obelisk.html" title="Obelisk">obelisk</a> monument commemorating Acton deaths in "<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord_977e.html" title="Battles of Lexington and Concord">the Concord Fight</a>" of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolutionary_War_48ec.html" title="American Revolutionary War">Revolutionary War</a>, a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregational_church.html" title="Congregational church">Congregational church</a>, a 64-acre <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arboretum.html" title="Arboretum">arboretum</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservation_area.html" title="Conservation area">conservation area</a>, and the former <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_office.html" title="Post office">post office</a>. The modern post office and the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_station.html" title="Police station">police station</a> are each located about one-half mile away in opposite directions along Main Street. Otherwise, Acton Center is generally a residential area.</li>
<li>West Acton is an important commercial area of town. It developed in response to the growth of the Fitchburg <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railroad.html" title="Railroad">railroad</a> in the 19th century. West Acton has also served as the shopping area for the nearby town of <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxborough%2C_Massachusetts_e53f.html" title="Boxborough, Massachusetts">Boxborough</a>.</li>
<li>South Acton is the most <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industry.html" title="Industry">industrial</a> area of town. In the eighteenth century this area held many mills and other small industrial developments that used <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydropower.html" title="Hydropower">water power</a> generated by Fort Pond Brook, which includes the Faulkner Homestead which is the oldest home still standing in <strong class="selflink">Acton</strong>. The Faulkner Homestead was owned by the Faulkner family who owned and runned a mill across the street which is also still standing today and is still utilized in the fashion of selling grain and feed.</li>
<li>East Acton was a small commercial area that grew around the East Acton train station in the 19th century. However, with the advent of the automobile and the demise of this branch of the railroad, East Acton became a residential area with a small commercial base that focuses largely on the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commuting.html" title="Commuting">commuter</a> traffic on Route 2A.</li>
<li>North Acton has had major growth in the past 30 years. In the eighteenth century it held a rsmall store, a school and a church/meetinghouse. A post office was located at the intersection of Ledgerock Way and Main Street, near the old train station, and operated into the middle of the 20th century. With the growth of automobile traffic, these ventures folded and North Acton became primarily a farming area that developed into a residential area in the 20th century. With the growth of the Rte 2A/<a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Route_119_12a3.html" title="Massachusetts Route 119">119</a> corridor, North Acton has developed many commercial complexes and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condominium.html" title="Condominium">condominium</a> buildings. The North Acton Recreation Area (also called Nara Park) contains a small swimming pond, an open air auditorium, playing fields, and hiking trails.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current Master Plan for the town encourages development in the village centers in an attempt to prevent further <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_sprawl.html" title="Urban sprawl">sprawl</a> and preserve open space in the rest of the town.</p>

<p>During the 19th century, Acton participated in the growing <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. By the mid-1800s, Acton was an industrial center for the production of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrel.html" title="Barrel">barrels</a> (cooperage).

<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Acton%2C_Massachusetts_42ba.html" title="Edit section: Sewers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sewers</span></h5>
<p>Most homes and businesses in Acton (approximately 80%) use private on-site sewage systems (i.e. <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septic_tank.html" title="Septic tank">septic tanks</a>). Higher density developments such as condominiums and apartment buildings (approximately 10% of the town) use private sewers which go to small-scale private treatment plants.</p>
<p>In 2001, Acton completed its first public sewer system, which serves approximately 10% of the town, primarily in South Acton. There are current plans to expand the sewer system and this is generating a lot of controversy in town.</p>
<p>The proponents of expanding the sewer treatment cite several advantages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sewers will provide relief for homeowners whose septic systems cannot meet current Title 5 requirements because of the distance from the ground to the underground water table.</li>
<li>Sewers will provide better treatment for sewage than can be provided in septic tanks and thus help protect the town water system which is based on underground aquifers.</li>
<li>Sewers will allow businesses to expand in village centers and thus improve the economic situation for the town as well as providing additional local shopping and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The opponents of expanding the sewer treatment cite several concerns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sewers tend to lead to higher density development. If this happens in residential areas, the population could increase which causes pressure on town services and expenses.</li>
<li>Sewers concentrate pollutants which are currently distributed across a wider geographic area. While a sewer system treats organic pollutants, it does not remove some non-organic pollutants such as medicines, etc. If the sewage system discharge occurs near the town water supply, the water supply system could be compromised in ways that are not immediately apparent.</li>
<li>Sewers concentrate the waste water from a large geographic area. This means that there will be less re-charging of the aquifer in the town as a whole which could impact the town's water supply.</li>

<p>At the beginning of the century, each village in Acton had its own grade school, but the town struggled with how to provide a high school education for its students. For most of the early twentieth century (until 1925), Acton students were sent to Concord's high school.</p>
<p>In 1953, new schools were constructed to accommodate the growth in the student population. In 1957, Acton and <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxborough%2C_Massachusetts_e53f.html" title="Boxborough, Massachusetts">Boxborough</a> created a regional school district for grades 7 - 12. The Merriam School was constructed in 1958. Other schools quickly followed (Douglas (1966), Gates (1968), and Conant (1971)). In 1967 a building was constructed for the Junior High. In 1973 a huge addition was added to this building and it became the high school (the junior high moved to the old high school building).</p>

<p><b>The Acton Public School District</b> consists of five elementary schools and the Acton Public School Pre-school. Acton has an unusual method of assigning students to elementary schools, called "School Choice". Incoming Kindergarten parents participate in a lottery based selection process where the parents "choice" the school by listing the preferences in ranked order.</p>
<p>This method of school choice has a large impact on the nature of the town. Acton is less oriented around neighborhoods than towns which have neighborhood based schools. Other child-oriented activities such as town sport teams are also not organized around the school system. As a result, students and families are likely to have social connections which are independent of the neighborhood in which they live.</p>
<p>While the curriculum in the district is fairly standardized, each of the elementary schools has a different teaching philosophy. The schools and their philosophy of education are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://conant.ab.mec.edu/" class="external text" title="http://conant.ab.mec.edu/" rel="nofollow">Conant School</a>. Named for Luther Conant who taught for 17 years in the school district, served on the School Committee and was Town Moderator for 40 years. The school emphasizes the <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whole_language.html" title="Whole language">Whole language</a> approach when teaching students to read. The Conant School has an <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_as_a_Second_Language_989a.html" title="English as a Second Language">English as a Second Language</a> (ESL) program.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://douglas.ab.mec.edu/" class="external text" title="http://douglas.ab.mec.edu/" rel="nofollow">Douglas School</a>. Named for Carolyn T. Douglas who was a teacher in the Acton schools from 1940 to 1967. The school emphasizes <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonics.html" title="Phonics">Phonics</a> as a system for learning to read. The Douglas School has an ESL program (English as a Second Language).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://gates.ab.mec.edu/" class="external text" title="http://gates.ab.mec.edu/" rel="nofollow">Gates School</a>. Named for Paul P. Gates who was the school physician from 1948 to 1968. The school emphasizes Phonics as a system for learning to read.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mct.ab.mec.edu/" class="external text" title="http://mct.ab.mec.edu/" rel="nofollow">McCarthy-Towne School</a>. Named for Julia McCarthy who taught at the South Acton School from 1906 to 1952 and Marion Towne who was a teacher in the primary and secondary schools in Acton from 1921 to 1959. McCarthy-Towne integrates art instruction into all areas of the curriculum. McCarthy-Towne offers a project-based curriculum and makes extensive use of teacher's aides in the classroom.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://merriam.ab.mec.edu/" class="external text" title="http://merriam.ab.mec.edu/" rel="nofollow">Merriam School</a>. Named for Florence A. Merriam who taught for 35 years in Acton.

<p>Acton has two public <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">libraries</a>: the Acton Memorial Library and the West Acton Citizens' Library.</p>
<p>The Acton Memorial Library was given to the town of Acton by William Allan Wilde as a memorial to its <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> veterans in 1890. The building was expanded in 1967, and a second major expansion was completed in 1999.</p>
<p>The Citizens' Library, one of the oldest buildings on Windsor Avenue, was most likely built in the 1840s by Phineas Wetherbee, who by 1856 resided there and lived at that address until his death in 1894.</p>
<p>There are also libraries in each of the elementary schools, the Junior High, and the High School.</p>
