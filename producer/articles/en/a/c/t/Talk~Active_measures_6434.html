<li>Good job. Only I have two questions about the title.
<ul>
<li>First, is it a commonly accepted term in the West?</li>
<li>Second, is the term applied only to the USSR? `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 02:42, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to be rather well accepted. See for example book by Cristopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, page 292. They call it "political warfare". "Active measures" are also widely used in other books about KGB. The expression indeed came from "Soviet phraseology". <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 04:19, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Absolute nonsense. Are Vasiliy Mitrokhin and Christopher Andrew (his book cowriter) represent the whole Western Civilisation on that issue?.

<p>My point here is very simple. I am not doing any original research or promote my own opinion. I only cite sources (as we all suppose to do), and these sources or people are very good experts and prominent enough, since they are described in Wikipedia. Any alternative views are very welcome, if supported by similar sources, but one should not simply delete the text supported by references. If an Internet link is dead, please mark this as <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> and wait for a few days until I can repair the reference.

<p>You modified my text: Active Measures (Russian: "Активные мероприятия") are a form of political warfare conducted by the Soviet intelligence services (Cheka, OGPU, NKVD, KGB, GRU, FSB, and SVR) <b>allegedly</b> to influence a course of world events.</p>
<p>But this is not a claim or accusation. This is <b>definition</b>: what is the "active measures"? So, you misled the reader. Of course these "measures" tremendously influenced the course of word events (all historians agree). That was a success of KGB. I must revert this. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 05:30, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Clean-up is really needed. Beside articles missing (<i>the</i> FSB, etc.), the article confuses everything, mixing operations in the 1920s with Chechnya&#160;! I know that there are continuities from the Tsarist Russia to modern Russia, passing by the USSR, but that's not a reason to jump from the 1920s to the 2000s and back to the 1960s... Beside, as Vlad Fedorov notes immediately above, Ion Macepa is famous for being unreliable. So, when he claims that he heard Ceaucescu, another trustworthful source, to have said that Moscow had planned to... this is enough to suscite some questions. Although there are clearly no doubts that Moscow has engaged in such operations, as well as Washington and all intelligence agencies, over-simplification on the pretexts of ideological struggle is like shooting oneself in the foot. Beside, I am most intrigued about this "reference": <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yossef_Bodansky_f308.html" title="Yossef Bodansky">Yossef Bodansky</a> <i>The Secret History of the Iraq War</i> (Notes: The historical record).

<dd>This part of Bodansky book (Notes: The historical record) describes active measures by KGB. I think you are right, and this part of Bodansky book must be explained better and more prominently in this article. As about history, this is exactly the point: the tactics ("active measures") are very similar over the time. <b>Please provide at least one example when Ion Macepa claimed anyting obviously wrong</b> (supported by reliable sources). Only then one can claim that "Ion Macepa is famous for being unreliable".

<dd>Claims by him that USSR has nurtured and sponsored virtually all terrorists in the world. Unevidenced citations of KGB and USSR political leaders by Macepa, who was just a Romanian (periphery) bureaucrat, and wasn't a member of a general task force. He claims he had an access to all KGB information which render him as a clown at once. Nobody, nobody could say that he knows everything about KGB, CIA, FBI, MI5 and so on. It is just stupid.

Let's go slowly: do we agree that we need to chronologically divide this article, and that it has no sense starting in the 1920s, then jumping to the 2000s, then going back to the 1950s, to finally end back in the 2000s? Shouldn't we clearly separate 1920s, Cold War, and FSB period?

<p>I used just a few sources here. There is enormous literature about "active measures", and I can bring it here if necessary.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 15:41, 16 March 2007 (UTC) How about that:</p>
<p>Active measures include white, gray, and black propaganda, as well as disinformation. White propaganda was created by the Information Department of the Communist Party and included those publicly identified Soviet channels as Radio Moscow, Novosti, and pamphlets and magazines as well as official Soviet government statements. Gray propaganda was organized by the International Department of the Communist Party and used such channels as the foreign Communist Parties and the network of international Soviet fronts. Black propaganda was prepared by the KGB and included agents of influence, covert media placements, and until 1959, assassinations. Forgeries and disinformation were used by the Soviets in all modes. The first effective disinformation campaign was during the Korean Conflict. This was a major Soviet disinformation campaign that generated media attention. The Americans were accused of going into Korean villages during the Korean conflict (1950–1953) and shooting villagers, or killing them with biological weapons and chemical warfare. In fact, the Soviets used anthrax in Korea to kill men, women, and children, and then blamed it on the Americans.</p>
<p>An attempt is now underway with the Cold War History Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, DC, to counter this account, especially through the work of Katherine Weathersby who discovered that Soviet documents obtained through a Japanese researcher belied these rumors and accusations. The issue re-surfaced in the book United States and Biological Weapons: Secrets of the Early Cold War and Korea (Indiana University Press, 1999) by Stephen Endicott and Edward Hagerman. Endicott was the son of one of the men who helped to disseminate the disinformation campaign, James Endicott.</p>
<p>On September 9, 1982, President Ronald Reagan designated the United States Information Agency to lead an inter-departmental effort to counter Soviet propaganda and disinformation. For an advisory body, the administration created the Active Measures Working Group in 1981 to bring together the information the various agencies held to counter Soviet disinformation and forgery. It served as a clearinghouse to expose such information and it had permission to use classified documents and any other resources that were required to meet this goal. The Working Group was chaired by the State Department with representatives from State, Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, United States Information Agency, and the Defense and Justice Departments. The Working Group ended in 1991, two years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Let's talk. I have included all texts from our two different versions that are supported by references. Please tell me if any sourced text is missing, or if any particular source is unreliable in your opinion. Then, let's discuss the matter and decide. If the source is indeed unreliable according to official Wikipedia criteria, we will exclude the corresponding segment of text. But we can not simply delete large segments of text supported by references without any preliminary discussion. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 01:46, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, I have included all referenced texts (also the fragment about Mitrokhin comission which I think is redundant) - to find a compromise. But you do not want to discuss anything and simply continue deleting all referenced texts, claiming that authors are "clowns" (in your opinion), etc. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 15:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am new to this dispute but I will have to go with Vlad, I mean how serious are you by using conspiracy theories to justify everything. Moscow Theatre seige was carried out by Movsar Barayev and was broadcast LIVE. How the hell could FSB have prepared it? Biophys your personal views on Russia and FSB are irrelevant and gross violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> 16:44, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hello, Kuban Cossack. Thank you for coming here! This is fine if you disagree with a certain version of Moscow Theatre seige events. But <i>you just have deleted A LOT of text and references about other events</i>. So, I suggest the followig. Let's start from the complete text with all references. Then you tell here which exactly references you think are unreliable (for example, the reference to Litvinenko), and we discuss this first, and then delete if necessary the corresponding segment of text. I guess, you actually do not like that I cited ONLY references like Litvinenko. Then you are very welcome to bring any other additional references that say the opposite. So, we can do this in a "pro" and "contra" arguments style, rather than deleting perfectly appropriate references that someone simply do not like. I respect your opinion. Let's just discuss what exactly you do not like and correct, in accordance to Wikipedia policies. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 21:43, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You just said: "Undid revision 117540337 by Biophys (talk)bullshit conspiracy theories of Radio Free Europe and Stomakhin are not credible sources)" But these sources were about Moscow metro bombing, not about Moscow hostage theater crisis. I have checked these sources once again and can agree with you that the source with Stomakhin's article is indeed unreliable, and that <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Free_Europe_8fc2.html" title="Radio Free Europe">Radio Free Europe</a> article, although a reliable source, actually does not claim that Moscow <i>metro</i> bombing was organized by FSB. So, let's remove this. As about other sources in the same paragraph, they appear to be good. So, it would be appropriate just to cite an opposite point of view about Moscow theater crisis. You are welcome to do it.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 22:04, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
