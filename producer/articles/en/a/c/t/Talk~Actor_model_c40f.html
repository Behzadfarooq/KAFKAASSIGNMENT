<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Talk%7EActor_model_c40f.html" title="Edit section: General Discussion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">General Discussion</span></h2>
<p>This is the discussion page for the Wikipedia article <b>Actor model</b>.</p>
<p>Although in some sense the Actor model is conceptually very simple, it is also highly technical. There were mistakes made in its development. Unfortunately, as shown in the discussion below, it is still quite possible for those who are not versed in its intricacies to make serious errors.</p>
<p>So it is suggested that changes to this article first be proposed in this discussion page rather than just editing the article. Of course typos, spelling, grammar, <i>etc.</i> should just be corrected as usual.--Carl Hewitt 09:13, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Talk%7EActor_model_c40f.html" title="Edit section: Interaction with Koffieyahoo">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Interaction with <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a></span></h2>
<p>I believe there are a number of problems with the page as it is now:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is biased towards the Actor model being <i>a good thing</i>?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Where in the article does it say that the Actor model is a "good thing"?</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>While reading the article I get the distinct impression that comparisions are trying to show that the actor model is best. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 06:43 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For what purpose do you think that the article argues that the Actor model is best?--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 16:24 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Because it is the <i>best</i> your answer will certainly be. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 17:54 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>A definition of the actor model is actually lacking from the article</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The article states: "Actors are the universal primitives of concurrent digital computation. In response to a message that it receives, an Actor can make local decisions, create more Actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received."--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 16:10 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That statement is incomplete, it omits the notions or terms of script, list of acquaintances and that messages are themselves actors. --Blissex</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There should be a clear and informal description first and only a abstract definition later. The article should be readable for people with only little knowledge on the subject. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 06:43 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Good point. It would be good to have a new article "Actor model formalism".--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 16:10 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It is unclear for me in which of the references actually deals the Actor model</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Some discussion needs to be added to relate a couple of the references.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>More than this, is my impression. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 06:43 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps there should be a new article "Theories of concurrency".--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 16:31 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now this is a <i>very</i> good point, as this would allow the move of a stuff you are trying to add all the concurrency pages to one page. However, I would name it <i>Models of concurrency</i>. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 17:54 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that "models" is probably better.--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 18:30 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Atm the page only compares the model with other models, although this should be part of this page it should not be 99% of the page</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The page discusses many issues in addition to comparing with other models.</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hence, the page should be structured better. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 06:43 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Please clarify how this <i>model was inspired by the laws of physics</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The laws of physics were definitely an inspiration for the Actor model; see for example the laws for Actor systems and Clinger's dissertation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'll repeat the <i>missing</i> link to the <a href="http://www.erights.org/history/actors.html" class="external text" title="http://www.erights.org/history/actors.html" rel="nofollow">laws of locality</a> by Carl Hewitt (the real one) that shows that they don't look at all like physical laws, except in the parody of calling them <i>laws</i>. --Blissex</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That is not enough, please give some hints in the article, or omit is altogether. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 06:43 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article also talks about indeterminacy in physics. What areas would you like to see expanded?--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 16:24 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>How does the actor model relate to agent systems?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Agent systems tend to have a psychological basis as in the <a href="../../../b/d/i/BDI_Software_Agents_6f3a.html" title="BDI Software Agents">Belief Desire Intention</a> model. Actors tend more to a anthropological, sociological, organizational, and philosophy of science basis as in the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_Community_Metaphor_f3e5.html" title="Scientific Community Metaphor">Scientific Community Metaphor</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is just one view of agents. In another view agents are just pieces of code to can move from machine to machine and that can <i>activate</i> other pieces of code. 6 July 2005 06:43 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I added <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent.html" title="Agent">Agent</a> to the See Also section.--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 16:32 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You're not answering the question. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 13:59, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I have just fixed (Blissex, 050705) some of the most glaring problems with this page, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding a good if brief and informal definition of Actor system;</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The new definition needs to made a further specification of the original definition.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>removed the utterly misleading link to SOAP, which is just an RPC mechanism;</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If you read the SOAP reference, you will discover that it specifies a general message passing communication mechanism, not just RPC.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No SOAP is just an RPC mechanism based on HTTP and XML. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 06:43 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You might be interested in reading some of the literature on SOAP including the specification in the reference to which you are objecting. SOAP is explicitly <i>not</i> restricted to using HTTP as a transport.--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 16:24 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But it is still an RPC mechanism based on XML, so I don't see your point. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 17:54 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>SOAP includes one-way messages and other non RPC capabilities.--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 18:09 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can do one way messages with any RPC mechanism, so I don't see your point. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 18:16 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I reckon that this CarlHewitt impersonator is trying to argue that <i>any</i> form of message sending or concurrency is in effect the Actor model (and viceversa). --Blissex</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>added the reasons why Actor model systems and languages have not become popular;</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It is important to distinguish between the abstract <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">Actor model</a> mathematical theory and various uses and implementations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please separate these two things then, but deal with them both. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 06:43 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It would be good to have a new article "Actor model implementations".--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 16:24 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't believe that something like that can be something more than a list of external links. So, no. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 17:54 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually there is a lot to say on this subject.--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 18:09 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And now we have finally reached the core of the problem: wikipedia is not a discussion forum, it's a encyclopedia. If there is discussion on some topic you can, no, you must, say something about that, but it should not dominate the articles. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 18:16 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually what there is to say is that a lot of work has been published on the subject (and not by me!) which could usefully contribute to an encyclopedia article.--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 18:30 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>removed the utterly misleading reference to the laws of physics and put in the more correct notion that it was based on a metaphor of a <a href="#blOverviewMIT" title="">society of independent but cooperating <i>persons</i></a>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The laws of physics were definitely an inspiration; see for example the laws for Actor systems and Clinger's dissertation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are many other fixes that remain to do in the rest of of the page, like the pointless mentions of Java or C# which are not even remotely related.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are currently two common use cases for the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">Actor model</a>: <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_Services_50d4.html" title="Web Services">Web Services</a> and concurrent programming languages like Java and C#.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is one of the most glaring absurdities I have read in a long time: how do you square that Actor systems have only local state and support fine grained parallelism with Java and C# having <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_implementation.html#No_global_state_in_the_Actor_model" title="Actor model implementation">global state</a> and heavyweight threads? Never mind that Java and C# are primarily based on function calls, not message sending, for computation, and that when they send each other data that cannot be an Actor, which is required by the Actor model. --Blissex</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It can also be argued that Web services form just a message passing system, so your claim should be substantiated. <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 6 July 2005 06:46 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And not every message passing system is an Actor system. --Blissex</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I also suspect that the <b>CarlHewitt</b> that has been been doing some edits is a case of <i>mistaken identity</i>&#160;:-).</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Just whose identity do you suppose is mistaken?</b> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarlHewitt_d5ad.html" title="User talk:CarlHewitt">User talk:CarlHewitt</a> = <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Hewitt_103a.html" title="Carl Hewitt">Carl Hewitt</a>!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, some of the text seems to me poorly written and contains some absurdities and irrelevancies (never mind the lack of use of fundamental terms like <i>acquaintance</i> or <i>script</i> or <i>society</i>) and that makes me suspect that the real <i>Carl Hewitt</i> is not even an acquaintance&#160;:-).</dd>
<dd>Some online Actor pages that present a rather different view of Actors than the one presented in <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">this page</a>:
<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://sail.stanford.edu/pub/MT/93actors.ps.Z" class="external text" title="ftp://sail.stanford.edu/pub/MT/93actors.ps.Z" rel="nofollow">history of Actors to 1993</a></li>

<p>Thanks for your comments. There is not doubt that the text could stand improvement! It is true that the history in this article, like all histories, is somewhat of an idealization.</p>
<dl>
<dd>To me it looks like a betrayal and an attempt to belittle an important if little known part of the research on computational systems. Linking the Actor model with SOAP, Java, and C# (instead of ACT-1 for example) just invites ridicule, if only because of the glaring contradiction with the <i>no global state</i> principle of the Actor model. --Blissex</dd>
</dl>
<p>It only covers the essential points that have stood the test of time. In this respect it is akin to the history of the early days of quantum theory. Many twists, turns, and false starts are omitted. But maybe this is as it should be in a brief encyclopedia article.--CarlHewitt 2005 July 6 02:49 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do you mean that <i>no global state</i> and fine grained concurrency and asynchronous message/actor sending have not stood the test of time and that therefore any IPC tranport, like SOAP, and any programming language with IPC and concurrency, even Java or C#, are based on your new millennium's Actor model?</dd>
<dd>And if so, what's the point? The Actor model as described in the works of Hewitt, Lieberman, Baker, and all the others, was a really interesting and distinctive branch of research for which widespread adoption may yet come. But yet another theory of IPC and concurrency that covers banalities like SOAP, Java or C# looks much less valuable to me, that's why I say <i>a betrayal and an attempt to belittle</i>. --Blissex</dd>

<p>AFAICS, the actor model is not a process calculus because a calculus in this sense is a single language (with syntax and intended semantics), whereas the actor model is a computational model that is defined axiomatically (by the actor laws). Any language that satisfies those laws is an actor language; which programming constructs it supports is a secondary issue. Each process calculus, on the other hand, is primarily defined by the constructs that it supports. DavidHopwood 01:51, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Incidentally, actors is even closer to the <a href="../../../j/o/i/Join_calculus.html" title="Join calculus">Join calculus</a>, which is essentially a reinvention of it -- except that the join calculus is also a language rather than an axiomatically defined computation model.

<p>I've just been looking over your edits, and I'm pretty sure you are the distinguished researcher I thought you might be: a big welcome to Wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess that's ill-founded, as several of things written in the Actor model pages are utterly ridiculous (e.g. Java systems being Actor systems), there have been glaring omissions (e.g. even the terms <i>acquaintance</i> and <i>script</i>) and the real Carl Hewitt (I hope) would know better, never mind the crank-style references to quantum physics.</dd>
<dd>I have tried to add some of the missing bits and fix the most obvious absurdities, but all my changes were reverted willy-nilly. So I re-added some of them under <b>Alternative view</b>.
<dl>
<dd>My impression is that most of what CarlHewitt writes is a poor assemblage of half digested cut-and-paste jobs, which might indicate an undergraduate or postgrad doing some dissertation and having a laugh.</dd>
<dd>The other possibility is that the real Carl Hewitt is retroactively trying to redefine much of his research in order to claim after-the-fact victory (because unfortunately much of his research as originally defined has had zero impact on the so called <i>real world</i>, which has gone down a rather worse path), and he should not get away with it.
<dl>
<dd>Another possibility is that this is the work of BarbaraLiskov under a CarlHewitt persona, as an ironical joke, as a case can be made that almost all concurrent languages today, and in particular Java and C#, are (regrettably perhaps) fairly similar to <a href="../../../c/l/u/CLU_programming_language_4390.html" title="CLU programming language">CLU</a> and its underlying model of concurrency, while having essentially no relationship to the Actor model.

<p>(I'd fix this myself, but it seems to be under heavy edit). The article capitalises lots of terms which should be lower case.

<dd>Thanks for a proper argument (first one?&#160;:-&gt;). I can see your preference has a point; but I prefer, like I see in most/many papers, to capitalize <i>Actor model</i> because it is proper name, but to leave <i>actor</i> lower case, because in the context of a discussion on the Actor model it is clear it is a context dependent term-of-art and thus understood to mean something else than a live/screen performer.

<p>The article currently states lambda calculus is state based.</p>

<dd><i>The first models of computation (e.g.. Turing machines, Post productions, the lambda calculus, etc.) were based on mathematics and made use of a global state to represent a computational step.

<p>This, I think, is incorrect under normal interpretations.

One significant fact about the Church-Turing thesis is precisely that equal computational power is obtained by a stateful model (e.g. Turing machines) and stateless ones (e.g. lambda calculus).--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 19:59, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There was no point in requoting the whole paragraph, as CSTAR had already a long quote at the start. As to the emphasis on <i>step</i>, do you really think that <i>both</i> the Turing and the lambda models have computational steps involving a global state? That could be an interesting discovery...&#160;:-) I suspect that there might be <i>some</i> approximate sense in what you say if <i>global state</i> really means <i>simultaneous evaluation/reduction</i> for the lambda calculus, and that would be a property of the evaluator, more than of the model of computation. --Blissex.</dd>

<dd>A computational step in the lambda calculus is an application of a lambda reduction rule. It's thus possible to "think" of the lambda calculus as a labelled transition system wher the labels are lambda terms and transitions are reduction rules.

<dd>This shows <b>very clearly</b> that the Actor model design is based foremostly on a society of cooperating agents metaphor, rather than physics, the canonical use of terminology like <i>script</i> and <i>acquaintance</i>, that the definition of Actor I have given is much closer to the original than the other; I also note that the CarlHewitt persona has omitted any mention of PLASMA, which instead would be very familiar indeed to the real Carl Hewitt.</dd>
<dd>I also found together with that paper a 1979 printout I made of the 1972 SAIL MicroPlanner documentation (I think I still have the sources somewhere), of which I have scanned in pages <a href="http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/xart/D/sailPLNRDocs-01.jpg" class="external text" title="http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/xart/D/sailPLNRDocs-01.jpg" rel="nofollow">01</a> and <a href="http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/xart/D/sailPLNRDocs-02.jpg" class="external text" title="http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/xart/D/sailPLNRDocs-02.jpg" rel="nofollow">02</a>; perhaps to reinforce the point that maybe unlike some other people I have had and I have familiarty with original documents on or related to the Actor model (MicroPlanner is not quite an Actor language).

<dd>Two notes: in these pages the word <i>actor</i> is always lower case, and in the ancestry of PLASMA (page 28), SIMULA is credited with ideas on modularity, but message passing is credited to Alan Kay (strangely, because message passing was already at the time already known as a term to network people; but then Alan Kay's message passing had a twist). --Blissex</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>1.2. The Actor Model of Computation<br />
In this subsection we discuss the principles underlying the actor model of computation, compare it to other models, and illustrate programming in our actor language. See [1] for more discussion of the actor model, and for many examples of programming using them.<br />
<br />
1.2.1. The Actor Philosophy<br />
The early work on Actors [12, 13, 14, 3, 4, 5, 16, 17] proposed some fundamental principles:<br />
* Every object is an actor; this includes messages and numbers.<br />
* No actor can be operated on, looked at, taken apart or modified in anyway except by sending a message to that actor requesting it perform the operation itself.<br />
* The only thing that happens in an actor system is an event, which consists of an actor receiving a message.<br />
* An actor can send many messages at the same time but can only receive them one at a time. In other words the arrival order is linear; while the structure of events is only partially ordered by the notion of one event preceding another.<br />
* Actors have a set of acquaintances, other actors it knows about and can send messages to. This set can increase in time since the actor may create new acquaintances, and it may also hear about them in messages it receives. These are the only ways the set of acquaintances can increase.<br />
<br />
The key features of actor based computation, that have evolved from these guiding principles are:<br />
* Message passing is fundamental.<br />
* Mail delivery is guaranteed, i.e. fairness.<br />
* There is arrival-order non-determinism in message delivery.<br />
* Actors are history sensitive shared objects.<br />
* Resource allocation and interconnection topology are dynamic.</p>

<dd>An <i>actor</i> is defined as an entity that has an <i>identity</i>, a list of the identities of some other actors that are its <i>acquaintances</i>, and a <i>script</i> that is executed to examine each (free form) message received from any acquaintance, and that can create a replacement for itself with a new list of acquantainces and/or send messages to the acquaintances. Messages are themselves actors, just as everything else in the Actor model is an actor.</dd>
<dd>Since the state of an actor is its list of acquantainces and that is unmodifiable and actors execute their scripts independently, the Actor model implies potentially very high degree of very fine grain concurrent execution, as the only serialization constraint is the wait for the arrival of an incoming message, and there is <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_implementation.html#No_global_state_in_the_Actor_model" title="Actor model implementation">no global state</a>, as the <a href="http://www.erights.org/history/actors.html" class="external text" title="http://www.erights.org/history/actors.html" rel="nofollow">laws of locality</a> describe.</dd>

<hr />
<dl>
<dt>Alternative view</dt>
<dd>Java and C# have nothing to do with the Actor model, because they have <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_implementation.html#No_global_state_in_the_Actor_model" title="Actor model implementation">global state</a> and their computational model is based on procedure calls and heavy weight threads, not asynchronous message copying and fine grained concurrency. SOAP is just an IPC mechanism based on HTTP and XML and while it can be used to send messages then just about any IPC mechanism can, and this does not make them all Actor model implementations (or <i>use cases</i> whatever that means here).</dd>
<dd>Conversely, the description of <a href="http://agents.www.media.mit.edu/people/lieber/Lieberary/OOP/Act-1/Concurrent-OOP-in-Act-1.html" class="external text" title="http://agents.www.media.mit.edu/people/lieber/Lieberary/OOP/Act-1/Concurrent-OOP-in-Act-1.html" rel="nofollow">ACT-1</a> gives an example of a language that is authentically inspired by the Actor model, and <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?SalsaLanguage" class="external text" title="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?SalsaLanguage" rel="nofollow">SALSA</a> is a derivative of Java with Actor model inspired extensions.</dd>

<hr />
<p>While the Actor model has been very influential in research on concurrent systems and its formalization (arguably the CSP model is inspire by it), there are currently no Actor model based languages or systems in widespread use, in part because fine grained highly concurrent computations do not map well onto most current computers.</p>
<p>This model of computation maps well onto fine grained massively parallel, <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Uniform_Memory_Access_8e3f.html" title="Non-Uniform Memory Access">NUMA</a> or distributed computer systems, because there is no global state, and maximum concurrency is allowed in the message passing patterns thanks to the <a href="http://www.erights.org/history/actors.html" class="external text" title="http://www.erights.org/history/actors.html" rel="nofollow">laws of locality</a>. The Actor model may be regarded as at the opposite end of the spectrum from the <a href="../../../t/u/p/TupleSpaces_0af4.html" title="TupleSpaces">Tuple spaces</a> model of computation used in the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_%28coordination_language%29.html" title="Linda (coordination language)">Linda</a> programming language.</p>
<p>The motivation for the Actor model was in part as a formal model, and in part arising from <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Hewitt_103a.html" title="Carl Hewitt">Carl Hewitt</a>'s vision that a possible evolutionary path of computer systems was as chips and boxes containing very large numbers of simple general purpose processors.</p>
<p>Therefore part of the research on Actor model implementation involved for example concept like greedy, speculative execution (<i>future</i>s), and the consequent need for <a href="http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/Futures.html" class="external text" title="http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/Futures.html" rel="nofollow">garbage collection of processes</a>.</p>
<p>However, so far the dominant evolutionary path of computer systems has been towards even more complex and faster single processor systems for which the more conventional procedural model of computation is more suitable.</p>
<p>But on the 40th anniversary of the publication of <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moore%27s_Law_4f26.html" title="Moore's Law">Moore's Law</a>, hardware development is starting to hit limits with the single processor system model, and is going towards both local and nonlocal massive <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm" rel="nofollow">concurrency</a>.</p>
<p>[ ... ]</p>
<p>All of the above developments favor the Actor model, or at least systems that might be considered inspired by it such as massively parallel cluster systems using message passing libraries like <a href="http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/" class="external text" title="http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/" rel="nofollow">PVM</a> or <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/" class="external text" title="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/" rel="nofollow">MPI</a>, which might be considered to be societies of actors engaged in actor computations, with some important limitations with respect to the full Actor model and at a much coarser level of granularity.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some of the same concepts are expressed in <a href="https://www.cypherpunks.to/erights/history/actors/AITR-633.pdf" class="external text" title="https://www.cypherpunks.to/erights/history/actors/AITR-633.pdf" rel="nofollow">Clinger's thesis</a> on page 24:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The actor model is perhaps best motivated by the prospect of highly parallel computing machines consisting of dozens, hundreds or even thousands of independent monoprocessors, each with its own memory and communications processor, communicating vias a high performance communications network in a system much like the computer networks now coming in widespread use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>also a little below on the same page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primitive objects of the simplified model are events and actors. The actors represent computational agents. In the idealization suggested above, an actor may be though of as a program that has been given its own very processor on which to run. An event represents the arrival of a message at a target actor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and of course this tallies very well with the attitude in the paper on <a href="http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/Futures.html" class="external text" title="http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/Futures.html" rel="nofollow">garbage collection of processes</a>.</p>

<hr />
<dl>
<dt>Alternative view</dt>
<dd>SIMULA has no message passing whatsoever. If you think otherwise, try to find a single SIMULA language primitive that allows sending or receiving messages. There are some event queing facilities in the discrete simulation libraries written in SIMULA, but these have been there in every simulation library, and do not even conceptually amount to message passing.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>The virtual methods in <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simula.html" title="Simula">Simula</a> are generally considered to implement a message passing metaphor and were the inspiration for message passing in <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smalltalk.html" title="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>.--Carl Hewitt 01:30, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But that does not allow sending or receiving of messages, because calling <a href="http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~rjp/bookhtml/chap18.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~rjp/bookhtml/chap18.html" rel="nofollow"><i>virtual:</i> procedures/labels/switches</a> has nothing to do with sending or receiving.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps it may be <i>generally considered</i> (still <b>I-say-so</b>, but in this this I agree that many make this mistake) so by ignoramuses that haven't figured out yet that they are just <a href="#blVirtual" title="">semi-dynamically dispatched function calls</a> (or control transfers), just like in C++, Ada, CLOS, Java, and C#, and by those unaware that there is not one language called <i>Smalltalk</i>, but a series of languages, of which the first few had very different semantics from the latter few: while the first were based on something quite different from a dynamically dispatched function call paradigm, but on another one that indeed inspired the Actor's model message passing, Smalltalk-76 and later languages reverted back to conventional dynamically dispatched function calls. Consider <a href="http://www.sabi.co.uk/xart/D/habGuardians-28.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.sabi.co.uk/xart/D/habGuardians-28.jpg" rel="nofollow">this scan pf page 28</a> of (the real) Carl Hewitt's paper on Actor model guardians, in which he (correctly) credits SIMULA for modularity but Alan Kay for message passing.</dd>

<dd>In more detail, as to <span id=".23blVirtual"><b>virtual:</b> in SIMULA</span>, Dahl, one of the very authors of SIMULA in his <a href="http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~olejohan/birth-of-oo.pdf" class="external text" title="http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~olejohan/birth-of-oo.pdf" rel="nofollow">2001 paper on the birth of OO</a>, an original source, not a <b>I-say-so</b>, states clarly and unambiguously that it is about a semi-dynamic procedure call/dispatch mechanism:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>It is fair to say that Simula 67 invites to bottom up program design, especially through the possibility of separate compilation of classes. As a last minute extension, however, we introduced a top down oriented mechanism through a concept of "virtual procedures".<br />
In general attribute identifiers may be redeclared in subclasses, as is the case of inner blocks. The identity of an attribute is determined by the prefix level of the accessing occurrence, or, if the access is remote, by the class qualifying the object reference in question. In this way any ambiguity of identifier binding is resolved textually, i.e at compile time; we call it static binding.<br />
On the other hand, if a procedure P is specified as virtual in a class C the binding scheme is semi-dynamic. Any call for P occurring in C or in any subclass of C will bind to that declaration of P which occurs at the innermost prefix level of the actual object containing such a declaration (and similarly for remote accesses). Thus, the body of the procedure P may, at the prefix level of C , be postponed to occur in any subclass of C . It may even be replaced by more appropriate ones in further subclasses.<br />
This binding scheme is dynamic in the sense that it depends on the class membership of the actual object. But there is nevertheless a degree of compiler control; the access can be implemented as indirect through a table produced by the compiler for C and for each of its subclasses.</p>

<dd>In more detail as to the evolution of the semantics of the <i>Smalltalk-xx</i> languages, some more scans from the original documents. In <i>Smalltalk-80: Bits of History, Words of Advice</i>, an original source (not a <b>I-say-so</b>), it is fairly clear (<a href="http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/xart/D/st80BOHWOA-011.jpg" class="external text" title="http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/xart/D/st80BOHWOA-011.jpg" rel="nofollow">page 11</a>, <a href="http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/xart/D/st80BOHWOA-012.jpg" class="external text" title="http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/xart/D/st80BOHWOA-012.jpg" rel="nofollow">page 12</a>, <a href="http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/xart/D/st80BOHWOA-013.jpg" class="external text" title="http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/xart/D/st80BOHWOA-013.jpg" rel="nofollow">page 13</a>) that the original Smalltalk-72 semantics and syntax were based on a token stream model, which is what inspired (the real) Carl Hewitt to base the Actor model on entities with scripts to examine and react to a stream of incoming <i>messages</i> (themselves actors of course). Note also the somewhat similar role of the <i>eye</i> operator in Smalltalk-72 and <i>=&gt;</i> in PLASMA.</dd>
<dd>But in later versions of <i>Smalltalk-xx</i> both the syntax and the semantics were switched back to be the same as dynamically dispatched procedure calls (for the reason given in those pages, which I would paraphrase as <i>excessive locality</i>); this is clearly (but belatedly) stated in <a href="http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/xart/D/st80TLAII-575.jpg" class="external text" title="http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/xart/D/st80TLAII-575.jpg" rel="nofollow">page 575</a> scanned from <i>Smalltalk-80: The Language and its Implementation</i>, but unfortunately the <i>message passing</i> stream terminology was retained in the main, engendering endless confusion in the naive (and regrettably sometimes even in those that should know better) that don't know that early <i>Smalltalk-xx</i> languages were based on a rather different and less conventional semantics than more recent (and popular) ones.</dd>

Strachey at about the same time of <b>Baker Hewitt</b> gave lectures which were later written up as an MIT Press book, where continuity does play a role (and again continuity of application).

<p>Hi again, Carl, I put links to the articles <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_physics.html" title="Quantum physics">quantum physics</a> in the see also section. Would this be an acceptable compromise to you? After reading the article again, I have to say I still don't see the connection. Perhaps in future you can elaborate a bit on exactly what you think the connection is.

<dd>The new category Relativistic Information Science stinks. The clock timing issues have nothing to do with relativity! Computers cycles are not controlled with atomic clocks!!! Instead the internal clock rates for computers differ due to mechanical differences between the clocks due to differences in manufacture, environment and treatment of the equipment. At the least I challenge you to produce for me a study that shows that the internal clocks of computers run slower only on the lower floors of the same building and do so by an amount of 1 part in 10<sup>16</sup> per meter of elevation as called for by general relativity. I can tell you right now that there are a lot of physicists who would love to know about it if you can. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 15:07, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Based on the discussions above, and also at <a href="../../../a/c/t/Talk%7EActor_model_history_9562.html" title="Talk:Actor model history">Talk:Actor model history</a>, I am forced to conclude that Carl Hewitt is either an imposter, or that the content of this article is some sort of pernicious pseudo-science. I am thus sticking POV and accuracy labels on this article, and classifying it as pseudoscience. I am not sure how to proceed. We need to determine if this is the real Carl Hewitt or not, and we need to talk to MIT to find out what is going on here. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 20:50, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Linas - I too must question your actions. I think that it is the job of the computer science editors to police this page, not the physics editors. I must express concerns that you are making the same kind of mistake that Carl Hewitt was making: sticking yourself into a place where your views don't belong.</dd>
<dd>I will not contest the statement that Carl's views of GR and QM are pseudoscience. However, I would not paint the whole of his work as that. As best I can tell, he is a competent computer scientist and his work being tolerated here seems to speak of his being known and at least somewhat respected in the computer science community. To me, Carl's fault is a lack of perspective resulting in his overrating the applicatibility of his work. (That speaks very much of his being the real Carl Hewitt BTW.) As I mentioned on Chris's GTR Project page, our goal should be to get Carl out of our hair. Getting ourselves this deeply into his hair very much works against that goal.</dd>
<dd>At this time, I am reverting the page back to Chris' last edit, thereby removing questionable material added by both you and by Carl. I must also ask you to please stop questioning this user's credentials and competence. It is not good <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_3717.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette">wikiquette</a> to begin with. Only if you have solid evidence of fraud or maliciousness should you be making allegations such as yours above. Also, NPOV and accuracy tags should be slapped on only if you have knowledge of the subject sufficient to state a proper justification for them. The fact that Carl is ignorant of GR does not justify the global tag. Perhaps a sectional accuracy tag would work, but I fail to see a good case for that either.</dd>
<dd>Please remember that the issue is whether this work belongs in the GR category. We are competent to judge that. However, I do not see us as competent to judge much else about Carl's work. Please recognize and respect that.

<dd>I also have doubts about some assertions Carl has made in this article <i>other</i> than the specific claims we are all objecting to (the ones mentioning relativistic physics and quantum physics), but I don't much care about the others, at least not right now. Provided Carl moves the suspect claims to his user pages, I would not be inclined to recategorize this article as pseudoscience. Linas, would you be willing to remove that category? We are making limited progress by negotiating with Carl, but I do see some signs that he might eventually listen to reason (see his acknowledgement of my suggestion about links <i>out of</i> his articles in a "see also" section, and I still hope to resolve this by taking the moral high ground and reasoning with him.</dd>

(IMO, Linas' edits bordered on vandalism. The accuracy tag is one thing, but to replace all of the categories with "psudoscience" because he did not like Carl's responses is more than a little overboard.) For this article my reversion also removed the categories that we are trying to delete from this page, but that I because I just could not bring myself to re-insert them. Carl is free to do so if he desires. I just felt that the current page was the last "good" edit, after which there were only items that others had objected to and either were removed or which needed removing. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 04:04, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

So what I propose to do is to restore the parts that are uncontroversial and move the parts that are controversial to the talk page with an appropriately named section for each one where they can be debated. If there are further passages that become controversial, then we can move them to the talk page rather than just deleting them which leads to chaos and revert wars. It would also be good to add passages that might be controversial first to the talk page. But it is not always possible to predict what will become controversial. Also given the chaos that we face now, I may not get this perfectly right the first time. But at least I have expressed the intent of what I am trying to do.

I advise looking at the history to see why I fell back as far as I did. For example, referencing the conflict between GR and QM is not germane to the actor model, as another editor noted. (Note: To see the article history first click on the "article" tab above and then the "history" tab.

I expect the two questioned categories will be deleted soon; as long as Carl doesn't attempt to recreate those or similarly misleading categories, I have no objection to the current categorization of <i>this</i> article (which doesn't include the VfD'd categories).</dd>

<dd>Carl, I would just add that you shouldn't draw the wrong lesson from this experience. The lesson you should draw is that you should be <i>more</i> cautious, not <i>less</i> cautious, about making strong claims than you might be in a published paper arguing for your views. This is an <i>encyclopedia</i>, not a research journal, so author/editors need to be more conservative in their claims than they might be on their web pages or even in their papers. I think the principle role of technical articles here is to orient readers in NPOV fashion by describing the most important, influential, and best understood concepts in each field, plus <i>widely discussed</i> controversies, conjectures, and speculations, explaining how these fit together into the big picture, and helping scholarly readers locate more information, by providing citations to review articles and writing sufficiently detailed articles that interested readers can note search terms for use in the <a href="../../../a/r/x/ArXiv_671d.html" title="ArXiv">arXiv</a> and similar resources.</dd>

<p>Some readers have asked why Actor is capitalized. The answer is that in some computer systems (especially animation) that we have to deal with two kinds of "actors": the characters (called actors) and the concurrent entities that pass messages around to implement the characters (called Actors). Capitalizing the latter helps to disambiguate them.--Carl Hewitt 21:36, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest that we follow Clinger and Agha, regardless of this possible ambiguity. It is also closer to the WP style guide for capitalization.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 21:39, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry. The article was in an inconsistent state with just a couple of instances at the very beginning capitalized.--Carl Hewitt 22:01, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I still maintain that it should not be capitalized. Besides the WP style guideline, I have given two authoritative <i>published</i> sources in which <i>actor</i> is not capitalized. Can you do likewise? Referring to your sayso is not a valid justification, although a refereed publication or a technical report at a university or company (written by you) would be justification.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 02:38, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I am capitalizing it in my publications, <i>e.g</i>, see the abstract <a href="../../../c/a/r/Talk%7ECarl_Hewitt_a04d.html#Semantics_for_Autonomy_and_Interdependence_in_Agents" title="Talk:Carl Hewitt">Talk:Carl_Hewitt#Semantics_for_Autonomy_and_Interdependence_in_Agents</a> which is submitted for publication.--Carl Hewitt 14:23, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

It is particularly irksome that you refer to "some outsider" (presumably me). Though your article reference is not what I had asked (it's just another page on WP), it will do.

<p>This article seems very unfocused to me. In addition to discussing the Actor model, it contains digressions on control structures, Smalltalk, Planner, Simula, unbounded nondeterminism. All of this makes the article very hard to follow (especially for someone trying to obtain a quick understanding of what the Actor model is). I understand that a lot of this material is here to provide context, but it seems like in many cases the information is a duplicate of information available elsewhere in the Wikipedia. It might be better to condense this contextual information into a sentence or two identifying the basic relationship between the Actor model and the concept in question, along with an appropriate wikilink. I will be happy to undertake these edits if there are no objections. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> 01:36, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that the <i>issues</i> are important. It's all of the extraneous background (such as the detailed discussion of the history of message-passing in Smalltalk) that I'm concerned about. As I said, it makes the article seem very unfocused. I'd suggest creating a single section entitled “Key issues in the development of Actors” (or something along those lines) and collecting all of the issues there in precis form (this is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not a textbook). Providing external links to published literature that contains more detailed accounts of these issues would probably make sense as well.</dd>

<dd>I understand that. I am simply trying to make suggestions that will get <i>this</i> article into a form that (a) provides readers with a basic understanding of what the Actors model is, and (b) provides an <i>overview</i> more detailed material, along with appropriate external or wikilinks. Please understand that I am not trying to minimize the importance of the Actors model in any way. I am simply trying to help make the material on the Actors model more accessible to those not familiar with it. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> 07:40, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have. But I think it would be reasonable to provide a <i>brief</i> overview of the truly major highlights in Actors model development here, and a pointer to <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_early_history.html" title="Actor model early history">Actor model early history</a> for anyone who wants more detail. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> 07:40, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>A <i>brief</i> overview would be great, but as the current article shows there are a number of issues to be covered. Maybe what we need is a new article <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_history.html" title="Actor model history">Actor model history</a> to provide an overview for <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_early_history.html" title="Actor model early history">Actor model early history</a> as well as the not yet written <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_middle_history.html" title="Actor model middle history">Actor model middle history</a> and <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_later_history.html" title="Actor model later history">Actor model later history</a>.--Carl Hewitt 07:50, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article already has a informal description that could be improved. What you seem to be calling for here is a new article on a <i>mathematical</i> operational characterization of the behavior of Actors. I agree that this would be a valuable addition although hopefully it will be done more elegantly than what you have described (of course you undoubtedly meant a more elegant approach and just used "send, become, initadr, newbeh, etc." as a short hand.--Carl Hewitt 06:29, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I'm calling for is a basic description of what an Actor is, and how a system of Actors interacts. Possibly with some simple examples. The existing definition is, in my opinion, vague at best. This article should provide a reader with a basic working understanding of what the Actors model is. And yes, it was shorthand. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> 07:40, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Key issues during development is what the article <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">Actor model</a> is largely about. I do think that it is important to provide historical perspective for key issues during development because it makes the material more understandable and it is necessary for intellectual honesty in attributing scientific credit. For example it really is necessary to discuss the relationship to the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambda_calculus.html" title="Lambda calculus">lambda calculus</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simula.html" title="Simula">Simula</a>, and <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smalltalk.html" title="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>.</dd>
<dd>Some of the material currently in <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">Actor model</a> may be extraneous. But I have found that people disagree as to which parts. I have more own favorite candidate to remove. So I will try taking it out and see if anyone screams;-) What's yours?</dd>

Consider, for example, the page on <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lie_groups.html" title="Lie groups">Lie groups</a>; there is a great deal that can be said about Lie groups and a remarkable wealth of published papers on the subject - the Lie groups article, however, does its best to simply provide a concise but accessible definition and then <i>briefly</i> touch on the major points of interest, farming out most of the material to other pages with more specific information. <a href="../../../l/e/l/User%7ELeland_McInnes_a728.html" title="User:Leland McInnes">Leland McInnes</a> 22:48, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm basing this structure on the way articles such as the one on the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambda_calculus.html" title="Lambda calculus">λ-calculus</a> have been structured.

<dd>It's true that the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambda_calculus.html" title="Lambda calculus">λ-calculus</a> is very much simpler than <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">Actor model</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Process_calculi.html" title="Process calculi">process calculi</a> so that we have our work cut out for us in organizing this material for the Wikipedia.

<p>As it stands, the section on Actor prospects is <i>not</i> referenced at all (aside from a pointer related to many-core processors).

<dd>I think that the rewrite is an improvement, but it still seems speculative to me. Is there any work currently being done on applying the Actors model to solving the scalability and transparency problems that you outline? I agree that it seems probable that Actors would be very helpful in those areas, but it's still speculation without references to work in that area. I'm trying to think of a way to reword things so it's less speculative, so I'll leave that section as it stands for now. But unless we can come up with a better wording, or some references to current work, I think it should eventually be removed. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> 04:08, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alan,</dd>
<dd>Articles are allowed to do analysis of the published literature as to what developments mean. However they are not allowed to be forums for original research. This can be a fine line! So, the current references are to published work that raise the issues. The current article should not claim that Actor model will be helpful in addressing the issues, it should say only that the Actor model must address the issues.</dd>
<dd>In answer to your question: Yes, there is an increasing amount of work being done on applying the Actor model to address the scalability and transparency problems discussed as issues in the article that has been submitted for publication. As soon as it is published, it can be reported in the Wikipedia articles.</dd>

<p>The present reference list seems (to me at least) extremely long. Nor is it obvious that all of these references are actually directly relevant to the article at hand. I would like to suggest that we move all references (except those that are already wikilinked via ref_harvard) to the talk page, and then gradually repopulate the reference list only with those references that can be directly tied to (again via ref_harvard links) specific claims. I'm hopeful that this will help to trim the reference list down to a more manageable length.
