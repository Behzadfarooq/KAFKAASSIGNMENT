<p>The article has been reorganized as a result of the helpful questions, comments and suggestions that everyone has provided.</p>
<p>Note that current controversy seems to be confined to the section <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model%2C_mathematical_logic%2C_and_quantum_physics.html#Actor_model_and_quantum_physics" title="Actor model, mathematical logic, and quantum physics">Actor model, mathematical_logic, and quantum physics#Actor model and quantum physics</a> which is now completely independent of the rest of the article.</p>
<p>So one possible way out of our difficulties would be to delete the section <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model%2C_mathematical_logic%2C_and_quantum_physics.html#Actor_model_and_quantum_physics" title="Actor model, mathematical logic, and quantum physics">Actor model, mathematical_logic, and quantum physics#Actor model and quantum physics</a> and rename the article Actor model and mathematical logic.</p>
<p>If we did this, it would make sense to remove the connections between the Actor model and quantum physics from the other articles as well. Note that we would still have a connection between the Actor model and indeterminacy because the consensus view of experts is that Arbiters are indeterminate in their operation. Also it still leaves the Actor model dependent on physics but not yet reported that it is dependent on quantum physics.</p>
<p>Please provide questions, comments, suggestions, etc. Thanks--Carl Hewitt 10:18, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Once the VfD is settled, if the article is not deleted, you will have to make substantial changes to this article. You may want to ask someone else such <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">User:Chalst</a> for assistance. Some suggested changes</p>
<ul>
<li>The opening sentence has to be replaced. It is too vague.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Hewitt's thesis was that logical deduction was incapable of carrying out concurrent computation in open systems even though there are mathematical theories of concurrency</i>" This requires explanation. Surely you are not trying to claim that in principle the classes are different. You need to be more precise here. What is an "open system"; do you mean "open" in sense of its being entangled with the environment?</li>

<dd>The article states:
<dl>
<dd><i>The Actor model makes use of arbitration for determining which message is next in the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_theory.html#Arrival_orderings" title="Actor model theory">arrival ordering</a> of an Actor that is sent multiple messages concurrently. For example <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbiter_%28electronics%29.html" title="Arbiter (electronics)">Arbiters</a> can be used in the implementation of the arrival ordering of an Actor which can give rise to <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbiter_%28electronics%29.html#Arbiters_give_rise_to_indeterminacy" title="Arbiter (electronics)">physical indeterminacy</a> in the arrival order. Therefore mathematical logic can not implement concurrent computation in open systems because of the impossibility of deducing arrival orderings since they are indeterminate. Note that although mathematical logic cannot implement general concurrency it can implement some special cases of current computation,</i> e.g., <i>sequential computation and some kinds of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_programming.html" title="Parallel programming">parallel</a> computation including the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambda_calculus.html" title="Lambda calculus">lambda calculus</a>.</i></dd>

<dd><i>In concrete terms for Actor systems, typically we cannot observe the details by which the arrival order of messages for an Actor is determined. Attempting to do so affects the results and can even push the indeterminacy elsewhere. e.g., see <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metastability_in_electronics.html" title="Metastability in electronics">metastability in electronics</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbiter_%28electronics%29.html" title="Arbiter (electronics)">arbiters</a>. Instead of observing the internals of arbitration processes of Actor computations, we await outcomes. Physical indeterminacy in arbiters produces indeterminacy in Actors. The reason that we await outcomes is that we have no alternative because of indeterminacy.</i></dd>

<dd>I sort of hate to be on Carl's side of this, but I see little trouble with his referencing physical indeterminacy in this. Certainly the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbiter_%28electronics%29.html" title="Arbiter (electronics)">Arbiters</a> which he is so fond of display it. My gripe comes when Carl makes the illogical leap from the actor model referencing physics to the actor model being physics. If he would not do that, there would be no fight over what is fundamentally a very benign relationship. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 04:55, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>However, some of the claims about the physical basis of the actor model do not appear in either Gul Agha's thesis nor in Clinger's thesis. For instance, the following claim made in <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_theory.html" title="Actor model theory">Actor model theory</a> is as far as I can tell, not in any of the published literature on the actor model (which is not to say that Hewitt may not have made it in an unpublished seminar talk)</dd>

<dd>It's worth observing that there is a well-established argument in modal logic that the frame conditions corresponding to formulae of modal logic are not first-order definable, hence if the domain of mathematical logic is taken to be that of multi-sorted theories in a first-order logic, then there can be a respectable case for graph-theory based theories not be be within mathematical logic. One must be very careful with such claims, they are prone to be misunderstood. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 13:37, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd><i>The Actor model makes use of arbitration for determining which message is next in the arrival ordering of an Actor that is sent multiple messages concurrently.</i></dd>

<p>Is this a quote? If so from which of the two articles? If it is not a quote, then why does it have this special formatting? --<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 04:45, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The issues discussed in the article are related to the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">Actor model</a> because it is based on message arrival orderings. The situation is more ambigous for the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Process_calculi.html" title="Process calculi">process calculi</a> since I don't know of any published work. In order to generalize the title, some references and discussion to back it up will be needed in the article.--Carl Hewitt 06:17, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Lamport's paper is about <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_clock.html" title="Logical clock">Logical clocks</a> and clock synchronization which is a different subject than what is discussed in this article.--Carl Hewitt 18:21, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because you say it's different?

<dd>How about renaming the article "Indeterminacy in computation"?--Carl Hewitt 19:06, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That certainly seems like a more sensible choice. Before changing the name, I would hope other contributors would opine first.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 19:12, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No objection to that name from me.

<dd>"[[Arbiter (electronics)#Arbiters give rise to indeterminacy|<b>physical</b> indeterminacy]]" and "<b>Physical</b> indeterminacy in arbiters produces indeterminacy in Actors." It's not supported by physics. The other <b>physics</b> in the article, whether or not supported by fact, is in the context "The published claim....", so it isn't POV. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 23:33, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As far as I know, that's not POV. I would say it's an unsupported statement (and most likely a false one). Please, let's not confuse POV and falsehood.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 23:36, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS. I misread what you wrote; I think those statements are basically OK. Arbiters do give rise to indeterminacy. other statements about the origin of indeterminacy in arbiters and arbiters being the origin of indeterminacy in distributed systems is what I object to.--23:42, <a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a>8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The title proposed by Hewitt <i>Indeterminacy in computation</i> seems like a good one to me. Unfortunately, only <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> has responded. If no one objects within the next few days, I will go ahead and change it.</p>
<p>The claim that indeterminacy may have physical causes appears to me to be an incontestable (or even trivial fact), so I don't understand <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin's</a> objections. I do object to the emphasis on the actor model, since as I mentioned the relation between physics and computation has been considered by several researchers (including von Neumann, Feynman, David Deutsch, Kitaev, Leslie Lamport etc.. besides Hewitt and some of his students). It may not be trivial to extract a useful article, however from their published work.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 06:18, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The claim that indeterminacy <i>may</i> have physical causes seems incontestable to me -- but <i>this</i> article is not effected by the cause of the indeterminacy. If the article were to be greatly expanded, then the question of whether the indeterminacy is physical, quantum, or just uncertainty as to the design might be relevant. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 00:39, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed, what goes into the article may not be easy to decide.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 01:30, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I just realized that <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indeterminacy_in_concurrent_computation.html" title="Indeterminacy in concurrent computation">Indeterminacy in computation</a> already exists and it's another one of the articles that was at the source of a prior dispute with Hewitt. Given that fact, I propose to merge them. Before doing so I will place a {{merge|Indeterminacy in computation}} banner on this article. --<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 05:25, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>For what it is worth, I think this would improve things and give the reader who might not be that familiar with the topic a broader and more complete picture of the subject. <a href="../../../d/v/8/User%7EDV8_2XL_8587.html" title="User:DV8 2XL">DV8 2XL</a> 11:19, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sorry for taking time in responding: I agree with the proposed merge. Even if the content of the article remains slanted towards CH's work, the article will still be better balanced if it gestures towards the context in the preamble and bibliography. It's worth noting that much of the relevant sources are widely available and fairly well known, so I'm hopeful about some of this editing work getting done. --- 16:49, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
