	    <p>Re: Army Staff Sgt. Christopher R. Webb.</p>
<p>What, doesn't a Bronze Star and dying for your country for anything anymore? He was on the front page of latimes.com and flags were ordered to be flown at half mast by Gov. Schwarzenegger. What exactly disqualifies him from an article? I joined Wikipedia after waiting two day from a block that never should have existed and spent six hours reasearching and writing an article to show his mother and widow. This is not a biased heroic tribute to my BFF, I'm not promoting a stupid band, and there are 342 stubs on army personel so what's wrong with a fleshed out article? It wasn't too long, it wasn't written poorly, and I did everthing I could to make it comform to the appearance of other articles. I have reference links to newspapers and I not really that biased because I didn't even talk to him in the last five years. So can you please give me a good reason not to have his article up?</p>
<pre>
Thanks.

<p>I've removed the speedy deletion tag from the above article. While the subject might not be notable, the article does <i>assert</i> notability in a reasonable way.

<dd>Right-o. So, just for clarity (and I'm not trying to sound like an ass, though this is an ass's favorite argument) - if Joe Fifth Grader writes an article on "Miss Henning", which includes text to the effect of "A quick Google will reveal the importance of her contributions to Dullsville Elementary School", this (clearly non-notable) article is to go through <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, not speedy delete? --Action Jackson IV 23:17, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I re-read what you wrote and see what you're asserting - though to my eyes the article really doesn't mention any notibility beyond a request to Google, which as I stated brings up about 174 hits, most of which are spam in other web forums. --Action Jackson IV 23:19, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Having 16,000 players could be seen by some as notable. I have no idea if that claim is true or not (determining that is for AFD) but it's an <i>assertion</i> of real notability, so I can't speedy it. It's kind of a judgment call, really, left up to the admin that looks at it. The 5th grade teacher article wouldn't present even a remotely convincing assertion of notability, whereas this one <i>might</i> be notable (if true) so I thought it would be best to get input from the rest of the community. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 00:45, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cool. For what it's worth, I'd probably lean toward deleting it (and will probably show up to take a look at the evidence and voice my opinion at AFD).

<dd>Awesome. It was just meant to relate to that one sub-section (Aleksei Ledovsky) - too bad there isn't a section-only template. Anyway, what aroused my suspicion was the generic "conspiracy theory" ring to it - <i>a "High-ranking Czech communist" leaked</i> - in addition to the complete... I don't know, for lack of a better term, "idiocy" in the situation (maybe it's just the way it's described - taking a cockpit big enough for a dog and ripping out half the machinery to stuff a human in there. It would take a pretty heavy dose of naive idealism to imagine anything but disaster resulting from that). Anyway - if you see sources, and this isn't just a case of "things made up in school one day", then I have no problem with it. --Action Jackson IV 04:18, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! Just to say that I enjoyed you edit to the Läther story. I reverted most of it - as you noticed - simply because it was too long and detailed and is therefore better suited for the article of the album. I am happy to see that you did not regard my edit as a negative one. I have personally no strong opinion about the whole issue, so I tried to make an edit that was as objective as possible. Glad that you liked it, and your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Zappa&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=113999229" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Zappa&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=113999229" rel="nofollow">edit</a> is perfect!

<dd>Hiya! I was going to leave a message on your talk page as well - your edit was quite a pleasant surprise. Reading the diff, I was already groaning and preparing myself for a giant editwar - but was nearly dumbstruck with joy when I actually read it. Too bad that a lot of what we know for certain about Zappa comes from sources that the current Wiki-acracy would deem "non-verified" - USENET posts, fan studies, and a lot of connect-the-dotting. The man himself couldn't even accurately date most of his live material, yet if it came down to an editwar you know which side the ArbCom would fall on. Anyway, enough disjointed ramblings - glad you liked my edit as much as I liked yours. --Action Jackson IV 18:46, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He deleted the conversation we were having, but I'm not gonna revert it since he's allowed to do so...then he deleted the part I posted afterwards defending his actions..why? I'm not sure, but that's none of my business. Anyway, read the conversation <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia_talk%7EUser_page_9e3f.html#Blanking_one.27s_own_talk_page" title="Wikipedia talk:User page">here</a>. Mostly the last reply, but you can read that whole thing if you like, it's just the last reply that's most important though. I'm not gonna say it's not frustrating...trust me..I know how frustrating it can be, and I think it <b>should</b> be a policy that you are not allowed to delete warning messages on your own talk page. But, unfortunately, it isn't, so he was/is allowed to do so. I do dis-like when people do that, but it's allowed so I can't do anything about it. <a href="../../../b/s/r/User%7EBsroiaadn_ccbc.html" title="User:Bsroiaadn">Bsroiaadn</a> 05:28, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I noticed you've been doing a lot of CSD tagging lately. First up, you're doing a great job, keep it up. And secondly, the pages really only need one tag (I've seen you tag a few with 2 or 3 different speedy reasons). Thanks again for helping out, happy editing. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelBillington_855e.html" title="User:MichaelBillington">Michael Billington</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelBillington_4525.html" title="User talk:MichaelBillington">talk</a>) 07:36, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do tend to agree that the page will be noticed faster if you give it more than one tag - that's probably why I found them in the first place. Anyway, it is only the visual clutter of multiple speedy templates that I'm worried about, so there's no issue with me if you want to keep doing that. Cheers, and to echo myself again: keep up the quality work, we need more people to help with things like this. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelBillington_855e.html" title="User:MichaelBillington">Michael Billington</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelBillington_4525.html" title="User talk:MichaelBillington">talk</a>) 11:49, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You must, however, make sure that the articles meet the criteria; it's not enough for you to judge that the subject is not notable, the article must make no claim to the significance of its subject. If it makes such a claim and you don't believe it, then an AfD is the correct route. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 12:03, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Uh, yeah. That's a no-brainer. Are you thinking about a specific example? The only article that comes to mind is one whose statement of notability completely failed <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and according to the CSD criteria, would have therefore qualified as a nocontext. --Action Jackson IV 12:12, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When an article is just being started, <i>some</i> leeway should be granted; it wasn't clearly a bad-faith opening, and I'd say that it did enough to warrant holding off on a speedy tag. The way it developed bore that out (maybe I'm depending upon hindsight a little, I don't know). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 14:33, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
