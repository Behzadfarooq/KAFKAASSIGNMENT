<p><b>Action Park</b> was a popular <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterpark.html" title="Waterpark">waterpark</a>/motor themed park open from 1978 to 1996 in <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernon_Township%2C_New_Jersey_fa7f.html" title="Vernon Township, New Jersey">Vernon Township</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, on the property of the former Vernon Valley / Great Gorge <a href="../../../s/k/i/Ski_area.html" title="Ski area">ski area</a>, today <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_Creek_e3ea.html" title="Mountain Creek">Mountain Creek</a>. It featured three separate attraction areas — an <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpine_slide.html" title="Alpine slide">alpine slide</a>; Motoworld, where patrons could operate motorized vehicles on land and water and Waterworld, with many water-based attractions such as <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterslide.html" title="Waterslide">waterslides</a>.</p>
<p>Its popularity went hand in hand with a reputation for poorly-designed, unsafe rides; inattentive, underaged, underpaid and sometimes under-the-influence employees<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park22_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park22" title="">[1]</a></sup>; equally intoxicated and underprepared visitors — and the poor safety record that followed from this <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_storm.html" title="Perfect storm">perfect storm</a> of circumstances. At least six people are known to have died as a result of mishaps on rides at the park, and it was nicknamed "<a href="../../../t/r/a/Traction_%28orthopedics%29.html" title="Traction (orthopedics)">Traction</a> Park",<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park" title="">[2]</a></sup> "Accident Park",<sup id="_ref-Jersey_Ed_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jersey_Ed" title="">[3]</a></sup> "Danger Park" and "Death Park" by doctors at nearby <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospitals</a> due to the number of severely injured parkgoers they treated. While little action was taken by state regulators despite a history of repeat violations, in its later years <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tort.html" title="Tort">personal-injury</a> lawsuits forced the closure of more and more rides and finally the park itself. The new owner of the <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skiing.html" title="Skiing">ski</a> area has reopened the water attractions as <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_Creek_Waterpark_872a.html" title="Mountain Creek Waterpark">Mountain Creek Waterpark</a>, with a vastly increased emphasis on ride safety.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_Park_f076.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Action Park was born in the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> when Great American Recreation (GAR), new owners of the recently combined Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, wanted to do something with the ski area during the off season. They followed the trend of many other ski areas at the time, and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> began offering an alpine slide down the very steep ski trails, then gradually put together Waterworld, one of North America's earliest <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_park.html" title="Water park">water parks</a>, at the base of the slopes.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park20_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park20" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>They started out with two speed <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterslide.html" title="Waterslide">waterslides</a> in the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, and then more waterslides and a small deep-water swimming pool the next year. The early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> saw more slides along with a huge wavepool. Finally, Motoworld was carved out of the swampy areas the ski area owned across <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Route_94_dae2.html" title="New Jersey Route 94">Route 94</a>. Ultimately, the small park consisting of the Alpine Slide and two speed slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides, including 35 motorized self-controlled rides and 40 waterslides.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>GAR promoted its new attraction with <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_commercial.html" title="Television commercial">television commercials</a> in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_metropolitan_area_ab27.html" title="New York metropolitan area">New York metropolitan area</a>, using the memorable <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingle.html" title="Jingle">jingle</a> "The action never stops ... at Action Park!" (later, "There's nothing in the world like Action Park!" in several-part <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmony.html" title="Harmony">harmony</a><sup id="_ref-how_to_find_a_video_of_this_ad_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-how_to_find_a_video_of_this_ad" title="">[5]</a></sup>). The park soon became a popular summertime weekend destination in and of itself, due to the level of control it offered visitors over their experience compared most other amusement parks. Some visitors were not even aware that it was part of a ski area.</p>
<p>Action Park's most successful years were the mid-1980s. Most rides were still open, and the park's later reputation for danger had not yet developed. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, the deaths of two visitors within a week of each other and ensuing permanent closure of one ride took place, but that hardly dampened the flow of crowds.</p>
<p>The park's fortunes began to turn with two deaths in summer <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> and the legal and financial problems that stemmed from the lawsuits. A state investigation of improprieties in the leasing of state land to the resort led to a 110-count <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_jury.html" title="Grand jury">grand jury</a> <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indictment.html" title="Indictment">indictment</a> against the nine related companies that ran the resort and their executives for operating an unauthorized <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insurance.html" title="Insurance">insurance</a> company.<sup id="_ref-NJ_Herald_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NJ_Herald" title="">[6]</a></sup> Many took pretrial intervention to avoid prosecution; head Eugene Mulvihill pled guilty that November to five <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insurance_fraud.html" title="Insurance fraud">insurance fraud</a>-related charges.<sup id="_ref-state_investigation_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-state_investigation" title="">[7]</a></sup> Still, attendance remained high and the park remained profitable at least on paper. The park entertained over a million visitors a year, with as many as 12,000 coming on some of the busiest weekends.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park24_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park24" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Park officials said this made the injury and death rate statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, the director of the <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_room.html" title="Emergency room">emergency room</a> at a nearby hospital said they treated from five to ten victims of park accidents on some of the busiest days, and the park eventually bought the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Township.html" title="Township">township</a> of Vernon extra <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambulance.html" title="Ambulance">ambulances</a> to keep up with the volume.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park24_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park24" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>A few rides were closed and dismantled due to costly settlements and rising insurance premiums in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, and at last the park's attendance began to suffer as the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recession.html" title="Recession">recession</a> early in that decade reduced visitation. GAR was finally forced into <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy_in_the_United_States_dca8.html" title="Bankruptcy in the United States">bankruptcy</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, and Action Park closed at the end of the season as usual on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2.html" title="September 2">September 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>. It was assumed that it would reopen on Memorial Day weekend of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park24_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park24" title="">[8]</a></sup> Due to the problems in getting proper insurance, the park was unable to open at that point. They delayed the opening to mid June, but that date came and went and the opening was announced for the 4th of July weekend. By the end of June, however, it was determined that the park would not be open for the season. Therefore, the last day of operation was on <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_Day_663d.html" title="Labor Day">Labor Day</a> of 1996.</p>

<p>While many of Action Park's attractions were unique, they often had corresponding features that, while they gave patrons more control over their experience than they would have at most other amusement park's rides, made them considerably riskier.</p>
<p><a name="Alpine_slide" id="Alpine_slide"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_Park_f076.html" title="Edit section: Alpine slide">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alpine slide</span></h3>
<p>Action Park's alpine slide descended the mountain roughly below one of the ski area's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairlift.html" title="Chairlift">chairlifts</a>, resulting in much verbal harassment and sometimes <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expectoration.html" title="Expectoration">spitting</a> from passengers going up for their turn, who would often be entertained by the accidents they witnessed while at the same time hoping to avoid similar fates.<sup id="_ref-Gethard_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gethard" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The tracks themselves were made of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concrete.html" title="Concrete">concrete</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fiberglass.html" title="Fiberglass">fiberglass</a>, which led to numerous serious <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrasion.html" title="Abrasion">abrasions</a> on riders who took even mild spills. The tendency of some to ride in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathing_suit.html" title="Bathing suit">bathing suits</a> so they could go on to Waterworld attractions afterwards exacerbated this problem.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sled.html" title="Sled">sleds</a> themselves were a large factor in the injuries. A stick that was supposed to control speed led, in practice, to just two options on the infrequently maintained vehicles: extremely slow, and a speed described by one former employee as "<a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a> awaits."<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park20_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park20" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>This slide led to the first fatality at the park, a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_injury.html" title="Head injury">head injury</a> suffered by an employee (it would later be referred to as the "Death Express"). <a href="../../../h/a/y/Hay_bale.html" title="Hay bale">Hay bales</a> at the curves were meant to cushion the impact of those whose sleds jumped the track (a frequent occurrence), but did not always do so effectively. According to state records, in the years 1984 and 1985 the alpine slide produced 14 <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone_fracture.html" title="Bone fracture">fractures</a> and 26 <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_injury.html" title="Head injury">head injuries</a>.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park_20_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park_20" title="">[10]</a></sup> While park officials regularly asserted its safety, saying that 90-year-old grandmothers could and did ride it, in the early years of the park the slide was responsible for the bulk of the accidents, injuries, lawsuits and state citations for safety violations.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park20_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park20" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Intrawest took over the park and renamed it Mountain Creek in spring 1998, they announced the slide would remain open for one final season. Riders were required to wear <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmet.html" title="Helmet">helmets</a> and <a href="../../../k/n/e/Kneepad.html" title="Kneepad">kneepads</a>. The last day of the slide's operation was <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a> of that year, the day before the park closed for the season, as that year's <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_Day_663d.html" title="Labor Day">Labor Day</a> was rainy and the slide had to be closed.</p>
<p>The tracks were torn out afterwards, but the route can still be seen from the <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gondola_lift.html" title="Gondola lift">gondola</a> that replaced the chairlift.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park20_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park20" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>A <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skateboard.html" title="Skateboard">skateboard</a> park briefly existed, near the ski area's ski school building, but closed due to poor design after a season. Bowls were separated by <a href="../../../p/a/v/Pavement_%28material%29.html" title="Pavement (material)">pavement</a>, which in many cases did not meet the edges smoothly. Former park employee Tom Fergus was quoted in an article in the magazine <i><a href="../../../w/e/i/Weird_NJ_e40a.html" title="Weird NJ">Weird NJ</a></i> to have said that the "skate park was responsible for so many injuries we covered it up with dirt and pretended it never existed."<sup id="_ref-Tom_Fergus_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tom_Fergus" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>The park also had a section called Motorworld. It had powered vehicles and boats on the west side of Route 94. These closed with Action Park in 1996. They have been replaced with a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condominium.html" title="Condominium">condominium</a> housing development. Several types of vehicles were used in this area:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Super Go Karts</b>: <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kart_racing.html" title="Kart racing">The karts</a> were meant to be driven around a small loop <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_track.html" title="Race track">track</a> at a speed of about 20 mph (32 km/h) set by the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_%28device%29.html" title="Governor (device)">governor devices</a> on them. But park employees knew how to circumvent the governors by wedging <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis_ball.html" title="Tennis ball">tennis balls</a> into them, and were known to do so for parkgoers. As a result, an otherwise standard small-engine car ride became a chance to play <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumper_cars.html" title="Bumper cars">bumper cars</a> at 50 mph (80 km/h), and many injuries resulted from <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head-on_collision.html" title="Head-on collision">head-on collisions</a>.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park21-22_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park21-22" title="">[12]</a></sup>

<p>In a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chainlink.html" title="Chainlink">chainlink</a> fence-enclosed area, small tanks could be driven around for a fee for five minutes at a time, with tennis ball cannons that enabled riders to shoot at a <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensor.html" title="Sensor">sensor</a> prominently mounted on each tank. If hit, the tank stopped operating for 15 seconds, while other tankers often took advantage of the delay to pepper the stricken vehicle with more fire.</p>
<p>Visitors on the outside could also join in the fun through less costly cannons mounted on the inside of the fence. When workers had to enter the cage to attend to a stuck or crashed tank, which usually happened several times a day, they were often pelted with tennis balls from every direction despite prohibitions against such behavior that could result in expulsion from the park. It is not known if this resulted in any serious injuries, but it made the tank ride the least popular place to work in the park.</p>

<p>Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but then were surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold.

<li><b>Surf Hill</b>: This ride, common to other water parks at the time, allowed patrons to slide down a water-slick sloped surface on mats into small puddles, until they reached a foam barrier after an upslope at the end. Barriers between lanes were minimal, and people frequently collided with each other on the way down, or at the end. The seventh lane was known as the "back breaker," due to its special kicker two-thirds of the way down intended to allow jumps and splashdowns into a larger puddle.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park_21_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park_21" title="">[13]</a></sup>
<p>Employees at the park used to like eating at a nearby <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snack_bar.html" title="Snack bar">snack bar</a> with a good view of the attraction, since it was almost guaranteed that they could see some serious injuries, lost <a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini.html" title="Bikini">bikini</a> tops, or both.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park_21_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park_21" title="">[13]</a></sup> Mountain Creek kept this attraction open through <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>

<li><b>Super Speed Water Slides</b>: These were two water slides, set slightly apart from the rest of the park, that took advantage of nearly vertical slopes to allow riders to attain higher speeds than usually possible. One started with riders going almost vertically downwards and was covered with screening for the first several feet.
<p>As barriers on the side of the slides were very low, lifeguards reminded every user to remain flat on their back with their arms at the side as they descended since there was no way to ride it otherwise and stay on. The fall from both slides had the potential for very serious injury.</p>
<p>Those who made it to the bottom found their progress arrested by water, which made a large splash, and then a small pool. The speed at which riders met the end resulted in many getting <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedgie.html" title="Wedgie">wedgies</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enema.html" title="Enema">enemas</a> from the experience.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park_21_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park_21" title="">[13]</a></sup> Employees kept <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishnet.html" title="Fishnet">fishnets</a> for scooping out the occasional nugget of <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excrement.html" title="Excrement">excrement</a> or <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampon.html" title="Tampon">tampon</a>.</p>

<li><b>Diving cliffs</b>: The area around Roaring Rapids was (and still is) laid out like a kind of <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grotto.html" title="Grotto">grotto</a>, with many lower-intensity attractions. One was a pair of diving <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliff.html" title="Cliff">cliffs</a> — one 23 feet (7 m), the other 18 feet (5.4 m) — above a 16-foot (5 m) deep pool.
<p>However, the pool below was not blocked off from those who might be swimming in or away from from other attractions, and nothing at water level gave any indication to swimmers that they could expect people to dive in right next to them or right on top of them. The sole lifeguard on duty often had his or her hands full dealing with the results of those collisions.<sup id="_ref-Gethard_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gethard" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also, nonswimmers would jump off the cliffs, not fully appreciating how deep the water below was, and have to be rescued. Former employee Tom Fergus says the bottom of the pool was eventually painted white to make it easier to spot any bodies on the bottom. The large pool into which people jumped is no longer used for regular swimming, only to deposit used tubes.<sup id="_ref-Tom_Fergus_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tom_Fergus" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<li><b>Colorado River Ride</b>: The Colorado River Ride, which still exists, winds its way down a heavily wooded area on the side of the park. It used to feature large, circular <a href="../../../r/a/f/Raft.html" title="Raft">rafts</a> that people had to carry from the splash pool to the start. The "river" is actually a large trough made to look like a natural river bed.
<p>The ride started out at a slow pace around a couple of turns, but then become far more challenging. Since the river is on a steady pitch down the hill, the rafts gained speed very quickly. Sudden turns would send the rafts up the walls. Riders who were not holding on would sometimes fall out onto the steep surrounding terrain. A rider recounted to <i><a href="../../../w/e/i/Weird_NJ_e40a.html" title="Weird NJ">Weird NJ</a></i> how a friend's mother suffered a broken nose when their raft was thrown into a rock wall.<sup id="_ref-Greg_Shpunder_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greg_Shpunder" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>At one point the rafts would come to a fork where they could either head into a tunnel, or (less frequently) around a corner into an unknown section of river. The tunnel had many turns and was dark. At the exit, rafts commonly struck a curved wall with great force. The raft then floated into a small rock pool and stayed there until it found its way out. The final stretch of the river consisted of a large downhill portion complete with bumps, and a foot-high (30 cm) jump where the rafts would momentarily catch air and then slam back onto the surface.</p>

<p>Waterworld also featured the Aerodium, a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertical_wind_tunnel.html" title="Vertical wind tunnel">vertical wind tunnel</a> that allowed riders to hover in the air without any type of restraints. Riders wearing a special skydiving suit, helmet, and earplugs would join the <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodyflight.html" title="Bodyflight">bodyflight</a> instructor one by one on a trampoline-like netting directly over the fan. The instructor would grab each rider's wrists and guide the rider to fall forward, allowing the fan to loft the rider skyward. After a few seconds of flight, the attendant operating the fan would cut the power, causing the rider to fall onto the air cushions surrounding the fan. Park guests' flights were limited to a maximum of 6 or 7 feet above the ground, approximately a foot or two over the instructor's head. Stadium seating encircled the perimeter of the Aerodium, allowing friends and spectators to watch riders fly. The fee to fly in the Aerodium (in 1996) was $7 per person.</p>

<p>The one ride that has come to symbolize Action Park and its extreme thrill-seeking was, paradoxically, almost never used.</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s GAR built an enclosed water slide, not unusual for that time, and indeed the park already had several. But for this one they decided to build, at the end, a <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loop_%28roller_coaster%29.html" title="Loop (roller coaster)">complete vertical loop</a> of the kind more commonly associated with <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roller_coaster.html" title="Roller coaster">roller coasters</a>.<sup id="_ref-Looping_water_slide_picture_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Looping_water_slide_picture" title="">[15]</a></sup> Employees have reported they were offered <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_one_hundred-dollar_bill_050f.html" title="United States one hundred-dollar bill">hundred-dollar bills</a> to test it. "It didn't buy enough booze to drown out the memory", said Fergus.<sup id="_ref-Tom_Fergus_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tom_Fergus" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was opened for one month in summer 1985 before it was closed at the order of the state's Advisory Board on Carnival Amusement Ride Safety, a highly unusual move at the time.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park_21_9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park_21" title="">[13]</a></sup> One worker told a local <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a> that "there were too many bloody noses and back injuries" from riders, and it was widely rumored that some of the <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crash_test_dummy.html" title="Crash test dummy">test dummies</a> sent down before it was opened had been <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dismemberment.html" title="Dismemberment">dismembered</a>.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park_21_10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park_21" title="">[13]</a></sup> A rider also reportedly got stuck at the top of the loop due to insufficient water pressure, and a <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatch.html" title="Hatch">hatch</a> had to be built there to allow for future extrications.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park_21_11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park_21" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ride supposedly reopened a few more times over the years. In summer 1995 it opened for several days before a few more injuries forced another shutdown.</p>
<p>Those who did ride it have said that more safety measures <i>were</i> taken than was otherwise common at the park. Riders were <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weight.html" title="Weight">weighed</a> and hosed down with cold water, required to remove <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewelry.html" title="Jewelry">jewelry</a>, and then carefully instructed in how they had to position their bodies to complete the ride.<sup id="_ref-Steve_Braybrook_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Steve_Braybrook" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>For the remainder of the park's existence, it remained visible near the entrance of Waterworld, tempting visitors with the possibility of the thrilling ride it might have offered yet tempering it with the high potential for injury that was just as obvious from looking at it.</p>
<p>The slide was dismantled shortly after Action Park closed and has never been rebuilt; as of 2006, no additional looping waterslides have opened at any parks. However, since 2002, the Swiss company Klarer Freizeitanlagen AG has been working on a safe design for a looping waterslide and have now built and tested a 1:1 prototype of their design. <a href="http://freizeitparkweb.de/cgi-bin/dcf/dcboard.cgi?az=show_thread&amp;om=264&amp;forum=DCForumID74&amp;viewmode=all" class="external autonumber" title="http://freizeitparkweb.de/cgi-bin/dcf/dcboard.cgi?az=show_thread&amp;om=264&amp;forum=DCForumID74&amp;viewmode=all" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.eap-magazin.de/index.php?id=127&amp;L=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eap-magazin.de/index.php?id=127&amp;L=1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<p>Action Park and its defenders often pointed out that it was one of the first water parks in the nation and thus pioneered ideas that were later widely copied. This meant that visitors were using rides that had not been tested through practical use for very long. Ride designers may have had insufficient training in <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> or <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">engineering</a>.

<p>GAR, as its legal troubles would suggest, has been accused of cutting corners to maximize its profits. For example, it was accused of building rides cheaply, sporadically maintaining many of them, and failing to renovate rides to take advantage of later safety improvements to its ideas made by imitators. These practices may have taken place in a range of its operations, including customer safety (in the park's last year, it kept part of the ski area open despite being unable to obtain <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liability_insurance.html" title="Liability insurance">liability insurance</a>).</p>

<p>Since it was closer and slightly cheaper than <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Flags_Great_Adventure_724a.html" title="Six Flags Great Adventure">Six Flags Great Adventure</a>, Action Park attracted many visitors from the <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_area.html" title="Urban area">urban</a> areas of the New York metropolitan area, particularly northeastern New Jersey. Many of them were often from lower-income neighborhoods where they had few, if any, opportunities to swim, much less learn how. At the park they greatly overestimated these abilities, and this was a factor in many accidents as well as the drownings, according to park officials. DeSaye faults management's decision to broaden the customer base by advertising in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish-language</a> media as contributing to the accident rate, since few employees spoke Spanish nor was any written information made available in that language.<sup id="_ref-Jim_DeSaye_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jim_DeSaye" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The staff's indifference to many of the park's own rules led to a similarly lawless culture among riders, who generally liked the high level of control they had over their experience and felt that any accidents were the fault of the victims. A state official lamented that many waterslide accidents were caused by the victims themselves, who would often, in blatant violation of an explicitly posted rule, would discard their mats midway down the slide and wait at a turn for their friends so they could go down together.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park_21_12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park_21" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since many rides routed their lines so that those waiting could see every previous rider, many played to the audience with risky and bawdy behavior when it did finally come to be their turn. The Tarzan Swing in particular was known for outbursts of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">foul language</a> (not always planned) and <a href="../../../e/x/h/Exhibitionism.html" title="Exhibitionism">exhibitionism</a> as people jumped off the swing in full view of the whole line behind them.<sup id="_ref-Gethard_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gethard" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>The park also sold <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a> in many <a href="../../../k/i/o/Kiosk.html" title="Kiosk">kiosks</a> on the grounds, with similarly lax enforcement of the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_drinking_age.html" title="Legal drinking age">drinking age</a> as with other restrictions in the park.

<p>Despite many citations for safety violations between 1979 and 1986, including allowing minors to operate some rides and failing to report accidents, which was unique among New Jersey's amusement parks, an investigation by the <i>New Jersey Herald</i>, Sussex County's main daily newspaper, later found that the park was <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fine.html" title="Fine">fined</a> only once. It was also unique in that department in that all the other amusement parks were fined for first offenses — except Action Park. It asked if there was some sort of special relationship between GAR and the state.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park24_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park24" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was not an unreasonable question. In addition to its then-recent shenanigans that had led to the SCI investigation and indictments, Mulvihill was a well-connected local <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_estate_developer.html" title="Real estate developer">developer</a>. The company was a major employer in a rural and remote region of the state.</p>
<p>Some of the state's regulations failed to adequately address the situation, too. After the 1987 drowning, it was reported that the Tidal Wave Pool was considered a pool by the state, not a ride. Under state regulations at the time, that meant that all the company had to do was keep the water clean and make sure that certified lifeguards were on duty, and nothing else.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park20_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park20" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Six people are known to have died directly or indirectly from rides at Action Park:</p>
<ul>
<li>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_8.html" title="July 8">July 8</a>, 1980, a 19-year-old park employee was riding the alpine slide when his car jumped the track and his head struck a rock, killing him.<sup id="_ref-Ride_Accidents_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ride_Accidents" title="">[20]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_24.html" title="July 24">July 24</a> 1982, a 15-year-old boy drowned in the Tidal Wave Pool.<sup id="_ref-Water_Ride_Accidents_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Water_Ride_Accidents" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[22]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A week later, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>, a 27-year-old man from <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Island_ec1e.html" title="Long Island">Long Island</a> got out of his tipped <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayak.html" title="Kayak">kayak</a> on the Kayak Experience to right it. He was <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_shock.html" title="Electric shock">electrocuted</a> when he either stepped on a grate that was in contact with, or came too close to, a section of <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wire.html" title="Wire">wiring</a> for the underwater fans that was exposed. Several other members of his family nearby were also injured. He was taken to a hospital in nearby <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warwick_%28village%29%2C_New_York_07c5.html" title="Warwick (village), New York">Warwick, New York</a> where he died later of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_arrest.html" title="Cardiac arrest">heart failure</a> from the electric shock.<sup id="_ref-Water_Ride_Accidents_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Water_Ride_Accidents" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Traction_Park20_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park20" title="">[4]</a></sup>
<p>The park at first disputed that the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_current.html" title="Electric current">electric current</a> caused his death, saying there were no <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burn_%28injury%29.html" title="Burn (injury)">burns</a> on his body, but the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coroner.html" title="Coroner">coroner</a> responded that burns generally do not occur in a water-based electrocution.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park20_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park20" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ride was drained and closed for the investigation. Accounts differed as to the extent of the exposed wiring: the park said it was "just a nick," while others said it was more like 8 inches (20 cm). The state's Labor Department found that the fan was properly maintained and installed and cleared the park of wrongdoing; however it also said the current had the possibility to cause bodily harm under certain circumstances.<sup id="_ref-Water_Ride_Accidents_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Water_Ride_Accidents" title="">[21]</a></sup> While the park said it was vindicated, it never reopened the ride, saying people would be afraid to go on it afterwards.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park20_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park20" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<li>In 1984, a fatal heart attack suffered by one visitor was unofficially believed to have been triggered by the shock of the cold water in the pool beneath the Tarzan Swing. The water on the Tarzan Swing and in that swimming area was 50-60°F (10-16°C) while other water areas were in the 70-80°F (21-27°C) range more typical of swimming pools.<sup id="_ref-Traction_Park_21_13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Traction_Park_21" title="">[13]</a></sup></li>

<p>While many of the water rides still exist, extensively renovated by <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intrawest.html" title="Intrawest">Intrawest</a>, which bought the ski area in 1998 and decided the next year to reopen them as Mountain Creek Water Park, it is no longer the state's largest water park nor quite the draw it once was. Other waterparks have been built in and near the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Metropolitan_Area_6371.html" title="New York Metropolitan Area">region</a>, dividing what was once an exclusive market.</p>
<p>New Jersey toughened its amusement regulations as a result of the Action Park experience. Rides at Mountain Creek, many of them built in Action Park's heyday, now boast large bilingual signs advising patrons of just what the ride entails, how deep the water is in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metric_system.html" title="Metric system">metric</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_customary_units_40bb.html" title="United States customary units">English</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/Units_of_measure.html" title="Units of measure">units</a> and the age it is most appropriate for, as well as their state regulatory ID numbers. Safety rules are strictly enforced at the new park, and alcohol sales have been curtailed on the grounds. Today Mountain Creek is managed by <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palace_Entertainment_c589.html" title="Palace Entertainment">Palace Entertainment</a>.</p>
<p>Action Park as it was is now a fond memory, a cultural touchstone for most <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generation_X_5b7c.html" title="Generation X">Generation Xers</a> who grew up in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Jersey_e792.html" title="North Jersey">North</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Jersey_e437.html" title="Central Jersey">Central Jersey</a>. A popular list of "You Know You're from New Jersey When ..." that circulates in <a href="../../../e/m/a/Email.html" title="Email">email</a> begins with, "You've been seriously injured at Action Park."<sup id="_ref-You_know_you.27re_from_NJ_when_..._0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-You_know_you.27re_from_NJ_when_..." title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some even credit the park for making them learn some difficult lessons. In 2000, one, Matthew Callan, recalled Action Park thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Action Park made adults of a generation of Tri-State Area kids who strolled through its blood-stained gates, by teaching us the truth about life: it is not safe, you will get hurt a lot, and you'll ride all the way home burnt beyond belief.<sup id="_ref-Callan_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Callan" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Gethard, a writer for <i><a href="../../../w/e/i/Weird_NJ_e40a.html" title="Weird NJ">Weird NJ</a></i> and the associated book series, concurs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Action Park was a true <a href="../../../r/i/t/Rite_of_passage.html" title="Rite of passage">rite of passage</a> for any New Jerseyan of my generation. When I get to talking about it with other Jerseyans, we share stories as if we are veterans who served in combat together. I suspect that many of us may have come closest to death on some of those rides up in Vernon Valley. I consider it a true shame that future generations will never know the terror of proving their grit at New Jersey's most dangerous amusement park.<sup id="_ref-Gethard_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gethard" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
