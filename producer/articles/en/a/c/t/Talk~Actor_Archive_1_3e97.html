<p>How about <b>Actors/Actors and Actresses</b>?</p>
<hr />
<p>Also, I still see some girls here on the boys pages.</p>
<hr />
<p>In case you haven't noticed, women refer to themselves now as <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actors.html" title="Actors">actors</a>... I hope the page editor who deleted all the women, except <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judith_Dench_d989.html" title="Judith Dench">Judith Dench</a>, Ellen Burstein, <a href="../../../b/l/y/Blythe_Danner_bcb6.html" title="Blythe Danner">Blythe Danner</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophia_Loren_f82d.html" title="Sophia Loren">Sophia Loren</a> and further messed up the alphabetizing will correct it. You might notice also that <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidney_Poitier_9c83.html" title="Sidney Poitier">Sidney Poitier</a> is a man, or so I always thought.</p>
<ul>
<li>A female who acts is an actress. Thus, when <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilary_Swank_4107.html" title="Hilary Swank">Hilary Swank</a> won an <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a>, it was for Best Actress, not Best Actor Who Is Female. Please see <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s <i>Politics and the English Language</i> for more on manipulating thought by abusing language.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Great essay, <a href="http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/patee.html" class="external text" title="http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/patee.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, but doesn't have enough detail about the ways political hacks abuse language. That is a fascinating topic. I'm also not quite sure that it's the best way to describe the resistance to "actress."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Re: "actress"...yet another perfectly useful word forever tarred with the brush of political incorrectness. Female actpersons might refer to themselves as <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actors.html" title="Actors">actors</a>, but there are still many people who refer to them (quite respectfully) as <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actresses.html" title="Actresses">actresses</a>. It's what they are, isn't it? -- AnonymousCoward (ducking)----</p>
<p>Linguistically speaking, what is common usage IS correct. These females who act are, as a group, whatever the plurality of AME speakers call them, be it <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actors.html" title="Actors">actors</a> or <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actresses.html" title="Actresses">actresses</a>. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE!!!(Answer to A.C.) Since there is a dispute here, started by me, I will cede to the older nomenclature and possibly the majority opinion. I have created <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actresses.html" title="Actresses">actresses</a>. Wait til next year though...:-).</p>
<hr />
<p>I thought about this when I created the two pages, believe me. I thought about it, too, when I created separate pages for <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male_Tennis_Professionals_681f.html" title="Male Tennis Professionals">Male Tennis Professionals</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_Tennis_Professionals_fd64.html" title="Female Tennis Professionals">Female Tennis Professionals</a>. In both cases, I was guided by the highest professional awards. In tennis, women play in a separate league from men. In acting, the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a> (and, I believe, all the other major awards) are granted separately to male and female performers.</p>
<p>In both cases, there is a good reason for the distinction. If men and women played in the same tennis league, it would be extremely unfair. That's a biological fact, as far as I know. Maybe in the future, it will not be true, but for today, it is true.</p>
<p>In acting, it is generally, but of course not universally, the case that parts played by women and parts played by men are inherently different. It might be possible to remake, say, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_f51f.html" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i>, with <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Pfeiffer_1aa4.html" title="Michelle Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a> playing the role previously played by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlon_Brando_e47f.html" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a>, but... --<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The question seems to me, whether their is a difference in the activity called <i>acting</i> for men and women. I don't see any. Remember, in <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s time all roles were played by men. Why are "the parts played by men and those by women inherently different," by the way?</p>
<hr />
<p>I would answer this by saying that the problem was sexism in Shakespeare's time, not in our own. The role of <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Macbeth%28Shakespeare%29_d14c.html" title="Lady Macbeth(Shakespeare)">Lady Macbeth</a> is best portrayed by a woman, I think. A film detailing the life of <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Theresa_07ef.html" title="Mother Theresa">Mother Theresa</a>, starring <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvester_Stallone_7277.html" title="Sylvester Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a> in the central role, would be a farce, would it not?</p>
<p>Remember that I said, "generally, but by no means universally".</p>
<p>Perhaps in the future, the methods of makeup will have advanced to a sufficient stage that <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Connery_c5ee.html" title="Sean Connery">Sean Connery</a> could play a convincing <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Diana_4f2c.html" title="Princess Diana">Princess Diana</a>, but for now, gender is relevant to the roles, and it is not sexism to note this fact. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>----</p>
<hr />
<p>And I suppose having <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Taylor_fff3.html" title="Elizabeth Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a> playing <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Theresa_07ef.html" title="Mother Theresa">Mother Theresa</a> or <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah_Winfrey_92a2.html" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> playing <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Diana_4f2c.html" title="Princess Diana">Princess Diana</a> would be good casting? Notice you are choosing characters who HAVE lived and of whom we already have a visual image. Remember that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Martin_ffc6.html" title="Mary Martin">Mary Martin</a> played <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Pan_7c41.html" title="Peter Pan">Peter Pan</a>?</p>
<hr />
<p>Is this stealing your last word, if I only agree with what you've said? It occurred to me late last night (<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is keeping me up at night!) that you are absolutely right when you say that there isn't a difference in the activity of acting between men and women. And you are of course right too, in pointing out that just as some men are not right for some parts as women, some women are equally not right for some parts as women.</p>
<p>Of course, this perhaps doesn't remove the need for the distinction. We agree that personal physical characteristics can play a major role in how a performer is perceived in a part. And so we might conclude that, in general, gender is or at least tends to be a highly important characteristic for classifying performers. So we might leave the distinction as is.</p>
<p>The big difference between my tennis example, and acting, is that in tennis it really is true that the top tennis players would all be men, if all were to play in the same league. In order to have sensible competition, segregation is probably necessary. But why do we have separate awards for best actor and best actress? Even if men and women naturally tend to play different parts, there seems to be no reason why we should consider it difficult at all to decide if <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julia_Roberts_5e14.html" title="Julia Roberts">Julia Roberts</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Pacino_b483.html" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a> is the better performer in a given year.</p>
<hr />
<p>I guess we will have to <b>agree</b> to <b>agree</b>!!!</p>
<hr />
<p>If we were making a page listing famous philosophers, or famous scientists, I do not think that a separate listing would be a good thing at all. Unless, of course, someone wanted to make a page highlighting famous female scientists of the past, when they were more rare, or something like that.</p>
<p>One of the beautiful things about a wiki is, of course, that someone can create a page of 'Acting Professionals' that lists all of them, male or female, on the same page, or in alphabetical order, like 'Acting Professionals/A', etc. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a></p>

<p>I think differentiation between actresses and actors isn't a derogatory, sexist, or generally bad thing. Take, for example, a member of the US Congress. We universally call a male member a "Congressman". However, what can we call women? "Congressperson" is not a commonly used word. "Congressman" would obviously be sexist (and I say this with the utmost seriousness). So, we use "Congresswoman". Is that degrading? No. I doubt any female member of Congress would prefer "Congressman" or the unused word "Congressperson"? And by unused, I mean, how many times have you heard the media say "Congressperson Dianne Feinstein" rather than "Congresswoman Dianne Feinstein"?</p>
<p>So, what's wrong with calling female theatre or movie performers "actresses"? I think many females I know would prefer themselves being called with an obvious feminine term rather than a generally masculine term. This is more prevalent in foreign languages, such as French, where <i>une actrice</i> and <i>un acteur</i> have specific genders, and it would be rather weird say "elle est un acteur", which literally means "she is an actor (masculine)". <a href="../../../u/g/e/User%7EUgen64_718c.html" title="User:Ugen64">ugen64</a> 01:06, Dec 8, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and can someone delete the huge, long, list of acting professionals at the bottom that is annoying and rather unnecessary? <a href="../../../u/g/e/User%7EUgen64_718c.html" title="User:Ugen64">ugen64</a> 01:06, Dec 8, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why the need to differentiate? The term "actor" does not carry the kind of gender specificity as does "congressman" or "congresswoman," at least in English. Calling a female actor an "actress" gives me the same shivers as calling a female poet a "poetess." Ugh. Plus, the corresponding plural form, "actors and actresses," takes twice as long to say and write. So much more efficient and non-discriminatory to accept the convention that an actor is a person who acts and a group of people who act are "actors."</p>
<p>(Just an actor's two cents. Thanks for letting me participate.)</p>
<hr />
<p>The names have a purpose! We can look at the list and immediately see if they have been written on or not. This way we can choose to write on them, or leave them alone. (I got to this page by looking for information on Scott Bairstow, from Party of Five, who got into legal trouble this week for, ahem, difficulties with a 12-year-old girl.) Anyway-- I found this list from my search, and found from the list that Wikipedia didn't really have anything either. Sometimes (like in the case of Tom Mix or Victoria Principal) I will create the document if I know something about the person.</p>
<p>I thought about just spacing the list so that the names didn't take up so much vertical space, then I just got tired of it. Maybe someone else can take up this chore...</p>

<p>An <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinkBot_bb26.html" title="User:LinkBot">automated Wikipedia link suggester</a> has some possible wiki link suggestions for the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">Actor</a> article, and they have been placed on <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinkBot_suggestions_Actor_1b35.html" title="User:LinkBot/suggestions/Actor">this page</a> for your convenience.<br />
<i>Tip:</i> Some people find it helpful if these suggestions are shown on this talk page, rather than on another page. To do this, just add {{User:LinkBot/suggestions/Actor}} to this page. — <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> 10:16, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC) <a name="Is_this_really_true.3F" id="Is_this_really_true.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is this really true?</span></h2>
<p>During the Rennaissance, and for much of the subsequent century, deceased actors were buried at a crossroads, with a bowl and, in some cases, a stake through the heart, in much the same manner as a Vampire. They were also often distrusted because of their apparent supernatural ability to take on the persona of another individual.</p>
<p>Can someone post an independent source on this? I'm asking this because a lot of dubious editing has been going on from 62.252.64.18 (<a href="../../../6/2/2E/User_talk%7E62.252.64.18.html" title="User talk:62.252.64.18">talk</a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.252.64.18_c1db.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.252.64.18">contributions</a>).

<p>Apparently this bit of the article was summarily deleted by someone. I want to re-include it because of its prevalence in gaming development, but I'm not sure where.</p>
<ol>
<li>Here. Because they can play a very similar role, acting out the story of the game.</li>
<li>On the dab. Because this use might warrant its own article.</li>
</ol>
<p>Btw, I've linked (or tried to link) "third person", but I'll let the other suggestions fly for now, because they didn't look as useful as this one. Bye for now, <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerbrant_7d11.html" title="User:Gerbrant">Shinobu</a> 01:17, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
