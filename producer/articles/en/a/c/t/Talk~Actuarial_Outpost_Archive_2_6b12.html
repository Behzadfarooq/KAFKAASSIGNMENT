<dd>Greetings, Avi. I don't believe I've spoken with you before.

<p>I was just looking at <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.com.html" title="Fark.com">Fark.com</a>, and they have a long list of "Farkisms" to give people a sense of the community. Several entries mention specific posters by their user names, along with phrases that they coined. Avi, since you directed me to this page as an example of what the AO page should look like, should we go in this direction? Maybe come up with a list of "AO-isms" along with the people who coined them? I'd be willing to take the lead on this part of the project. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 19:21, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The debate on farkisms does show that my idea to include some information on the sense of community on a message board is not "trolling" or a "vanity project." People have been discussing eliminating the farkisms for months, and it hasn't happened yet, so maybe it's appropriate after all? <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 22:11, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nope. Fark is a much bigger, much more pervasive internet meme, and yet it is debating this issue, <i><a href="../../../a/_/f/A_fortiori.html" title="A fortiori">a fortiori</a></i> the AO shouldn't start. That the AO is in and of itself notable, yes, that anything like "Clank" or "Wiki-vandalizers-never-wases"&#160;;) is meaningful <i><b>in</b></i> the AO, let alone here, is not.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We shouldn't debate an issue because the editors over at the Fark.com page are debating it? That's a strange argument. And clearly "Clank" is notable in the context of the AO, given that my new wikistalker is using it. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 06:52, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't be rediculous, I used Clank as a cute way to let you know that your cute and cuddly self is well known, Skip. It is no more notable than you are, especially since you think you invented it 8-) . This is ludicrous; there is nothing to debate, the only thing notable about the AO <i><b>is</b></i> the AO, that an internet community exists for the purposes of actuarial research, collaberation, exam support, and recreation.

<dd>Wait, you are TheActuary as well as Avi? Isn't the use of sock puppets against wiki policy? But never mind that --- I'm actually interested in a discussion, rather than trying to track people down on the web and intimidate them. One critically important thing to point out --- I am not Abducens. As amusing as it was to see you guess my identity incorrectly, I feel I need to set the record straight on this, given the history of harassment and personal attacks against those who disagree with the "in-crowd" at the AO. I want to be absolutely sure that you realize that I am not Abducens, Abducens had his banning at the AO reversed by Tom, but chose not to return precisely because of these kinds of threats and harassment. The only reason I even dare to speak up is because I am pretty well insulated from the threats of retaliation that have driven others from this discussion and from the AO. In order to completely verify that I am not Abducens, I am signing this post with my work IP address. The only reason I'm opening myself to this kind of potential harassment is because Abducens is a friend of mine, and I don't want to see people try to damage his career. <a href="../../../1/2/8/User%7E128.111.222.211.html" title="User:128.111.222.211">128.111.222.211</a> 19:36, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Now, what is between you and Skip, TheActuary, glenn, Joe Smythe, DanRather, Abducens, etc. is your business. How many of the aforementioned are the same people, I haven't the faintest idea. The sockpuppetry accusation against Joe Smythe, et.al. was based on different id's, being newly created, and making the <i>exact same edits</i> word-for-word. Wiki admins have ways of finding out the IP's so the innocent (such as myself) have nothing to fear. - <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:47, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Only the editor who vehemntly denied he or she was Abducens felt they were notable. No one else does. Clank is never used anymore. Moran pre-dates the AO by a long shot (it's a farkism), never-wases is only used in an old sig. They are all non-notable, unused, and completely unbecoming of Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 21:26, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let's be honest here --- there are only about 3-4 people participating in this discussion, so saying 1 person disagreed is not exactly a landslide. Clank is still used, even by you in the archived discussion. The other expressions are still used on a fairly regular basis as well. I guess "AO-isms" wouldn't look good in an advertisement to bring Glenn more business, but they are perfectly appropriate for a wiki entry, as the fark.com page shows. I'll put them back up later when I have time, and we'll see if we get feedback from more people than just you. <a href="../../../8/8/2E/User%7E88.8.45.31.html" title="User:88.8.45.31">88.8.45.31</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>/lol I used Clank as a tongue-in-cheek “homage” to Skip, who is at the very least, a close personal friend of Abducens. I have not seen the other expressions used, outside of a few sig lines. They are not notable. To quote <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.com.html" title="Fark.com">fark.com</a>: “Fark's comments threads are often smattered with "Farkisms" or "FARK.com clichés" (essentially, in-jokes) which are an integral part of the community culture and used in myriad discussions at the website, regardless of whether they apply to the topic at hand.” This does not apply to the AO. I just clicked on three other examples from <a href="../../../i/n/t/Category%7EInternet_forums_e8c2.html" title="Category:Internet forums">Category:Internet forums</a>, and none of them have cliches. I'd bet the vast majority do not, which bolsters my contention that they are not notable, especially in the AO, where there use is minimal-to-nonexistant outside of a few people, at most. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 22:52, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually, it applies to the AO quite directly, just as this kind of material applies to other message boards. There is no concensus on this: it looks like you and Skip disagreed, and that was the end of the discussion. So please, stop treating this page as your personal property and let other people participate in its creation. If you like, we could do some searches on the AO to find out just how common the AO-isms I've listed are, and try to agree on how common they must be to be notable. <a href="../../../8/8/2E/User%7E88.8.45.31.html" title="User:88.8.45.31">88.8.45.31</a></p>

<dd>By all means, I never claimed, nor do claim, to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own or control</a> this article. Rather, I have an interest in keepin it in-line with Wiki's polices of notability and encyclopedic content. Please look at the following articles, and tell me if you think it is common to have cliche lists for <a href="../../../i/n/t/Category%7EInternet_forums_e8c2.html" title="Category:Internet forums">Category:Internet forums</a>: <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaia_Online_5051.html" title="Gaia Online">Gaia Online</a>, <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vault_Network_fc26.html" title="Vault Network">Vault Network</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_Forums_a7ce.html" title="Something Awful Forums">Something Awful Forums</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_Dope_bebe.html" title="Straight Dope">Straight Dope</a>, etc. I've picked some larger ones, but it appears that the vast majority of articles do not feel that "—isms" are appropriate. Thus, if anything, the burden of proof is on the editor wanting to ADD that information. If you can make a valid case why these phrases are particularly notable, other than your apparent desire to immortalize Abducens et al., then they can, and should, belong in the article. However, I am firmly of the belief that at this point they are not, and so I will move them to the talk page here for further discussion. I would suggest polling other editors for their opinion. As an aside, I would suggest reading <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> before making warning notes in edit summaries 8-) . -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 14:16, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AO "--isms"; notable or not</span></h2>
<p>Anonymous user, <a href="../../../8/8/2E/User%7E88.8.45.31.html" title="User:88.8.45.31">88.8.45.31</a>, wishes to add the following to the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>As with all message board communities, the AO has developed its own unique character and style. The following are some common "AO-isms" used by members of the community:</i></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Clank!</b>: First used to taunt a Syracuse fan over the number of free throws missed by their opponents in the 2003 NCAA chapionship, the term has spread in use to a general mocking term whenever someone fails to make a point with a post.</i></dd>
<dd><i><b>Super-Bowl-Never-Wases</b>: First used to taunt a Philadelphia fan over their losses in NFC championship games, the term "Never-wases" is now applied to any perception of failure (i.e., "Exam-Passer-Never-Wases)."</i></dd>
<dd><i><b>Meltdown</b>: Used in response to an exceptionally hostile or virulent post to indicate the original poster has lost control.</i></dd>
<dd><i><b>Your a Moran</b>: A phrase with 2 deliberate misspellings, one based on a well-known photo circulating on the internet. Often used in a self-depreciating way as a response to someone pointing out a spelling error or gramatical mistake.</i></dd>
<dd><i><b>42</b>: A number always included in poll options, probably named after a poster of the same name.</i></dd>
<dd><b>Sockpuppet</b>: An emoticon created by Tom Troceen for thse posters who often say "let me get the sockpuppets out and explain it to you."</dd>
<dd><i><b>NTTAWWT</b>: "Not That There's Anything Wrong With That," a winking reference to a "politically correct" desire not to offend any group.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My opinion and arguments are that firstly, these are not notable, as described in the talk section above and secondly, the anonymous poster is demonstrating ignorance of, or confusion about, both AO history and the use of some of these phrases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, "Clank"'s usage was restricted to basically one user before he was banned (and allegedly started to vandalize this article on Wiki), and is moribund and defunct now. Same with "never wases"; same poster, extremely limited usage, and these two seem to be a method for this poster, or his friends, to get some sort of "revenge" or immortalization, after being banned from the community.</li>
<li>Secondly, meltdown has been an internet meme (google "netwok meltdown" for example) way before its use on the AO.</li>
<li>Thirdly, Moran was a farkism way before it came to AO; it came FROM fark (see <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.com.html" title="Fark.com">Fark.com</a>.</li>
<li>Fourthly, the etymology of 42 is obvious, and pre-dated the eponymous poster. I presume I don't have to spell this one out to the Internet community.</li>
<li>Fifthly, the name of the emoticon is "Handpuppet" not "Sockpuppet" and it comes from a particular post by one poster, and it was created by glenn, not Tom.</li>
<li>Sixthly, NTTAWWT is a well-known acronym, <a href="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/NTTAWWT" class="external free" title="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/NTTAWWT" rel="nofollow">http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/NTTAWWT</a> that comes from <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, in a nutshell, EVERYTHING here either has nothing to do with the AO, is defunct, or is a pure <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">vanity play</a>, and so I strongly believe NONE of this belongs in the article.

<p>I'm one of those who disagrees with Avi. The Fark.com page has a list of cliches and -isms, so why shouldn't we? I think it gives a nice feel for the community. Thanks to Avi for some of the factual corrections --- we should certaintly include them in future versions of the article. However, I'm not sure what to say about all the bizarre motives attributed to my contributions. I'm wondering if the hostility to my contribution comes not from its content, but from Avi's personal grudge against someone else. 83.60.31.172 14:36, 29 June 2006 (UTC)<small>—The previous is the user's first edit 83.60.31.172 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_83.60.31.172_4687.html" title="Special:Contributions/83.60.31.172">contribs</a>) -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 23:05, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I was trying to think of some AOisms that would be helpful for users. Is ATGTF or "another thread gone to flirting" one that is still in common usage or would be helpful from a historical perspective? How about DFTUYR or "don't forget to update your resume" which posters who spam the board with meaningless post count padding use to joke about their "contributions" to the board? p=p+1? I suppose it is pointless to contribute to Wiki since it is so pwned by white knights like Avi.

<dl>
<dd>It appears to me what is uncalled for is Avi's own emotional attachment in defending his own contributions and in preventing other parties from disagreeing with them. His whole attitude of placing the burden of proof on anyone else who wants to add content when he himself has no such burden of proof even in proving notability of his project of which he is clearly some sort of supporting member. If his site truly was notable, then someone not affiliated with the site would note such and write the article rather than resorting to his own self promotion and vanity. "Members of the site should remember that Wikipedia is not generally a place where you write about your own projects. If your community becomes famous, let others write about it." This type of non-notable graffiti ultimately cheapens and discredits the whole wiki project.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiLaw_9b32.html" title="User:WikiLaw">WikiLaw</a> 19:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC))<small>—The previous is the user's first edit <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiLaw_9b32.html" title="User:WikiLaw">WikiLaw</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WikiLaw_b1ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/WikiLaw">contribs</a>) -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 20:10, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</small>

<p>Against my better judgement, I will continute to attempt to have a civil conversation about this article, even if everyone who might have shared my point of view has been blocked and even if I have to wade through a thicket of meat puppets to do it. I will check the fark page to see what they're doing with their fark-isms, and make a few inquiries. If it looks like the fark-sims are here to stay (and maybe if I find some other examples of -isms related to internet sites), I'll try to cobble together a cleaned-up list of AO-isms (and watch the meat puppets promptly delete it, probably). <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 18:17, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe it was shown that on wikipedia, fark is the exception, not the rule, and is not a velid precedant for any "isms," especially ones only used to somehow rekindle the memory of banned Rams-fans. The use of a term does not make it an "ism."

I'll do a more comprehensive survey of message board pages later.

<p>The entire discussion around this article is sliding into a very bad place. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">User:Avraham</a> has managed to get everyone (but me) who disagreed with him labeled a "sock puppet" and blocked.

In the meantime, my legitimate concerns that <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheActuary_5432.html" title="User:TheActuary">User:TheActuary</a> is a sock or meat puppet were dismissed without investigation, and I was accused of making the accusation in bad faith, suggesting that wikipedia is run by a clubby bunch of insiders who selectively enforce the rules. I guess I'm not in the club ...</p>
<p>A warning to all: apparently <b>any</b> disagreement with Avi on this article will be labeled vandalism or be attributed to a sock puppet, and Avi has the power to punish you through the wikipedia powers that be.</p>

<dd>Good one! That's a good example of an AO-specific -ism that springs from a funny story that gives some nice insight into the AO culture. Thanks, Ravenslaw. Just to warn you, Avi will most likely try to get you blocked as a sock puppet (see below). He's managed to get everyone who disagreed with him blocked but me. However, I'm starting to learn my way around wikipedia rules, and now that I'm "lawyered up" I think the other side of this argument might get a fair hearing after all.

<dd>Not sure what your fascination is with usernames and identities. Is a play about Romeo and Juliet any less appealing if the author's REAL name was something other than Francis Bacon? Does the rose smell less sweet if called an Abducanian Tulip? The proof is in the pudding, Avi, and truth can be uttered out of the mouths of babes or "trolls" or "sock puppets" if that is what you wish to label those with whom you disagree. I find your intolerance for diversity un-amusing. Wiki is supposed to give a neutral perspective, not a biased one. Your defense and authoring of this article is not neutral. You can throw about whatever label you want on those with whom you disagree. I suppose Howard Dean should write his bio here too, or write the article about the Democratic Party in 2006. Maybe the Israeli prime minister can write the Wiki article about Middle East current events. Maybe Osama bin Laden can write the article about Western Civilization. And if anyone other than the author tries to add a different perspective, then the author or his meat puppet can revert to their fundamental text that is to remain sacred from dissenting opinions. In the end, the dissenters should probably acquiesce to your changes. After all, this article is even less significant than the subject it is written about…less noisy and less furry than a tickle me Elmo, but still signifying nothing. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColeSlaw_2e63.html" title="User:ColeSlaw">ColeSlaw</a> 17:18, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Jimbo Wales has said: "There's no specific policy against [Sock Puppetry]"" Particular net speak may not be notable in and of itself, but if we work from the premise, as we have here, that a web site is itself notable, then the language spoken at that site and the history of that site might be of interest to a person who is researching or trying to understand that site. Everything mentioned in an article does not have to be notable. At least it would seem to me to be the case that things not notable on their own could still be mentioned within the context of another, presumably notable, topic. Is Casey Sheehan notable? He is a soldier who died. Doesn't seem particularly notable. But he might be referenced in an article about Cindy Sheehan who became a political figure and cause celeb in the anti-war political movement during a presidential campaign.
