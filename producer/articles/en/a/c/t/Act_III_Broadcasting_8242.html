	    <p><b>Act III Broadcasting</b> was a company that owned several television stations that started as independents, and later became <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">Fox</a> affiliates. The stations were located in medium-sized markets, and the company existed from the mid <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> to the mid <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, eventually to be sold to Abry in 1994.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_III_Broadcasting_8242.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Act III Broadcasting began in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, when <a href="../../../w/v/a/WVAH-TV_14da.html" title="WVAH-TV">WVAH-TV</a>, channel 23 in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charleston%2C_West_Virginia_1570.html" title="Charleston, West Virginia">Charleston, West Virginia</a>; signed on as the first independent station in the state. Prior to that, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntington%2C_West_Virginia_30f0.html" title="Huntington, West Virginia">Huntington</a>-Charleston was the largest market without an independent station. WVAH's sign-on was possible because the West Virginia legislature forced the state educational broadcasting authority to withdraw its application for the channel, which had tied up its assignment for over a decade.</p>
<p>Act III then signed on channel 45 in <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayton%2C_Ohio_88d9.html" title="Dayton, Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a> in the fall of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> as <a href="../../../w/r/g/WRGT-TV_9b8d.html" title="WRGT-TV">WRGT-TV</a>. Before WRGT came, WTJC, a religious-based independent station that had been on the air for a few years had some entertainment programs, the only real source of non-network programming in Dayton. Act III bought most of these shows for WRGT. This made WRGT virtually the only general-entertainment independent station in Dayton.</p>
<p>The next year, <a href="../../../w/t/a/WTAT-TV_a41a.html" title="WTAT-TV">WTAT-TV</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charleston%2C_South_Carolina_d5d8.html" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Carolina_aeeb.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a> signed on with a similar format to WVAH and WRGT. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, when Fox launched, Act III signed an affiliation deal with the network.</p>
<p>The next year, Act III acquired Fox affiliate WNRW (now <a href="../../../w/x/l/WXLV-TV_c0b5.html" title="WXLV-TV">WXLV-TV</a>) in the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedmont_Triad_1bc2.html" title="Piedmont Triad">Piedmont Triad</a> from the <a href="../../../t/v/x/TVX_Broadcast_Group_9d66.html" title="TVX Broadcast Group">TVX Broadcast Group</a>, whom which Fox had signed an affiliation deal as well. However, there was a catch to this deal: if TVX sold one of its underperforming stations, Fox could disaffiliate from that station. This was not the case in the Piedmont Triad, because WNRW's rival station WGGT (now <a href="../../../w/m/y/WMYV_38bf.html" title="WMYV">WMYV</a>) was in bankruptcy, but it still ran a low budget schedule. This is where Act III began the practice of acquiring stations in medium markets.</p>
<p>That same year, Act III acquired <a href="../../../w/v/r/WVRN_60ab.html" title="WVRN">WVRN</a> in <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_Virginia_2b80.html" title="Richmond, Virginia">Richmond</a> from Sundbrink Broadcasting, which had also filed for bankruptcy. Both this station and Gillett-owned Fox affiliate <a href="../../../w/r/l/WRLH-TV_59ce.html" title="WRLH-TV">WRLH-TV</a> struggled in the ratings.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, Act III bought Fox affiliate <a href="../../../w/n/y/WNYB_1bcd.html" title="WNYB">WNYB</a> channel 49 in <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_New_York_0d75.html" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo, New York</a>. Later that year Act III decided that Richmond was not large enough to support two independent stations. It offered to buy WRLH's programming and move it over to WVRN. However, Gillett wanted to sell WRLH outright. Act III agreed to the deal, moved WVRN's programming to WRLH, and took channel 63 off the air. Act III then went on a buying spree, acquiring <a href="../../../w/z/t/WZTV_cd13.html" title="WZTV">WZTV</a> in <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville.html" title="Nashville">Nashville</a>, and <a href="../../../w/u/h/WUHF_0d99.html" title="WUHF">WUHF</a> channel 31 in <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rochester%2C_New_York_4bd8.html" title="Rochester, New York">Rochester, New York</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, Act III petitioned the FCC to allow its flagship station, WVAH, to move to channel 11, the last VHF frequency left in the Huntington-Charleston market. WVAH's signal on channel 23 was not strong enough to reach the entire market--a 61-county behemoth occupying rugged terrain in three states. The FCC granted the request, and WVAH moved to channel 11 later in 1989.</p>
<p>It did not stop there, as in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, Act III made several deals which made its stations the only general entertainment stations in their markets. In Nashville, WXMT (now <a href="../../../w/u/x/WUXP-TV_be60.html" title="WUXP-TV">WUXP-TV</a>), then the Fox affiliate, had been sold by TVX to Michael Thompson in 1988. Fox then moved its affiliation to WZTV in November, and Act III then cut a deal in which WZTV would take all of WXMT's stronger shows, leaving WXMT with only religious and home shopping shows. However, Thompson backed out of the deal last minute, but then made a revised deal which allowed WXMT to keep barter cartoons and low budget syndicated shows, giving WZTV the better and more expensive shows. WXMT's daily schedule now looked like this: home shopping for 15 hours, religion 3 hours, cartoons 3 hours, and low budget shows 3 hours. While WXMT was not eliminated from the draw, it was left with a much weaker schedule. In June, Act III bought <a href="../../../w/u/t/WUTV_e984.html" title="WUTV">WUTV</a> channel 29 in Buffalo from Citadel Broadcasting and sold <a href="../../../w/n/y/WNYB_1bcd.html" title="WNYB">WNYB</a> to <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tri-State_Christian_Television_298f.html" title="Tri-State Christian Television">Tri-State Christian Television</a>. WNYB's programming and Fox affiliation then moved to WUTV, whereas WNYB became an all-religious station. A year before, WVAH was permitted to move to channel 11.</p>
<p>Act III's next task was to ensure they had a monopoly in the Piedmont Triad: in 1991 it bought WGGT's programming and merged it onto WNRW's schedule. WGGT's owners then cut a deal with Act III allowing it to simulcast WNRW, creating a strong combined signal with over 60% overlap known as the "Piedmont Superstation." For all intents and purposes, Act III's stations were now the only general-entertainment stations in their markets, except for Nashville.</p>
<p>In the 1990's, a new concept developed: the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_marketing_agreement.html" title="Local marketing agreement">local marketing agreement</a>, or LMA for short. Under an LMA, one station would buy all or most of another station's broadcast day and take over its operations, but the other station would technically remain under separate ownership. The senior partner in the LMA would then program the other station with shows that it didn't have time to air. Act III, however, was not interested in this concept.</p>
<p>This became a moot point in 1994, as Act III Broadcasting would be sold to Abry, which had LMA's in some of their markets. The <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group_85ab.html" title="Sinclair Broadcast Group">Sinclair Broadcast Group</a> then bought Abry later that year; Sinclair of course had started the LMA concept back in 1991.</p>
<p>Here is what would happen in the former Act III markets over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rochester: WUHF is still one of only four full power stations because of the lack of available licenses.</li>
<li>Buffalo: <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant_Broadcasting_System_II_6d44.html" title="Grant Broadcasting System II">Grant Broadcasting System II</a> acquired the channel 26 license in <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamestown%2C_New_York_fbe9.html" title="Jamestown, New York">Jamestown, New York</a> in 1995. Grant then swapped channel 26 to TCT, who would move WNYB over there, and in return, Grant got channel 49, which became WNYO-TV, a <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_WB_Television_Network_e9d5.html" title="The WB Television Network">WB</a> affiliate. WNYO was sold to Sinclair in 2001.</li>
<li>Dayton: WRGT was not sold to Sinclair directly, but rather to Sullivan Broadcasters, although Sinclair would manage WRGT. Sinclair attempted to buy it outright in 2001 along with the other Sullivan-owned stations, but could not do so because by this time it also owned then-<a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> affiliate <a href="../../../w/k/e/WKEF_308a.html" title="WKEF">WKEF</a>. In the end, it was sold to <a href="../../../c/u/n/Cunningham_Broadcasting_b838.html" title="Cunningham Broadcasting">Cunningham Broadcasting</a> instead. However, Sinclair effectively owns WRGT and the other Cunningham-owned stations because the Smith family, the founders of Sinclair, controls most of Cunningham's stock. As for the religious station, it is now <a href="../../../w/b/d/WBDT_a531.html" title="WBDT">WBDT</a> channel 26, a CW affiliate owned by <a href="../../../a/c/m/ACME_Communications_15cc.html" title="ACME Communications">ACME Communications</a>.</li>
<li>Huntington/Charleston: WVAH was sold to Glencairn, Ltd. in 1997 after Sinclair acquired ABC affiliate <a href="../../../w/c/h/WCHS-TV_143f.html" title="WCHS-TV">WCHS-TV</a>. The Smith family, owners of Sinclair, though, owned most of Glencairn's (now Cunningham Broadcasting) stock, making Sinclair the de facto owner of WVAH.</li>
<li>Piedmont Triad: In 1995, Fox bought what was then the ABC affiliate, <a href="../../../w/g/h/WGHP_ab2b.html" title="WGHP">WGHP</a>. ABC then went to channels 45/48. Sinclair bought WNRW outright and changed its calls to <a href="../../../w/x/l/WXLV-TV_c0b5.html" title="WXLV-TV">WXLV-TV</a>. It then had Glencairn buy WGGT. Glencairn ended the simulcast and transformed WGGT into WUPN-TV, a <a href="../../../u/p/n/UPN_2d96.html" title="UPN">UPN</a> affiliate. WNRW also changed its calls to WXLV-TV. Sinclair bought WUPN outright in 2001, and later changed its callsign to <a href="../../../w/m/y/WMYV_38bf.html" title="WMYV">WMYV</a>, in anticipation of its <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Network_TV_a0f6.html" title="My Network TV">My Network TV</a> affiliation.</li>
<li>Nashville: Abry began LMA'ing WXMT in 1995, giving that station a UPN affiliation, and more entertainment shows as WZTV decided to focus on news and first-run syndicated shows. WXMT eventually changed calls to WUXP-TV. Sinclair bought WUXP outright in 2001.</li>
<li>Charleston, SC: Sinclair, after buying UPN affiliate <a href="../../../w/m/m/WMMP_2354.html" title="WMMP">WMMP</a> channel 36 in 1998, sold WTAT to Glencairn.</li>
<li>Richmond: While channel 63 never returned, a religious station on channel 65 signed on in 1990. That station eventually went to general entertainment, and became a WB affiliate in 1995, switching to UPN three years later. That station is currently <a href="../../../w/u/p/WUPV_2790.html" title="WUPV">WUPV</a>, a CW affiliate owned by <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeastern_Media_Holdings_376f.html" title="Southeastern Media Holdings">Southeastern Media Holdings</a> and managed by <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raycom_Media_3080.html" title="Raycom Media">Raycom Media</a>.</li>
