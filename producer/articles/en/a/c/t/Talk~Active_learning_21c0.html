<dd>As an impartial observer on this, can I suggest that the editors who are active here be cautious about their approach to one another? Disagreements over content are usually better approached by discussion on this talk page, rather than just reverting and removing content without explanation. There's been a lot of work done on this page in recent days, and I've noted some issues with the content that's been added (some POV is involved in a few places, as in the discussion of the NCLB legislation), but it doesn't seem to be too problematic in the whole. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 21:36, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Progressing in knowledge (i. e., learning) means accommodating an ever increasing space of mutually incompatible explanatory alternatives. It's not defending at all cost one's idealized view of reality, nor reproducing and amplificating someone else's conceited attacks against the diversity of interpretations, viewpoints and evidence.</p>
<p>Even the scientific explanations we select (and we are forced to do that; nobody can pay attention to everything) do not explain an independent objective world, they explain our experience and the world we live in.</p>
<p>Thus, if we are in an assertive mood and we want to impose our views on the other without reflection, de facto negating him or her, or if we are directly in an emotion that negates him or her, we will find ourselves operating in an irrational explanatory path.</p>
<p>Irrational not only because assertive emotions do not contribute to the constitution of the validity of an argument, but because they blind us to doing nothing more than choosing the point of view to see what was previously determined. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlos_Vasconcelos_Lopes_a3ba.html" title="User:Carlos Vasconcelos Lopes">Carlos Vasconcelos Lopes</a> 14:37, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>You are naif.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The NCLB act authoritarian view on education, with its strong normative emphasis and its reluctance in accepting diversity, will certainly make it very difficult to work on the premisses of active learning. Opportunities for active learning will be reduced to a few places where people are regarded as individuals and personal potential is valued.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With the exception of those already working with the educationally subnormal or with the gifted pupils, few active learning teachers will remain engaged in modifying educational methods to suit the needs of particular pupils.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One can reasonably expect that only the extremely successful ones will survive. I can even predict that some statistic-based scientific "research" will probably come to the fore with the brilliant conclusion that NCLB improved active learning effectiveness.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No doubt, it will be telling the truth. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlos_Vasconcelos_Lopes_a3ba.html" title="User:Carlos Vasconcelos Lopes">Carlos Vasconcelos Lopes</a> 16:38, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>People who are promoting mis-information on this Wikipedia article are most likely innocent fans of specific political efforts to win votes. I still cannot see how the NCLB act will help, in a significant (and sustainable) way, students, teachers and schools to improve.</p>
<p>That fact will certainly not invalidate a project to see a "mature" active learning article in Wikipedia. Reason has a central position in our [western] culture. I expect that sooner or later events and circumstances will push all contributions into the path of objectivity.</p>
<p>Of one thing I am certain, however. That path (i. e. the search for conditions that make an argument rational, and, hence, undeniable) can only emerge here on this talk page. Reverting and removing everybody else's contributions on the article page is good for nothing. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlos_Vasconcelos_Lopes_a3ba.html" title="User:Carlos Vasconcelos Lopes">Carlos Vasconcelos Lopes</a> 15:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Standard approaches aimed at the "universal" person are wedded to the simplistic views which still hold that the right combination of reward (or incentives) and punishment will be sufficient to regulate behaviour. Many of the so-called "statistically scientific researchers" still share that view, and many others, like them, who, despite all evidence, still find it difficult to accept that the world is round, not flat.</p>
<p>Educational standards present a series of rising hurdles over which aspiring pupils are expected to jump if they are to achieve prescribed levels of performance. Given human diversity, it is inescapable that these academic hurdles will be set too high (too soon) for some.</p>
<p>We can ask why, even now, with an all time high in the number of young adults who don't fit anywhere (don't have a real personal identity, don't feel comfortable in society, fail to earn a living in a legitimate way and have little intention of doing so) some politicians are demanding that more should be done to put schools measuring achievement by the distinctions awarded to star pupils. The answer to that question is obvious: it's all about pleasing the usual elements within the general public that agree and claim for more "black and white" normativity.</p>
<p>The real challenge though, even if one wants to pull in the direction of social conformity, lies in meeting the diversity of needs of the less educated. Schools cannot deal with these needs if they are run on a standard model.</p>
<p>It's certainly not that political sincerity or will or vision is lacking. A good proportion of politicians can probably score well on measures of decisiveness and mental ability. The problem is that proclaiming an open (and realistic) change of line would simply mean to risk the disaffection of their simple-minded political supporters and to prepare a path into the political wilderness. That's why electorally attractive but oversimple solutions to problems tend to be selected, even if they are not sustainable; even when they are expected to founder on the hard bedrock of reality a short time afterwards. What wise people can expect will happen with that kind of political dictation is a delayed political reverse, a more than probable future loss in educational control and direction.</p>
<p>In our increasingly complex age, this unaccountable "blindness" of so many educational policies is an anachronism. If the increasingly wide variation in educational ability continues to go unchallenged, one can only expect that a new era of extreme violence will be about to open.</p>
<p>We can even foresee the probable contours of what will be NCLB unhappy ending. A few successive crimes (of the particular kind that always attracts media attention) will be perpetuated in schools (understandably involved in no more than custodial duties), they will unleash public outrage and, as a consequence, NCLB won't need to remain underfunded, it can be sent down the toilet for real. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlos_Vasconcelos_Lopes_a3ba.html" title="User:Carlos Vasconcelos Lopes">Carlos Vasconcelos Lopes</a> 18:41, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I feel that the distinctions and relations among the concepts of "Discovery Learning," "Problem-based Learning," "Experiential Learning," and "Inquiry-based Instruction" are not explained clearly enough to warrant their presentation as individual subdivisions of "Active Learning." I feel that either more specific definitions need to be given to distinguish these categories more fully from each other, or they should be condensed to a list of different facets of the pedagogy of "Active Learning," and have their subsequent pages deleted or condensed to the page on "Active Learning." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.130.172.10_f36c.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.130.172.10">204.130.172.10</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/4/User_talk%7E204.130.172.10.html" title="User talk:204.130.172.10">talk</a>) 21:11, 26 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
