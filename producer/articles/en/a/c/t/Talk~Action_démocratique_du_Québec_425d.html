<p>Is the ADQ really libertarian? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 16:51, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes they are. They are socially liberal (although conservative to Quebec standards, Quebec is the most liberal society in North America by far) and VERY fiscally conservative.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That doesn't really qualify them as <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarian</a>. Libertarians generally believe that the state has only three roles in society: (1) defence against other countries, (2) police, and (3) the court system. I don't think that the ADQ would go that far. They may want smaller government and freer enterprise, but that is very different from privatising roads and schools and hospital as true libertarians would. 18:26, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>While it's true that being both socially liberal and fiscally conservative doesn't qualify a party as libertarian, it's also not true that a party cannot be said to have a libertarian ideology unless it meets the criteria laid out by the previous poster. National Post Columnist Andrew Coyne has described the ADQ as "libertarian nationalism" <a href="http://www.vigile.net/ds-souv/docs3/02-6-22-coyne-coalition.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vigile.net/ds-souv/docs3/02-6-22-coyne-coalition.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. An article in the McGill Postgraduate Students Society says "The platform of the ADQ stands primarily on a laissez-faire form of capitalism, where the state plays a secondary role to the private sector." <a href="http://www.pgss.mcgill.ca/COUNCIL0203/rep02dec_prez.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pgss.mcgill.ca/COUNCIL0203/rep02dec_prez.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> With this in mind I have re-added <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">Libertarianism</a> to the ideology section. <a href="../../../r/e/h/User%7ERehpotsirhc_d5d1.html" title="User:Rehpotsirhc">rehpotsirhc</a> 21:54, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd actually disagree that the McGill statement would mark them as libertarian...libertarianism is that the state plays little to no role, not just a secondary one. Unless it's in the party's platform, I don't think it should be there.Habsfan<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Nova_Scotia.svg_0206.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Flag_of_Nova_Scotia.svg/20px-Flag_of_Nova_Scotia.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="10" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Nova_Scotia.svg_0206.html" /></a>|<a href="../../../h/a/b/User_talk%7EHabsfannova_28d9.html" title="User talk:Habsfannova">t</a> 03:11, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Unless what, exactly, is in the party's platform? You won't find the politically sensitive term 'libertarian' in the platforms of many libertarian organizations. The point is that the ADQ are widely mentioned both in the media and by Quebec libertarian journals <a href="http://www.quebecoislibre.org/04/040515-2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.quebecoislibre.org/04/040515-2.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> as a libertarian-leaning party. The <i>raison d'etre</i> of the party is to lessen government involvement in people's lives, which is the essence of libertarianism.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To quote the Mcgill PGSS report you mentioned:
<dl>
<dd><i>These answers read exactly as the set of requests in a document released recently by le FEUQ - not exactly the vision of post-secondary education that we hold at PGSS, but not bad for a start. M. Dumont then went on to give one of the more libertarian-leaning speeches that I have had the privilege of hearing.</i></dd>

<dd>There is no magic recipie for what constitutes Real Libertarianism and what doesn't.

<dd>Well, the onus isn't on me to show that that party isn't Libertarian...it's on you to show that it is...and there's no showing on the ADQ site, and the only descriptions you use call it "libertarian leaning". Libertarianism is an extreme, and M. Dumont and his party aren't saying that Quebec needs to do a massive retreat to the free market. That's why I think "classical Liberal" should be used, as they simply want to free the market up. Take the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Democratic_Party_%28Germany%29_9f02.html" title="Free Democratic Party (Germany)">German FDP</a>, which pretty much practices the same goals, is labeled as "liberal".Habsfan<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Nova_Scotia.svg_0206.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Flag_of_Nova_Scotia.svg/20px-Flag_of_Nova_Scotia.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="10" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Nova_Scotia.svg_0206.html" /></a>|<a href="../../../h/a/b/User_talk%7EHabsfannova_28d9.html" title="User talk:Habsfannova">t</a> 15:25, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The statement "libertarianism is an extreme" is a perfect example of something that falls within the realm of your POV. <a href="../../../r/e/h/User%7ERehpotsirhc_d5d1.html" title="User:Rehpotsirhc">rehpotsirhc</a> 15:29, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I mean "extreme" in the sense as more far reaching then what the ADQ puts out in their platform.

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I understood you correctly the first time--but it's still an example of POV. You are saying libertarianism should be removed because the ADQ doesn't fit into your internal definition of what consitutes a libertarian organization. Or do you have any sources? <a href="../../../r/e/h/User%7ERehpotsirhc_d5d1.html" title="User:Rehpotsirhc">rehpotsirhc</a> 19:07, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I can't prove that the ADQ isn't a libertarian party, because that's not where the burden of proof is...the challenge is to prove whether the term libertarian can properly be seen. The only articles you've provided are an opinion by Andrew Coyne (Whom I like to read, but it's only his POV, like mine), and one McGill paper showing that they were "libertarian leaning", not "libertarian."Habsfan<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Nova_Scotia.svg_0206.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Flag_of_Nova_Scotia.svg/20px-Flag_of_Nova_Scotia.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="10" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Nova_Scotia.svg_0206.html" /></a>|<a href="../../../h/a/b/User_talk%7EHabsfannova_28d9.html" title="User talk:Habsfannova">t</a> 19:32, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You don't have to "prove" anything, nor is anyone burdened with the "burden of proof." This is about consensus and evaluating sources.</dd>

<dd>I showed you an article in the MPGSS journal that described Dumont and the ADQ as libertarians, the Coyne column in the Natinoal Psot, <i>and</i> an article in a Quebec libertarian magazine characterizing the ADQ as libertarians. If you're expecting hundreds of media sources in English for a minor provincal Francophone political party in a realatively small country, you're going to be disappointed. There are quite a few mentions on internet discussion forums characterizing the ADQ as libertarians, though. A commentor on left-leaning blog Daily Kos writes:

<p>What is the exact position of the party?

<dd>The problem, according to me, is that they are flip-flopping a lot. I do not want to write this in the article, of course, but it would be hard to write down their "exact position". They did support independance in 1995, that's for sure, but in subsequent years were more of the opinion that, the referendum having been lost, it was best to concentrate on other issues. Then in 2004 they adopted a platform of autonomism, even though they never clearly defined what autonism was. In the last federal elections they supported the conservatives, not the Bloc Québécois. <a href="../../../u/n/h/User%7EUnHoly_866f.html" title="User:UnHoly">UnHoly</a> 05:12, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I say to call the platform of the ADQ "Nationalist" is incorrect. Dumont recently said he wishes to re-open constitutional talks with Ottawa, on giving Quebec more freedom as a province, but still within the constitution (which he wants Quebec to ratify), as a part of Canadian Confederation. Simply, Autonomism, which is used accurately in the article itself, would be the best, and npov-ish way to describe the ADQ's position on the National Question. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamNorman_0e13.html" title="User:WilliamNorman">WilliamNorman</a> 02:54, 8 May</dd>

<p>"Embarrassing comments were made by Party President Yvon Picotte about PQ Leader André Boisclair. Boisclair had decided not to run in a by-election for the Sainte-Marie-Saint-Jacques (in Montreal), the district where he is living and that is well known for its large gay population. Accusing Boisclair of being a coward, Picotte jokingly said that the riding would fit Boisclair, who is openly gay, like a glove (comme un gant). Many journalists criticized Picotte, saying his comment sounded homophobic. Within days, Picotte apologized."</p>
<p><b>Similar incidents previously involved right-wing politicians, notably Cheryl Gallant, who allegedly made anti-gay remarks in 2002.</b></p>
<p>Is this last sentence relevant to an article about the ADQ? It seems sort of out of place to talk about the views on homosexuality of a specific Federal CPC member in an article about a relatively small Quebec party just because both parties are right wing.

<dd>I agree, I've added a tag (albeit in the wrong place, at first, sorry) to that effect. It's not that there's anything wrong. I think this article is rather well done.

<p>There's nothing about the ADQ's policies, something an article about a political party really should have. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETompw_aa36.html" title="User:Tompw">Tom<small>pw</small></a> (<a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETompw_bf4a.html" title="User talk:Tompw">talk</a>) 15:39, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hear hear. I came here looking specifically for those after reading about the ADQ's success, and have been pretty frustrated. 86.132.143.43 00:56, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most Quebecers don't know about their policies either. Long story short, people here vote AGAINST parties, not FOR parties, so they don't really look into the party's programs. A lot of Quebecers couldn't even tell you what "Left" or "Right" means in reference to politics. Two-party systems lead to political illiteracy. 70.55.60.209 03:27, 28 March 2007 (UTC) Phil</p>
<p>Phil, this is a bit reductionnist. Québec has been in a situation of bipartism for the last 40 years and people where voting for Québec's independance or against it. This was the main issue in political debate. Now that there are three main parties plus 2 marginals parties, this campain has been more oriented around the program and this is mainly why the Partis Québecois lost many of its voters since Boisclair (party's leader) promised a referendum on sovereignty of Québec many voters are tired of the referendum question. All this being said, your comment is not a constructive one, it is unfair and useless. Now, for those interested in ADQ policies, they can consult there website. Also, after reading the article, I think it is biaised at many places. I'll try to improve it tomorrow. <a href="../../../i/n/x/User%7EInXistant_8f67.html" title="User:InXistant">InXistant</a> 06:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why on earth would anyone consider the ADQ populist? They don't seem to be economically left of center. Mordac 10:14, 28 Martch 2007 (GMT)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi. Because you needn't be on ther left to be populist (see the Reform Part of Canada as another example). But I think all this dickering about populism or not or what kind of consrvatism is missing a <i>major part of the ADQ philosophy</i>, which is a fairly radical change to Quebec's status within Canada. See: <a href="http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=f5672daf-32d1-4773-bee8-f78002048d52&amp;k=97257" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=f5672daf-32d1-4773-bee8-f78002048d52&amp;k=97257" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>.
