<p>The <b>Acts of the Apostles</b> (Greek <i>Praxeis Apostolon</i>) is a book of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>, which now stands fifth in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>. It is commonly referred to as simply <b>Acts</b>.</p>
<p>Acts tells the story of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Christian_69b2.html" title="Early Christian">Early Christian</a> church, with particular emphasis on the ministry of the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Apostles_56fc.html" title="Twelve Apostles">Twelve Apostles</a> and of <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul of Tarsus</a>. The early chapters, set in <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, discuss Jesus's <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrection_of_Jesus_9d9f.html" title="Resurrection of Jesus">Resurrection</a>, his <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension.html" title="Ascension">Ascension</a>, the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecost.html" title="Pentecost">Day of Pentecost</a>, and the start of the Twelve Apostles' ministry. The later chapters discuss Paul's conversion, his ministry, and finally his arrest and imprisonment and trip to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>.</p>
<p>It is almost universally agreed that the author of Acts also wrote the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>. The traditional view is that both the two books were written <i>c.</i> 60 by a companion of Paul named <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_the_Evangelist_2172.html" title="Luke the Evangelist">Luke</a> — a view which is still held by many theologians. Alternatively, many modern scholars view the books as having been written by an unknown author at a later date, sometime between 80 and 150.</p>

<p>The apostles, along with other of Jesus's followers meet and elect Matthias to replace Judas as a member of The Twelve. On Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descends on them—the apostles hear a great wind and witness "tongues of flames" descending on them, paralleling <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=3:16-17&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=3:16-17&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Luke 3:16-17</a>. Thereafter, the apostles have the miraculous power to "<a href="../../../s/p/e/Speak_in_tongues.html" title="Speak in tongues">Speak in tongues</a>" and when they address a crowd, each member of the crowd hears their speech in his own native language.</p>
<p>Peter, along with John, preach to many in Jerusalem, and perform many miracles such as healings, the <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exorcism.html" title="Exorcism">casting out of evil spirits</a>, and the raising of the dead. As a result, thousands convert to <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Christianity_6b3f.html" title="Early Christianity">Early Christianity</a> and are baptized.</p>
<p>As their numbers increase, the Christians begin to be increasingly persecuted. Some of the apostles are arrested and flogged, but ultimately freed. <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Stephen_7c4f.html" title="Saint Stephen">Stephen</a>, one of the first deacons, is arrested for <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blasphemy.html" title="Blasphemy">blasphemy</a>, and after a trial, is found guilty and executed by stoning, thereby becoming the first <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyr.html" title="Martyr">martyr</a>.</p>
<p>Peter and the apostles continue to preach, and Christianity continues to grow, and begins to spread to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentiles.html" title="Gentiles">Gentiles</a>. Peter has a vision in which a voice commands him to eat a variety of impure animals. When Peter objects, the voice replies, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean". When Peter awakes from his vision, he meets with a centurion, who converts. Peter baptizes the centurion, and later has to justify this decision to the other Christians.</p>

<p>Paul of Tarsus, also known as Saul, is the main character of the second half of Acts. He is introduced as a persecutor of the Christian church (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=8:1:3&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=8:1:3&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">8:1:3</a>), yet somehow he was converted to Christianity. His own account of his conversion, <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Gal&amp;verse=1:11-24&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Gal&amp;verse=1:11-24&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Gal 1:11-24</a>, is not detailed. Acts records three versions of the story, known as the <a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_to_Damascus_2ccf.html" title="Road to Damascus">Road to Damascus</a>: While Paul was on the road to Damascus, near Damascus, "suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground" (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=9:3-4&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=9:3-4&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">9:3-4</a>), the light was "brighter than the sun" (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=26:13&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=26:13&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">26:13</a>) and he was subsequently blinded for three days (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=9:9&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=9:9&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">9:9</a>). He heard a voice in the Hebrew language (probably <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_of_Jesus_ecb6.html" title="Aramaic of Jesus">Aramaic</a>): "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? ... I am Jesus" (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=26:14-15&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=26:14-15&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">26:14-15</a>). In Damascus, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Ananias_of_Damascus_75c2.html" title="Ananias of Damascus">St. Ananias</a> cured his blindness, "something like scales" fell from his eyes, and baptized him (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=9:17-19&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=9:17-19&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">9:17-19</a>). It is commonly believed that Saul changes his name to Paul at this time, but the source of this claim is unknown, the first mention of another name is later, (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=13:9&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=13:9&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">13:9</a>), during his first missionary journey.</p>
<p>Several years later, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnabas.html" title="Barnabas">Barnabas</a> and Paul set out on a mission (13-14) to further spread Christianity, particularly among the Gentiles. Paul travels through <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>, preaching and visiting churches throughout the region.</p>
<p>Paul travels to Jerusalem where he meets with the apostles — a meeting known as the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Jerusalem_9bac.html" title="Council of Jerusalem">Council of Jerusalem</a> (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=15&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=15&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">15</a>). Paul's own record of the meeting appears to be <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Gal&amp;verse=2&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Gal&amp;verse=2&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Gal 2</a>, however, due to the differences, some argue Gal 2 is a different meeting. Members of the Jerusalem church have been preaching that <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision_in_the_Bible_5eda.html" title="Circumcision in the Bible">circumcision</a> is required for salvation. Paul and his associates strongly disagree. After much discussion, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_James_the_Just_5b60.html" title="Saint James the Just">James the Just</a>, leader of the Jerusalem church, decrees that Gentile christian converts need not follow all of the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosaic_Law_c43a.html" title="Mosaic Law">Mosaic Law</a>, and in particular, they do not need to be circumcised.</p>
<p>Paul spends the next few years traveling through western <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a> and founds his first Christian church in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippi.html" title="Philippi">Philippi</a>. Paul then travels to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thessalonica.html" title="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a>, where he stays for some time before departing for <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>. In <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>, Paul visits an altar with an inscription dedicated to the <a href="../../../u/n/k/Unknown_God_725d.html" title="Unknown God">Unknown God</a>, so when he gives his speech on the <a href="../../../a/r/e/Areios_Pagos_1b0a.html" title="Areios Pagos">Areopagos</a>, he proclaims to worship that same Unknown God whom he identifies as the Christian God.</p>
<p>Upon Paul's arrival in Jerusalem, he was confronted with the rumor of teaching <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antinomianism.html" title="Antinomianism">against the Law of Moses</a> (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=21:21&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=21:21&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">21:21</a>). To prove that he was "living in obedience to the law", Paul took a <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazirite.html" title="Nazirite">biblical vow</a> along with some others (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=21:26&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=21:26&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">21:26</a>). Near the end of the seven days of the vow, Paul was recognized outside <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod%27s_Temple_07a6.html" title="Herod's Temple">Herod's Temple</a> and was nearly beaten to death by a <i>mob</i>, "shouting, 'Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple area and defiled this holy place'" (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=21:28&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=21:28&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">21:28</a>). Paul is rescued from the <i>mob</i> by a Roman commander (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=21:31-40&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=21:31-40&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">21:31-40</a>) and accused of being a <a href="../../../z/e/a/Zealot.html" title="Zealot">revolutionary</a>, "ringleader of the sect of the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazarenes.html" title="Nazarenes">Nazarenes</a>", teaching <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrection_of_the_dead.html" title="Resurrection of the dead">resurrection of the dead</a>, and thus imprisoned in <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesarea_Maritima_d266.html" title="Caesarea Maritima">Caesarea</a> (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=Acts%20&amp;verse=23–26&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=Acts%20&amp;verse=23–26&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">23–26</a>). Paul asserts his right, as a Roman citizen, to be tried in Rome. Paul is sent by sea to Rome, where he spends another two years under house arrest, proclaiming the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_God_9f58.html" title="Kingdom of God">Kingdom of God</a> and teaching the "Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=28:30-31&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=28:30-31&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">28:30-31</a>). Surprisingly, Acts does not record the outcome of Paul's legal troubles — some traditions hold that Paul was ultimately executed in Rome, while other traditions have him surviving the encounter and later traveling to Spain and Great Britain — see <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html#Paul.27s_trip_to_Rome.2C_imprisonment_and_death" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul - Imprisonment &amp; Death</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Universality of Christianity</dt>
</dl>
<p>One of the central themes of Acts, indeed of the New Testament, see also <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Commission_a9b6.html" title="Great Commission">Great Commission</a>, is the universality of Christianity — the idea that Jesus's teachings were for all humanity — <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentiles.html" title="Gentiles">Gentiles</a> alike. In this view, Christianity is seen as a religion in its own right, rather than a subset of Judaism, if one makes the common assumption that Judaism is not universal, however see <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noahide_Laws_3e06.html" title="Noahide Laws">Noahide Laws</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism_and_Christianity_c61a.html" title="Judaism and Christianity">Judaism and Christianity</a> for details. Whereas the members of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Christianity_9362.html" title="Jewish Christianity">Jewish Christianity</a> were circumcised and adhered to dietary laws, the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_Christianity_2d94.html" title="Pauline Christianity">Pauline Christianity</a> featured in Acts did not require Gentiles to be circumcised or to obey all of the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosaic_laws.html" title="Mosaic laws">Mosaic laws</a>, which is consistent with Noahide Law. The final chapter of Acts ends with Paul condemning non-Christian Jews and saying "Therefore I want you to know that God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!" (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=28:28&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=28:28&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">28:28</a>).

<dl>
<dt>Holy Spirit</dt>
</dl>
<p>As in the Gospel of Luke, there are numerous references to the Holy Spirit throughout Acts. Acts features the "baptism in the Holy Spirit" on Pentecost<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and the subsequent spirit-inspired speaking in tongues. The Holy Spirit is shown guiding the decisions and actions of Christian leaders<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>, and the Holy Spirit is said to "fill" the apostles, especially when they preach.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> As a result, Acts is particularly influential among branches of Christianity which place particular emphasis the Holy Spirit, such as <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostalism.html" title="Pentecostalism">Pentecostalism</a> and the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_movement.html" title="Charismatic movement">Charismatic movement</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Attention to the oppressed and persecuted</dt>
</dl>
<p>The Gospel of Luke and Acts both devote a great deal of attention to the oppressed and downtrodden. The impovershed are generally praised<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>, while the wealthy are criticized. Luke-Acts devotes a great deal of attention to women in general<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> and to widows in particular.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> The <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaritans.html" title="Samaritans">Samaritans</a> of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaria.html" title="Samaria">Samaria</a> (see map at <a href="../../../i/u/d/Iudaea_Province_84e3.html" title="Iudaea Province">Iudaea Province</a>), had their temple on <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Gerizim_76d3.html" title="Mount Gerizim">Mount Gerizim</a>, and along with some other differences, see <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaritanism.html" title="Samaritanism">Samaritanism</a>, were in conflict with Jews of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea.html" title="Judea">Judea</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galilee.html" title="Galilee">Galilee</a> and other regions who had their <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_in_Jerusalem_e1a8.html" title="Temple in Jerusalem">Temple in Jerusalem</a> and practiced <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>. Unexpectedly, since Jesus was a Jewish Galilean, the Samaritans are shown favorably in Luke-Acts.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> In Acts, attention is given to the religious persecution of the early christians, as in the case of Stephen's martyrdom and the numerous examples are Paul's persecution for his preaching of Christianity.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Prayer</dt>
</dl>
<p>Prayer is a major motif in both the Gospel of Luke and Acts. Both books have a more prominent attention to prayer than is found in the other gospels.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> The Gospel of Luke depicts prayer as a certain feature in Jesus's life. Examples of prayer which are unique to Luke include Jesus's prayers at the time of his baptism (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=3:21&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=3:21&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Luke 3:21</a>), his praying all night before choosing the twelve (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=6:12&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=6:12&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Luke 6:12</a>), and praying for the transfiguration (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=9:28&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=9:28&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Luke 9:28</a>). Acts also features an emphasis on prayer and includes a number of notable prayers such as the <i>Believers' Prayer</i> (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=4:23-31&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=4:23-31&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">4:23-31</a>), Stephen's death prayer (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=7:59-60&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=7:59-60&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">7:59-60</a>), and Simon Magus' prayer (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=8:24&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=8:24&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">8:24</a>).

<dl>
<dt>Speeches</dt>
</dl>
<p>Acts features a number of extended speeches or sermons from Peter, Paul, and others. In fact, there are at least 24 different speeches in Acts, and the speeches comprise about 30% of the total verses.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> These speeches, which are quoted verbatim at length rather than simply summarized, have been the source of debates over the historical accuracy of Acts. (see below).</p>

<p>While the precise identity of the author is debated, the general consensus is that the author was a Greek Gentile writing for an audience of Gentile Christians.</p>

<p>There is substantial evidence to indicate that the author of <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">The Gospel of Luke</a> also wrote the Book of Acts. The most direct evidence comes from the prefaces of each book. Both prefaces are addressed to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theophilus_%28Biblical%29_ffbd.html" title="Theophilus (Biblical)">Theophilus</a>, the author's patron—and perhaps a label for a Christian community as a whole as the name means "Beloved by God". Furthermore, the preface of Acts explicitly references "my former book" about the life of Jesus—almost certainly the work we know as The Gospel of Luke.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are linguistic and theological similarities between the Luke and Acts. As one scholar writes,"the extensive linguistic and theological agreements and cross-references between the Gospel of Luke and the Acts indicate that both works derive from the same author"<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> Because of their common authorship, the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles are often jointly referred to simply as Luke-Acts. Similarly, The author of Luke-Acts is often known as "Luke"—even among scholars who doubt that the author was actually named Luke.</p>

<p>The traditional view is that the Gospel of Luke and Acts were written by the physician <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_the_Evangelist_2172.html" title="Luke the Evangelist">Luke</a>, a companion of Paul. This Luke is mentioned in Paul's <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_Philemon_7234.html" title="Epistle to Philemon">Epistle to Philemon</a> (v.24), and in two other epistles which are traditionally ascribed to Paul (<a href="../../../c/o/l/Colossians.html" title="Colossians">Colossians</a> 4:14 and <a href="../../../2/_/t/2_Timothy_cbbd.html" title="2 Timothy">2 Timothy</a> 4:11).</p>
<p>The view that Luke-Acts was written by the physician Luke was nearly unanimous in the early Christian church. The Papyrus Bodmer XIV, which is the oldest known manuscript containing the start of the gospel (dating to around 200 <a href="../../../c/e/_/CE_7a86.html" title="CE">CE</a>), uses the title "The Gospel According to Luke". Nearly all ancient sources also shared this theory of authorship—<a href="../../../i/r/e/Irenaeus.html" title="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a>,<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertullian.html" title="Tertullian">Tertullian</a>,<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_of_Alexandria_389e.html" title="Clement of Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a>,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origen.html" title="Origen">Origen</a>, and the <a href="../../../m/u/r/Muratorian_Canon_5e0b.html" title="Muratorian Canon">Muratorian Canon</a> all regarded Luke as the author of the Luke-Acts. Neither <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eusebius_of_Caesarea_fb99.html" title="Eusebius of Caesarea">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> nor any other ancient writer mentions another tradition about authorship.</p>
<p>In addition to the authorship evidence provided by the ancient sources, some feel the text of Luke-Acts supports the conclusion that its author was a companion of Paul. First among such internal evidence are portions of the book which have come to be called the "'we' passages". Although the bulk of Acts is written in the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_person.html" title="Grammatical person">third person</a>, several brief sections of the book are written from a first-person perspective.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> These "we" sections are written from the point of view of a traveling companion of Paul: e.g. "After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia", "We put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace"<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> Such passages would appear to have been written by someone who traveled with Paul during some portions of his ministry. Accordingly, some have used this evidence to support the conclusion that these passages, and therefore the entire text of the Luke-Acts, were written by a traveling companion of Paul's. The physician Luke would be one such person.</p>
<p>It has also been argued that level of detail used in the narrative describing Paul's travels suggests an eyewitness source. Some claim that the vocabulary used in Luke-Acts suggests its author may have had medical training, but this claim has been widely disputed.</p>

Instead, they believe Luke-Acts was written by an anonymous Christian author who was not an eyewitness to any of the events recorded within the text.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Foremost among the evidence comes from the text of Luke-Acts itself. In the prefaces, the author refers to having eyewitness testimony "handed down to us" and to having undertaken a "careful investigation", but the author does not mention his own name or explicitly claim to be an eyewitness to any of the events. Accordingly, some cite this to argue that the author's work as a product of research, not of recall.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Except for a few "we" passages, the narrative of Luke-Acts is written in the third person—the author never refers to himself as "I" or "me". One might expect that had its author been an eyewitness, there would be more discussion of the author's background and of his personal experiences. To those who are skeptical of an eyewitness author, the "we passages" are usually regarded as fragments of a second document, part of some earlier account, which was later incorporated into Acts by the later author of Luke-Acts. An alternate theory is that the use of "we" was a stylistic idiosyncrasy used in many sea travel narratives written around the same time as Acts.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>The author of Acts likely relied upon other sources, as well as oral tradition, in constructing his account of the early church and Paul's ministry. Evidence of this is found in the prologue to the Gospel of Luke, where the author alluded to his sources by writing, "Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word." Some theorize that the "we" passages in Acts are one such "handed down" quotation from some earlier source who was a part of Paul's travels.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the author of Acts did not have access to a collection of <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_epistles.html" title="Pauline epistles">Paul's letters</a>. One piece of evidence suggesting this is that although half of Acts centers on Paul, Acts never directly quotes from the epistles nor does it even mention Paul writing letters. Additionally, the epistles and Acts disagree about the general chronology of much of Paul's career. Since many of Paul's epistles are believed to be authentic, the discrepancies between the authentic epistles and Acts are probably errors on the part of Acts which were made because its author lacked access to the Pauline epistles or a similar source.</p>
<p>Other theories about Acts' sources are more controversial. Some historians believe that Acts borrows phraseology and plot elements from <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euripides.html" title="Euripides">Euripides</a>' play <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bacchae_bc0b.html" title="The Bacchae">The Bacchae</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> Some feel that the text of Acts shows evidence of having used the Jewish historian <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus.html" title="Josephus">Josephus</a> as a source (in which case it would to have been written sometime after 94 <a href="../../../c/e/_/CE_7a86.html" title="CE">CE</a>).<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The question of authorship is largely bound up with that as to the historicity of the contents. Conservative scholars view the book of Acts as being extremely accurate while skeptics view the work as being inaccurate. For example, the conservative <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> scholar <a href="../../../a/2E/n/A.N._Sherwin-White_795c.html" title="A.N. Sherwin-White">A.N. Sherwin-White</a> wrote in his work <i>Roman Society and Roman Law in the New Testament</i> the following: "For the New Testament of Acts, the confirmation of historicity is overwhelming…any attempt to reject its basic historicity, even in matters of detail, must now appear absurd. Roman historians have long taken it for granted."<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> In addition, conservative scholars see the book of Acts being corroborated by <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeology.html" title="Archaeology">archaeology</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Acts is divided into two distinct parts. The first (chs. 1–12) deals with the church in Jerusalem and Judaea, and with Peter as central figure—at any rate in the first five chapters. "Yet in cc. vi.-xii.," as Harnack observes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the author pursues several lines at once. (1) He has still in view the history of the Jerusalem community and the original apostles (especially of Peter and his missionary labors); (2) he inserts in vi. 1 ff. a history of the Hellenistic Christians in Jerusalem and of the Seven Men, which from the first tends towards the Gentile Mission and the founding of the Antiochene community; (3) he pursues the activity of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_the_Apostle_f7d8.html" title="Philip the Apostle">Philip</a> in <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaria.html" title="Samaria">Samaria</a> and on the coast...; (4) lastly, he relates the history of Paul up to his entrance on the service of the young Antiochene church. In the small space of seven chapters he pursues all these lines and tries also to connect them together, at the same time preparing and sketching the great transition of the Gospel from Judaism to the Greek world. As historian, he has here set himself the greatest task.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No doubt gaps abound in these seven chapters. "But the inquiry as to whether what is narrated does not even in these parts still contain the main facts, and is not substantially trustworthy, is not yet concluded." The difficulty is that there are few external means of testing this portion of the narrative. The second part pursues the history of the apostle Paul, and here the statements made in the Acts may be compared with the Epistles. The result is a general harmony, without any trace of direct use of these letters; and there are many minute coincidences. But attention has been drawn to two remarkable exceptions: the account given by Paul of his visits to Jerusalem in Galatians as compared with Acts; and the character and mission of the apostle Paul, as they appear in his letters and in Acts.</p>
<p>In regard to the first point, the differences as to Paul's movements until he returns to his native province of Syria-Cilicia do not really amount to more than can be explained by the different interests of Paul and the author, respectively. But it is otherwise as regards the visits of Galatians 2:1–10 and Acts 15. If they are meant to refer to the same occasion, as is usually assumed, it is hard to see why Paul should omit reference to the public occasion of the visit, as also to the public vindication of his policy. But in fact the issues of the two visits, as given in Galatians 2:9f. and Acts 15:20f., are not at all the same. Nay more, if Galatians 2:1–10 = Acts 15, the historicity of the "Relief visit" of Acts 11:30, 12:25 seems definitely excluded by Paul's narrative of events before the visit of Galatians 2:1ff. Accordingly, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Mitchell_Ramsay_7244.html" title="William Mitchell Ramsay">Sir W. M. Ramsay</a> and others argue that the latter visit itself coincided with the Relief visit, and even see in Galatians 2:10 witness thereto.</p>
<p>But why does not Paul refer to the public charitable object of his visit? It seems easier to assume that the visit of Galatians 2:1ff. is altogether unrecorded in Acts, owing to its private nature as preparing the way for public developments—with which Acts is mainly concerned. In that case, it would fall shortly before the Relief visit, to which there may be tacit explanatory allusion, in Galatians 2:10; and it will be shown below that such a conference of leaders in Galatians 2:1ff. leads up excellently both to the First Mission Journey and to <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Jerusalem_9bac.html" title="Council of Jerusalem">Acts 15</a>.</p>
<p>As for Paul as depicted in Acts, Paul claims that he was appointed the apostle to the Gentiles, as Peter was to the Circumcision; and that <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision_in_the_Bible_5eda.html" title="Circumcision in the Bible">circumcision</a> and the observance of the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosaic_Law_c43a.html" title="Mosaic Law">Mosaic Law</a> were of no importance to the Christian as such. His words on these points in all his letters are strong and decided, but see also <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antinomianism.html" title="Antinomianism">Antinomianism</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Perspective_on_Paul_30bd.html" title="New Perspective on Paul">New Perspective on Paul</a>. But in Acts, it is Peter who first opens up the way for the Gentiles. It is Peter who uses the strongest language in regard to the intolerable burden of the Law as a means of salvation (15:10f.; cf. 1), so-called <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legalism_%28theology%29.html" title="Legalism (theology)">Legalism (theology)</a>. Not a word is said of any difference of opinion between Peter and Paul at Antioch (Gal 2:11ff.). The brethren in Antioch send Paul and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnabas.html" title="Barnabas">Barnabas</a> up to Jerusalem to ask the opinion of the apostles and elders: they state their case, and carry back the decision to Antioch. Throughout the whole of Acts, Paul never stands forth as the unbending champion of the Gentiles. He seems continually anxious to reconcile the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Christians_2c5f.html" title="Jewish Christians">Jewish Christians</a> to himself by personally observing the law of Moses. He personally circumcises the semi-Jew, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy.html" title="Timothy">Timothy</a>; and he performs his vows in <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_in_Jerusalem_e1a8.html" title="Temple in Jerusalem">the temple</a>. He is particularly careful in his speeches to show how deep is his respect for the law of Moses. In all this, the letters of Paul are very different from Acts. In Galatians, he claims perfect freedom in principle, for himself as for the Gentiles, from the obligatory observance of the law; and neither in it nor in Corinthians does he take any notice of a decision to which the apostles had come in their meeting at Jerusalem. The narrative of Acts, too, itself implies something other than what it sets in relief; for why should the Jews hate Paul so much, if he was not in some sense disloyal to their Law?</p>
<p>This is not necessarily a contradiction; only such a difference of emphasis as belongs to the standpoints and aims of the two writers amid their respective historical conditions. Peter's function toward the Gentiles belongs to early conditions present in Judaea, before Paul's distinctive mission had taken shape. Once Paul's apostolate—a personal one, parallel with the more collective apostolate of "the Twelve"—has proved itself by tokens of Divine approval, Peter and his colleagues frankly recognize the distinction of the two missions, and are anxious only to arrange that the two shall not fall apart by religiously and morally incompatible usages (Acts 15). Paul, on his side, clearly implies that Peter felt with him that the Law could not justify (Gal 2:15ff.), and argues that it could not now be made obligatory in principle (cf. "a <a href="../../../y/o/k/Yoke.html" title="Yoke">yoke</a>," Acts 15:10); yet for Jews it might continue for the time (pending the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parousia.html" title="Parousia">Parousia</a>) to be seemly and expedient, especially for the sake of non-believing Judaism. To this he conformed his own conduct as a Jew, so far as his Gentile apostolate was not involved (1 Cor 9:19ff.). There is no reason to doubt that Peter largely agreed with him, since he acted in this spirit in Galatians 2:11f., until coerced by Jerusalem sentiment to draw back for expediency's sake. This incident simply did not fall within the scope of Acts to narrate, since it had no abiding effect on the Church's extension. As to Paul's submission of the issue in Acts 15 to the Jerusalem conference, Acts does not imply that Paul would have accepted a decision in favor of the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaizers.html" title="Judaizers">Judaizers</a>, though he saw the value of getting a decision for his own policy in the quarter where they were most likely to defer. If the view that he already had an understanding with the "Pillar" Apostles, as recorded in Galatians 2:1–10, be correct, it gives the best of reasons why he was ready to enter the later public Conference of Acts 15. Paul's own "free" attitude to the Law, when on Gentile soil, is just what is implied by the hostile rumors as to his conduct in Acts 21:21, which he would be glad to disprove as at least exaggerated (vv. 24 and 26).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Edit section: Speeches">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Speeches</span></h3>
<p>The speeches in Acts deserve special notice, because they constitute about 20% of the entire book. Given the nature of the times, lack of recording devices, and space limitations, many ancient historians did not reproduce verbatim reports of speeches. Condensing and using one's own style was often unavoidable. Nevertheless, there were different practices when it came to the level of creativity or adherence individual historians practiced.</p>
<p>On one end of the scale were those who seemingly invented speeches, such as the Sicilian historian <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timaeus.html" title="Timaeus">Timaeus</a> (356–260 BCE). Others, such as <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus_c1ef.html" title="Dionysius of Halicarnassus">Dionysius of Halicarnassus</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacitus.html" title="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, fell somewhere in between, reporting actual speeches but likely with significant liberty. The ideal for ancient historians, however, seems to have been to try as much as possible to report the sense of what was actually said, rather than simply placing one's own speech in a figure's mouth.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best example of this ideal was voiced by Polybius, who ridiculed Timaeus for his invention of speeches. Historians, Polybius wrote, were "to instruct and convince for all time serious students by the truth of the facts and the speeches he narrates" (<i>Hist.</i> 2.56.10–12). Another ancient historian, <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thucydides.html" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, admits to having taken some liberty while narrating speeches, but only when he did not have access to any sources. When he had sources, he used them. In his own words, Thucydides wrote speeches "of course adhering as closely as possible to the general sense of what was actually said" (<i><a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War_d688.html" title="History of the Peloponnesian War">History of the Peloponnesian War</a></i>, 1.22.1). Accordingly, as stated by C.W. Fornara, "[t]he principle was established that speeches were to be recorded accurately, though in the words of the historian, and always with the reservation that the historian could 'clarify'" (<i>The Nature of History in Ancient Greece and Rome</i>, p. 145).</p>
<p>On what end of the scale did the author of Acts fall? There is little doubt that the speeches of Acts are summaries or condensations largely in the style and vocabulary of its author. However, there are indications that the author of Acts relied on source material for his speeches, and did not treat them as mere vehicles for expressing his own theology. The author's apparent use of speech material in the Gospel of Luke, obtained from the Gospel of Mark and the hypothetical Q document or the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a>, suggests that he relied on other sources for his narrative and was relatively faithful in using them. Additionally, many scholars have viewed Acts' presentation of Stephen's speech, Peter's speeches in Jerusalem and, most obviously, Paul's speech in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miletus.html" title="Miletus">Miletus</a> as relying on source material or of expressing views not typical of Acts' author.<a href="http://www.christiancadre.org/member_contrib/cp_acts.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.christiancadre.org/member_contrib/cp_acts.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Additionally, there is no evidence that any speech in Acts is the free composition of its author, without either written or oral basis. Accordingly, in general, the author of Acts seems to be among the conscientious ancient historians, touching the essentials of historical accuracy, even as now understood.</p>

Sanday calls "an unreal and artificial standard, the standard of the 19th century rather than the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_century.html" title="1st century">1st</a>, of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> rather than <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_%28region%29.html" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a>, of the lamp and the study rather than of active life." This has a bearing, for instance, on the differences between the three accounts of Paul's conversion in Acts. In the recovery of a more real standard, we owe much to men like <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodor_Mommsen_9297.html" title="Theodor Mommsen">Mommsen</a>, Ramsay, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Blass_89d6.html" title="Friedrich Blass">Blass</a> and Harnack, trained amid other methods and traditions than those which had brought the constructive study of Acts almost to a deadlock.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Edit section: Structure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Structure</span></h2>
<p>The structure of the book of Luke<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> is closely tied with the structure of Acts.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup> Both books are most easily tied to the geography of the book. Luke begins with a global perspective, dating the birth of Jesus to the reign of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_emperors.html" title="Roman emperors">Roman emperors</a> in Luke 2:1 and 3:1. From there we see Jesus' ministry move from Galilee (chapters 4–9), through Samaria and Judea (chs. 10–19), to Jerusalem where he is <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucifixion.html" title="Crucifixion">crucified</a>, raised and ascended into <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">heaven</a> (chs. 19–24). The book of Acts follows just the opposite motion, taking the scene from Jerusalem (chs. 1–5), to Judea and Samaria (chs. 6–9), then traveling through <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> towards <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> (chs. 9–28). This <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiastic_structure.html" title="Chiastic structure">chiastic structure</a> emphasizes the centrality of the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrection.html" title="Resurrection">resurrection</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension.html" title="Ascension">ascension</a> to Luke's message, while emphasizing the universal nature of the gospel.</p>
<p>This geographic structure is foreshadowed in Acts 1:8, where Jesus says "You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem (chs. 1–5), and in all Judea and Samaria (chs. 6–9), and even to the remotest part of the earth (chs. 10–28)." The first two sections (chs. 1–9) represent the witness of the apostles to the Jews, while the last section (chs. 10–28) represent the witness of the apostles to the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentiles.html" title="Gentiles">Gentiles</a>.</p>
<p>The book of Acts can also be broken down by the major characters of the book. While the complete title of the book is the Acts of the Apostles, really the book focuses on only two of the apostles: Peter (chs. 1–12) and Paul (chs. 13–28).</p>
<p>Within this structure, the sub-points of the book are marked by a series of summary statements, or what one commentary calls a "progress report". Just before the geography of the scene shifts to a new location, Luke summarizes how the gospel has impacted that location. The standard for these progress reports is in 2:46–47, where Luke describes the impact of the gospel on the new church in Jerusalem. The remaining progress reports are located:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acts 6:7 Impact of the gospel in Jerusalem.</li>
<li>9:31 Impact of the gospel in Judea and Samaria.</li>
<li>12:24 Impact of the gospel in Syria.</li>
<li>16:5 Impact of the gospel in Asia Minor.</li>
<li>19:20 Impact of the gospel in Europe.</li>
<li>28:31 Impact of the gospel on Rome.</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure can be also seen as a series of concentric circles, where the gospel begins in the center, Jerusalem, and is expanding ever outward to Judea &amp; Samaria, Syria, Asia Minor, Europe, and eventually to Rome.</p>
<p>Again, just as in the prologue to Acts, Luke refers to his former treatise as being an "account of all that Jesus began to do and teach", so the impression is given that Acts itself is set forth as 'an account of what Jesus <i>continued</i> to do and teach', Christ himself being the principal <i>actor</i>.</p>

<p>External evidence now points to the existence of Acts at least as early as the opening years of the 2nd century. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Christianity_6b92.html" title="Conservative Christianity">Conservative Christian</a> scholars date the book of Acts early. For example, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Geisler_7f55.html" title="Norman Geisler">Norman Geisler</a> dates the book of Acts being written between 60-62 A.D. for a number of reasons.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> As evidence for the Third Gospel holds equally for Acts, its existence in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcion.html" title="Marcion">Marcion</a>'s day (120–140) is now assured.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Further, the traces of it in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polycarp.html" title="Polycarp">Polycarp</a> 6 and <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatius_of_Antioch_9e29.html" title="Ignatius of Antioch">Ignatius</a> 7 when taken together are highly probable; and it is even widely admitted that the resemblance of Acts 13:22 and <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistles_of_Clement_c2f2.html" title="Epistles of Clement">First Clement</a> 18:1, in features not found in <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalms.html" title="Psalms">Psalms</a> 89:20 quoted by each, can hardly be accidental. That is, Acts was probably current in Antioch and <a href="../../../i/z/m/%C4%B0zmir_4158.html" title="İzmir">Smyrna</a> not later than circa 115, and perhaps in Rome as early as circa 96.</p>
<p>With this view internal evidence agrees. In spite of some advocacy of a date prior to 70 since the book of Acts does not mention the destruction of Jerusalem, the bulk of critical opinion is decidedly against it<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. The prologue to Luke's Gospel itself implies the dying out of the generation of eyewitnesses as a class. A strong consensus supports a date about 80; some prefer 75 to 80; while a date between 70 and 75 seems no less possible. Two points used by advocates of pre-70 authorship is the fact that (1) <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nero.html" title="Nero">Nero's</a> mass execution of Christians in 64 is omitted, and (2) Paul's death is not recorded. Although point two can be addressed as being off focus with respect to Acts, the numerous amount of Christians that were killed would surely have contained a motif for the writer to record since in the very least it would offer a case of martyrdom. Of the reasons for a date in one of the earlier decades of the 2nd century, as argued by the <a href="../../../t/%C3%BC/b/T%C3%BCbingen_school.html" title="Tübingen school">Tübingen school</a> and its heirs, several are now untenable. Among these are the supposed traces of 2nd-century <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnosticism.html" title="Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a> and "<a href="../../../h/i/e/Hierarchy.html" title="Hierarchy">hierarchical</a>" ideas of organization<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>; but especially the argument from the relation of the Roman state to the Christians, which <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsay.html" title="Ramsay">Ramsay</a><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> has reversed and turned into proof of an origin prior to <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliny_the_Younger_1ce0.html" title="Pliny the Younger">Pliny's</a> correspondence with <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trajan.html" title="Trajan">Trajan</a> on the subject. Another fact, now generally admitted<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, renders a <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd-century.html" title="2nd-century">2nd-century</a> date yet more incredible; and that is the failure of a writer devoted to Paul's memory to make palpable use of his Epistles. Instead of this he writes in a fashion that seems to traverse certain things recorded in them. If, indeed, it were proved that Acts uses the later works of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus.html" title="Josephus">Josephus</a>, we should have to place the book about 100. But this is far from being the case.</p>
<p>Three points of contact with Josephus in particular are cited. (1) The circumstances attending the death of <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agrippa_I_b5c0.html" title="Agrippa I">Agrippa I</a> in <a href="../../../4/4/_/44.html" title="44">44</a>. Here Acts 12:21–23 is largely parallel to his <i><a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiquities_of_the_Jews_2130.html" title="Antiquities of the Jews">Antiquities</a></i> 19.8.2; but the latter adds an omen of coming doom, while Acts alone gives a circumstantial account of the occasion of Herod's public appearance. Hence the parallel, when analyzed, tells against dependence on Josephus. So also with (2) the cause of the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a> pseudo-prophet in Acts 21:37f. and in Josephus (<i><a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_War_d9ae.html" title="Jewish War">J.W.</a></i> 2.13.5; <i>A.J.</i> 20.8.6) for the numbers of his followers do not agree with either of Josephus's rather divergent accounts, while Acts alone calls them <i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicarii.html" title="Sicarii">Sicarii</a></i>. With these instances in mind, it is natural to regard (3) the curious resemblance as to the (nonhistorical) order in which <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theudas.html" title="Theudas">Theudas</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_of_Galilee_61cb.html" title="Judas of Galilee">Judas of Galilee</a> are referred to in both (Acts 5:36f.; <i>A.J.</i> 20.5.1) as accidental.</p>
<p>It is worth noting, however, that no ancient source actually mentions Acts by name prior to <a href="../../../1/7/7/177.html" title="177">177</a>. If it were composed prior to then, no one spoke of it by that name, or at least no one whose writings have survived down to the present day. This being an <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_from_silence.html" title="Argument from silence">argument from silence</a>, not withstanding, that just as previously mentioned <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Ignatius_of_Antioch_b4ef.html" title="Saint Ignatius of Antioch">Saint Ignatius of Antioch</a> (c. 35-107) quotes from the book of <a href="http://www.ntcanon.org/Ignatius.shtml#Acts" class="external text" title="http://www.ntcanon.org/Ignatius.shtml#Acts" rel="nofollow">Acts</a> as he also quotes from the gospel of <a href="http://www.ntcanon.org/Ignatius.shtml#Gospel_of_Luke" class="external text" title="http://www.ntcanon.org/Ignatius.shtml#Gospel_of_Luke" rel="nofollow">Luke</a>.

<p>The place of composition is still an open question. For some time Rome and Antioch have been in favor, and Blass combined both views in his theory of two editions. But internal evidence points strongly to the Roman province of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Province_af60.html" title="Asia Province">Asia</a>, particularly the neighborhood of <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephesus.html" title="Ephesus">Ephesus</a>. Note the confident local allusion in 19:9 to "the school of Tyrannus" and in 19:33 to "Alexander"; also the very minute topography in 20:13–15. At any rate affairs in that region, including the future of the church of Ephesus (20:28–30), are treated as though they would specially interest "Theophilus" and his circle; also an early tradition makes Luke die in the adjacent <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bithynia.html" title="Bithynia">Bithynia</a>. Finally it was in this region that there arose certain early glosses (e.g., 19:9; 20:15), probably the earliest of those referred to below. How fully in correspondence with such an environment the work would be, as apologia for the Church against the Synagogue's attempts to influence Roman policy to its harm, must be clear to all familiar with the strength of Judaism in Asia (cf. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Revelation_4ea8.html" title="Book of Revelation">Rev</a> 2:9, 3:9; and see Sir W. M. Ramsay, <i>The Letters to the Seven Churches</i>, ch. xii.).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Edit section: Manuscripts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Manuscripts</span></h2>
<p>Like most biblical books, there are differences between the earliest surviving manuscripts of Acts. In the case of Acts, however, the differences between the surviving manuscripts is more substantial. The two earliest versions of manuscripts are the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_text-type.html" title="Western text-type">Western text-type</a> (as represented by the <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Bezae_d816.html" title="Codex Bezae">Codex Bezae</a>) and the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandrian_text-type.html" title="Alexandrian text-type">Alexandrian text-type</a> (as represented by the <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Sinaiticus_96ac.html" title="Codex Sinaiticus">Codex Sinaiticus</a>). The version of Acts preserved in the Western manuscripts contains about 10% more content than the Alexandrian version of Acts. Since the difference is so great, scholars have struggled to determine which of the two versions is closer to the original text composed by the original author.</p>
<p>The earliest explanation, suggested by Swiss theologian <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Leclerc_%28theologian%29_b461.html" title="Jean Leclerc (theologian)">Jean LeClerc</a> in the 17th century, posits that the longer Western version was a first draft, while the Alexandrian version represents a more polished revision by the same author. Adherents of this theory argue that even when the two versions diverge, they both have similarities in vocabulary and writing style-- suggesting that the two shared a common author. However, it has been argued that if both texts were written by the same individual, they should have exactly identical theologies and they should agree on historical questions. Since most modern scholars do detect subtle theological and historical differences between the texts, most scholars do not subscribe to the rough-draft/polished-draft theory.</p>
<p>A second theory assumes common authorship of the Western and Alexandrian texts, but claims the Alexandrian text is the short first draft, and the Western text is a longer polished draft. A third theory is that the longer Western text came first, but that later, some other redactor abbreviated some of the material, resulting in the shorter Alexandrian text.</p>
<p>While these other theories still have a measure of support, the modern consensus is that the shorter Alexandrian text is closer to the original, and the longer Western text is the result of later insertion of additional material into the text.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup> It is believed that the material in the Western text which isn't in the Alexandrian text reflects later theological developments within Christianity. For examples, the Western text features a greater hostility to Judaism, a more positive attitude towards a Gentile Christianity, and other traits which appear to be later additions to the text. Some also note that the Western text attempts to minimize the emphasis Acts places on the role of women in the early Christian church.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>A third class of manuscripts, known as the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_text-type.html" title="Byzantine text-type">Byzantine text-type</a>, is often considered to have developed after the Western and Alexandrian types. The extant manuscripts of this type date from the 5th century or later; however, papyrus fragments show that this text-type may date as early as the Alexandrian or Western text-types.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup> The Byzantine text-type served as the basis for the 16th century <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textus_Receptus_8cfe.html" title="Textus Receptus">Textus Receptus</a>, the first Greek-language version of the New Testament to be printed by printing press. The Textus Receptus, in turn, served as the basis for the New Testament found in the English-language <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Bible_1b4e.html" title="King James Bible">King James Bible</a>. Today, the Byzantine text-type is the subject of renewed interest as the possible original form of the text from which the Western and Alexandrian text-types were derived.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
