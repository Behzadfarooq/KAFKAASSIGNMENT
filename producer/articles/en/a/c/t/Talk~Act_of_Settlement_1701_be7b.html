<p><i>Such decisions are made by the Prime Minister, whose own religion (if any) may be in conflict with the Church of England. This situation is rendered possible because, on the one hand, religious tests have never applied to public offices such as the Prime Minister (and under contemporary anti-discrimination laws it would be illegal to do so), while on the other hand, such a religious test not only is but must be applied to the monarch.</i></p>
<p>I was under the impression that the Appointments Secretary who advises the Prime Minister on appointments of bishops and the like must be an Anglican, and that the Catholic Relief Act specifically forbids a Catholic from advising the monarch as to appointments within the CofE. Also the Queen is immune from prosecution and the appointment of a prime minister is one of the royal prerogatives which the courts historically have held to be outside the scope of judicial revieq. The Queen could refuse (in theory) to appoint a non-anglican as Prime Minister and there's nothing anyone could do about it in the courts. - <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrism_8422.html" title="User:Chrism">Chrism</a> 18:22, May 23, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Queen could <i>in theory</i> refuse to to appoint anyone for any reason. But to do so would be a revolutionary act and cause a crisis. James II and Edward VIII learnt the consequences of such behaviour. Iain Duncan-Smith and Charles Kennedy are Roman Catholics; Michael Howard is Jewish; Neville Chamberlain was Unitarian; Ramsey MacDonald and Alec Douglas-Hume were Scottish, while David Lloyd George was Welsh and disestablished the Church in Wales. There has been no suggestion that any of them would be unable to be Prime Minister on religious grounds; the usual practice is to finger a convenient CofE cabinet minister to be responsible for bishops. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 16:00, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the Queen and all her descendants die leaving no heirs the succession goes 'back up the tree' as it were, and this allows us to come up with an order of succession in which we list descendants in order and then go back up the tree when we run out. According to the general rules of succession as we all understand them this is an open-ended process, and provided we know the genealogy we can keep going and come up with a very long list of people, getting ever more distantly related to the present Queen as we go. But the Act of Settlement restricts all this to the descendants of one historical figure. Hypothetically speaking, if I was to wipe out all living descendants of Sophia, and I know there must be an enormous number by now, am I right in saying that no one would be entitled to succeed to the throne? We wouldn't be able to find a descendant of, let's say, Sophia's uncle, and give them the throne, because the Act means that she is the cut-off point. (I'm aware that all this is very poorly worded, but hopefully you'll get the gist of what I'm talking about.) What would happen in such a situation? — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 12:42, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even in the incredibly unlikely event of them all dying there is no problem, as the title to the Crown is not entirely dependent upon statute; we could fall back on the common law (see my article at [<a href="http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/Succession_Law.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/Succession_Law.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]).<a href="../../../n/c/o/User%7ENcox_1ae9.html" title="User:Ncox">Ncox</a> 02:04, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What would happen is that Parliament would simply pass a new law regarding succession (it would probably do this even if all 5,000 were not wiped out, as many of that 5,000 would probably be considered unsuitable), the problem would be, how could Royal Assent to the law be given if there is no Monarch. An ex post facto law could be past - Parliament can do anything - yet the Monarch is part of that Parliament, and a circular reasoning situation could develop, with a law being valid because it was Assented to by the Monarch, but the Monarch, and the Assent, only being valid because of that law. A similar situation arose after King James's 'abdication'.

<dd>The UK parliament couldn't "simply pass a new law regarding succession" - the line of succession is under the shared control of 16 different countries, some of which have the Act of Settlement as an inherited part of their own constitution. By the convention laid out in the preamble to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_Westminster%2C_1931_84eb.html" title="Statute of Westminster, 1931">Statute of Westminster, 1931</a> (also a part of each <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Realm_4960.html" title="Commonwealth Realm">Commonwealth Realm</a>'s constitution) no one country can alter the line of succession without the approval of the 15 others - and that includes the UK. In Canada alone such a change would require the consent of all ten provincial legislatures, plus the federal parliament. Not impossible, but clearly more than simply passing new legislation. --gbambino 14:23, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously it would take agreement by all Commonwealth states to change the head of the Commonwealth, but is there a constitutional rule that each member must have the same monarch? A few years back I heard of a proposal in Australia to change the succession as to Australia alone (in favor of Anne). —<a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETamfang_5c14.html" title="User:Tamfang">Tamfang</a> 03:47, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Queen's position as Head of the Commonwealth is ceremonial only, and has nothing to do with her roles as Head of State of sixteen independent <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Realm_4960.html" title="Commonwealth Realm">Commonwealth Realms</a>. For these sixteen countries the Statute of Westminster requires that they all be in agreement over any changes to the line of succession. However, it's only a convention, and not legally binding. So, technically Australia (or Canada, or the UK, or Jamaica, etc.) could break symmetry and create its own different line of succession, but this would breach convention - a convention which an Ontario judge said was strong enough to be one reason the court couldn't overturn the Act of Settlemnt within the Canadian constitution. --gbambino 15:29, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are several Republics in the Commonwealth, so I see no theoretical reason that there couldn't be a monarchy with its own king/queen. The interesting question is what would happen if, say, Australia passed a different succession law and therefore ended up with a different monarch than the rest of the Commonwealth. Would that new King (or Queen) of Australia move to Australia? If so, would Australia retain their Governor-General, or would the position now be moot, since their monarch would be <i>in</i> Australia, hence no need for a viceregal office? <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENik42_afcf.html" title="User:Nik42">Nik42</a> 06:46, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also within the Commonwealth are a few kingdoms under different dynasties. So, yes, Australia, or Jamaica, or St. Kitts could alter their line of succession, thereby making them a kingdom with a separate monarch to the other 15 Commonwealth Realms, but still under the same House of Windsor. It actually happened for one day in 1936, when all the Realm parliaments passed their respective acts allowing Edward VIII to abdicate, save for the Irish parliament, which didn't get around to it until a day later. So, for one day each Realm had George VI as king, while Ireland still had Edward VIII.</dd>
<dd>I've heard that this was proposed in Australia some time ago: the Earl of Wessex, or some other junior Royal, would be selected as King of Australia. However, it never went through - most likely due to the questions you raise: Where would the sovereign live? What would become of the Governor General? Etc. Not to mention the fact that it still breaches the convention laid out in the Statute of Westminster, and the approval of the other 15 Realms would most likely still need to be sought, if only at least out of courtesy. --gbambino 16:19, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The statute of Westminster does not prevent the UK parliament, and probably a number of other parliaments, from changing the line of succession, with or without the approval of the other countries. Parliament cannot bind itself.

<p>I wonder if this Act would stand or fail in the EU supreme court?</p>
<p>It could probably justified on the grounds that its a legitimate restriction under the Equal Treatment Framework Directive (article 4 clause 2) - a religious body (in this case the CofE) can require its officers (in this case the Supreme Governor) to be an adherent of that religion. - <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrism_8422.html" title="User:Chrism">Chrism</a> 12:19, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is no good excuse, because it would be very easy to separate the role of head of CofE and that of the monarch, so there be no reason to argue for one via the other. But the point is rather moot, since monarchy and established church are concepts that are against human nature and thus must be struck down and the islands made into a secular republican democracy. - User:195.70.32.136 17:55, Dec 30, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I can see the arguement about having the CoE head being a CoE, requiring the head of state to be a certain religion is more shakey. The requirement that they can marry anyone except catholics is the hardest to justify, though. As it stands, the monarch can marry a jew, a muslim, a athetist, a jedi, or even a follower of the <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a>, but not a Catholic.

<dd>What I've heard in the past is that if William really had his head set on marrying a Catholic that Parliment would probably change the rules to accomodate him.<br />

<dd>In 1980 the Cabinet set up a committee to investigate the implications of Prince Charles marrying a Roman Catholic, as there was the possibility of him marrying a Luxembourg princess. The Royal family personally have never had any problems marry whoever they want, it is Parliament which has left them in the present position.<a href="../../../n/c/o/User%7ENcox_1ae9.html" title="User:Ncox">Ncox</a> 02:04, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Act seems to have two parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>The head of state must be a Protestant descendant of Sophia</li>
<li>The Monarch/heir cannot marry a Catholic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, they seem to get entangled in the article. For example, in the paragraph trying to show both sides of removing the part 2 clause, it shows the proponent arguements for removing part 2, but the opponents' response seems to be defending part 1. It would be nicer if it were possible to break down the pros and cons into for/againt whole act, and for/against removing just that clause.</p>

<p>Tony Blair has stated that he would amend or repeal the Act of Settlement 1701 and does not agree with it - indeed he was quoted in a newspaper interview before the election as saying that it was 'plainly discriminatory' but that the burden of work involved in changing this law, and the limited real-world effect meant that it was not a priority. 136.2.1.101 11:43, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The situation regarding Adrian Hilton was not directly related to the pronouncements of Michael Howard, but largely a reaction to a Catholic Herald article during the election.

<p>The situation is more complex than presented in the article. There are two configurations:</p>
<p>1. Countries that have cut legal and constitutional ties with Britain, e.g. Canada (Canada Act) and Australia (Australia Act). In these realms any changes to the Act of Settlement 1701 (Imperial) would not affect the Act of Settlement 1701 (Canada) etc. However, in these countries the Crowns are <i>de jure</i> divorced from the British Crown already, and exist as entirely seperate legal and constitutional entities - even if the currently happen to be held by the same person (e.g. Queen of Barbados, Queen of Jamaica, etc.). The succession according to the existing Act of Settlement 1701 is a constitutional clause in New Zealand at least. Repeal or amendment of the Act of Settlement in these situations would not cause any legal problems in the UK, but could cause real-world difficulties in other countries (potentially breaking the 'personal union' relationship between the Commonwealth Realms).</p>
<p>2. Countries that still have tied-legal systems, including the right of the Imperial Parliament (Westminster) to legislate for them (overriding local law). The Statute of Westminster 1931 tempers this right by requiring Westminster to have consent before doing so (c.f. Abdication Act 1936), and this is very specific in the case of any change to the succession requiring approval of all 16 Commonwealth Realms - including those that now in legal practice have a distinct Crown. Even with agreement on a change this is still logistically difficult, and the course most commonly suggested by constitutional lawyers in the UK is to nullify this requirementin any legislation to make the amendment - earlier Acts do not bind Parliament against taking a different course later. To quote Geoffrey Robertson QC "The statute of Westminster is not a bar to progressive reform of the monarchy. Just like any other statute, it can be amended by a later act of parliament. There is no legal reason why a Commonwealth country can veto a UK government enactment."</p>
<p>Overall though, any unilateral change to the religious or any other succession requirement (such as male-preference primogeniture) could potentially break the union and symmetry of the Commonwealth Realm crowns. 136.2.1.101 11:43, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello user 136 in configeration 1. above you mention that repeal or ammendment of the Act of Settlement in countries that have no constitutional ties to the UK could cause real world difficulties in other countries - potentialy breaking the personal union relationship between the Commonwealth Realms . Could you elaborate on what those difficulties would be&#160;? ( considering that they have no constitutional ties ) Lejon 10:20 19 Mar 06</p>

<p>References to the Act being from 1700 (such as the ACT register of legislation in the link) are due to the change in New Year's Day from 25th March to 1st January in England that occured in 1752. There is no fixed convention on whether to quote in Old Style (OS), New Style (NS), or the combined form that would read 1700/1.</p>
<p>The UK Parliament always refers to legislation by the OS year, and refers to this Act as the 'Act of Settlement 1700' in formal documents, although common usage (as recorded in Hansard in debates) is to use the modern form of 1701.</p>
<p>136.2.1.101 11:58, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The reason is that before 1793, Acts came into force on the first day of the session that parliament sat. See <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_Parliament_%28Commencement%29_Act_1793_805b.html" title="Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793">Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793</a>. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurando_7134.html" title="User:Kurando">Kurando</a> | <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKurando_4c8b.html" title="User talk:Kurando">^_^</a> 09:27, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's definitely this reason and the old style/new style reason because the act was passed in June 1701. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurando_7134.html" title="User:Kurando">Kurando</a> | <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKurando_4c8b.html" title="User talk:Kurando">^_^</a> 09:52, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some of the aspects of the law listed would seem to no longer apply. If this is so, it should be stated - as is the case with "no monarch can leave the British Isles without the consent of Parliament". The section I'm talking about (althought I don't know for sure they no longer apply) are -</p>
<ul>
<li>That no foreigner—even if naturalized (unless they were born of English parents)—shall be allowed to be a Privy Councillor or a member of both Houses of Parliament, or hold "any office or place of trust, either civil or military, or to have any grant of lands, tenements or hereditaments from the Crown, to himself or to any other or others in trust for him".</li>
<li>That no person who has an office under the monarch or receives a pension from the Crown can be an MP. This provision was inserted to avoid unwelcome royal influence over the Commons.</li>

<dd>I would have thought that naturalized citizens could run for parliament and serve in the military and government.
