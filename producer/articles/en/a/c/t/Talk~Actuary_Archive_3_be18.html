<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>The Dutch Johan de Witt (1625 - 1672) is seen as the first actuary. In 1671 he published "Waarden van Lijf-renten naar Proportie van Los-renten", which is regarded as the start of actuarial science. He showed that the government paid too much when buying annuities (annuities were used since the Middle Ages already as a way to buy an old age income for an individual). De Witt showed that by applying probability theory the price of an annuity could be reduced significantly. It is not unlikely that his violent death in 1672 had a link with this publication. The lower annuity payments were seen as a severe reduction in income for the "poor" widows. It certainly added to the bad press he and his brother already had.</p>

<dd>If that's true then yes, definatly. Its too specific from the film for me to remeber, and the <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fight_club.html" title="Fight club">fight club</a> article says he works for a car company recalling defective products, but we aren't supposed to use internal refences.

<dd>The narrator in Fight Club is <i>not</i> an actuary. He inspects defective cars and notes how many have gone wrong due to the car company's negligence. This is not at all actuarial work, especially as he does not do it for insurance purposes but rather to find out the car manufacturer's breakdown rate. Let me try and clarify what it <i>is</i> about. An actuary would not typically go out on site and investigate claims. Other people would do that and then the actuary would then use that claim-frequency information (coupled with the financial impact of the claim) to estimate the insurance company's liablities. It is a mathematical office job, we do not go and check out car wreckages or attend funerals to ensure life insurance claims are valid. Typically you're dealing with thousands or even millions of policies and claims as an actuary; any individual one is of little interest to you, rather the overall statistical happenings are what is of importance.--<a href="../../../z/o/s/User%7EZoso_Jade_9110.html" title="User:Zoso Jade">Zoso Jade</a> 11:12, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Granted, it's easy work that pays incredibly well, especially once you've passed the 10 actuarial exams and become a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries. However, many people who are actuaries have incredibly poor social skills. You wouldn't believe the number of people who are in the field who have the smarts to pass all ten exams, yet are in real life socially-retarded. In addition, actuaries make mistakes left and right. They are not perfect - although they promote the illusion that they are.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.36.184.212 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.36.184.212_2f2a.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.36.184.212">contribs</a>) 08:56, September 10, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

He didn't counter by claiming that all actuaries are warm, fuzzy, good-looking individuals. How is he excluded from pointing out a pointless stereotype? Or are you quite seriously going to sit here and claim that all actuaries (i.e. tens of thousands of people the world over) fit the profile? What is all this doing on Wikipedia anyway?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Praise" style of summary in main page</span></h2>
<p>With no intention to undervalue the actuary profession, I find that the summary in Featured Article section in the main page is phrased a bit too much as a praise to the profession, taking more words to mention what experts actuaries are, mentioning explicitly the depth of skills they require, etc. I think the summary should focus more NPOV-alike on the essence of the profession, and not on the amount of virtues and responsibilities the profession requires (as many others do).</p>
<p>The style of text in the Featured Article section in the main page seems more like the summary of an "elite insurance force". -- Zoopee 22:13, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I had the same thought when I read the summary on the main page. "Actuaries are highly trained experts with a deep understanding of financial security systems, their reasons for being, their complexity, their mathematics, and the way they work". This text is not contained in the article, "highly trained" and "deep understanding", when combined together in one sentence at the beginning of the summary, doesn't look NPOV at all. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 22:51, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Approximately ten years of examinations after college should qualify as "highly trained" in a completely impartial sense. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 03:30, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is nonsensical. The ability to ace multiple choice exams after having taken a review course (more than likely the same courses, multiple times) does not convey either virtuousness or professionalism or respect. The actuarial exams serve as a gatekeeper, keeping the number of acutaries artificially low and their salaries grossly inflated. Perhaps this truly explains the fallacy that actuaries are "highly trained". It's a scam to convince the public that they are more important than they really are. Remember, most actuarial work can be automated/computerized, and the work itself is determined and regulated by law. So, actuaries need no creativity or business savvy, and rarely if ever exhibit any true common sense. E.g.: If a client needs to reduce their annual defined benefit pension plan cost, they "suggest" to the actuary that they need to increase their pension plan's expected rate of return of invested assets. The actuary willingly "complies". Sound like professionalism to you? Or maybe just the common sense to keep the client happy, and the invoices paid, regardless of whether the acutarial report truly reflects the needs of the pension plan participants.

<dd>Not highly trained? Methinks someone has not taken an actuarial exam in his or her life. I don't know about elsewhere but the UK doesn't have any multiple choice exams. Here's the CT4 exam (just the fourth of 15 exams) I did in April for you to try your hand at (<a href="http://www.actuaries.org.uk/files/pdf/pastpapers/2006apr/ct4x_a06.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.actuaries.org.uk/files/pdf/pastpapers/2006apr/ct4x_a06.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). I know people with a<a href="../../../f/i/r/First_class_degree.html" title="First class degree">first class degree</a> in subjects ranging from math to astrophysics at universities such as Oxford, the LSE and Cambridge who still failed said exams and I don't think anyone who knows anything about actuaries would contest the statement "highly trained". Your statements on a perceived lack of "professionalism" and even "respect" are far less NPOV than the article so I don't see how they are constructive. If you want to prove that actuaries aren't really all that important , please feel free to make your point by pointing out the numerous successful insurance sectors in countries without actuaries. Also handy will be an alternative to using actuarial math for insurance products... perhaps rolling a die? Or maybe some sort of astrological methodology?--<a href="../../../z/o/s/User%7EZoso_Jade_9110.html" title="User:Zoso Jade">Zoso Jade</a> 13:10, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Perhaps the British actuarial societies have different exams, but at the very least the first 3 exams given by the Society of Actuaries in America are indeed multiple choice (which, granted, you still have to work out to get the correct answer). Regardless of the format, however, everyone takes review courses and crams for the exams, just like with any other certification exams - the CPA exam included. So, again, just because someone can pass a slew of exams means only that they crammed for a particularly narrow subject and passed an exam. Most people do not pass these actuarial exams on their first try - it takes 2 to 3 attempts for most people. Anyone who denies that the exams are used as a "gatekeeper" to keep people out of the profession is living in a state of denial. 90% of the material on these exams is NEVER used in the real world by 90% of actuaries. Everything is reduced to computer programs that clerks can and do run in the normal course of the business day. Also, passing some pen and paper exams means nothing re common sense and integrity. Finally, your comment re "astrological methodology" as a comeback response only highlights how immature and socially retarded actuaries are.

<dd>There is something rather ironic about being called immature by a person who has to sink to personal insults to make a point (though, possibly due to my social retardation, I'm struggling to get what the point is). What do you do, dear sir? I take it you must belong to a profession where all are above reproach? Do I believe that there is a lot of hoop-jumping in the actuarial exams? I do. However to attempt to make the point that the exams are unnecessarily difficult and serve as little else than a barrier while simultaneously claiming that the actuaries who did make the cut make too many mistakes sounds contradictory to me. --<a href="../../../z/o/s/User%7EZoso_Jade_9110.html" title="User:Zoso Jade">Zoso Jade</a> 13:49, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Yupe siounds like actuaries are better than others. Leaves you with some annoyance, reading it... And on a second thought (and a secon re-read) I think the article needs re-wrtiging. Seriouslly!? the first paragraph, the one that has to be the main and broad introduction of what it is BADLY written! It is too technical, this technical aspect can be moved to later paragraphs, and has to be simplified. Afterall this is a general encyclopedia entry, not a specialised text, while specialised bits should be stated later on!<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 195.68.200.21 (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.68.200.21.html" title="User talk:195.68.200.21">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.68.200.21_cc63.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.68.200.21">contribs</a>) 03:41, September 11, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd><small>Actuaries' insurance disciplines may be classified as life, health, pensions, annuities, and asset management, social welfare programs, property, casualty, liability, general insurance and reinsurance. Life, health, and pension actuaries deal with mortality risk, morbidity, and consumer choice regarding the ongoing utilization of drugs and medical services risk, and investment risk. Products prominent in their work include life insurance, annuities, pensions, mortgage and credit insurance, short and long term disability, and medical, dental, health savings accounts and long term care insurance. In addition to these risks, social insurance programs are greatly influenced by public opinion, politics, budget constraints, changing demographics and other factors such as medical technology, inflation and cost of living considerations (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2005).</small></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clarification on what an actuary actually does</span></h2>
<p>Let's say an actuary works for a life insurance firm. Would part of his job entail reviewing potential clients and establishing an estimated life expectancy? You'll have to excuse my ignorance, I've never spoken to an actuary before, and I didn't seem to find the answer to this exact question in the article. I'm asking for two reasons: the first is that I'm currently at work on a short story that involves a person performing the task I described above, and I need to know if that's the job of an actuary. The second is that if an actuary doesn't perform this task, it should probably be noted in the article, as I'm sure I wouldn't be the first person to have made this misguided assumption. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Silvers_da83.html" title="User:Jeff Silvers">Jeff Silvers</a> 01:33, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>An actuary would not look at any individual person to estimate their life expectancy. Actuaries deal with whole populations; given the number of policyholders in a particular Life insurer in the UK (hundreds of thousands), we can estimate how many will die each year to a good degree of accuracy based on simple info such as age, sex and whether or not the person is a smoker. No one goes through each policy any more but rather they are done with computer programs called models. But that isn't the end. There is a great misunderstanding with actuaries that most of what we do is to do with probability of dying; rather this is just the underlying issue. It's the finance we calculate. There is no point in an insurer just knowing how many people are going to die; if they're all poor people expecting payouts of $50,000 then the impact is far less important than they are if they're all rich people expecting payouts of $5 million. Insurers are interested in their financial liability. How much they're going to have to payout each year. This may be largely determined by death rate, but the finance is really the tricky part... Life insurance policies aren't very simple anymore. Now we have people whose policies are linked to the NYSE, we have joint policies so a certain amount is paid out if the husband dies, another if the wife does, and yet another if both do. In the UK we have with-profits policies where the policyholder's get profits even without making claims. Also paying out $100,000 today is vastly different from paying it out ten years from now. When claims are going to be made it of utmost importance. There are thousands of other complications meaning it would be impractical to perform calculations on a person by person basis.</p>
<p>The job you described is probably closer to what (I imagine) an underwriter does. They're more about the collection and assessing of data. As an actuary you simply get all the data for every policyholder presented to you on a database and then you work with it (usually by passing it through an actuarial model). I hope this helps.--<a href="../../../z/o/s/User%7EZoso_Jade_9110.html" title="User:Zoso Jade">Zoso Jade</a> 07:14, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I know a few people from college who used a similar survey to select the actuarial profession, only to realize they had made a mistake.

<p>A few points:</p>
<ol>
<li>The policy is not “mine”, but wikipedia's as a whole.</li>
<li>The policy does not mean that wikipedia is filled with “gonzo” studies, because improper studies are almost always repudiated by published reliable and verifiable sources.</li>
<li>Regarding bias, I believe you are laboring under a misunderstanding of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. It does not mean that one must approach an article as having a lobotomy. It means that all significant points-of-view must be described in the article in proportion to their acceptance/significance. But in no way shape or form does it mean that the policies of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> are placed in abeyance.</li>
<li>The fact that I am an actuary does not mean that I cannot adhere to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> anymore than the fact that you are an IP editor means that you cannot.</li>
<li>I have over 9000 edits in over 3200 different articles in the english wikipedia project, so I believe you are somewhat mistaken in your assumptions about my edit history as well <a href="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.gif_8d37.html" class="image" title="image:smile.gif"><img src="../../../upload/shared/f/fb/Smile.gif" alt="image:smile.gif" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.gif_8d37.html" /></a> -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 03:32, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The survey used six key criteria to rank jobs: environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands, security and stress.

<dd>Greenocean, Coming in late on this discussion, I cannot help but feel that your statement does in fact violate NPOV through implied sarcasm. It seems to be written with an agenda and that is to discredit the survey. Your assumption that doctors definitely have better jobs than biologists is biased within itself. I don't know for certain that biologists are just failed doctors. This survey was based on a variety of factors that, at least to me, seem reasonable in their judgement. I don't think it is a coincidence that every job you hinted was obviously better was higher paying than the "inferior" job.</dd>

<dd>On the topic of actuaries in particular, if your children come on this site and read about the profession, they would do well to read the study section of the page. You talk about tempering the article but there is much mention, in this section, of the high fail rates and frustrations that actuarial students face. I'm not sure what your experience is with actuaries but I have seldom heard ill of the profession (bar the exams, of which I have heard - and said - much ill) by its own members. I don't have numbers to hand but I know in the UK the rate of leaving the profession for qualifieds is one of the lowest for any profession. Few professions sustain such large salaries for so few hours so I'm not entirely sure what your so scared of your children experiencing. What, exactly, is the problem with them expressing an interest in such a terrible profession?--<a href="../../../z/o/s/User%7EZoso_Jade_9110.html" title="User:Zoso Jade">Zoso Jade</a> 09:48, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The question of whether or not to keep the "the survey goes on to state..." portion boils down to this: is that statement intended to push a certain viewpoint regarding actuaries? If so, then it's <s>N</s>POV. If not, then it's irrelevant. Either way, it doesn't belong in the article. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Silvers_da83.html" title="User:Jeff Silvers">Jeff Silvers</a> 17:47, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Agreed. Also, the ranking of those jobs is over a number of criteria. For example, yes lawyers make much more than paralegals, but they also work hours that often lead to medical complicatinos such as heart attacks and strokes, they leave school usually over US$100,000 in debt, and if they do not make partner in a few years may burn out. So the interpretation being supplied by the implied sarcasm in the sentence is purely a POV of the author, and, I believe, has nothing to do directly with actuaries or the facts in this article, and it does not belong. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 20:21, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The line "The survey goes on to state that paralegals have better jobs than attorneys, biologists have better jobs than doctors, and accountants have better jobs than CEOs" contains only fact. It doesn't say doctors have better jobs than biologists, or that biologists are failed doctors. It doesn't say actuaries don't have excellent jobs. Those are things you read into the facts. This edit simply reconciles, in a fair and balanced way, the dispute between Avi and the original editor. I think it should stay. Further, I agree that since Avi and Zozo Jade are actuaries, the ethical thing would be for them to avoid involvement in this dispute. --Greenocean1 00:27, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>But its inclusion in this article is only to poke implied snide assertions about the study. The facts are what they are, if you feel it flawed, by all means, have a similar study published in a reliable and verifiable source and include it here. Secondly, I would recommend you carefully revisit <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, as you seem to be under a fundemental misconception as to what it means. Thirdly, I suggest you read <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> as well. Noone own any article, and asking for people not to edit, especially if they are experts in the field, smacks of a violation of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>.

<dd>"But its inclusion in this article is only to poke implied snide assertions about the study." That is merely your perception of the facts, and is your POV. Again I point out the edit contains only fact and does not state anything negative about actuaries or the study. Please stop being so insecure about the desirability of your profession. If it's really a good profession then why do you care about such a small edit? --Greenocean1 18:28, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Let me start by saying that I'm an actuary (Hi Avi!) and that I don't put any trust in surveys of "the best place to live," "the best car to drive," or "the best job in America."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Having made those disclaimers, I have a few thoughts about the paragraph in question.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First, the final sentence of the paragraph sticks out like a sore thumb because it has nothing to do with the first two sentences. If it must stay, find some way to tie it to the rest of the paragraph.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second, I agree with Avi that the final sentence is loaded with value judgments. Why not mention some of the the other top jobs in the survey (paralegal, astronomer) and mention some that didn't make the top ten (doctors, lawyers) -- without comparing biologists and doctors, paralegals and lawyers, etc.? In my opinion, that helps to remove the value judgment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, the final sentence is grammatically inconsistent with the rest of the paragraph. "A WSJ survey <b>listed</b> actuary. The survey <b>used</b>. The survey <b>goes on to state</b>." <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalik_Shabazz_a2fa.html" title="User:Malik Shabazz">Malik Shabazz</a> 20:30, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Greenocean</b>, the concept that one cannot edit an occupational article on Wikipedia if one is a member of the occupation is absurd. If I want to find out more about the medical profession, I ask one of my doctor friends. I don't approach a banker or a bus driver, for instance, and ask what the perks of being a doctor are, because I think an actual doctor will be too biased. Bias on Wikipedia is governed by strict and lengthy rules set out for the website. Exactly who is editing the article, or whatever bias they may personally have is rendered irrelevant as all content added must:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>a. Be relevant (which your proposed insertion is not)</dd>
<dd>b. Not express a point of view as fact</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I actually disagree with Malik that you can still slip that info in by just listing other professions. It is irrelevant. I am not saying this to glorify the actuarial profession; I am saying it because you want to paste irrelevant information on a site in order to express your own bias. It has nothing to do with the actuarial profession. To make my post constructive, I'll tell you what you <i>can</i> do. You can create a separate article on the WSJ rankings, list all the professions you like there and then link to your page here. In that situation any interested reader can go to that page, review the list of professions and decide <i>on their own</i> whether they consider the list absurd. But you cannot hand pick and choose a few professions (Why those professions in particular? From memory hundreds of professions were included in the survey) and paste their results on the <i>actuary</i> page. At best it makes no sense, at worst it is an attempt to bias. I advise you give up soon. Posters like Avi have been working on this page for ages, I doubt they will allow your paragraph stay on this page and if an edit war begins, an administrator will interfere and only reach the same conclusion I have... that it is irrelevant and has no place in the article--<a href="../../../z/o/s/User%7EZoso_Jade_9110.html" title="User:Zoso Jade">Zoso Jade</a> 17:00, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I thought about it last night and I was going to write something similar to what Zoso Jade wrote. That sentence has absolutely nothing to do with an article about actuaries.

<dd>The actuarial profession evolved from the study of human mortality and morbidity. While statistics as a whole does benefit greatly from the study of games of chance, actuaries in soecific do not, and the connection to bookmaking is tenuous and misleading.

<p>User:Avraham introduced the word "statistics", which seems a total non-sequiter. The use of statistics is universal in most disciplines and is irrevelant to the current discussion. Here we are talking about chance outcomes; of life expectancy or winning an event. Bookmakers(directly) along with actuaries(or their employers) have a finincial interest in the outcome of chance events. Both are professiionals in their own analagous spheres. Both have mathematical underpinnings. Accordingly the comparison is relevant. Consequently the information about the study of games of chance leading on to actuarial development and the comparison with similar practitioners is appropriate for reinstatement. <a href="../../../t/a/y/User%7ETayana_a32c.html" title="User:Tayana">Tayana</a> 15:18, 12 December 2006 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe you are incorrect on any number of fronts.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Bookmakers set odds for various outcomes of individual sporting events. No actuary would ever calculate ods for an individual death or car accident; that is inherently incalculable.</li>
<li>Bookmakers do not use sophisticated mathematical models; rather they use an inherent understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of individual teams/competitors.</li>
<li>Tailors are also professionals in their own sphere. So what?</li>
<li>Waiters and waitresses also have a financial interest in the outcome of chance events (whether or not they will get tipped)</li>
<li>Epidemiology and physics also have mathematical underpinnings.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>The comparison is flawed on all levels. The closest thing one can say is "both use math to calculate future outcomes". So do accountants, census takers, research biochemists, and anyone who uses statistics. That is <b>much</b> too tenuous a connection and it in no way shape or form belongs in the article, let alone the lead. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:29, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
You are moving this discussion toward the absurd by your reference to tailors and waiters!!. Again further non sequiters are irrelevant to your case. Reading your reply suggests contradictions as you state; "no actuary would ever calculate odds for an individual death" Does this mean that if I take out life assurance aged 30 or 50, that sombody has not determined that the 50 year old has the a greater risk of dying in the term of the cover than the 30 year old? Each policy is a risk individually ascertained and contradicts your assertion accordingly. Similarly the contract the bookmaker makes with his customer reflects the real world probability of a sporting outcome individually determined by the volume of wagers in a particular direction. How he achieves his determination whether by math or inherent judgement is irrelevant. I still condider that inclusion is warranted. <a href="../../../t/a/y/User%7ETayana_a32c.html" title="User:Tayana">Tayana</a> 00:14, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is correct. The cohort of people age 50 has greater mortality and morbidoty risk than does the cohort of those aged 30, and individual policies are sold based on the insured's assigned cohort (together with other correlated factors). No actuary will calculate the risk of any one person dying to price a policy. It is false to say that each risk is individually ascertained in life insurance. Rather, there are various factors whose value is calculated based on cohorts (age, smoking, obesity, gender, etc.) and the policy is usually a base plus multiplicative and additive charges applied due to membership in certain groups. Further, your response to waiters and chemists further underscores my point regarding bookmakers. It seems apparent that you are neither an actuary nor do you understand the field. Lastly, doctors also make decisons about the possibilty of future life and death based on inherent judgement. Are they actuaries? Of course not. You may wish to talk with one, such as myself, before adding irrelevant information.

<p>If I may jump in (Avi, unless I misread what was said in other threads, you are an actuary. So am I -- FSA, 1997), bookmakers aren't really concerned with the strengths or weaknesses of the teams. What they're after is setting odds and spreads so that, whatever the outcome, they win. I read once about how it's done. Interesting stuff. Anyway, that said, it seems to me that the tone of "Similar people who..." is one of disparagement. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_143.165.201.47_54a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/143.165.201.47">143.165.201.47</a> (<a href="../../../1/4/3/User_talk%7E143.165.201.47.html" title="User talk:143.165.201.47">talk</a>) 19:01, February 22, 2007</small></p>
