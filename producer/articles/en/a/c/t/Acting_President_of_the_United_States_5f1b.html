<p><a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_One_%28United_States_Constitution%29_e88d.html" title="Article One (United States Constitution)">Article I</a>, Section 2, of the Constitution appears to establish a succession to the <b>Office of the President</b>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_President_of_the_United_States_d4a8.html" title="Vice President of the United States">Vice President</a> of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided.

</blockquote>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_Two_%28United_States_Constitution%29_4cdf.html" title="Article Two (United States Constitution)">Article II</a>, Section 1 of the Constitution, in contrast, appears to establish the position of <b>Acting President</b>:</p>

<p>The above texts raised many questions regarding the status of a Vice President upon the death or resignation of the elected President, and whether he would be an "<a href="../../../a/c/t/Acting_%28law%29.html" title="Acting (law)">Acting</a> President," which raised the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the phrase "the same shall devolve upon the Vice President" refer to the office of the President, or simply its powers and responsibilities. If it meant the office, then a disabled President had no legal method of returning to power.</li>
<li>What specific conditions would install the Vice President (or another officer) as Acting President? What was the procedure necessary to declare the incapacity of the president? Would Congressional action be necessary to declare a President disabled, or could he declare himself incapacitated?</li>

<p>Since a strict adherence to either of the two sections of the Constitution could yield opposing interpretations, there was, naturally, much disagreement when the matter was first put to the test. Any question regarding the Vice President succeeding to the presidency was for all intents and purposes resolved in April 1841 when <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tyler_b85c.html" title="John Tyler">John Tyler</a> succeeded <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Henry_Harrison_e87c.html" title="William Henry Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> upon Harrison's death. Tyler made it clear that he was the President rather than the Vice President acting as such, thus establishing precedent in accordance with the <b>Article I</b> interpretation. Constitutional scholars, while not generally criticizing Tyler's actions, nonetheless were uncomfortable with the informality of this process and could easily imagine problematic situations in which the applicability of the precedent would not be clear. This question would come up repeatedly over the next 100 years until resolved by the ratification of the <a href="../../../2/5/t/25th_amendment.html" title="25th amendment">25th amendment</a> in 1967. (See also: <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidential_Succession_Act_of_1947_3cdf.html" title="Presidential Succession Act of 1947">Presidential Succession Act of 1947</a>.)</p>
<p><a name="Presidential_disability_prior_to_1967" id="Presidential_disability_prior_to_1967"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Acting_President_of_the_United_States_5f1b.html" title="Edit section: Presidential disability prior to 1967">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Presidential disability prior to 1967</span></h2>
<p>The possibility of installing an Acting President was informally discussed several times prior to the ratification of the 25th amendment, but in nearly every case the Vice President (or the next in the line of succession) did not act, most likely because there was no formal process established for doing so.</p>
<p>Some constitutional scholars feel Tyler's actions in succeeding Harrison as President were in direct conflict with the provisions of the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_0ff6.html" title="Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution">12th amendment</a>, adopted in 1804, which reads in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the Vice-President shall <i>act</i> (emphasis added) as President, <i>as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President</i> (emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This clause proved vague, in that it was unclear what qualified as a "constitutional disability." It should be noted the amendment is referring to Presidential elections, and the House of Representative's duty in choosing a President when the electoral college is deadlocked. The clause assumes a VP candidate has cleared all electoral hurdles and can carry out the duties of President until the House can select a full-term president as per its Constitutional requirements. Since a person could presumably claim constitutional priority to the presidency over the VP in this scenario, the VP logically could not assume the full title of President. Constitutional disability in this context could refer to either the potential president not meeting the eligibility requirements of the office, or that he has not completed his electoral affirmation by Congress.</p>
<p>Tyler, in so much as President Harrison was dead and offered no possibility of returning to the post, was incapable of losing his constitutional authority to act as president other than through his own death or incapacity, and therefore the assumption of the full title of President was simply a matter of semantics.</p>
<p>Despite the amendment's ratification, the death, resignation, or removal from office of the President would remain the only means by which a Vice President could discharge the powers and duties of the office. Its provisions would remain untested in over a dozen situations where a President's health or other considerations might have made it prudent to have the Vice President act as President, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>During May, 1790, when President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> was temporarily debilitated due to a severe case of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza.html" title="Influenza">influenza</a>. Many thought Washington would die, but neither he, nor Vice President <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Adams_7525.html" title="John Adams">John Adams</a>, nor the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">Senate</a> attempted to invoke any effort to temporarily install Adams as Acting President, as there was no provision for such action.</li>
<li>For several weeks in 1813, when President <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Madison_5b50.html" title="James Madison">James Madison</a> suffered from a high <a href="../../../f/e/v/Fever.html" title="Fever">fever</a> and delirium. During this time some felt he had become deranged and was unable to carry out his responsibilities - particularly troublesome in the midst of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_1812.html" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>. Despite occurring during a period of intensive military operations, apparently no serious thought was given to removing Madison from office temporarily, perhaps in part because his Vice President, <a href="../../../e/l/b/Elbridge_Gerry_6186.html" title="Elbridge Gerry">Elbridge Gerry</a>, was of poor health himself and nearing age 70.</li>
<li>During early 1818, when President <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Monroe_d013.html" title="James Monroe">James Monroe</a> was temporarily incapacitated with <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a>. Monroe recovered, and transferring power to <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_President_of_the_United_States_d4a8.html" title="Vice President of the United States">Vice President</a> <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_D._Tompkins_2f05.html" title="Daniel D. Tompkins">Daniel D. Tompkins</a> was again never considered.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_4.html" title="March 4">March 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1849.html" title="1849">1849</a> President-elect <a href="../../../z/a/c/Zachary_Taylor_d92b.html" title="Zachary Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> was to be inaugurated, but he refused as it was a Sunday and did not wish to break the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabbath.html" title="Sabbath">Sabbath</a>. Because of this, some have argued that neither Taylor nor his Vice President <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millard_Fillmore_5e1f.html" title="Millard Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a> had any legal authority as president. They go on to argue that, as the previous President's term had expired at noon, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Rice_Atchison_77a8.html" title="David Rice Atchison">David Rice Atchison</a> was Acting President for the day. Both claims are heavily disputed by historians and Constitutional scholars (see the article on Atchison for more detail).</li>
<li>During the 1868 <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeachment.html" title="Impeachment">impeachment</a> trial of President <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johnson_4b5c.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>. Though he was ultimately acquitted, some argue he should not have been permitted to exercise his constitutional authorities during this time. With the Vice Presidency vacant during the trial, the person next in line was Senate <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Pro_Tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate_b68f.html" title="President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate">President Pro Tempore</a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_F._Wade_304b.html" title="Benjamin F. Wade">Benjamin Franklin Wade</a>. As Wade was one of those who sat in judgment of Johnson, a declaration of disability could have been seen as akin to an outright <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_d%27etat.html" title="Coup d'etat">coup d'etat</a></i> by <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">Congress</a>, and consequently was never considered.</li>
<li>During the summer of 1881, following the <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">July 2</a> shooting of President <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Garfield_49bf.html" title="James Garfield">James Garfield</a> by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Guiteau_78b0.html" title="Charles Guiteau">Charles Guiteau</a>. Though Garfield would live 80 days after the shooting, most of this time was spent under heavy sedation and he was incapable of discharging presidential duties. Despite a widespread belief that Vice President <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_A._Arthur_0aeb.html" title="Chester A. Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a> was a puppet of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalwart.html" title="Stalwart">Stalwart</a> factions of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">Republican Party</a>, and particularly <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> Senator <a href="../../../r/o/s/Roscoe_Conkling_a953.html" title="Roscoe Conkling">Roscoe Conkling</a>, Garfield's cabinet at least informally discussed scenarios under which Arthur could act as President. Again however, there being no apparatus in place and no precedent, nothing came of it.</li>
<li>In 1884-1885, when Garfield's successor, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_A._Arthur_0aeb.html" title="Chester A. Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>, was suffering the effects of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright%27s_disease.html" title="Bright's disease">Bright's disease</a> that would take his life less than two years after leaving office. As had been the case with <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johnson_4b5c.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> before him, there was no Vice President in place to succeed, and no procedure for allowing anyone to act as President in the event that Arthur had become totally disabled.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_13.html" title="June 13">June 13</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_17.html" title="July 17">July 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a>, respectively, when President <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grover_Cleveland_70d2.html" title="Grover Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> underwent two operations to remove (and repair damage from) a rather significantly sized <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancerous</a> tumor from his upper jaw. The operation was kept secret until 1918, well after Cleveland's death, and any plans related to his potential long-term disability, if there were any, were not documented.</li>
<li>During September, 1901. Following the shooting of President <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_McKinley_c296.html" title="William McKinley">William McKinley</a> in <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_New_York_0d75.html" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo, New York</a> by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Czolgosz_612c.html" title="Leon Czolgosz">Leon Czolgosz</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a>, Vice President <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> was summoned to Buffalo, but no action was taken to permit him to discharge McKinley's duties during his final days.</li>
<li>During May, 1909, when President <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Howard_Taft_3129.html" title="William Howard Taft">William Howard Taft</a> fell ill with <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza.html" title="Influenza">influenza</a> and simultaneously suffered a family tragedy (his wife had suffered a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a>). While perhaps inconceivable today, at the time it would have been considered widely acceptable for a President to temporarily transfer power due to grief caused by an illness not his own.</li>
<li>President <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_eb76.html" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> suffered a slight stroke on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_25.html" title="September 25">September 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">October 2</a> it was followed by a massive, debilitating stroke which left him partially paralyzed and completely incapacitated. Rather than to transfer Presidential authority to Vice President <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_R._Marshall_1d76.html" title="Thomas R. Marshall">Thomas Riley Marshall</a>, Wilson's condition was hidden (to the extent that he was physically isolated) from the Vice President, the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet.html" title="Cabinet">Cabinet</a>, Congress and the public for most of the remainder of his second term. Many feel that First Lady <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Bolling_Galt_Wilson_ecfb.html" title="Edith Bolling Galt Wilson">Edith Bolling Galt Wilson</a> was the <i>de facto</i> President, as she controlled access to Wilson and spoke on his behalf.</li>

<li>During the mid-point of <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_Eisenhower_f660.html" title="Dwight Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>'s presidency there were three instances where the president was disabled. The first occurred in September, 1955 when Eisenhower suffered a <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> while on vacation. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">June 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> he was hospitalized for a bowel obstruction that ultimately required <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a> and incapacitated him for six days.

<p>The <a href="../../../2/5/t/25th_amendment.html" title="25th amendment">25th amendment</a>, ratified in 1967, clears up many of the issues which surrounded presidential succession and incapacity.

<p>Section 3 of the amendment set forth a procedure whereby a President who believes he will be temporarily unable to perform the duties of his office may declare himself "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."</p>
<p>Upon this declaration, which is transmitted in writing to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Vice President becomes Acting President.

<p>Section 4 of the amendment sets forth a second procedure establishing presidential incapacity. This second method allows the Vice President, together with a majority of the members of the President's cabinet, to declare the President disabled.</p>
<p>Upon this declaration, which is transmitted in writing to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Vice President immediately becomes Acting President. The Vice President continues to act as President until the President declares, by another letter to the leaders of each house of Congress, that he's again able to discharge the powers and duties of the presidency. The Vice President and the cabinet may countermand that declaration, however, whereupon Congress must convene in emergency session to decide who shall discharge the powers and responsibilities of the presidency.</p>
<p>Ostensibly to be used in the event of a President's complete mental or physical disability, this method of transferring presidential power has never been used. In cases such as the 1981 assassination attempt on President <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> however, this method of designating an Acting President could have been justified, in consideration of the fact that Reagan was literally unable to give any orders in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, prompting the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Haig_7233.html" title="Alexander Haig">Secretary of State</a> to proclaim "I'm in control here."</p>

<p>In preliminary drafts of what ultimately became the <a href="../../../2/5/t/25th_Amendment_a91a.html" title="25th Amendment">25th Amendment</a>, the line of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession_245a.html" title="United States presidential line of succession">presidential succession</a> was spelled out in great detail, including the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Representatives_1aaf.html" title="Speaker of the House of Representatives">Speaker of the House of Representatives</a>, the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Pro_Tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate_b68f.html" title="President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate">President Pro Tempore of the Senate</a>, and the existing cabinet officers.</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_the_United_States_f5e4.html" title="Congress of the United States">Congress</a>, acting under the powers conferred upon it by Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution, and by Section 3 of the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_2267.html" title="Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution">20th Amendment</a>, has provided for cases where neither a President nor Vice President is able to discharge the powers and duties of the office of President via the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidential_Succession_Act_of_1947_3cdf.html" title="Presidential Succession Act of 1947">Presidential Succession Act of 1947</a> (officially styled <i>"An Act to provide for the performance of the duties of the office of President in case of the removal, resignation, death, or inability both of the President and Vice President").</i></p>
<p>The constitutional delegation of authority that enabled Congress to enact the Presidential Succession Act is twofold: the authority of Congress to regulate cases when neither a President-elect, nor a Vice President-elect have qualified, determining who shall act as president in that specific situation stems from section 3 of the 20th Amendment. On the other hand, the power of the Legislature to determine who shall act as President in the cases of removal, resignation, death, or inability both of the President and Vice President is provided for in article Article II, section 1 of the Constitution. Congress has chosen to regulate both situations by the same statute, and the Presidential Succession Act it passed in 1947 deals with both cases.</p>
<p>The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 is not the first statute to have been enacted by Congress under the above mentioned constitutional provisions. Before the enactment of the current statute previous Acts of Congress (the Presidential Succession Acts of 1792 and 1886) dealt with the hypothesis of there being neither a President nor a Vice-President able to discharge the powers of the presidency.</p>
<p>Apart from the circumstances regulated by sections 3 and 4 of the 25th Amendment, the provisions of the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 regulate the only other scenarios in which the office of Acting President would come into existence.</p>
<p>While none of these officers would succeed to the presidency as would a Vice President, the provisions of the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, now codified in Title 3, Chapter 1, Section 19 of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Code_9645.html" title="United States Code">United States Code</a>, create a line of succession that allows the Speaker of the House, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and Cabinet officers, to serve as Acting President in the case of removal, resignation, death or inability of both the President and Vice President, and also in the case of failure to qualify of both a President-elect and a Vice President-elect. The following is the currently established line of succession after the President and the Vice President:</p>

<p>The fact that section 2 of the 25th Amendment allows a President to nominate a new Vice President whenever a vacancy occurs in that office, while not directly impacting the Presidential Succession Act, has greatly diminished the potential for its coming into operation. Indeed, since the office of Vice President, once vacant, no longer remains vacant until the end of the presidential term, but is now filled by presidential nomination confirmed by Congress, the likelihood of there ever being a time when there is simultaneously neither a president nor a Vice President able to discharge the powers and duties of the presidency has greatly decreased.</p>

<p>Under both the <a href="../../../2/5/t/25th_Amendment_a91a.html" title="25th Amendment">25th Amendment</a> and the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidential_Succession_Act_of_1947_3cdf.html" title="Presidential Succession Act of 1947">Presidential Succession Act of 1947</a>, an Acting President has identical constitutional "powers and duties" as the President, being able to sign bills into law, petition <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> for a declaration of war, and perform other tasks, but does not hold the office itself.</p>
<p>The President who is unable to exercise the powers and duties of the office remains the President of the United States during the period when there is an Acting President; in other words, the incapacitated President does not become an ordinary citizen. The President is deprived of the powers and duties of the office, but not of presidential status. Similarly, while the Vice President is discharging the powers and duties of the presidency pursuant to sections 3 or 4 of the 25th Amendment, he still holds the office of Vice President. He would be both Vice President and Acting President simultaneously.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Stormy_Present_43d6.html" title="The Stormy Present">an episode</a> of the fictional television series <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_West_Wing_%28TV_series%29_5872.html" title="The West Wing (TV series)">The West Wing</a></i> a former Acting President of the United States attends the funeral of a recently-deceased President and is accorded the same protocol as all the other former Presidents. As of June, 2006, it is unknown under what circumstances this protocol would be accorded in real life, because the only Acting President who was not subsequently elected to the presidency is current Vice President <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Cheney_58d2.html" title="Dick Cheney">Dick Cheney</a>. Should he never succeed to the presidency, he would be the first to whom this question applies. Considering his status as acting president is not widely known, it is unlikely he would be granted such honors.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Acting_President_of_the_United_States_5f1b.html" title="Edit section: Oath of Office">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Oath of Office</span></h2>
<p>The presidential oath is not taken by the Vice President upon the 25th Amendment's being invoked. As stated above, Acting President is not the same as President. The former merely exercises the powers and duties of the president, without actually holding the office of president.</p>
<p>And, while the Constitution requires the President to take this oath upon entering into the office, the 25th Amendment states that, upon it being invoked "<i>the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President</i>." Thus, the Vice President becomes Acting President as soon as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate receive the written declaration issued under either section 3 or section 4 of the 25th Amendment, no oath being required.</p>
<p>Precedent confirms that, since, in the two occasions when the 25th Amendment was invoked, there is no record of the Vice President having taken the oath. In the case of the Amendment's invocation by President Bush, a detailed account of the procedure was subsequently given by the White House Press Secretary, and no mention whatsoever was made of the oath being taken by the Vice President. Instead, it is recorded that Vice President Cheney was informed by telephone that he was now Acting President as soon as the invocation letters signed by the president were transmitted to the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate.<a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0206/29/bn.02.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0206/29/bn.02.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 (that applies when there is neither a President nor a Vice President able to discharge the powers and duties of the office) makes reference to the oath, albeit in an indirect manner. It states that the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and the mentioned members of the Cabinet, upon being called to act as president, shall resign their offices of origin, and, in the section referring to members of the Cabinet acting as President, it states that the taking of the oath of office by one person so called to act as president shall be held to constitute the said person's resignation from the Cabinet office by virtue of the holding of which he qualifies to act as President. However, the Act stops short of explicitly requiring the presidential oath to be taken. In any event, the Presidential Succession Act does not apply when the Vice President is the one in place to act as President.</p>

<li>twenty one days elapse after the receipt, under section 4 of the 25th Amendment, of the declaration of the Vice-President and Cabinet, declaring, within four days of the President having declared that he was able to resume the powers and duties of his office, that they still believe that the President is unable to discharge those powers and duties, but only if Congress does not, within that period of twenty one days, determine, by a two thirds vote in both Houses, that the President is incapable of exercising his powers and duties.</li>
<li>The death, resignation (it is not clear, however, if an incapacitated President would still be able to resign the office after his incapacity had been declared) or removal of the President. In this case a Vice-President acting as President would succeed to the office. Any other officer acting as President, however, would (per the terms of the Presidential Succession Act of 1947) serve out the remainder of the Presidential term as Acting President, instead of becoming President.</li>
<li>A President-elect or Vice-President elect qualifying to hold the office, in a case in which the Presidential Succession Act has entered into operation due to the failure of both a President-elect and a Vice-President-elect to qualify.</li>
<li>A person mentioned in section A or B of the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 (Speaker of the House of Representatives or President pro tempore of the US Senate) becoming able to act as President, when those powers and duties are being exercised by a member of the Cabinet under section D of the said Act in virtue of there being no Speaker or President pro tempore able to act upon the entry into operation of the provisions of the said Act. In this case, however, an Acting President would be merely replaced by another Acting President, placed higher in the order of Succession.</li>
<li>At the expiration of the term for which the elected President was chosen, whereupon the President-elect would take office.</li>

<p>Because of the wording of letter signed by President Reagan to declare his temporary inability, in which he expressed doubts about whether his situation would fall within the scope of the 25th Amendment, some argue that the invocation of the Amendment by him was invalid, and that no formal transfer of power took place. The following facts make it unquestioned that it had, in fact, occurred:</p>
<ul>
<li>His precise following of the provisions of Section 3 of the <a href="../../../2/5/t/25th_Amendment_a91a.html" title="25th Amendment">25th Amendment</a>, issuing written declarations to the President pro tempore of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House, declaring his temporary inability to discharge the office, and subsequent declaration that his disability had been removed.</li>
<li>His post-presidential writings on the subject clearly stated that it was his intent to invoke the amendment.</li>
<li>His chief counsel on the matter, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Fielding_9d53.html" title="Fred Fielding">Fred Fielding</a> has been quoted as saying, "I personally know he (Reagan) did intend to invoke the amendment, and he conveyed that to all of his staff, and it was conveyed to the VP as well as the President of the Senate. He was also very firm in his wish not to create a precedent binding his successor."</li>
</ul>
<p>So while Reagan didn't wish for his particular situation to establish a precedent binding future Presidents to turning over their authority every time they underwent surgery, his intent to transfer executive authority in that instance was clear.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 25th Amendment does not require that the written declaration contain express words invoking the Amendment itself. It simply requires a written statement that the President is unable to discharge his powers and duties. The 1985 Reagan invocation letter was clear in stating that he would be so incapable.</p>

<p>In addition to the two instances where it was utilized, in two other cases the 'Acting President' provisions of the <a href="../../../2/5/t/25th_amendment.html" title="25th amendment">25th amendment</a> could, at least in theory, have been invoked:</p>
<ul>
<li>During 1972, when President <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> was hospitalized due to <a href="../../../p/h/l/Phlebitis.html" title="Phlebitis">phlebitis</a>. At the time no consideration was given to installing Vice President <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiro_Agnew_94aa.html" title="Spiro Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> as Acting President, but the precedents set by the invocations of 1985 and 2002 leave this as a case where power could have been temporarily transferred.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_30.html" title="March 30">March 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, perhaps the most perfectly suited situation for the invocation of the 'Acting President' provision occurred when President <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> was <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reagan_assassination_attempt.html" title="Reagan assassination attempt">wounded by a would-be assassin</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hinckley%2C_Jr._047d.html" title="John Hinckley, Jr.">John Hinckley, Jr.</a> Though Reagan was clearly seen by his staff, Cabinet members, and others as incapacitated, Vice President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H.

Reagan would eventually recover, but constitutional scholars such as Herbert Abrams have opined that the 25th amendment should have been invoked in order to clarify the acting chain of command <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0393030423/102-7242686-5423364" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0393030423/102-7242686-5423364" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>

<p>The invocation of the 25th Amendment and the potential for a power struggle or coup d'état are recurring themes in politically-themed entertainment. Acting Presidents have been depicted as part of story arcs on the American television shows <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_West_Wing_%28TV_series%29_5872.html" title="The West Wing (TV series)">The West Wing</a></i>, <i>Commander in Chief</i>, and <i><a href="../../../2/4/_/24_%28television%29.html" title="24 (television)">24</a></i>.
