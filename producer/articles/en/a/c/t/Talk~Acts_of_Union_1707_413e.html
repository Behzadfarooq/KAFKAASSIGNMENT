<p>I'm not a lawyer, but I think this statement in the article is misleading: <i>The treaty provided that if any 'laws and statutes' were 'contrary to or inconsistent with the terms' of the Treaty; that they would be null and void. In practice this has been ignored, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom has been allowed to amend the Act.</i></p>
<p>The original act has: <i>That all Laws and Statutes in either Kingdom so far as they are contrary to, or inconsistent with the Terms of these Articles, or any of them, shall from and after the Union cease and become void, and shall be so declared to be by the respective Parliaments of the said Kingdoms.</i></p>
<p>This seems to imply that all laws currently in force <i>at the time</i> that violate the treaty are rendered null and void, but doesn't say that the act can't ever be amended in the future. Parliament had always had the power to overturn or modify any act of a previous Parliament. --<a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a> 6 July 2005 17:33 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I think you're trying to apply English concepts, such as the sovereignty of Parliament, to the Scottish and UK-wide situation. If you read the judgement in <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacCormick_v._Lord_Advocate_a778.html" title="MacCormick v. Lord Advocate">MacCormick v. Lord Advocate</a> then you'll see quite clearly that this concept does not apply in Scotland and while the Act of Union can be amended, there are certain 'entrenched' principles that cannot be altered. The words 'from or after the Union' seem to imply that the Act is referring to both previous enactments and future enactments.</p>
<p>—————————————————————</p>
<p>A fundamental concept in the UK Parliament is that no government can bind a future government. The government that passed the Act of Union cannot prevent any future government from amending the Act. --<a href="../../../w/o/n/User%7EWonkotsane_bf7a.html" title="User:Wonkotsane">wonko</a> 09:09, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have the <i>Chronological Table of the Statutes</i> open in front of me just now, and it notes the Scottish act (which, interestingly, it lists as c.7 of 1706 - old style dates, I guess) is repealed in part by the Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act (1906); the Criminal Justice Act 1948 s.83 (3) sch. 10, Pt. III; the Peerage Act 1963 s.7 (2) sch.2; &amp; the Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1964.</dd>
<dd>The English act - these are listed seperately, since they were before 1707 - is more detailed, and states that the following parts have been repealed - articles 5, 6 (in part), 7 (in part), 8, 9, 10-15, 16 (in part), 17, 19 (in part), 22 (in part). The Peerage Act of 1963 repeals bits but it doesn't specify which ones, and sections 2, 3, 4 and 6 have all been repealed in part. Article 23 and section 2 have been amended. The Scots and English ones were amended by seperate laws, which makes sense, but I do wonder if they're out of synch by now...</dd>
<dd>Anyway, this clarifies a lot of matters in the "violated" part; arts. 8 and 12 &amp; 13 are certainly obsolete and can't be violated. 16 may still be in force; I don't know what was changed. 21 (the Royal Burghs) is still an open question. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 09:49, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>JW1805 is trying to pretend that he is the second person to support a merger. He knows fine well that I did not put up the Merge notice because I support such a merger, but rather because I strongly objected to him unilaterally deleting the Treaty of Union article. There used to be a very good Treaty of Union article (a couple of years ago?), but someone has completely erased it from the records. Certain people are trying to blackwash the Treaty out of history.--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 07:51, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I didn't mean to imply anything. However, there never was a Treaty of Union article. Last month, someone actually moved the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Union_1707_ebbb.html" title="Act of Union 1707">Act of Union 1707</a> article to <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Union_1707_51e6.html" title="Treaty of Union 1707">Treaty of Union 1707</a>, and then went around various other articles replacing "Act" with "Treaty" (actually, I think you may have been involved with that, but I could be mistaken). The fact is that the Treaty of Union did not merge the two kingdoms. That was accomplished by the Acts. The brief mention of the "Treaty of Union" would be better located in the "Act of Union" article, that way everything would be in the same place. --<a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a> 15:11, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> Also, should it not be mentioned somewhere that the Scottish Act was called the Union with England Act 1707, and that the English Act was called the Union with Scotland Act 1706 (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Acts_of_Parliament_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_bb1f.html" title="List of Acts of Parliament of the Scottish Parliament">List of Acts of Parliament of the Scottish Parliament</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Acts_of_Parliament_of_the_English_Parliament_2526.html" title="List of Acts of Parliament of the English Parliament">List of Acts of Parliament of the English Parliament</a>), and that they were actually passed in different years? In fact the English Parliament even managed to pass four more pieces of legislation before being abolished. <i>"It was a single act"</i> strikes me as being innaccurate: was the wording in each exactly the same? Given that the titles themselves of the Acts vary, this seems highly unlikely.--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 16:19, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Passage by the English Parliament should be discuessed in much more detail. But it's clear from the article that the two happened in the same session, within weeks of each other.

<li><i>Passage by the English Parliament should be discussed in much more detail</i>&#160;? Passage in the English parliament was pretty straightforward.

<p>As usual such timelines work from an Anglocentric perspective... if the Treaty of Rhuddlan can be mentioned, surely the annexation of Orkney and Shetland should figure too in the Scottish context.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 20:44, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting point but (if you'll forgive a little more anglocentricism) by extension wouldn't that also require the formation of England from the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and the similar process in Wales (or to take it to an extreme dicussions on Berwick Upon Tweed). The current timeline at least is considtent in limiting itself to the building blocks of what are regognised as the "nations" (whatever that menasn...) of the Union.

<dd>I agree with MacRusgail. Either all the pre 1707 treaties/expansions involving Scotland and England should be shown or none at all - the UK traces tis origins to the union of the only two independent states in the British Isles which were the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Scotland_2d91.html" title="Kingdom of Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> and the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_England_1e4c.html" title="Kingdom of England">Kingdom of England</a>. English annexation of Wales is certainly significant for both of those territories but the UK was formed by two powers&#160;; England ( which contained Wales and had Ireland as a vassal state/colony) and Scotland. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Siarach_8bef.html" title="User:An Siarach">siarach</a> 13:43, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The whole thing is a bit bizzare. The Act essentially stipulated a number of broad Big Principles, and then a lot of highly detailed short-term conditions to "grease" the the thing enough for it to work at all in practice, and there's a significant difference between violating the first and allowing the second to lapse into obsolesence, which I suspect is the case for most of these.</dd>
<dd>Also, note Article Sixteen: "And a Mint shall be continued in Scotland ... subject to such Regulations and Alterations as Her Majesty Her Heirs or Successors, or the Parliament of Great Britain shall think fit". If the Mint's been closed, (or, a possible legal fiction, simply moved offsite), because the Crown or Parliament said it should, it seems <i>perfectly legal</i> for that to have happened under the Act. Indeed, there is no longer a mint in England for it to be subject to the sules of! <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 23:24, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, time for another. Articles 13 &amp; 14; coals and malt. These do not say "coals etc. shall never be taxed"; they say "Coals etc. in Scotland shall not be subject to <i>this specific tax</i> currently in force in England". Note "during the continuance of the Duties" as a key phrase. If that specific tax is still in force, there'd be an issue... but ten to one says that if you look carefully, when (if?) those taxes were reinstated in June 1707 and September 1710, they'll have been explicitly applied to the whole UK. Note that Art15 basically says "from here on, no exemptions unless Parliament explicitly says so at the time" <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 23:30, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for salt, I have no idea - it basically says after 1714, tax on salt would be consistent across the UK, some implementing details, and Scottish fish laws remain in force unless altered by Parliament. There's then something about fixed payments, but this is "during the present allowances" for the one section and "alterable by the Parliament of Great Britain" for the other, so it could lapse or be altered legally - wouldn't have to be broken.

<dd>"it wasn't abolished until 1817." - Therefore, the violation occurred in 1817. If you can even supply me with the date of the violation, why are you denying it was violated? The violation of the Royal Burghs have tended to take place even later, but still constitute violations. In fact, most of the articles have been violated. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 17:39, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Looking up, I fear I may not have explained myself very well last night. (I plead tiredness). Basically, here's the problems which the "it's been violated!" argument fails to take into account, as far as I can see.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>a) The Act was not laying down how things would be forever and ever amen; it was laying down how things would work for the next two years, the next five years, the next ten years - how the big sticking points of taxation and political rights, which needed be dealt with, would be handled in order to get economic and political union working.</dd>
<dd>b) The Act explicitly states in many cases that the conditions will only apply for a short time - they don't apply to, say, all taxes on windows, just the taxes on windows which were in force at the time of changeover. It doesn't pose any legal problem to Parliament saying later "well, we had agreed windows would be taxed from 1705 to 1710, it's 1710 now, we're going to reintroduce the window tax - and by the way, it applies to Scotland now as well"</dd>
<dd>c) Legally changing the law does not mean you "violate" the old law; my girlfriend isn't violating the Representation of the People Act 1867 when she goes to vote, because the clause saying the vote is only given to men has since been repealed or amended.</dd>
<dd>d) Finally, it's an act of Parliament. Parliament has rarely shown much compunction over repealing what it feels are outdated bits of old legislation - look at how much of Magna Carta is left.</dd>
<dd>My contention is... many of these (the taxes ones) aren't violations, because they were explicitly short-term and explicitly allowed for those substances to be taxed in future; the mint isn't a violation because Parliament is legally entitled to say "no, actually, we're not going to have a mint in Scotland any more".</dd>
<dd>I'm a bit lost on the Royal Burghs, and you may have a point there... but as an aside, would it have been legal under Scottish law as of 1706 for this to be done? I'm curious... <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 21:09, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The larger question here is this: is the Act of Union some sort of "super statute" that cannot be modified by subsequent legislation (like the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_the_United_States_01a7.html" title="Constitution of the United States">Constitution of the United States</a>? Or, is it simply an Act passed by the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_England_d506.html" title="Parliament of England">Parliament of England</a> and the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Scotland_b6d1.html" title="Parliament of Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a> which can be modified by the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom_dcaf.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a>. The most common argument (the one that has been the <i>de facto</i> operating principle since the Union) is that the United Parliament inherited all the powers of the two successor Parliaments. Anything that either Parliament could do (like change the salt tax), the United Parliament can do. What happens if every single person in England and Scotland want some part of the Act changed? If the United Parliament can't change it, who can? The Parliaments of England and Scotland do not exist anymore. One can't claim that "the Parliament of Scotland didn't have parliament supremacy"....and then claim that it was able to pass a law that forever binds all the people of England and Scotland, a law which can never be modified. That is a strange paradox. What some people view as a case affirming the "super-statue" nature of the Acts (<a href="../../../m/a/c/MacCormick_v._Lord_Advocate_a778.html" title="MacCormick v. Lord Advocate">MacCormick v. Lord Advocate</a>) really is not (it dances around the issue a bit, but doesn't give a decisive view). Perhaps it would be better to create a new section in this article to discuss this issue in a NPOV manner, rather than just stating that parts of the Act have been "violated", which is inherently POV. --<b><a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a></b> <small><a href="../../../j/w/1/User_talk%7EJW1805_b255.html" title="User talk:JW1805">(Talk)</a></small> 21:56, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"The Parliaments of England and Scotland do not exist anymore." - Trouble is that they do. Scotland now has a <i>new</i> parliament, and there is a good argument for saying that England's never went away, since it retained all of its pre-union features, location, tradition, religious associations etc. For Westminster, it was business as usual after the Union, except for the addition of some extra members. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 15:13, 3 July 2006 (UTC) p.s.

<dd>You're wrong. If you mean that the parliament we have now is not the same as the one we had before Scotland had its "Anschluss", then you're right. But the terms Scottish Parliament and Parliament of Scotland are used interchangeably, and certainly were of the pre-1707 one by officialdom.</dd>

<dd>Secondly, it was properly the Kingdom of Scots, not of Scotland, although there are usages of the latter. The UK parliament is the same as the pre-union parliament, just as the parliament at Brussels is more or less the same parliament it was before the former Iron Curtain states started sending representatives. Westminster is merely the English parliament expanded to include Scottish and (some) Irish representatives. That's why you find pre-union English parliamentary &amp; legal traditions surviving within it, and not Scottish ones. There is a famous quote from this period, from a member of the "British" parliament (the Speaker I believe if I remember rightly(: <b>"Have we not <i>bought</i> Scotland and the right to tax her?"</b> When I can reference that quote properly, it shall be appearing in the article.

<p>This is a poor, badly organised account of a major even in British history, clearly corrupted by viewpoints with little or no interest in historical truth. I actually find it deeply embarrasing that some innocent soul might come across this page in their simple-minded search for the facts. Would the traditions of the Scottish Parliament that were ignored after 1707 include the reintroduction of forms of feudal servitude for the wretched mining community?

<p>The version we have on Wikisource has a preface which seems to say it was the one passed in Edinburgh; the comment about "in pursuance of the fourth Act of the third Session of <i>this Parliament</i>" seems to refer to the Scottish "Treaty with England Act" of 1705 (the third session of Anne's first Parliament; c.4 or c.50 depending on how you count), and the reference to a different act being "made <i>in England</i> the third year of Her Majesties Reign" makes this clear (emphasis mine).</p>
<p>This strongly suggests to me that the preface, at least, of these two acts must have been different - it wouldn't make sense for the English to refer to "the fourth Act, etc" without clarifying. So were any other changes made? Did the English one have additional sections which were only binding on England and not relevant to the Scottish context? I've noted a reference to "sections" of the Act above, but the source version we're looking at has no such sections... <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 17:26, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is not true, because the said election is scheduled for May 3, 2007. The 300th anniversary of May 1, 1707 is May 12th, 2007, as a result of the introduction of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_calendar.html" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> in 1752. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 15:37, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I heard on radio 4 (in the UK - obviously) that the date we remember for the act of union is wrong, as the gregorian calendar has since intervened. Hearing that I went to the wikipedia page on the Gregorian Calendar, which suggests that the Gregorian calendar was introduced before the Act of Union in Scotland but after the Act of Union in England. Therefore each act would have been based on a different calendar, and a different date.</p>
<p>What's the correct answer? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_212.219.158.121_09f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/212.219.158.121">212.219.158.121</a> (talk) 12:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>The Acts (which were signed at different times by the English and Scottish parliaments) came into effect on 1st May 1707. The changover to the Gregorian calendar (in both England and Scotland) did not take place until 1752. All anniversaries, such as birthdays, were now legally expressed on the new calandar with an apparent 11 day difference. The true anniversay of the Act of Union is therefore 12th May. The idea that Scotland switched to the Gregorian calendar earlier is a misconception. What happened is that Scotland adopted 1st January as New Year's Day around 1600, but this was still a date on the old calendar. England retained 25th March as its legal New Year's Day until 1751 - and, as expressed on the new calendar (5th April) - still retained it thereafter as the start of the <i>financial</i> year (though this was shifted to 6th April in 1800). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 12:42, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Was the English parliament dissolved in 1707? The answer is yes. By my calculation it was the 276th time an English parliament had been dissolved. It was then recalled, in the same place, with all its traditions, personel, standing orders, committees, paid officials, etc. etc... and with the addition of a few new members representing Scotland. There is no break in continuity (and the same applies to 1801 as well). No one can deny that in <i>practical</i> terms the parliament at Westminster continued uninterrupted. What I'm saying here is that in <i>legal</i> terms the same is also true. Dissolution of parliaments was what happened at the end of every sitting. In this sense the dissolution of the English parliament in 1707 was absolutely standard practice. I suggest we amend the article accordingly. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 19:08, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
