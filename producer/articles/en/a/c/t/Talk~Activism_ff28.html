<p>Wow, first person to write here.</p>
<p>Shouldn't there be a <b>Social Activism</b> - as in activism conducted by groups of people to affect a change by getting the public support for a cause. This differs from <i>political activism</i> where you wish to dialogue with politicians to get governments to take action.</p>
<p>An example could be <i>Clean up Australia Day</i> which started in 1990.</p>
<p>I bring this up because I would like to write an article on "West Papuan Social Activism" -- to:</p>
<ul>
<li>list such groups from around the world;</li>
<li>discuss possible reasons why there seems to be a lack of any such group in the US (and its not apathy from the American people; I'm thinking more like the vested interests of Freeport, Indonesia, and the Ford Foundation);</li>
<li>and itemize what constructive actions such groups could work towards.</li>

<p>People, I think that the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Activism, in a general sense, can be described as involvement in action to bring about change, be it social, political, environmental, or other change. This action is in support of or opposition to one side of a controversial argument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is what the activists call what they are doing, but I do not think that this makes for a quality encyclopedia definition. Thing is, anything anybody is doing is causing some kind of change. What the CEO of KillingNature Inc is doing is "change" too, maybe just not exactly of the kind that activists would prefer, and to judge what is and is not change by someone's criteria is POV. Needless to say, we need to keep it as a self-description, but we should not have it as a basic definition. A better definition should be more specific to what 'activism' really entails, in opposition to other human activities. I think part of it entails something like participating in activities that would not be considered a "legitimate occupation" for an individual. Basically, there are some occupations, sometimes paid ones, that do not "qualify" as a real "job", sort of like protesting against Walmart, fighting against wishy-washy school curriculum, or training suicide bombers for Hamas. So if you cannot say that this guy has such and such job, you would say he is an "activist" for whatever it is that he is trying to accomplish. I am sure there are other symptoms, sort of like a "deviant" goal of the activity. Anyway, I will try working on it later, but I just wanted to open up the discussion about it. Let's make this article more analytical and less of a teach-in-truth-out kind of broadside. <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatcher_5a47.html" title="User:Watcher">Watcher</a> 09:14, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Activism is about <b>social</b> and/or <b>political</b> change, and many acts of CEOs do not do this. If a CEO does (for example if (s)he orders his/her company to start offering same-sex partner benefits, or if (s)he orders his/her company to deny such benefits if they currently exist) then it would be activism. Activism is an act, not necessairly an occupation. There are activists whose primary jobs are activist related, but I don't see how this would be a "non-legitimate occupation" --- and such a statement would not be NPOV. Likewise, trying to define activism as supporting a "deviant" goal is not NPOV. Because activism generally involves advocating for change, it often does try to change or challenge the accepted standards of a society. However, "deviant" is a loaded term. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretAgent_4661.html" title="User:SecretAgent">SecretAgent</a> 02:03, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Removed this content as it appears to be original, unsupported research. Activism comes in all flavors, from left to right, so claiming that the word is associated with the political left wing is absurd; and the comment about "freedom fighters" and "terrorists" seems highly POV. Perhaps there may be another way to phrase it, but one should cite sources in any case. Let's talk about what activism is or isn't, not about what it might be subjectively called by an unnamed party. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 28 June 2005 13:30 (UTC)

<dd>The first sentence is debatable, but it seems to have some truth to it, particularly in the United States. The second sentence doesn't seem to be particularly problematic. Certainly people use either positive and negative terms for activists depending on whether they are praising or condemning them. Though I suppose that example is relevant mainly to particular kinds of activists, like <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerilla.html" title="Guerilla">guerillas</a>. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 08:02, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are 4 articles where many forms of activism could be listed: <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activism.html" title="Activism">activism</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">direct action</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonstration.html" title="Demonstration">demonstration</a>, and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protest.html" title="Protest">protest</a>. I would say activism is the broadest category, so I would suggest putting actions that would fit in those other articles into those articles and putting links to those lists in the list in activism, to avoid repetition. I reorganized the list in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protest.html" title="Protest">protest</a> but I think many of those should be in <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">direct action</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonstration.html" title="Demonstration">demonstration</a> with a link to those lists in the protest article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the sorting of the list, I think putting similar categories nearer to each other is better than listing them alphabetically. At the top of the list I would put that which is the most popular form of protest or whatever the article is about. Edno 05:08, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A famous mailing list for contributors to the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> operating system is called "<a href="http://www.kclug.org/old_archives/linux-activists/" class="external text" title="http://www.kclug.org/old_archives/linux-activists/" rel="nofollow">Linux activists</a>". This is based not only on the general English meaning of the word, but is also a play on Finnish history, where those were called activists who started at the turn of the century 1900 to call for national independence (from Russia), if need be by armed revolution. Finland eventually declared itself independent in 1917 after the <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_Revolution_dcce.html" title="October Revolution">October Revolution</a>. In Sweden the term "activist" surfaced during World War I, describing a fraction (including the Royal family) that wanted "a more active neutrality" in support of Germany. This movement was politically dead after 1915. Both meanings of "activists" are associated with the political right (German-friendly, anti-Czarist and anti-Bolshevik). --<a href="../../../l/a/2/User%7ELA2_a404.html" title="User:LA2">LA2</a> 03:18, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think ethical shopping can be considered a form of activism. It doesn't contribute to changing society. If this were true then going to live in the woods in a cabin could be considered activism. I think activism has to do with somehow seeing to change the rules, laws, or social norms of society. I think promoting ethical shopping would be a form of activism. But not engaging in ethical shopping by itself.

<dd>I think financially supporting companies, stores, etc. that agree with your values can definitely be an "intentional action to bring about social or political change" (as the article defines activism).

<p>The section on judicial activism is incredibly POV--judicial activism is not ordinarily considered a type of activism; it's a recent invention to selectively characterize judicial decisionmaking. At most it should be a footnote to a separate article on judicial activism. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 22:03, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Talk%7EActivism_ff28.html" title="Edit section: Merge of Youth voice into this article">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Merge of <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_voice.html" title="Youth voice">Youth voice</a> into this article</span></h2>
<p>I have proposed a merge of <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_voice.html" title="Youth voice">Youth voice</a> into this article. I'd even suggest a simple redirect. The <i>Youth voice</i> article openly states that it is a neologism. It also claims that it is a "fairly common" neologism, but provides no source or evidence for that assertion. The term is also used rather anachronistically through most of the article, applying it to things that would never have used the term in their day, whereas "activism" would have been. The article is simply about a narrow form of activism using a term that I suspect most people would not search for. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:32, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The article is poorly written, because the term embraces far more than simply involving youth in activism. It would be inappropriate to merge the youth voice into the activism article. - <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 22:46, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a>, I can't help but think you nominated the article for a merger in order to circumnavigate the talkheader. - <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 17:32, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The talkheader on which talk page, this one or the "youth voice" one? How? And for what purpose? I completely fail to understand what you're accusing me of. If you think I have some ulterior motive, I take umbrage at the insuation. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 10:14, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The talkheader on the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Talk%7EYouth_voice_f1fd.html" title="Talk:Youth voice">discussion page</a>, which clearly states that it is not for general discussion about the article's subject - which you have circumnavigated with your proposal, and creating a seperate discussion <a href="../../../a/c/t/Talk%7EActivism_ff28.html#Merge_of_Youth_voice_into_this_article" title="Talk:Activism">here</a>. It doesn't matter now though - your comment clearly shows you didn't have anything else in mind. - <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 15:25, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For what it's worth, that header on the other talk page means that people aren't supposed to treat the talk page like a chat-room to discuss the issue of "youth voice". It is <i>entirely</i> appropriate to talk about the merits of the subject as an encyclopedic article or likewise.

<p>"activism" is just another word for "democratic participation", that is, persons actively participating politically. I have found that it is often used in disgust by those speaking it as if to marginalize active participation. "Those activists causing trouble". As if they were abnormal for not sticking to merely voting. [[User:67.53.78.15 04:43, 6 March 2007 (UTC)]] 22:45, 05 Mar 2007 (UTC)</p>
