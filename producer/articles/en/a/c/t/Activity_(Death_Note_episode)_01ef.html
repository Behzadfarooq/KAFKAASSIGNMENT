<p>The episode begins with the Yotsuba Group having a new meeting before they were supposed to. Coil has contact the group and informed them that Misa may know who L is and that he recommends they use her to learn L's identity. However, the Yotsuba members agree that because Coil is supposed to find out who L is for them, they will not do this without Coil's help. While the identity of the Third Kira has not yet been revealed, he is shown telling Rem that he is sure Misa was the Second Kira and discarded her death note upon being captured by L. He also says that he will make Misa his wife in order to be admired once L is dead, and then he will kill Misa. Rem, concerned for Misa's life, decides to take out a piece of a Death Note page.</p>
<p>Misa goes to be interviewed by the Yotsuba Group, who have decided to interview her about L with Coil there with them. At the meeting, the Yotsuba members confront her about arriving in Tokyo to meet Kira and that she was captured and interrogated by L. Misa, as she promised L, tells them she was once captured by L, but does not know who he is. While going to the bathroom during a break in the interview, Rem has Misa touch the piece of the death note she tore out. This makes Misa be able to see and hear Rem, but her memories of being the Second Kira are not restored. Rem tells her that Yagami Light is Kira and that she was the Second Kira. Rem also explains to Misa how death notes work. Finally, Rem assures Misa that everything is going according to Light's plan, and that Misa should do whatever Light wants her to do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Light realizes that the current Kira cannot be the First Kira because he has chosen criminals who did crimes accidentally or showed remorse. Furthermore, Light believes that the First Kira's pattern of killing is the same as it would be if he were the First Kira. Misa accepts Rem's story because she knows so much about her and promises to do whatever Light wants done. Before Misa leaves the bathroom, Rem tells her she will be standing behind whoever the Third Kira is. When Misa returns to the interview room, she sees Rem standing behind Higuchi.</p>
<p>Misa returns to the Investigation Team and says she has been hired and was given the cell phone numbers of several of the group members. She says she wants to continue investigating the Yotsuba Group, but Light tells her any more investigating on her part will only put her in more danger. Misa is about to protest, but she quickly agrees. This takes L by surprise, making him suspicious of her actions. While on back the set of her newest movie, Misa goes to the restroom at a hospital during a break and trades costumes with another actress. When she exits the restroom, Mogi--her new "manager"--assumes she is still inside, and doesn't realize what has happened until the other actress exits the restroom wearing Misa's clothes, reluctantly telling him Misa is on a "date".</p>
<p>Misa is picked up by Higuchi outside the hospital and together they drive away. Higuchi asks Misa where they should eat and she says he had better not be taking her to a strange place, because she can kill people. Higuchi asks her why this is, and she says it is because she was the Second Kira. Higuchi already suspects this could be true, but he wonders then why she would still have her memory if he has a death note that belonged to either the First or Second Kira. Higuchi says he is Kira and asks Misa to prove that she is the Second Kira. Higuchi suggests she kill a greedy CEO using her power. Misa tells Higuchi to look away and pretends to use a death note knowing that Rem, who is watching, will do it for her. Higuchi calls the man's bodyguard who tells him his boss has just collapsed. Higuchi accepts that she is the Second Kira and asks her if she will marry him. Misa says she will, but only if he proves that he is Kira. Higuchi tells her he will not prove he is Kira right now, so Misa tells him to stop killing criminals when she asks him to in order to prove he is Kira. Higuchi agrees and allows Misa to leave. Misa then returns to the Investigation Team with a record of part of the conversation as proof that Higuchi is the Kira the team is looking for. Matsuda is thrilled to hear this, but Light looks over at L, who is clearly more suspicious of Misa than ever because of her being able to find the identity of the Third Kira so easily.</p>
