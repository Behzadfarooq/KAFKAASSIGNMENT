See <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_and_process_calculi_history.html" title="Actor model and process calculi history">Actor model and process calculi history</a>.</p>
<p>There are many similarities between the two approaches, but also several differences (some philosophical, some technical):</p>
<ul>
<li>There is only one <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">Actor model</a> (although it has numerous formal systems for design, analysis, verification, modeling, <i>etc.</i>); there are numerous <a href="../../../p/r/o/Process_calculi.html" title="Process calculi">process calculi</a>, developed for reasoning about a variety of different kinds of concurrent systems at various levels of detail (including calculi that incorporate time, stochastic transitions, or constructs specific to application areas such as security analysis).</li>
<li>The Actor model was inspired by the laws of <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> and depends on them for its fundamental axioms, <i>i.e.</i> <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_law.html" title="Physical law">physical laws</a> (see <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_theory.html" title="Actor model theory">Actor model theory</a>); the process calculi were originally inspired by <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebra.html" title="Algebra">algebra</a> <span class="reference" id="ref_Milner1993-"><a href="#endnote_Milner1993-" title="">(Milner 1993)</a></span>.</li>
<li>Processes in the process calculi are anonymous, and communicate by sending messages either through named <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_%28communications%29.html" title="Channel (communications)">channels</a> (synchronous or asynchronous), or via <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambient_calculus.html" title="Ambient calculus">ambients</a> (which can also be used to model channel-like communications <span class="reference" id="ref_CardelliGordon1998-"><a href="#endnote_CardelliGordon1998-" title="">(Cardelli and Gordon 1998)</a></span>). In contrast, actors in the Actor model possess an identity, and communicate by sending messages to the mailing addresses of other actors (this style of communication can also be used to model channel-like communications — see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>The publications on the Actor model and on process calculi have a fair number of cross-references, acknowledgments, and reciprocal citations (see <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_and_process_calculi_history.html" title="Actor model and process calculi history">Actor model and process calculi history</a>).</p>

<p>Indirect communication using channels (<i>e.g.</i> Gilles Kahn and David MacQueen [1977]) has been an important issue for communication in parallel and concurrent computation affecting both semantics and performance. Some process calculi differ from the Actor model in their use of channels as opposed to direct communication.</p>

<p>Synchronous channels have the property that a sender putting a message in the channel must wait for a receiver to get the message out of the channel before the sender can proceed.</p>
<p><a name="Simple_synchronous_channels" id="Simple_synchronous_channels"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_and_process_calculi.html" title="Edit section: Simple synchronous channels">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Simple synchronous channels</span></h3>
<p>A synchronous channel can be modeled by an Actor that receives <tt>put</tt> and <tt>get</tt> communications. The following is the behavior of an Actor for a simple synchronous channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <tt>put</tt> communication has a message and an address to which an acknowledgment is sent when the message is gotten by a <tt>get</tt> communication from the channel in <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFO_c589.html" title="FIFO">FIFO</a> order.</li>
<li>Each <tt>get</tt> communication has an address to which the gotten message is sent.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Synchronous_channels_in_process_calculi" id="Synchronous_channels_in_process_calculi"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_and_process_calculi.html" title="Edit section: Synchronous channels in process calculi">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Synchronous channels in process calculi</span></h3>
<p>However, simple synchronous channels do not suffice for process calculi such as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communicating_Sequential_Processes_6018.html" title="Communicating Sequential Processes">Communicating Sequential Processes</a> (CSP) [Hoare 1978 and 1985] because use of the <i>guarded choice</i> (after Dijkstra) command (called the <i>alternative</i> comannd in CSP). In a guarded choice command multiple offers (called guards) can be made concurrently on multiple channels to <tt>put</tt> and <tt>get</tt> messages; however at most one of the guards can be chosen for each execution of the guarded choice command. Because only one guard can be chosen, a guarded choice command in general effectively requires a kind of <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-phase_commit_protocol.html" title="Two-phase commit protocol">two-phase commit protocol</a> or perhaps even a <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three-phase_commit_protocol.html" title="Three-phase commit protocol">three-phase commit protocol</a> if <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeout_%28telecommunication%29.html" title="Timeout (telecommunication)">time-outs</a> are allowed in guards (as in Occam 3 [1992]).</p>
<p>Consider the following program written in CSP [Hoare 1978]:</p>
<pre>
[X :: Z!stop() ||
 Y :: guard: boolean; guard := true;
     *[guard  →  Z!go(); Z?guard] ||
 Z :: n: integer; n:= 0;
       *[X?stop()  →  Y!false; print!n;
         [] Y?go()  →  n := n+1; Y!true]
]
</pre>
<p>According to Clinger [1981], this program illustrates global nondeterminism, since the nondeterminism arises from incomplete specification of the timing of signals between the three processes <tt>X</tt>, <tt>Y</tt>, and <tt>Z</tt>. The repetitive guarded command in the definition of <tt>Z</tt> has two alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>the <tt>stop</tt> message is accepted from <tt>X</tt>, in which case <tt>Y</tt> is sent the value <b>false</b> and <tt>print</tt> is sent the value <tt>n</tt></li>
<li>a <tt>go</tt> message is accepted from <tt>Y</tt>, in which case <tt>n</tt> is incremented and <tt>Y</tt> is sent the value <b>true</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If <tt>Z</tt> ever accepts the <tt>stop</tt> message from <tt>X</tt>, then <tt>X</tt> terminates. Accepting the <tt>stop</tt> causes <tt>Y</tt> to be sent <b>false</b> which when input as the value of its guard and will cause <tt>Y</tt> to terminate. When both <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> have terminated, <tt>Z</tt> terminates because it no longer has live processes providing input.</p>
<p>In the above program, there are synchronous channels from <tt>X</tt> to <tt>Z</tt>, <tt>Y</tt> to <tt>Z</tt>, and <tt>Z</tt> to <tt>Y</tt>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_and_process_calculi.html" title="Edit section: Analogy with the committee coordination problem">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Analogy with the committee coordination problem</span></h3>
<p>According to Knabe [1992], Chandy and Misra [1988] characterized this as analogous to the committee coordination problem:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Professors in a university are assigned to various committees. Occasionally a professor will decide to attend a meeting of any of her committees, and will wait until that is possible. Meetings may begin only if there is full attendance. The task is to ensure that if all the members of a committee are waiting, then at least one of them will attend some meeting.</dd>
<dd>The crux of this problem is that two or more committees might share a professor. When that professor becomes available, she can only choose one of the meetings, while the others continue to wait.</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_and_process_calculi.html" title="Edit section: A simple distributed protocol">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A simple distributed protocol</span></h3>
<p>This section presents a simple distributed protocol for channels in synchronous process calculi. The protocol has some problems that are addressed in the sections below.</p>
<p>The behavior of a guarded choice command is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The command sends a message to each of its guards to <tt>prepare</tt>.</li>
<li>When it receives the first response from one of its guards that it is prepared, the it sends a message to that guard to <tt>prepare to commit</tt> and sends messages to all of the other guards to <tt>abort</tt>.
<ul>
<li>When it receives a message from the guard that it is <tt>prepared to commit</tt>, then it sends the guard a <tt>commit</tt> message. However, if the guard throws an exception that it cannot <tt>prepare to commit</tt>, then guarded choice command starts the whole process all over again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If all of its guards respond that they cannot <tt>prepare</tt>, then the guarded command does nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The behavior of a guard is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a message to <tt>prepare</tt> is received, then the guard sends a <tt>prepare</tt> message to each of the channels with which it is offering to communicate. If the guard has booleans such that it cannot <tt>prepare</tt> or if any of the channels respond that they cannot <tt>prepare</tt>, then it sends <tt>abort</tt> messages to the other channels and then responds that it cannot <tt>prepare</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>When a message to <tt>prepare to commit</tt> is received, then the guard sends a <tt>prepare to commit</tt> message to each of the channels. If any of the channels respond that they cannot <tt>prepare to commit</tt>, then it sends <tt>abort</tt> messages to the other channels and then throws an exception that it cannot <tt>prepare to commit</tt>.</li>
<li>When a message to <tt>commit</tt> is received, then the guard sends an <tt>commit</tt> message to each of the channels.</li>
<li>When a message to <tt>abort</tt> is received, then the guard sends an <tt>abort</tt> message to each of the channels.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The behavior of a channel is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a <tt>prepare to put</tt> communication is received, then respond that it is prepared if there is a <tt>prepare to get</tt> communication pending unless a <tt>terminate</tt> communication has been received, in which case throw an exception that it cannot <tt>prepare to put</tt>.</li>
<li>When a <tt>prepare to get</tt> communication is received, then respond that it is prepared if there is a <tt>prepare to put</tt> communication pending unless a <tt>terminate</tt> communication has been received, in which case throw an exception that it cannot <tt>prepare to get</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>When a <tt>prepare to commit to put</tt> communication is received, then respond that it is prepared if there is a <tt>prepare to commit to get</tt> communication pending unless a <tt>terminate</tt> communication has been received, in which case throw an exception that it cannot <tt>prepare to commit to put</tt>.</li>
<li>When a <tt>prepare to commit to get</tt> communication is received, then respond that it is prepared if there is a <tt>prepare to commit to put</tt> communication pending unless a <tt>terminate</tt> communication has been received, in which case throw an exception that it cannot <tt>prepare to commit to get</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>When a <tt>commit put</tt> communication is received, then depending on which of the following is received:
<ul>
<li>When a <tt>commit get</tt> communication is received, then if not already done perform the <tt>put</tt> and <tt>get</tt> and clean up the preparations.</li>
<li>When an <tt>abort get</tt> communication is received, then cancel the preparations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a <tt>commit get</tt> communication is received, then depending on which of the following is received:

<p>Again consider the program written in CSP (discussed in <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_and_process_calculi.html#Synchronous_channels_in_process_calculi" title="Actor model and process calculi">Synchronous channels in process calculi</a> above):</p>

</pre>
<p>As pointed out in Knabe [1992], an issue with the above protocol (<a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_and_process_calculi.html#A_simple_distributed_protocol" title="Actor model and process calculi">A simple distributed protocol</a>) is that the process <tt>Z</tt> might never accept the <tt>stop</tt> message from <tt>X</tt> (a phenomenon called <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resource_starvation.html" title="Resource starvation">starvation</a>) and consequently the above program might never print anything.</p>
<p>In contrast consider, a simple Actor system that consists of Actors <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b>, and <b>print</b> where</p>
<dl>
<dd>the Actor <b>X</b> is created with the following behavior:
<ul>
<li>If the message <tt>"start"</tt> is received, then send <b>Z</b> the message <tt>"stop"</tt></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>the Actor <b>Y</b> is created with the following behavior:
<ul>
<li>If the message <tt>"start"</tt> is received, then send <b>Z</b> the message <tt>"go"</tt></li>
<li>If the message <b>true</b> is received, then send <b>Z</b> the message <tt>"go"</tt></li>
<li>If the message <b>false</b> is received, then do nothing</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>the Actor <b>Z</b> is created with the following behavior that has a count <tt>n</tt> that is initially <b>0</b>:
<ul>
<li>If the message <tt>"start"</tt> is received, then do nothing.</li>
<li>If the message <tt>"stop"</tt> is received, then send <b>Y</b> the message <b>false</b> and send <b>print</b> the message the count <tt>n</tt>.</li>
<li>If the message <tt>"go"</tt> is received, then send <b>Y</b> the message <b>true</b> and process the next message received with count <tt>n</tt> being <tt>n+1</tt>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>By the laws of Actor semantics, the above Actor system will always halt when the Actors <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, are <b>Z</b> are each sent a <tt>"start"</tt> message resulting in sending <b>print</b> a number that can be unbounded large.</p>
<p>The difference between the CSP program and the Actor system is that the Actor <b>Z</b> does not get messages using a guarded choice command from multiple channels. Instead it processes messages in arrival ordering, and by the laws for Actor systems, the <tt>stop</tt> message is guaranteed to arrive.</p>

<li><i>Starvation.</i> The use of sychronous channels can cause starvation when a process attempts to get messages from multiple channels in a guarded choice command.</li>
<li><i>Livelock.</i> The use of synchronous channels can cause a process to be caught in livelock when it attempts to get messages from multiple channels in a guarded choice command.</li>
<li><i>Efficiency.</i> The use of synchronous channels can require a large number of communications in order to get messages from multiple channels in a guarded choice command.</li>

<p>It is notable that in all of the above, issues arise from the use of a guarded choice command to get messages from multiple channels.</p>

<p>Asynchronous channels have that property that a sender putting a message in the channel need not wait for a receiver to get the message out of the channel.</p>

<p>An asynchronous channel can be modeled by an Actor that receives <tt>put</tt> and <tt>get</tt> communications. The following is the behavior of an Actor for a simple asynchronous channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <tt>put</tt> communication has a message and an address to which an acknowledgment is sent immediately (without waiting for the message to be gotten by a <tt>get</tt> communication).</li>
<li>Each <tt>get</tt> communication has an address to which the gotten message is sent.</li>

<p>The Join-calculus programming language (published in 1996) implemented local and distributed concurrent computations. It incorporated asynchronous channels as well as a kind of synchronous channel that is used for procedure calls. Agha's Aπ Actor calculus <span class="reference" id="ref_AghaThati-"><a href="#endnote_AghaThati-" title="">(Agha and Thati 2004)</a></span> is based on a typed version of the asynchronous <a href="../../../p/i/-/Pi-calculus.html" title="Pi-calculus">π-calculus</a>.</p>

<p>Migration is the ability of computational agencies to change locations. <i>E.g.</i>, in his dissertation, Aki Yonezawa modeled a post office that customer Actors could enter, change locations within while operating, and exit. An Actor that can migrate can be modeled by having a location Actor that changes when the Actor migrates. However the faithfullness of this modeling is controversial and the subject of research.</p>
<p>Note that there is a potential confusion in that the original literature on process calculi used the term <i>mobility</i> to mean the ability to change the topology of communication whereas later <i>mobility</i> is sometimes use to mean <i>migration</i>. <i>E.g.,</i> process calculi such as the higher-order <a href="../../../p/i/-/Pi-calculus.html" title="Pi-calculus">π-calculus</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/i/API-Calculus_9172.html" title="API-Calculus">API-Calculus</a> used <i>mobility</i> to mean change in topology whereas the <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_ambients.html" title="Mobile ambients">mobile ambients</a> use <i>mobility</i> to mean <i>migration</i>. In this respect the <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambient_calculus.html" title="Ambient calculus">ambient calculus</a> differs from the <a href="../../../p/i/-/Pi-calculus.html" title="Pi-calculus">π-calculus</a> in that communication is through ambients as opposed to being though channels in the <a href="../../../p/i/-/Pi-calculus.html" title="Pi-calculus">π-calculus</a>.</p>
