<p>I think that we should at least discuss the restoration of impeachment. Certainly the impeachment of the President of the United States is considerably different than an ordinary criminal trial. While certainly the presumption of innoncence should apply, it is noteworthy that in several other nations with presidential systems the president is somewhat or completely constrained in his actions while under impeachment. The presence of these comments in the article is not necessarily an endorsment of this viewpoint but rather an acknowledgement that it definitely exists, and should not be so arbitrarily and capricously eliminated in my view. <a href="../../../r/l/q/User%7ERlquall_e541.html" title="User:Rlquall">Rlquall</a> 01:25, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a huge difference between what happened on this fictional TV show and anything that is yet to occur in real life. On the show, the President announced his stepping aside in favor of the Speaker in a formal Cabinet meeting while his daughter had been kidnapped in a time of national crisis; the fictional Speaker/Acting President had to order a military attack in which the U.S. forces took casualties, and he served as President for several days before the President's daughter was recovered, not just for the duration of anesthesia for minor surgery. It seems fairly likely that such a person could be regarded as a former President; much less likely that the real-world Cheney would be seen as such, at least based on his career to date and laying aside the considerations that many make that he may already be President to a large extent on a day-to-day basis. A more interesting question the show raised in my opinion was whether a Speaker, President Pro Tem, or other such official would be expected to or likely to resign that previous position only to act as President for only a matter of hours or days as the <i>West Wing</i> character did. <a href="../../../r/l/q/User%7ERlquall_e541.html" title="User:Rlquall">Rlquall</a> 01:38, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Considering that, even though the show's priorities are drama and good storytelling, they do actually research constitutional law and have professional consultants fact-checking them, I'd like to see a little more discussion to the aspects of Acting Presidency that the <i>West Wing</i> episodes raised. No, it hasn't happened in real life, but especially considering some of the news stories on the First Family in recent years, it's closer to a possibility than anyone might like.<br />
<br />
However, as it <i>is</i> fiction, I defer to others' judgement as to whether it should be expanded upon. <a href="../../../s/f/f/User%7ESffcorgi_ee57.html" title="User:Sffcorgi">Corgi</a> 14:32, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Under the sub-section "Authorities" , this article says an Acting President is even addressed as Mr.President. Was George H.W. Bush on July 13, 1985 or Dick Cheney on June 29, 2002 addressed as Mr.President? Not publicly and as for privately (no one knows). This "addressed as Mr.President" statement, seems unfounded. Also it would appear arrogant and insulting to the First Family. Mightberight/wrong 21:30, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you consider the fact that traditionally (as far as I know), a person (in US) is addressed by the highest office they've held to date, for example Clinton would still be address as Mr. President if he's next to the current President as he's the 42nd President of the US, I don't see it as arrogant or insulting. It's probably argued that it is being respectful to address the Acting President as Mr. President, rather than insulting, as he (or she) would be carrying out the power and duties of the office of presidency. One's being respectful of the person, and the position. -- <a href="../../../k/t/c/User%7EKTC_0713.html" title="User:KTC">KTC</a> 02:43, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Bill Clinton was President of the USA &amp; all former President's of the USA (to date), are/were addressed as Mr.President. However an Acting President, is still the Vice President of the USA, an Acting President of the USA should still be adressed as Mr/Madam Vice President. If for example Cheney had to serve as Acting President for the rest of Bush's term, He's still Vice President and should be adressed as Mr. Vice President. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 21:55, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think there's any (known) definite policy on this, but a Vice President, or anyone else serving as Acting President is the President at that particular time, so in my opinion should be addressed as Mr. / Madam President. Part of addressing someone as President is addressing the office in which the person holds (held), in this case it may be so that it's not permanent, but they are still holding / carrying out the power and duties of the office at the time. In a formal meeting, the chairperson would be address as such, this include the time when one have a acting chair because the normal chair is stepping aside temporarily or is unavailable. If VP Cheney is the Acting President when you meet him, he <b>is</b> the President of the USA at that particular time, even if at another time he would be rightfully only VP, so should be address as Mr. President (at that time). How an Ex-Acting President is address is probably a different question and depends on how long that person was AP, and how public it was when it occurs, whether it was the VP that was AP, or a resigned Speaker, President Pro. Temp. ... etc. -- <a href="../../../k/t/c/User%7EKTC_0713.html" title="User:KTC">KTC</a> 00:01, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I still must disagree, as Acting President of the USA, one does not hold the office of President of the USA, but rather discharges the powers &amp; duties of that office, while mantaining his/her current office (vice president). During the time Cheney would be Acting President, George W. Bush would still be President of the USA. There can't be 2 Presidents of the USA at the same time. The scenerio would be as follows: George W. Bush, President of the USA &amp; Richard B. Cheney, Vice President of the USA-Acting President of the USA.

<dd>Six months after the above discussion, the disputed sentence remains in the article (‘Acting Presidents are addressed as "Mr. President" during their service’). There are arguments pro and con addressing an Acting President as "Mr. [or Madam] President" but they are merely arguments so the Wikipedia article shouldn't make this statement as a fact. I have put in a "<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>" designator but I doubt there is any authoritative source for this one way or another, and therefore the sentence should probably just be deleted. Alternatively, change it to ‘It is not known whether Acting Presidents are addressed as "Mr./Madam President".’ If somebody really wants to research this, then why not make a phone call to the Vice President's press office and ask whether Cheney was addressed as Mr. President during the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush_transfer_of_power.html" title="Bush transfer of power">period in 2002</a> when the 25th Amendment was invoked for George W.

<dl>
<dd>I'm going based my answer on the above comment and what's been crossed-out and now removed about the seal. The seal is for the office of the President of the USA, not the person. So an Acting President would use the President Seal when he's acting as the President. It would be ridiculous for example, for an (Ex-)Speaker of the House as Acting President to be issuing Executive Order bearing the Seal of the Speaker. He or she would be issuing the order, signing off bills or whatever as the President, under the power of the office of the President, not the Speaker (or whatever) and so uses the Seal of the office. -- <a href="../../../k/t/c/User%7EKTC_0713.html" title="User:KTC">KTC</a> 00:17, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Today there was an edit to the section "Other potential invocation situations" that addressed President Clinton. The edit is attempting to add balance to an otherwise absurd bullet point that suggests, without any foundation whatsoever, than an impeached President is or should be unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office to which he was legitimately elected. While several U.S. states have provisions of their Constitutions or laws that prevented an impeached official from the exercise of the duties of his or her office, there is NO corresponding section or intrepretation in the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>The edit does a good job, but the fact remains that the inclusion of President Clinton in the "Other potential invocation situations" is improper as it relates to impeachment. The only inclusion of President Clinton in this Section that I would support would be information relating to when President Clinton hurt his knee and underwent repair surgey using local anesthetic.</p>
<p>I'd like to get other thoughts on the subject and inform everyone of my thoughts before I just remove the offending section. If there is a contrary opinion that would object to removing this section, please post here so we can discuss. If not, I will remove the section.<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonCNJ_ddfd.html" title="User:JasonCNJ">JasonCNJ</a> 02:36, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not that I am advocating this to be added, but what happens if the VP was named active president for a time and after the President says he can resume executing his duties, the VP refuses to hand over power? <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbiteroftruth_4aad.html" title="User:Arbiteroftruth">Arbiteroftruth</a> 06:38, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If the VP became "Acting President" under Section 3 of the 25th Amendment which permits the President to self-declare an incapacity, and then the President signs and transmits a letter to the Speaker and Pres Pro Tem of the Senate declaring the inability no longer exists, then the President automatically resumes his powers and duties - there is no capacity for the Vice President to "refuse" to hand over power...he simply doesn't have the power once the resumption letters are transmitted. Orders he gives to the military cannot be followed, orders he gives to the Cabinet secretaries cannot be followed, etc. He can still sit and say "I am Acting President; I refuse to hand over power." but no one will actually ...listen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At all times, though, the Vice President can avail himself of the options in Section 4 of the Amendment. The Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet can transmit a written declaration to the Speaker and the Pres Pro Tem that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office and, upon sending that letter, shall immediately execute the duties as "Acting President." The President can send a letter to Congress saying "I am able to exercise the powers and duties" and begin the resumption of his duties -- but the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet can send <i>another letter</i> to those same officers declaring their belief that the President is wrong within four days. After receipt of the second letter from the VP and a majority of the Cabinet, Congress has 21 to determine, by a two-thirds vote, that the President is unable to discharge his powers and duties. If Congress does not determine that by a two-thirds vote within 21 days, or if Congress does not come into session within 21 days after getting the last letter, then the President automatically resumes the powers and duties of his office. If Congress, by a 2/3 vote of each House, does agree with the declaration of the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet, then the Vice President will continue as "Acting President."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given the practice of how a Vice President is selected, a situation involving Section 4 would be somewhat difficult to imagine. The closest we ever came to that occurrance was when President Reagan was shot and was undergoing surgery. At that time, it was fairly clear that the President was incapacited and he was unable to transmit letters declaring so to the appropriate people prior to going under anesthesia. Then-Vice President Bush apparently refused to sign a letter declaring the President incapacited, fearing it would amount to a coup d` etat and be inappropriate. Then-Vice President Bush became <i>de facto</i> Acting President but did not have the powers and duties of the President and did not act as such.</dd>

<p>Now for another scenario. At some point there is no Vice-President. As there have not been recent elections there is no President-elect or Vice-President elect either. Not such an entirely bizarre state of affairs. Then the President dies. At that point the Speaker of the House becomes acting-President for the remainder of the term of the deceased President. He will, if I am correct, not become President, but merely act as President with full Constitutional powers for potentially a period of years! Isn't it a bit odd that under such a scenario this man will not actually become President but just act as such for a prolonged period? Couldn't they have made provisions for such an officer actually succeeding instead of just acting, in cases where there is no 'propper' President? That would be equivalent to the position of the VP, who actually becomes President when the President dies. Also, could such an acting-President as decribed above nominate a Vice-President, who would then take over his job by default the moment he was sworn in as Vice-President? Could the acting-President nominate himself as Vice-President and thereby become a 'propper' President? Or would the acting President perhaps be <b>obliged</b> to nominate a Vice-President (as per Section 2 that establishes a procedure for filling a Vice-Presidential vacancy)?Gerard von Hebel 17:59, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok... the president and VP die 2 weeks into the first term and the Speaker is made the acting President. The Speaker (now the acting POTUS) finishes out the term as the acting president and is elected to the next term as the president? Is this person elgable to be re-elected for another (3rd) term since they have only served one term as the actual presidnet?--<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_who1975_66e5.html" title="User:Dr who1975">Dr who1975</a> 18:09, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No; the text of the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_fa39.html" title="Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> specifically provides that if you have "acted as President" for more than two years of a term for which someone else was elected, then you yourself can be elected as president only once. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathew5000_303f.html" title="User:Mathew5000">Mathew5000</a> 18:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
