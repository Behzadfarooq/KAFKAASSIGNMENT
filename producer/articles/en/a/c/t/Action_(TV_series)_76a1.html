	    <p><i><b>Action</b></i> was a short-lived comedy series about a Hollywood producer named Peter Dragon, who is trying to recover from his last box-office failure. It aired on FOX during the 1999-2000 season. The series was critically praised for its irreverent, and sometimes hostile look at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> culture. Thirteen episodes were produced.

<p><b>Peter Dragon</b>, played by <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Mohr_a85a.html" title="Jay Mohr">Jay Mohr</a>, is a star producer at Dragonfire Films. Peter got his start as a screenwriter for <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_pornography.html" title="Gay pornography">gay porn</a>, but eventually moved up the ladder of Hollywood as a hotshot producer of tasteless <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_movie.html" title="Action movie">action films</a>. At the start of the series, Peter's latest film, <i>Slow Torture</i>, is a monumental flop, and he is under tremendous pressure to make his next film a big success. Peter is bossy and arrogant to his subordinates and is morally unscrupulous in negotiating with Hollywood talent. It is frequently suggested that Peter is sexually confused.</p>
<p><b>Wendy Ward</b>, played by <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illeana_Douglas_19e4.html" title="Illeana Douglas">Illeana Douglas</a>, is a former child actress who gained fame as the cute star of <i>The Elephant Princess</i>. Her career tanked during her teen years due to a nasty coke habit, and she is now a high priced call girl. Through circumstance, she ends up becoming Peter's date at the premiere of his movie <i>Slow Torture</i>. After she gives her honest criticism of <i>Slow Torture</i>, Wendy is named Vice President of Production at Dragonfire Films. Wendy's character is an intentional play on the "<a href="../../../h/o/o/Hooker_with_a_heart_of_gold.html" title="Hooker with a heart of gold">hooker with a heart of gold</a>" movie stereotype.</p>
<p><b>Lonnie Dragon</b>, played by <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Hackett_e5d4.html" title="Buddy Hackett">Buddy Hackett</a>, is Peter's uncle and chief of security at Dragonfire Films. Lonnie and Peter seem to understand each other perfectly. Lonnie is one of the few people Peter actually treats with respect. Lonnie has served in many wars, including World War II, and often complains about past injuries, most notably the fact that he only has one testicle. As he puts it, "The sack is half full."</p>
<p><b>Stuart Glazer</b>, played by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Plotnick_6853.html" title="Jack Plotnick">Jack Plotnick</a>, is President of Production at Dragonfire Films. Stuart desperately wants to be taken seriously as a Hollywood developer, but is frequently abused and ordered around by Peter. In spite of his important sounding position, Stuart is often asked to do demeaning tasks like babysit Georgia, have suits dry-cleaned and order gift baskets for star talent. Stuart is gay.</p>
<p><b>Adam Rafkin</b>, played by Jarrad Paul, is a struggling screenwriter whose screenplay, <i>Beverly Hills Gun Club</i>, was picked up by Dragonfire Films for development. Adam's script was actually bought mistakenly because his name was confused with <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Rifkin_6a0a.html" title="Alan Rifkin">Alan Rifkin</a>. Adam lives alone, is sexually inexperienced and has had the same fuddy duddy agent represent him for most of his floundering professional career. A source of frustration is his lack of respect from Hollywood, most notably from Peter who never seems to recall his name.</p>

<p><b>Bobby Gianopolis</b>, played by <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Arenberg_6782.html" title="Lee Arenberg">Lee Arenberg</a> is the chief executive of Dragonfire Films. Bobby G, as he is well known, uses menacing threats to get what he wants from Peter and the rest of the Dragonfire staff. Often these threats involve withdrawing his massive financial backing or exposing his gigantic penis. Bobby G is gay, but married Jane, Peter's ex-wife, in order to quell any rumors of such. Many critics have suggested that Bobby is a parody of former FOX CEO <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Diller_64d5.html" title="Barry Diller">Barry Diller</a>.</p>
<p><b>Jane Dragon</b>, played by Cindy Ambuehl, is Peter's ex-wife. It is never revealed why she and Peter broke up, but she remarried with Bobby Gianopolis mostly to spite Peter. She is manipulative, scheming and is so orally gifted she can hum and whistle at the same time. She has a daughter by Peter named Georgia.</p>
<p><b>Georgia Dragon</b>, played by <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sara_Paxton_75ee.html" title="Sara Paxton">Sara Paxton</a>, is Peter's daughter by Jane. Ten years old, she is deceptively innocent but mildly stone-hearted for her age, a trait she gets from her parents.</p>
<p><b>Jenny</b>, played by <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erin_Daniels_1d7d.html" title="Erin Daniels">Erin Daniels</a>, is a struggling Hollywood career woman. She used to work at UPN, but after sleeping with Peter, moved on to become a production assistant at Dragonfire Films, where she then slept with Wendy. She is in competition with Stuart.</p>
<p><b>Cole Riccardi</b>, played by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Burgi_7a4f.html" title="Richard Burgi">Richard Burgi</a>, is a famous action star who has been in many of Peter's movies. He is introspective, self-obsessed and secretly gay.</p>
<p><b>Connie Hunt</b>, played by <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Aquino_62e7.html" title="Amy Aquino">Amy Aquino</a>, is the aggressive publicist assigned to Peter Dragon by Bobby Gianapolis after a major PR disaster. She is dry, practical, cold-hearted, and is portrayed with the aura of a hitman/cleaner. A clap of lightning and thunder usually follows mention of her name.</p>
<p><b>Titus Scroad</b>, played by <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._Lee_Ermey_3e81.html" title="R. Lee Ermey">R. Lee Ermey</a> is an eccentric movie director with a predilection for hydro-colonic therapy.</p>
<p><b>Holden van Dorn</b>, played by <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fab_Filippo_5657.html" title="Fab Filippo">Fab Filippo</a> is a hotshot young actor, with a very public record of alcohol and drug abuse.</p>
<p><b>Reagan Lauren Busch</b>, played by <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Lyons_3a31.html" title="Jennifer Lyons">Jennifer Lyons</a> is a sexy starlet with a big appetite and weight problems.</p>

<p><i>Action</i> was unusually explicit for a series on American broadcast television. The characters regularly used obscenities which were bleeped out (the DVD release restores them), and the writers managed to introduce sexual humor without explicitly calling attention to it. For example, in one scene Bobby Gianopolis has a prostate examination while standing at his desk during a business meeting. When he tells the doctor he's ready for the examination, the doctor tells him he has already begun. In another instance, Peter Dragon and Holden van Dorn drop in unexpectedly at Adam's apartment. During the ensuing scene, it becomes clear that Adam had been watching pornography and masturbating.</p>

<li>At one point, Peter Dragon refers to the show's producer (<a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Silver_f6a3.html" title="Joel Silver">Joel Silver</a>) as a "fat hack" who produced <i><a href="../../../x/a/n/Xanadu_%28film%29.html" title="Xanadu (film)">Xanadu</a></i>.</li>
