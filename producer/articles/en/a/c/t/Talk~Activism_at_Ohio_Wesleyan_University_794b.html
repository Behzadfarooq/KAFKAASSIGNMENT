<p>When I first read the paragraph about <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Rickey_9adb.html" title="Branch Rickey">Branch Rickey</a> I did not understand why he was included in it. I made a minor change to clarify this. I also think that the article would benefit with have it broken up into sections insted of it flowing as all one piece. Perhaps move the picture of Branch Rickey and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Robinson_5b0c.html" title="Jackie Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> to the paragraph about Branch Rickey. It is an interesting read. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDincher_280e.html" title="User:Dincher">Dincher</a> 23:10, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I actually have some questions about both of their inclusions here. Do I think they are notable and activist <b>from</b> OWU? Yes. Branch Rickey is one of the most notable Almn's the school ever had. But the page is titled "Activism <b>at</b> Ohio Wesleyan Univeristy." Perhaps making another section showing that activism of students continues on beyond OWU? I think this article would do a lot better if it was broken down into sections anyway, why not one highlighting activist alumnis?

<p>OK, The references here were not nearly as bad as they were on the OWU main page, but they still need some attention---particularly around the Campus Crusade for Christ issue. I personally do not like CCC, but unless you can provide better resources, then I question the inclusion in the section. I do not believe this event, which appears to be isolated to the campus only, is notable. {That doesn't mean that it doesn't matter to current students, but is it encyclopedic? Will it be an issue people care about 10-20 years down the road? I don't think so---I cannot see it being more notable than the bonfires in 90 or 91.) The article over is improving, but the article still has a fair amount of POV... and it has improved since being nominated for GAR.</p>

<p>It was my senior year at OWU. The people who were grandfathered in by the 21 year old drinking age were now over 21, so the only people old enough to drink (legally) were seniors. Shortly before fall exams, the campus announced a decision to become a dry campus! Needless to say, this idea was not well received. One of the fraternities (I believe it was FiJi) decided to have a protest party. The party was busted by Campus Security and 4 kegs were confiscated. The following night, some of the fraternity brothers staged a "jail break." They broke into Campus Security and broke the kegs out. An impromptu party broke out on the Hill that involved a small fire. This went on for two or three different nights. On Friday it was a huge event. The bonfire only had a radius of about 30 feet and flames going up 100+ feet into the air. Delaware police showed up, looked at the 400+ people gathered around the fire and left. The fire department showed up and left. Rumors started circulating that the National Guard had been called in to break up the group. In the mean time, fraternities were bringing couches, matresses, coke machines, benches, lamp posts, and basically anything not nailed down to feed the fire. One of my friends, who worked for the Transcript, had her camera and notebook thrown into the fire. At about 1:00 am a bunch of busses showed up, and everybody prepared to run convinced it was the national guard. It was a fraternity and soreity returning from an off campus event---and the fire got a second wind. All Rush activities were suspended the following semester and there was a threat of having all Greek activities kicked off campus. This event was absolutely huge among the students at OWU, we didn't want to become a dry campus, but I would be very surprised if anybody there now has even heard of this. And I suspect that in 10 years nobody will remember the adam affair... it may feel important today, but it isn't encyclopedic.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 08:06, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the latest episode of the Alumni magazine (I forget what it is called) there was an article about how OWU won some prize for activism due to its response to Katrina. I don't remember the details and can't find my copy of the magazine, but thought it might be worth looking up... I bet you that you could probably find the magazine at the alumni office.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 05:33, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

In addition, several of the references I checked don't back up what the article says. For example, this statement "During <i>Ohio Wesleyan University Against the War</i> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_5.html" title="October 5">October 5</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_17.html" title="November 17">November 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, more than a hundred students held peace rallies in front of the Delaware city hall" is supposed to be supported by reference #35 at this link <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/groups.php?state=OH" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/groups.php?state=OH" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> but when I pulled up that link there was nothing about how many students protested. I noticed similar problems with other references. Until these POV and reference issues are fixed, I don't see how this can be a GA.

<dd>Other reference issues include reference #2 for the statement "<b><a href="../../../s/t/u/Student_activism.html" title="Student activism">Activism</a></b> was embedded in the very vision for founding of <b><a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_University_7bf4.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan University">Ohio Wesleyan University</a></b> and has played an important role in its history."<a href="http://admission.owu.edu/faqs_whyowu.html#reputation" class="external autonumber" title="http://admission.owu.edu/faqs_whyowu.html#reputation" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> If you go to that link, there is nothing about activism playing an important role in the college's history.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another problematic reference is #39, supporting the statement "In April 2002, about a hundred Ohio Wesleyan students gathered on <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Mall_f1e8.html" title="National Mall">The Mall</a> in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> in the second day of a weekend of protests for an array of causes, including the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Middle East crisis</a>, but also to denounce lending policies of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bank_2c67.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>.<a href="http://www.islam-online.net/English/News/2002-04/22/article02.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.islam-online.net/English/News/2002-04/22/article02.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> However, if you go to that link you will find that only one Wesleyan student is mentioned and that, instead of "a hundred Ohio Wesleyan students" taking part in the protest "Several hundred protesters, hemmed in by police, rallied outside the World Bank." In short, the protesters were from a number of colleges.</dd>

<dd>I found this type of sloppy referencing throughout the article. If even a few statements are not supported by their reference, it will cause people to question all info in the article. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 20:53, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the feedback. I will double-check the references and if they support information exactly stated in the article. Thank you once again. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaSaltarella_7b57.html" title="User:LaSaltarella">LaSaltarella</a> 00:13, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, I don't believe the article has had its POV issues corrected. For example, in the lead it states that "The founders' vision maintained that the university "is forever to be conducted on the most liberal principles." However, the reference I can access on this at <a href="http://go.owu.edu/~catalog/cat-a04.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://go.owu.edu/~catalog/cat-a04.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> states that "The Charter of Ohio Wesleyan University, granted in 1842, provides that 'the University is forever to be conducted on the most liberal principles, accessible to all religious denominations, and designed for the benefit of our citizens in general.' The spirit of this statement has persisted through the years, so that today Ohio Wesleyan continues to live and thrive in an environment of intellectual freedom." In short, the University was founded on a vision of intellectual freedom, not activism. This is verified in other parts of the reference, which state that "Ohio Wesleyan judges itself successful when it has accomplished three objectives in its work with students:" 1) to impart knowledge; 2) to develop and enhance certain important capabilities of students (reading, writing and quantitative analysis); and 3) to place education in the context of values.</p>
<p>None of that states anything about activism. Yes, the intellectual freedom and values of the University provide fertile ground for activism, but to state that "Activism was embedded in the very vision for founding of Ohio Wesleyan University" is POV. The vision was intellectual freedom, education, and values (at least, that's what the provided reference states). Hope this helps.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 14:33, 19 February 2007 (UTC</p>

<p>In 2003, both Ohio Wesleyan students and the administration severely criticized and acted against the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campus_Crusade_for_Christ_af91.html" title="Campus Crusade for Christ">Campus Crusade for Christ</a> group.<sup id="_ref-OWProtestingCCC_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OWProtestingCCC" title="">[1]</a></sup> The organization is an interdenominational Christian organization, focusing on evangelism and discipleship in over 190 countries around the world. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> Students and administrators complained of being bullied by the ministry's members. <sup id="_ref-OWUandCCC_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OWUandCCC" title="">[3]</a></sup> The most recent backlash at OWU was due to the Campus Crusade's "Do You Agree with Adam?" campaign, which encouraged Christians campuswide to openly display signs of their faith. Most believed the resulting actions, such as <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidewalk_chalk.html" title="Sidewalk chalk">chalking</a>, were aggressively intrusive and spread religious intolerance.<sup id="_ref-OWUtolerance_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OWUtolerance" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-OWUandCCC_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OWUandCCC" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-OWChalking_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OWChalking" title="">[5]</a></sup> As a result, several activist groups and the administration protested the organization's presence on campus. As a result, Campus Crusade for Christ was expelled from the campus for the remainder of the 2003-2004 school year.<sup id="_ref-OWUtolerance_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OWUtolerance" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-OWProtestingCCC_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OWProtestingCCC" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Hello, I've just done a quick copy edit of this article. I also removed a quotation which seemed to have a missing word, and also seemed to be out of context. Basically it seemed too weird to leave as-is, so I deleted it. If this is stepping on someone's toes, I'm very sorry! <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJessicapierce_833a.html" title="User:Jessicapierce">Jessicapierce</a> 19:14, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
