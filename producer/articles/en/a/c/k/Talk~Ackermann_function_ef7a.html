<dd>I don't think so, not even if you decrease the arguments in our version. In particular, their definition gives perfect powers of two, where ours gives 3 less than the powers (e.g. wiki_ack(3,3) = 61 = 2<sup>6</sup>-3, while theirs never takes on that value). Their version does snip off the uninteresting bottom few rows of the table, which may not be a bad idea, but it's not the "true" ackermann function. It may or not be asymptotically equal to that function with some change of arguments, I'm not sure on that point. -- <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pakaran</a> 03:58, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've seen quite a few different functions called Ackermann functions, with anything from one through three arguments; about all they have in common was that they are easy-to-define recursive functions which grow too fast to be primitive recursive. I suggest we add a paragraph on these sort of 'variants' of the Ackermann function. <a href="../../../4/p/q/User%7E4pq1injbok.html" title="User:4pq1injbok">4pq1injbok</a> 23:07, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By using formulas for the A(0,n) through A(3,n), one shortcuts the recursion. If a program had to actually thread through the recursion, it would require way way too many steps.</dd>

<dd>I take issue with the first half of the sentence. It's kind of imprecise. It should at least give the order of the number at which it changes to 5. Also there needs to be some mention of a practical use - the union-find data structure. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesilverbail_89d5.html" title="User:Thesilverbail">Deepak</a> 14:35, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not something I fully understand myself - it was based on a single paragraph in one of my college textbooks. I don't think we have an article on union-find in any event. F becomes 4 at A(4,4) which has a number of digits whose own number of digits cannot be written in the physical universe, correct me if I'm wrong. It becomes 5 at a number which is far bigger than that. The point is a real computer running union-find on an input with only one element per proton in the universe will have no problem, nor if it first expands each proton to a universe the size of our own a fair number of times. This would probably require an environmental impact statement or something&#160;:). <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pakaran</a><a href="../../../p/a/k/User_talk%7EPakaran_4352.html" title="User talk:Pakaran">.</a> 16:24, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed. I remember what Aho-Ulmann had to say "\alpha [the inverse] eventually reaches 4, then 5 and so on in its unimaginably slow crawl to infinity." Let's at least write your description - "number of digits whose own digits cannot be written in the physical universe" (to be pendantic, we should say in base-10).

<dd>A(4, 4) is A(3, A(4, 3)), or A(3, A(3, A(4, 2))) - which is to say 2 to the power of a number which is itself 2 to the power of a number which would require a good fraction of a day to read aloud. A(5, 5) is a horse of another color. The practicalities of storing an input the size of either in a PC's address space are left as an exercise.

<p>If I understood the Aaronson article (under "References") correctly, the Ackermann function extends the line of operations "addition, multiplication, exponential" to "tetration, pentation" and so forth. So you have:</p>
<pre>
A(1) = 1 + 1
A(2) = 2 * 2
A(3) = 3 ^ 3 = (3 * 3) * 3
A(4) = 4 tetrated 4 = ((4 ^ 4) ^ 4) ^ 4
A(5) = 5 pentated 5 = (((5 tetrated 5) tetrated 5) tetrated 5) tetrated 5
...
</pre>
<p>The definition of the function in the Wikipedia article seems to be different, but the "Explicit description" section says something about "[...] iterated exponentiation, iteration of this operation and so on", so it sounds like the essence is the same in the two definitions.</p>
<p>I just stumbled across this article because it was featured, so I'm not a mathematician and thus don't really know what I'm talking about here! However, if the Ackermann function really has an as simple intuitive meaning as this, maybe there should be a table showing this, like the one I just wrote.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a modified Ackermann function which simplifies the explicit formulas for each level in the hierarchy. This function is defined for positive integers <i>m,n</i> both starting at 1 instead of 0:</p>

</dl>
<p>This function meets:</p>
<pre>
A(1,n) = 1 + 1 + ... (n 1's) ... + 1 + 2 = 2+n
A(2,n) = 2 + 2 + ... (n 2's) ... + 2 = 2*n
A(3,n) = 2 * 2 * ... (n 2's) ... * 2 = 2^n
A(4,n) = 2 ^ 2 ^ ... (n 2's) ... ^ 2 = 2 tetrated n
 <i>(powers are evaluated right-to-left as usual and so should the rest of operators;
  I borrowed the terms "tetrated", "pentated", etc. from "Intuitive meaning" above)</i>
A(5,n) = 2 tetrated 2 tetrated 2 ... (n 2's) ... tetrated 2 = 2 pentated n
A(6,n) = 2 pentated 2 pentated 2 ... (n 2's) ... pentated 2 = 2 hexated n
etc.
</pre>
<p>In particular, A(<i>m</i>,2) = 4 for all <i>m</i>, which implies that A(<i>m</i>, 3) = A(<i>m</i>-1, 4) for <i>m</i> &gt; 1.</p>
<p>I think that the hierarchy is more easily understood this way.</p>

<p>The Ackermann’s ‘function’ hardly counts as a function --- its array or table of values is merely a perverse pathological maze. Indeed, it blatantly demonstrates that the clearly ill-defined Ackermann’s function is an antinomy or self-contradiction paradox just like:</p>
<p>(1) Cantor’s diagonal argument [the sequence of diagonal terms is actually an inherent list-inclusion-and-imposition-of-order condition for the row-listing so that the anti-diagonal-terms expression is indubitably excluded from the row-list]; or</p>
<p>(2) Cantor’s bone-of-contention “set of all the elements of an infinite set which are not contained in their respective images for a presumed one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the given infinite set and the members of its power set [see Wikipedia article and discussion on Cantor’s Theorem]; or</p>
<p>(3) the ‘liar’ paradox [“This statement is false” — which is both true and false at the same time].</p>
<p>The following is a very simple counter-argument to the generally accepted claim that the Ackermann’s function is recursive but not primitive recursive:</p>
<p>(1) Clearly, the first row of the Ackermann’s function values table or array already enumerates the natural numbers — A(0,n) = n + 1 — or, recursively: A(0,0) = 1, A(0,n) = A(0,n-1) + 1.</p>
<p>(2) The Ackermann’s function has N x N as domain and N+ as range, where N is the set of all natural numbers and N+ is the set of all positive natural numbers. Therefore, for all natural numbers m &gt; 0 and n ³ 0, A(m,n) = z + 1 = A(0,z) where z is some natural number (which can be readily obtained from a non-recursive definition of the Ackermann’s function — say, using the hyper operator). That is:</p>
<p>A(m,n) = A(0,z) = A(0,A(0,z-1)) = A(0,A(0,A(0,z-2))) = A(0,A(0,A(0,A(0,z-3)))) . . . = A(0,A(0,A(0,A(0, . . . ,A(0,0)))))</p>
<p>— which is the standard primitive recursive successor function on the natural numbers. In other words, every Ackermann’s function value is primitive recursively and not primitive recursively defined at the same time in the same respect — hence, its very definition indeed violates the principle of non-contradiction so it is untenable ab initio.</p>
<p>For example, the following is a primitive recursive definition of the Ackermann’s function:</p>
<p>A(m,n) = 1 if m = 0, n = 0</p>
<p>= A(0,n-1) + 1 if m = 0, n &gt; 0</p>
<p>= A(0,hyper(2,m,n+3)-4) otherwise</p>
<p>where the hyper operator [see Wikipedia article on “Hyper operator”] for m &gt; 0 is defined as:</p>
<p>hyper(a,1,b) = a + b</p>
<p>hyper(a,2,b) = a x b</p>
<p>hyper(a,3,b) = a ­^ b = ab</p>
<p>hyper(a,4,b) = a ­­^^ b = ba [see Wikipedia article on “Tetration”]</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>hyper(a,m,b) = a ­^m-2 b</p>
<p>(3) Therefore, to avoid the self-contradiction, one should define the first row Ackermann’s function values from an already known recursive but not primitive recursive function — say, A(0,0) = a &gt; 1 and, for n &gt; 0, A(0,n) = f(A(0,n-1)) — for example, a = 10100 and f(A(0,n-1)) = A(0,n-1)A(0,n-1) — but this undercuts Ackermann’s function’s posturing as the simplest recursive but not primitive recursive function.</p>
<p>It must be noted that all the Ackermann function (indeed, a many-to-one relation) values do not follow a recursive single sequence — that is, they cannot be enumerated such that the later values are obtained only from earlier values in the sequence.</p>
<p>Moreover, the abstract algebraic commutative ring of integers or field of rational or real numbers has only addition and multiplication (as well as their respective inverse) operations initially defined. Exponentiation (that is, iterated multiplication) is also well-defined over these number systems but tetration (see Wikipedia article) or non-standard iterated exponentiation (the exponentiation is done at the deepest level first — that is, right associative operation) is not well-defined (it violates the laws of exponents for these standard number systems — that is, its operation is not properly derived from addition and multiplication). The fast growth of the Ackermann’s function values beginning with the A(4,n) row is attributable to the fact that their definition involve non-standard iterated exponentiation which belongs to a different number system than where primitive recursive functions are defined.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Hooray, a crank! Here's why you're wrong:
<ul>
<li>The Ackermann function is a function, if you define a function (like every other mathematician) to be a set of pairs. It has a procedure for computing it which provably always halts, which is enough to prove that the function exists and is unique.</li>
<li>It's not primitive recursive, and that's not "generally believed", that's a proven theorem - therefore any "counterargument" you offer is fallacious before I read it. The fact that you can expand it in terms of its own values in ways other than the recursive definition is true but irrelevent.</li>
<li>Cantor's diagonal argument is also not a paradox.</li>

</pre>
<p>Chronologically, Sudan's function is the first example of a recursive but not primitive recursive function (Bull. Math. Soc. Roumaine Sci. 30 (1927), 11 - 30; Jbuch 53, 171). Ackermann's work was published slightly later (Math. Ann. 99 (1928), 118 - 133; Jbuch 54, 56). Both were students of Hilbert, and were working on a problem posed by Hilbert, and were acquainted with each other's work. Sudan's function extends to ordinals and majorizes Ackermann's function (except at a single point). As Smorynski says in his book Logical Number Theory</p>
<pre>
independently, to two of Hilbert's students, Wilhelm Ackermann and
Gabriel Sudan. Although they gave essentially the same recursion,
Sudan worked with functions of transfinite ordinals and Ackermann
with functions of natural numbers, whence Hilbert cited Ackermann
and Ackermann's is the name associated with the resulting functions.
</pre>
<p>The paper cited above also has speculations as to why Hilbert and Bernays did not mention Sudan's construction.</p>
<p>According to MR 82k:03061, Sudan's function is as follows</p>
<pre>
F (x, y)   = x+y
 0
</pre>
<pre>
F (x, 0)   = x
 n+1

<pre>
F (x, y+1) = F ( F (x, y), F (x, y)+y+1 )

I don't think I've ever heard of an entity that is definately not conceivable, although I'd imagine there is some paradox out there formulated specifically for this purpose. Formally, is the range of a(n) actually bounded above by 5? How can that be, if f(n) = A(n,n) is defined for all natural numbers?</dd>
<dd>I would suggest changing "for any conceivable input size" to "for any input size that is scribable in decimal notation." Anyway, I enjoyed the article very much. Thanks a lot! --<a href="../../../r/w/e/User%7ERwehr_28ae.html" title="User:Rwehr">Rwehr</a> 20:06, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, has anyone done any work on the memory requirements of Ack? It would seem that if you have a smart compiler, that does save the intermediate values, those memory requirements also get pretty large. Looks like a space-time tradeoff to me. It would be interesting to see any papers on this, if anyone is aware of them.

<p>The Wikipedia article on Ackermann's function does <i>not</i> have ackermann's function as he originally defined it. The <a href="http://www.nist.gov/dads/" class="external text" title="http://www.nist.gov/dads/" rel="nofollow">NIST's DADS</a> website, also has an <a href="http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/ackermann.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/ackermann.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> on Ackermann's function. Unfortunately, it too does not show Ackermann's original definition, but it does have two links to the "versions" of Ackermann's function under the "more info" section. The link to <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/boyer/ftp/nqthm/nqthm-1992/examples/basic/peter.events" class="external text" title="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/boyer/ftp/nqthm/nqthm-1992/examples/basic/peter.events" rel="nofollow">Cowles and Bailey's</a> (hereafter C&amp;B) webpage seems to be the more informative of the two (Munafo's is just the math definitions without the history.) C&amp;B's research looks like its been directly taken from a BBS article, so you'll have to ignore the headers. C&amp;B's webpage shows that the current definitions on the NIST website, <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AckermannFunction.html" class="external text" title="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AckermannFunction.html" rel="nofollow">MathWorld</a>, and Wikipedia are all R. Peter's 1935 version of Ackermann's function.</p>
<p>Ackermann's original function seems to be a lot more general than the other two variable functions that are presented on C&amp;B's website. It is a three variable function which maps the common addition, multiplication, exponentiation, tetration, ... to a whole (including 0) number, which is the first parameter. It, of course, has the following two whole number input parameters that R. Peter's and the other two variable functions take in as its second and third parameters. This would make it use Polish notation, if the parameters were written and used from the left to right. Also, Herbert's version seems to be the most refined, and I would suggest using it to introduce the reader to Ackermann's function.</p>

<p>One can extend the Ackermann function to the transfinite (for ordinals which have a distinguished fundamental sequence) as follows:</p>

<dd>A (0, <i>n</i>) = <i>n</i>+1.</dd>
<dd>A (α+1, 0) = A (α, 1).</dd>
<dd>A (α+1, <i>n</i>+1) = A (α, A (α+1, <i>n</i>)).</dd>

<p>If λ is a limit ordinal with the fundamental sequence which takes <i>k</i> to λ<sub><i>k</i></sub>, we let:</p>

<dd>Let me clarify that it is only the first argument of the Ackermann function which is being extended to infinite ordinals. The second argument and the value are still limited to natural numbers. However, I think (but have not yet proved) that by using this extention to ordinals the Ackermann function can surpass the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conway_chained_arrow_notation.html" title="Conway chained arrow notation">Conway chained arrow notation</a> as a means of naming large natural numbers. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 04:46, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Specifically, A (ω<sup>ω</sup>+1, <i>n</i>) should rise faster as a function of <i>n</i> than any sequence of Conway chained arrow notations which has a relatively simple definition, such as <i>n</i>→<i>n</i>→...→<i>n</i> with <i>n</i> copies of <i>n</i>. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 04:55, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The explanation of why this function always terminates is confusing in my opinion. At least, it does not succinctly convince the reader that the function terminates. It states:</p>
<p>"The recursion is bounded because in each recursive application either m decreases, or m remains the same and n decreases. Each time that n reaches zero, m decreases, so m eventually reaches zero as well. (Expressed more technically, in each case the pair (m, n) decreases in the lexicographic order, which preserves the well-ordering of the non-negative integers.) However, when m decreases there is no upper bound on how much n can increase — and it will often increase greatly."</p>
<p>I don't think that the "more technical" explanation needs to be there as it interrupts the explanation. Furthermore, the "m decreases, so m eventually reaches zero" part is followed by the part stating that if m decreases there is no upper bound on how much n will increase, so it wouldn't follow that m eventually reaches zero without further inspection. I can't offer a better explanation, but I think it could be done. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sam Brightman (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Brightman_f8f9.html" title="User talk:Sam Brightman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sam_Brightman_215e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sam Brightman">contribs</a>) 15:58, 2 April 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
