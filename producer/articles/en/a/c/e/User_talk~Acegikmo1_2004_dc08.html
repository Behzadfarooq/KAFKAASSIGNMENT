<p>Unlike the other people on <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2004_3ccd.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2004">U.S. presidential election, 2004</a>, Dean has encouraged his supporters to continue to vote for him (and, judging from their past activities, they will presumably purchase radio spots and such that will encourage others to vote for Dean). I suggest that this is a sufficiently-significant distinction that Dean should not be considered "withdrawn", because his strong grassroots (and promise to continue operating Dean for America) support means that there's a very real possibility that he could place high in future primaries. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronSw_9541.html" title="User:AaronSw">AaronSw</a> 00:02, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, Jonathan... the changes I made, other people reverted, and quickly... so I'm starting to think that maybe this site just isn't worth my time. I don't see how you can be so enamored of a site so full of people like that.</p>

<dd>Hi Andrew. Like <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">User:Raul654</a> said on your talk page, you ought not to get discouraged because one of your articles was deleted. Anyway, it was my fault; I shouldn't have included a link to <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gullible.html" title="Gullible">gullible</a> in my <a href="../../../m/%26/m/M%26M%27s_a680.html" title="M&amp;M's">M&amp;M's</a> article.</dd>

<dd>I suggest you continue to make contributions (your spelling corrections on pages I've edited are very helpufl&#160;;-).

<dd>Well, I'm just wondering what the best list for the page is. I don't think that putting <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">Bush</a> alone is very good, considering that minor Democratic candidates like <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_LaRouche_df0c.html" title="Lyndon LaRouche">Lyndon LaRouche</a> are listed. At the same time, the enitre pool of candidates should not be listed. What resolution to this problem would you support?</dd>

<p>Actually, Lyndon LaRouche is quite well known (judging from how complete a biography he has). But wasn't he removed from the Democratic list?</p>
<p>In terms of delegate count, is it unanimous for Bush? I think the criteria should be 1) has an article, 2) is linked elsewhere on WP, but again, I don't object to the shorter version you proposed on my talk page. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 21:24, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I remember the conference room and the cockpit from "Timescape", and they both looked like a Danube's, but I can't remember what the runabout looked like from outside. That would have been in 2369, so they would have probably just started coming into service, and Danubes are the only things I've heard called 'runabouts', so it probably was one. If you can remember what it looked like, <a href="http://ex-astris-scientia.org/scans/other/danube-views.jpg" class="external text" title="http://ex-astris-scientia.org/scans/other/danube-views.jpg" rel="nofollow">this picture</a>'s of a Danube, so that should tell you if it was.</p>
<p>I have this Old English textbook, Robert Diamond's "Old English Grammar and Reader". I was looking through it one day, thought the language sounded pretty neat, and decided to get some use out of it on my talk page. For translating I use that for the grammar. The vocab. list in the back of that wasn't too good, though, just Old English to Modern English, no ME &gt; OE section. So now I use <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~modean52/oeme_dictionaries.htm" class="external text" title="http://home.comcast.net/~modean52/oeme_dictionaries.htm" rel="nofollow">this website</a> for looking up words; it's OE &gt; ME and vice-versa, and it has a lot more words than the book does, so it's pretty nice. -- <a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjinn112_fc26.html" title="User:Djinn112">Djinn112</a> 00:26, Mar 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>as the wikipedia is referring to it in a UK context, then 'most left-wing of Britain's mainstream parties' is correct. Only if we were looking on a wider stage would wording such as you suggested be appropriate (if true) as then the it would be the fact that this party happens to be 'British'; in the UK all UK-wide parties are 'British'!. <a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">VampWillow</a> 22:23, 2004 May 7 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My main purpose in editing the page was to change the comparative "more" to the superlative "most", as there are three mainstream British political parties, not two. After writing this, I concluded that using "British" was more concise and less awkward than "of Britain's", so I made a change to that as well. But, what you said also makes sense, so I think that the current wording is good.</dd>

<dd>I'm glad you find the article an interesting read. I believe Marshall is a profoundly interesting place, or as the local phrase goes: <i>frighteningly cosmopolitan, yet delightfully banana republic</i>. I've been reviewing the edits as you made them, and I'm very grateful. As, a member of the Harrison County Historical Museum, a fourth generation Marshallite, and other self-righteous, egocentric platitudes; I would like to consider myself an expert on Marshall. As a history major I know that is irrelevant; my sources include various literature, and a review by Jean Birmingham, (a local Eleanor Roosevelt like figure). I am quite confident in the accuracy of the vast majority of the information as I had several sources for it.</dd>

<p>You may notice that I marked this article for deletion—my reasoning is given on the VfD page. I also deleted every reference you established to it, because even if the case (<i>Harvey v. Horan</i>) hadn't been overruled, your interpretation of what the case was about was overbroad and incorrect. The judgment was not guaranteeing DNA evidence per se, but rather the due process right to exculpatory evidence, which just happened for this particular convict to be in the form of DNA because this was a rape trial with biological evidence. I'd suggest that before you write any article on a court case, actually read the opinion, or at least a law review article on it written by legal professionals. It looks as if the Washington Post article was your sole source for writing it, and unfortunately you often can't rely upon the popular press for legal accuracy, nor can you with this particular article—<i>Harvey</i> by no means says all "felons have a constitutional right to DNA testing," nor was it the first case to find a due process violation in a particular denial of DNA testing...<i>Harvey</i> itself cites others. Also, always double-check to see if the case is still good law. I noticed that you wrote the article this year, but <i>Harvey</i> was overruled by the Fourth Circuit in 2002, removing any precedential value. One thing that was correct in the Post article is that a "district judge's decision is not binding on other courts", so there was no way, even prior to being overruled, that <i>Harvey</i> could have "established" a constitutional right in the sense you were proclaiming. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 8:12 25 June 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for leaving a not about this on my talk page. I responded on the VfD page. I also actually want to thank you for listing the page on VfD, as it forced me to do more research on the topic. I found several reasons why the page should be kept. For example, an en banc reconsideration of the rejection of the case concluded that inmates do have a constitutional right to conduct DNA testing on leftover evidence in an effort to prove their innocence. <a href="http://www.law-forensic.com/crime_and_punishment.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.law-forensic.com/crime_and_punishment.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Although this opinion is non-binding because of a new Virginia state law that allowed the testing, it is significant as one of several developments that occured after the case supporting the right to DNA testing. I am concerned about the inaccuracies you pointed out in the article, and I'd like to correct them and incorporate this new information I found into the article.</dd>

<p>RE PETER CARROLL:</p>
<p><b>Dear Acegikmo1</b>, please do what you feel you must to satisfy your interest in the aforementioned page, I, having found it by chance merely thought it could do with cheering up a bit.</p>
<p>In fact you are probably right, but I am not Pete's biographer, I merely new him as a friend for several years. I note an interest in his group on the site and thought it might inspire someone to improve upon my efforts. I am working on other items at this time but will return to it later. Why don't you contact Pete directly and ask him about the alleged anecdotes perhaps he will confirm them for you, given a link to his site exists on the page, you may quote my name as a starting point, but I am not interested in arguing about it, as it makes a mockery of his own words. All the best: <a href="../../../f/a/e/User%7EFaedra_13a7.html" title="User:Faedra">Faedra</a> 20:51, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, your edit much improves this wanting item, prevously looking rather shoddy and like an advert. Thank you for your work, I have completed my item on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatham_Dockyard_d47d.html" title="Chatham Dockyard">Chatham Dockyard</a>, and have changed a few small references in your item, to link to actual pages on wikipedia, I have found, removing those links that do not exist (yet)</p>
<p>My sisters dog has just farted, and Star trek is on in the other room, so I hope you will excuse me, but why not email Pete and ask him for the source to "views on a chaotic universe", as I only have a spliced copy found tucked away in my copy of LIBER NULL (No 25 of 400, red cover, Morton Press).</p>

<p>Only a Wikipedian would respond to a statement that someone finds something personally offensive by asking for a reference.&#160;;-) But in any case, here are some I pulled up with a little Googling:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/64/C006/002.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/64/C006/002.html" rel="nofollow">The American Heritage® Book of English Usage</a>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>[African American] has the further advantage that, unlike black, its use as a noun in referring to a particular person or persons is unproblematic; you can say <i>My teacher is an African American</i> where you probably would not say <i>My teacher is a black</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/64/pages/page197.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/64/pages/page197.html" rel="nofollow">ibid.</a>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Like other names of social groups that are derived from adjectives (for example, <i>black</i>), <i>gay</i> may be regarded as offensive when used as a noun....</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://newswatch.sfsu.edu/guide/b.html" class="external text" title="http://newswatch.sfsu.edu/guide/b.html" rel="nofollow">NewsWatch Diversity Guide</a>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Use "black" as an adjective (i.e., black people) not as a noun.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To be more specific, what is offensive is to use "black" as a noun to refer to <i>specific</i> people. You can say, "according to polls, most <i>blacks</i> in America believe...." But "all the Congressmen sat quietly during the speech, except for <i>the blacks</i>, who stood and exited in protest" is bad. It has a disquieting "bar the door, Martha—the blacks are coming!" flavor. That badness is magnified when one refers to a single person as <i>a black</i>.</p>
<p>You wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I find the phrasing "She is the second black person..." to be excessivly careful, cloyingly politically correct, and awkward.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>And I find "She is the second black... to hold the office" to be offensive. (One can be <i>cloyingly</i> politically correct?) Feel free to rewrite the intro so that <i>black</i> modifies something other than <i>person</i>— but unfortunately, if it doesn't modify either <i>person</i> or <i>National Security Advisor</i>, it will take on a different meaning.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>An analogy would be replacing instances of "Jew" with "Jewish person" even though the former term is entirely proper.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your analogy with <i>Jew</i> is irrelevant. Different words have different connotations. Even <i>African American</i> can be used as a noun without offense. (By the way, Condoleeza Rice <i>is</i> African American as well as black by the most technical definition, unlike Colin Powell.)</p>
<p>In any case, your edit was <i>not</i> minor. See <a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMinor_edit_ba6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Minor edit">Wikipedia:Minor edit</a>. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyHarris_636a.html" title="User:TreyHarris">TreyHarris</a> 16:15, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>No, that's fine.</p>
<dl>
<dd>2. Why did my original edit not qualify as minor?</dd>
</dl>
<p>You deleted a word for non-grammatical reasons. You changed the meaning. A rule of thumb is that minor edits should be obviously unobjectionable. Since I objected, <i>ipso facto</i>, it wasn't minor.

<p>First, it was heavily NPOV ("Certainly, David Brock's is one of the more controversial stories"). Second, it responded to claims not made in the piece. Third, it relied on some pretty bizarre sources ("the ever-interesting Christopher Hitchens"?). Fourth, it didn't really add much except to say "some people don't like this guy", since it didn't provide much in the way of evidence. It seemed to me to be mainly a way to sneak in some nasty personal attacks:</p>

<p>I'm very impressed by the effort that you put into this article—it's exceeded my expectations by far. I only have a few small recommendations: 1) the introductory paragraph needs to tell under what court system it was a case. Though the general rule is probably to credit it to the highest court that ended up dealing with it, because the significant opinion was the district court case, it doesn't make too much sense to just say that it was a Fourth Circuit case. Maybe say that it was a federal court case that was resolved by the 4th in a reversal? 2) The introductory paragraph should also point out something about the case's subsequent impact, why it was significant—mention the Innocence Protection Act up there. 3) Make sure you note which district court it was heard in. 4) It would be nice if you said a little more about the Innocence Protection Act, just a sentence about what it was intended to do. I'm also not sure if you're arguing that Harvey v. Horan played a direct role in its passing, or in bringing the issue to light, or if the Act was simply a resolution of the issue in Harvey. Anyway, great job! I'm even more satisfied when a VFD recommendation becomes an impetus to genuinely make an article worthwhile than when an article gets killed. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 13:20, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Acegikmo,</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry if I messed that up. I'm new and when I did that edit I hadn't thouroughly researched the issue. The reason I added links to the second shows was that in another article I was writing I had to reference something that happened specifically in the 2nd episode of a two-parter. I could redo it.

<dd>However, I must very respectfully decline the proposed nomination. My primary reason for this is that I'm going to be moving to another country and starting college in about a month, and I don't know how my ability to participate in Wikipedia is going to be affected by that. I suspect that I'll continue to contribute as I have been, but I'd hate to accept administrator status only to realize that I don't have enough time to be a viable member of the community. Another reason that I'd rather not accept a nomination now is that there seem to be some outstanding disputes about what administrators are and what they should be able to do. <a href="../../../h/c/h/User%7EHcheney_Support_eb29.html" title="User:Hcheney/Support">User:Hcheney/Support</a>, <a href="../../../h/c/h/User%7EHcheney_Govern_314b.html" title="User:Hcheney/Govern">User:Hcheney/Govern</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_ee2f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_Policy_Proposals_ae9c.html" title="User:Sam Spade/Policy Proposals">User:Sam Spade/Policy Proposals</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4229710&amp;oldid=4229658" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4229710&amp;oldid=4229658" rel="nofollow">Warofdreams' application to be a bureaucrat</a> bring up some of my concerns in this respect.

<p>Nice to meet you yesterday at the S &amp; S. But I realize now I forgot to ask you... is there an explanation for the numeral 1 at the end of your username?

<hr />
<p>In reply to your question... I cannot possibly answer that for you.</p>
<p>In high school I wrote articles for the literary magazine under my own name and the pseudonyms "Amaranath Sasesusos" and "P. Fafnir Bergberg." In the CompuServe "CB simulator" (a prehistoric chat room) (you may not even know what "CB" meant) I used to call myself "Certified". But since then I've pretty much just used boring variations of my own name. My last major identity Thing occurred when I got married and decided to use my wife's maiden name as my second middle name, thus transforming myself from Daniel P. Smith to Daniel P. B. Smith.</p>
<p>When I joined Wikipedia I just used the customary username I've been using in most of my email accounts for years. By the time I saw that most people were using "handles," I toyed with the idea of enjoying a midlife identity crisis but now I sort of feel that I'm known under this name.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm not being truthful... in the alt.quotations newsgroup a number of people play around with multiple identities--there's a woman in Australia who uses about eighteen of them, by last count--not hard to tell as she's from a very small ISP--and I started to join in that game myself. Whenever I wanted to post something particularly undignified or tasteless I would post under the name "Chunks," for example.</p>
<p>I've thought about doing that here, but unless I wanted to create silly or tasteless articles under one username (and then list them under Votes for Deletion and vote to delete them myself) there wouldn't be much point.</p>
<p>For a while I thought your username as "Acegikmol", which is pronounceable but breaks the pattern.</p>
<p>In your situation I'd probably stick with the same username, but that could just be a sign of middle age on my part.

<p>Well my fellow Intactivists (this will appear on other talk:pages):</p>
<p>The circumcisiophiliacs won this round. The main problem is that they are more commited than we <i>(they make it impossible for us to correct any of their lies and bias on <a href="../../../p/r/%C3%A6/Pr%C3%A6puce.html" title="Præpuce">præpuce</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a>).</i> Now, they go after our articles <i>(maybe I should not have tried to expose them by writing about Circumfetishism).</i></p>
<p>Hugh Young wrote complaining about me creating articles about <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intactivism.html" title="Intactivism">Intactivism</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genital_Integrity_1e09.html" title="Genital Integrity">Genital Integrity</a> without consulting anyone. He was right to complain; I did create such articles without consulting. Let me just point out to things though:</p>
<ol>
<li>I invited other Intactivists to join me last year to join <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia.html" title="Encyclopædia">Encyclopædia</a> WikiPedia.Org last year <i>(within a month of that, I gave up on editing <a href="../../../p/r/%C3%A6/Pr%C3%A6puce.html" title="Præpuce">Præpuce</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">Circumcision</a> because I was so badly outnumbered, that I could not do any good).</i></li>
<li>I am the only full-time Intactivist with Michael Glass and Dan Blackham dropping in every now and then.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you are all temporarily here, I ask you to stay. If you would just check on our articles weekly and also <a href="../../../p/r/%C3%A6/Pr%C3%A6puce.html" title="Præpuce">præpuce</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a>, and articles linking to them, it would truly help much. While you are at it, you can edit and start other articles. ¡Editing and starting articles is fun! Look at this cool article, which I started about <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurentia.html" title="Laurentia">Laurentia</a>.</p>
<p>¡E Pluribus Unum!</p>
<p>¡Thanks!</p>

<p>I noticed your comments on the latest troll policy proposal.

<p>Would you be prepared to consider changing your vote? It'd only take a couple of people doing so to send this back to the drawing board, and though I didn't write it, I think the simplified proposal would fix many of the problems with the current one.

<p>I have set my time zone offset in preferences to "-04:00". However, every few weeks, it changes to "-4:00" and goes back to displaying timestamps as UTC. This is rather frustrating. Does anyone know how to fix it?</p>

<dd>So it changes from -4 to -4? I don't understand...maybe I'm just that stupid. It also depends which timestamps you're talking about. The signature timestamp, for example, is always UTC. <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep">Ilyanep</a> <a href="../../../i/l/y/User_talk%7EIlyanep_ef6d.html" title="User talk:Ilyanep">(Talk)</a> 00:56, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think he meant that the leading zero disappears. But the leading zero is automatically removed whenever you save your preferences, so that couldn't be the problem. If you don't believe me, save it with a leading zero and then immediately click the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPreferences_a6b2.html" title="Special:Preferences">preferences</a> link to reload the settings from the database. Perhaps this is one of those annoying transient bugs that goes away when you look at it. The obvious thing that comes to mind is that timestamps are in UTC when you are logged out, or when for some unknown reason some part of the software is treating you as logged out. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 01:15, Aug 2, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your note on my talk page. There is deliberate vandalism, and there are occasional mistakes.

I'm going to carefully read the Tuvix article and the Riddles article to sort out exactly what belongs in each article. I think the Tuvix article needs to address how the experience affected Tuvok and Neelix afterwards, but at the same time the article should not retread too much of what is said in the Riddles article.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've seen your recent contriubtions to starship classes and other Star Trek-related articles. They are quite good. Perhaps you could cite your source for data on the starship classes in the references sections. In any case, nice work. Please continue to contribute. Have you thought of creating a username?</p>
<p>Acegikmo1 07:51, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Greetings! You posted the preceeding note earlier. Thanks for the compliment! I'm not wholly familiar with the Wiki user interface, not even sure if I'm leaving this in the right place!, and I sometimes make editions when a thought arises (rare indeed!), but I do indeed have a user name and generally use it [E Pluribus Anthony].</p>
<p>My editions to the Star Trek--and other pages--are often to clean up alot of the grammatically incorrect text I find. I also find inconsistencies in some of the information ... particularly with much of the information on Wiki sites that are maintained by who I can only characterise as zealots.</p>
<p>As references, I generally use any and all mentions I can find (show, print, online) that are generally canon. For instance, the breadth and length of the Sovereign class are actually derived from measurements (in feet) on scale drawings produced by Paramount. Weapons counts? Usually by careful visual inspection. Furthermore, sometimes I take a very logical leap in making an edition. For instance, a Danube class starship is 'colloquially' but not necessarily known in canon as a 'Runabout' type; it is practically a type of scout, primarily because this is the smallest sort of starship available (in TNG Tech Manual) and it is similar in size and function to the ship Data piloted in 'Star Trek: Erection' (appropriate spelling) which is referred to as a scout, et al. As such, it is often unwieldly to list such reference sources and rationale, but I can gladly provide them.</p>
<p>As well, I tend to remove information that is utter supposition and non-canon; for example, I removed mention somewhere that the Titan (Riker's new command) is assumed to be a Prometheus class ship because there is NO authoritative mention of this assumption anywhere (as it can possibly be a new ship, old ship, or a good ship...) and especially not in 'Star Trek: Emesis' (appropriate spelling!). This certitude may also lead to errors, but I think these are rare and I'll gladly accept such feedback. I do strive for accuracy or at least for things that make sense.</p>
<p>On a similar note, I made editions to the Sovereign class page that were later changed by another user: namely, that it is a heavy cruiser and not an explorer. The 'editor' claims that Rick Sternbach himself (a co-creator of the Enterprise-E) wrote that it was a heavy cruiser in a BBS way-back-when, and even edited the article again and placed this comment in the body of the article (which is bad form), which seems to tell me that ego is also involved. I cannot find this posting but cannot currently contradict it. Thus, I've retained that edition for now, and I think out of compromise someone else actually wrote in 'Explorer/heavy cruiser'; however, I am e-mailing Mr. S. to get the last word. Fundamentally, NO mention of the Sovereign's type has ever been mentioned (that I know of) and this is all supposition, but again these are conflicting rationales. Moreover, Wikipedia is not a forum for such b-tching and I can imagine said editor including a nastygram in the future if such a 'correction' was made on this article.</p>
<p>I am quite the military and aviation buff (with a plethora of other interests); for example, I have the 99th edition of Jane's All The World's Ships. Making editions and additions to articles of real devices are far easier, since--for instance--the US government is far more authoritative about weapons like a certain sort of ICBM than Paramount or even some fans are about a Sovereign class ...?&#160;!&#160;:) So, I only hope that the sci-fi ship specs which appear can be as consistent and accurate as those for some bits of real hardware.</p>
