<p>In the <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_of_Base_aad6.html#History" title="Ace of Base">History section</a> it says the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Album_%28music%29.html" title="Album (music)">album</a> <a href="../../../d/a/_/Da_Capo_41d7.html" title="Da Capo">Da Capo</a> was the fourth (wich in cronilogical terms, is correct), yet in the <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_of_Base_aad6.html#The_Music" title="Ace of Base">Music secion</a> it says Da Capo is the fifth album. Should this be changed? I don't think the Ultamate Collection and the 90's Collections should be considered albums, but are indeed collections of their songs. --Admiral Roo 12:43, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The contradiction stems from whether 'Singles of the 90s' is considered an album or not. Some fans point out that only three original tracks appeared on the SOTN album. However, other fans mention the fact that the band produced around a dozen songs (enough for a full-length album) during this period, and it was only the band's European record companies' decision to release only three of the songs (the remaining tracks on the album were all songs from earlier albums, packaged together in a 'greatest hits'-type deal).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Arista Records in the US had a four-album contract with the band, and did release four albums, if you include 'Greatest Hits'. They never released anything else ('Platinum and Gold' wasn't an Arista product and contained no new material anyway), so apparently greatest hits albums count as albums, as long as there is some new content in them.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron">Firsfron</a> 21:08, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wasn't one of the women in the group heavily stalked until she literally awoke in bed one morning to find her stalker hovering over her with a knife? I distinctly remember this being highly publicized at the time. 67.101.159.164 22:18, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't recall all the details, but Jenny did have a stalker, who managed to break into her home. I don't remember if she was armed, but Jenny managed to keep her calm until the police arrived. The incident doesn't seem to have scarred Jenny, but her sister Lynn was significantly affected by it, to the point that she began to withdraw from her lead role within the band (notice that from Cruel Summer on, Jenny does most of the lead singing, and Lynn barely participated in the videos). --200.44.199.30 00:14, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In truth, Jenny was quite affected by the incident, and wrote the song <i>Ravine</i> in response to the incident: "Then one night/ someone came/took a knife and ripped me out by my roots". It is not known for sure if this is the same incident which caused Linn to go into hiding, or even if there was a specific incident which caused Linn to become so reclusive.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron">Firsfron</a> 02:49, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am a Spaniard Ace of Base fan since ever. I have always heard that was Linn the one stalked at her home, while she was sleeping, and because of that she started to stay aside, which is specially reflected on their next project, "Flowers". Later, and reflected in "Da Capo", she started to reappear shyly. I am afraid that in Spain no information was given about this at any media, and I still have not found any serious information about this. I am very interested in know the truth about this sad story. At least, put some links to any pages that talk about that. I think it also should be included in the article as an explanation when you say Linn started to participate much less in the band, because you do not give any reason, and you should do, in my opinion.</p>
<p>You also say that the sound is each time farther from their original sound, but you may hear so many winks to their first album in "Da Capo", and they told when it was released that "Da Capo" was chosen as the new album title because "da capo" is a musical term that means "start from the begining".</p>
<p>We can not say "Singles from the 90s" is an album, is clearly a compilation with 3 new songs, 4 for Europeans as the European version of "Flowers" does not include "Everytime It Rains", and the US version ("Cruel Summer") do. Therefore, they have released only four albums and some compilations, and that is what the band itself says on its official website.</p>
<p>After seeing articles so well done and nice as "Nintendo", "Rare", (I am also a Nintendo fan) etc. I found this article quite poor and imprecise. I would be very happy if you read this and pay attention to all I have said, although I am most interested in clarify Jenny's or Linn's assault.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for reading and for the site.</p>
<p>Mikau Bold</p>
<p>Today I have been checking "The Bridge" (their best album, for me) booklet. Jenny says on it about "Ravine": "I guess the sucess went to my head and suddenly I was not in 'good ground' anymore. The song is a metaphor (...) I've never felt better.". I think "Ravine" does not talk about the assault at all.</p>
<p>Mikau Bold</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Micau, if you've got a link that says Linn was the one who was attacked, please provide it. Then the article can be updated. But if the link contains pure speculation, or is just written by a fan on a bulletin board, it can't be included as fact. Unfortunately, no reputable source has ever clarified what exactly is wrong with Linn, explaining everything. Therefore, this article only reports what is known as fact.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Jenny stated in many 1993 interviews that she was attacked, not Linn, and that a knife was held to her. There's nothing to contradict that. And in the album after that, "The Bridge", Linn clearly wasn't in the background. So if there's a link between the 1993 attack, and Linn's reclusive behaviour in 1997, it's tenuous.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The article on Nintendo may be nice, but like any article on Wikipedia, it cannot rely on speculation. Proposals to add to the article based on "I heard this" or "I think that" cannot be considered. If you've got something that can be added, something which is fact, and can be supported by a book, reputable newspaper, or factual website, feel free to be bold and edit this article.</dd>

<dd>The "Singles of the 90s" album was recorded seperately from other albums. At least six tracks were recorded (official note from Claes Cornelius from Mega Records in 1998). If you've got an official link which calls the album "only a compilation, not a real album," feel free to edit this article, including the source. The band itself does not say that on the site.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron">Firsfron</a> 10:53, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Answer: What are you talking about? I sense your sarcastic tone and I don't like it at all... And I am not a liar, at their website it was told clearly that "Singles" was not an album, but of course today we cannot find it, time passes and websites change... Not this article that looks exactly the same and has not been updated.</p>
<p>I don't think I have spoken a way that allows you to talk to me like that.</p>

<p>The article says The Sign is 10X Platinum and The Bridge is 2X Platinum. Any reputable link/source for that? RIAA database lists The Sign as 9X Plat. and The Bridge as 1X Plat. Why the discrepancy?</p>
<p>Scholar91 02:59, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The discrepancy comes from the RIAA site itself. They listed The Sign at 10x platinum and The Bridge at 2X platinum for around two years, which is why I added links to their site. A few months ago, they changed the data <i>back</i> to 9X and 1x respectively, without notice why. I've sent e-mails asking why, but there was never any response. However, the band's official site also <a href="http://aceofbase.com/en/main.php?sida=sales" class="external text" title="http://aceofbase.com/en/main.php?sida=sales" rel="nofollow">confirms</a> the 10X (diamond) number, which was, as I recall, announced by Mega Records executive Claes Cornelius in 2002.

<p>The article states that Ace of Base has gone 3 x platinum in Germany with their "Happy Nation" album and then it states that the number of sold albums is 900,000. Well, how can it be 900,000 when before 1999 (before music piracy began) Germany's platinum cerification was 500,000 (that's for 1 platinum) and gold certification was 250,000 . If they have gone 3 x platinum there with their "Happy Nation" which was released in 1993, then the number of sold albums in Germany/Deutcschland would be 1.5 million.</p>

<p>I noticed that none of their albums were linked which is odd considering that articles on those albums exist. I am going to attach correct redirects for the albums. Can people correct this in the rest of the articles and add link (with proper redirects) to articles. Even if some don't exist and seem notable create a stub to link to. --<a href="../../../f/k/6/User%7EFK65_7144.html" title="User:FK65">FK65</a> 22:20, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that a possibly somewhat confused user, <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcerBen_d3dd.html" title="User:AcerBen">AcerBen</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ace_of_Base&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108121718" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ace_of_Base&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108121718" rel="nofollow">inserted</a> the following into the article at 20:18, 14 February 2007.</p>

Fortunately his apology was accepted and the following month the band performed in front of 55,000 people alongside <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Circle_f2c0.html" title="Inner Circle">Inner Circle</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/_/Dr_Alban_8052.html" title="Dr Alban">Dr Alban</a> in <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tel_Aviv_6d0d.html" title="Tel Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>.</p>

<p>(The text has since been slightly modified, the above is what I just cut out from the article.) If anyone's wondering, the following is what's wrong:</p>

<li>The <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_Anarcho-syndicalist_Youth_Federation_a12d.html" title="Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation">Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation</a> are anarcho-syndicalists, not nazis</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden_Democrats_3b85.html" title="Sweden Democrats">Sweden Democrats</a> (<i>Sverigedemokraterna</i>) are not nazis, either</li>
<li>The entire section, potentially libelous as it is, is unsourced</li>
</ol>
<p>And that, my friends, was the most obscure form of <s>vandalism</s> <i>possibly unintentional disruptive editing</i> I've ever seen on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn"><font color="#FF8000">Jobjörn</font></a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 16:54, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Calling AcerBen's edit vandalism is hardly to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. It is well known that Ulf had been collaborating with racists / nazists (including white power music, I think).

<dd>While assuming good faith, piping the link <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_Anarcho-syndicalist_Youth_Federation_a12d.html" title="Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation">Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation</a> as the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden_Democrats_3b85.html" title="Sweden Democrats">Sweden Democrats</a> and referring to both of them as <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">nazi</a> is, if not vandalism, stupid. As AcerBen's other contributions are of high standard, I first assumed it was by a vandal using his account, but I found out it was done in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ace_of_Base&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108121718" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ace_of_Base&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108121718" rel="nofollow">massive edit</a> which restructured the entire article. It IS possible that someone - maybe a friend - snuck that part in without AcerBen noticing, but really. In any case, I've already asked him on his <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAcerBen_a93f.html" title="User talk:AcerBen">talk page</a> to come here and explain. Oh, and, while Ulf perhaps did collaborate with racists (I don't care either way, really), it should definitely be sourced as that may be considered libellous. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn"><font color="#FF8000">Jobjörn</font></a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 18:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems that that part of the article (which I did write myself) is indeed factually incorrect. I hold my hands up to being "confused" but it was absolutely a genuine error, not deliberate vandalism - I am an "Acer" after all&#160;! Basically I got the word "Sverigedemokrater" from the original biography I wrote on my website, and if I remember correctly I got that exact word from the Swedish subtitles in the 1997 SVT documentary "Our Story". I will have to go back to re-watch the documentary to find out exactly what was said because I cannot remember. What I know for sure is that there was indeed a fairly big scandal about Ulf's "nazi" past beginning with that Expressen article - and it was also brought up again in 1995 on the American TV show "A Current Affair". Ulf was definitely a member of the racist <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commit_Suiside_063f.html" title="Commit Suiside">Commit Suiside</a> band. So basically, I admit that I have not researched this properly and I have evidently wrongly labelled two Swedish parties as "nazi" and I apologise for this.</dd>

<dd>However, I do feel that if we can come up with proper references, the issue of Ulf's past *is* relevant to the article. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAcerBen_a93f.html" title="User talk:AcerBen">AcerBen</a> 19:54, 18 February 2007 (GMT)</dd>

<dd>"They're known as the Swedish democrats - odd, since they include some of the most violent, racist skinheads in the world. Today we'll talk to a former member, a young man who says he wants to forget the hate in his past. Trouble is he now a singer in one of the hottest pop groups around, and that makes his racist past a big, big problem."</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Then Ulf said (in a later interview, not from "A Current Affair"</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"My controversial background was quite obviously.. obvious - will be.. official one day or another. Most of - not all accusations, but most of the accusations was actually right and I confessed it. And I told everyone I really regret what I done. I closed that book. I don't want to even talk about it, that time does not exist in me any more. I closed it and I threw the book away. I took the experience from it, I learned from it. But that life is not me.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So it would appear that if it's unfair to label either party as "racist", then "A Current Affair" was also in the wrong. I don't have any other sources to back up whether Ulf was indeed a member of either of those groups. But I shall do some more research to find out. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAcerBen_a93f.html" title="User talk:AcerBen">AcerBen</a> 20:20, 18 February 2007 (GMT)</dd>
