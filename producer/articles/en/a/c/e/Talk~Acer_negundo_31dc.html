<p>I've no objection to a move to the species name, <i>provided</i> this is also done for the other species in the same genus, so they are all grouped together in their category; having some at common names, and others at scientific names, makes indexing and finding pages difficult. Having them all at the scientific name would be best as it would also help avoid other common name variations in the genus, but might be unpopular with some other contributors. - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 15:57, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Of course, some species are well known by their genus and species names. (Hosta, Ginkgo) With at least two common names for Acer negundo in its native range, maybe it should be titled "Acer negundo".

<p>I really like the maps from the USDA, they are really nice maps showing where plants are in North America, but my only concern with them is that they are US-centric. The maps show the subnational divisions (states) of the USA, but not those of Canada (provinces) or M√©xico (estados).

<p>The page I have linked incorrectly implies that box elder is an ash. Otherwise it is good. I think that since this is a topic some kids have to use for school it would be very good if every fact were carefully sourced, so that they can easily source their papers. Also diagnostic descriptions and classifications are not the same everywhere. These are the reasons we should source things even when they can be generally accepted as fact.

<p>This article has an introduction that is difficult to grasp, but seems to mostly be about biases for and against certain common names rather than about <i>Acer negundo</i>, the tree.</p>
<p>"Manitoba Maple (<i>Acer negundo</i>), as the species is called in Canada, also known as Ash-leaved Maple or (confusingly) Box Elder in the United States, is a species of maple, which occurs throughout most of North America."</p>
<p>I believe the article can include information about the common names, but the introduction should read something like this, because the article is about the tree:</p>
<p><b><i>Acer negundo</i> is a species of maple (<i>Acer</i>) that grows throughout much of North America.</b></p>
<p><b>Common names</b></p>
<p><b>It is called Manitoba Maple in Canada, and Ash-leaved Maple (also Ashleaf Maple, Ash Maple) or Box Elder (also Boxelder, California Boxelder, Western Boxelder, Inland Boxelder, Boxelder Maple) in the United States. The American common names come from the pinnately compound leaves of <i>Acer negundo</i> that are similar to those on the elder (<i>Sambucus</i>) and some species of ash (<i>Fraxinus</i>). The "box" in the name is thought to be because the tree's wood superficially resembles that of the box hedge (<i>Buxus sempervirens</i>). Additional common names include Cut-leaved Maple (because it is the only maple species with compound leaves), or Three-leaved Maple (because all new leaves from overwintering buds have 3 leaflets), or Sugar Ash (because the leaves resemble the ash, but it is a source of maple syrup). Its numerous and diverse common names attest to its familiarity to many peoples over a great geographic range.</b></p>

Additional common names include <b>Cut-leaved Maple</b> (because of the compound, or fully dissected, leaves), or <b>Three-leaved Maple</b> (because all new leaves from overwintering buds have 3 leaflets), or <b>Sugar Ash</b> (because the leaves resemble the ash, but it is a source of maple syrup). Its numerous and diverse common names attest to its familiarity to many peoples over a great geographic range." <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 22:07, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, okay, the whole article is a mess, but you did remove something that actually said something, and left in lines, instead, about certain common names being "confusing" or whatever. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 22:11, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please take a few minutes and look more closely. Ash, elder, maple syrup, those common names, etc. -- its all still in the article. The only bit that is missing is is the explanation of the "box" element. I am often wary of etymologies -- even those appearing in reasonably respectable sources are sometimes wrong (or at least fall ito the category of "folk etymology"). If you think the <i>buxus</i> mention is important, stick in back in. Just please maintain the "thought to be" or some similar wording. <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HouseOfScandal_63ec.html" title="Special:Contributions/HouseOfScandal"><font color="blue">‚óÑ</font></a><a href="../../../h/o/u/User_talk%7EHouseOfScandal_2d15.html" title="User talk:HouseOfScandal"><font color="blue">HouseOfScandal</font></a><a href="../../../h/o/u/User_talk%7EHouseOfScandal_2d15.html" title="User talk:HouseOfScandal"><font color="blue">‚ñ∫</font></a></b> 22:14, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm trying the etymologies as a compromise to try to move away from one user having to write in every article with a common name that the common name is incorrect or confusing. I should source the information, and will, but the sources of common names are important, as common names are part of the ethnobotany of the plant, they can show where they were important, how they were important, and to whom and when. And, yes, I noticed the common names were listed elsewhere, that's why I commented that the article was a mess, upon rereading. I think asking that it be sourced is reasonable. But your suspicions of common names and dislike of "folk etymology" are POV. The common names exist. If they don't belong in an article about the tree, where do they belong, in their own article? I'll source the paragraph. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 23:06, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Please carefully read articles and discussion before making negative comments based on the context therein. Neglect in this area is disrespectful to fellow editors, wastes the time of all involved, and has necessitated the rebuttals that follow.</li>
<li>The suggestion that I have an aversion to common names is false and contradicted by all evidence. I retained the common names in the article except two which indicate a subspecies (these could be mentioned in that section). The name elements I list (ash-, -leaf, -leaved, etc.) can be combined to form a quantity of names far exceeding those previously listed. I even added two common names: Negundo Maple, and Red River Maple.</li>
<li>The accusation regarding POV in my edits to this article is unfounded and annoying. I already said the <i>Buxus</i> mention was fine as long as it was either referenced or not listed as a hard fact. You seemed to agree to this suggestion yet used it as a foundation for an accusatory rant.</li>
<li>While there is always room for improvement, the <i>Acer negundo</i> article is organized, well-written, and appropriately referenced . Since discussion of the common names of <i>A. negundo</i> took up so many lines of text, I decided a section heading "Common names" near the start of the article was a good way to deal with it. While it is your prerogative to disagree with the decisions of other editors, to describe this article as a "mess" is impolite and inaccurate.</li>
<li>I appreciate your attention to this subject of interest to us both and am going to make some edits based on your comments. I will not, however, engage in this dialogue further. <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HouseOfScandal_63ec.html" title="Special:Contributions/HouseOfScandal"><font color="blue">‚óÑ</font></a><a href="../../../h/o/u/User_talk%7EHouseOfScandal_2d15.html" title="User talk:HouseOfScandal"><font color="blue">HouseOfScandal</font></a><a href="../../../h/o/u/User_talk%7EHouseOfScandal_2d15.html" title="User talk:HouseOfScandal"><font color="blue">‚ñ∫</font></a></b> 06:37, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Since you didn't bother to read what you removed, and since you didn't read the discussion on this talk page about the content that you removed, and since you didn't read what I wrote, your first point is more than a bit disingenuous, but doesn't surprise me. I'll weigh the rest accordingly. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 14:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow, you really put me in my place.

<dd>And can you imagine how I would have felt if you had actually read anything the first time, like maybe feeling the need to reread my post? Nope. No surprise that not having read what you removed, you don't want to discuss the article. So, why not stick with what you wrote, something about not engaging in this dialogue. Oh, well, again, you don't appear to read what you write any more than what you delete, or agree with what you say, so how can I won't value what you say any more than you do. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 18:11, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
