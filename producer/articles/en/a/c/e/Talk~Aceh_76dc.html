<p>There was some pretty racist, archaic stuff in there i.e. Mohammedans and value judgments about the appearance of ethnic groups. Much of the rest of it is somewhat dated as well unless the Dutch still have a garrison there.

<p>The discussion of the 'blue-eyed' 'fair-skinned' people of West Aceh I simplified to make it more factual. There is no known historical evidence for the Portuguese origin of the Daya Acehnese, despite the widespread legend. (I would be glad to be corrected on this). I travelled through the area before the Tsunami, and whilst it is true that there are unusually many fair-skinned people in the area, there are also fair-skinned people in other parts of Aceh (a former Governor of Aceh, from Aceh Besar, had blue eyes). <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagleswings_0028.html" title="User:Eagleswings">Eagleswings</a> 13:19, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Your right,their not Portuguese descent,but of Turkish/Ottoman Janissary descent.The Portuguese theory by experts themselves clash with one saying they were colonists stranded,and another saying they are troops of the Moorish Empire.Some say they arrived in the 1400's,another say they arrived in 1509.I dont know how on earth this Portuguese theory came about,but people seem to take the Portuguese theory more seriously I guess is because they are European,whilst the Turks are mostly situated in the Middle East which probably makes people think that it is unlikely them.Well,the Ottoman troops,were also made up of a lot of southeast Europeans and so was their Jannisary troops.Also,the Portuguese are not blue-eyed blondes although you do find a minority of them with it.They are mostly tannish pale skinned with brown hair and eyes.So it doesnt make sense that they are Portuguese when the descendants gained a reputation as being the "blue eyes" of Aceh.Even more so since these people are of Acehnese+European descent,and European light colourings are recessive compared to the tanned black haired Acehnese which would have dissapeared after a couple of generations unless intermarriage with other descendants with high percentage of European blood would have been able to keep the features alive.Another example:the Portuguese descended people of Malaysia themselves dont look European at all.Those who do have recent European ancestors.Also,their Portuguese ancestors arrived in Malacca in 1511 till 1641.</p>

<p>I wish people would refrain from using "separatist", this is a completely biased term</p>
<p><br />
"<a href="../../../s/e/p/Separatism.html" title="Separatism">Separatist</a>" is the generally accepted and used term elsewhere in the article, other Wikipedia articles, the media, and in the political sphere.

<dl>
<dd>Actually members of various independence, or secessionist if you will, movements find the term offensive. People who oppose certain independence movements favour the term, since it gives them an added legitimacy, and/or suggests that said area was always part of whichever state (often not true). Members of independence movements in general should not be confused with violent groups which favour armed insurrection...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest it is only "generally accepted", in that many of the large states of the world have ulterior motives in hanging on to certain territories, and do not wish to give their self-determination movements positive publicity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This article while mentioning armed insurrections does not completely explain the actual grievances of the self-determination movement in Aceh.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The article also fails to explains the pre-1800 issues in Aceh. Aceh was part of the Kingdom of Atjeh in the middle ages. Those peoples were of indonesian descents while the indonesians of today are of javan descents. Ie: they are descendants of the Kingdom of Mataram which was situated near Jakarta. I'm not saying that it explains today self-determination movement but it does explain a bit the beginning of the article. If you doubt it check the CIA World Factbook. Over 80% of the population is of javan ethnicity. - Mystra007, January 26 2004 Also (opinion follow) Aceh independance isn't like independance in other places. Like Africa or Timor, those independance movements are mainly between remnants of colonization (like in Timor, the dutch settled indonesia but Portugal owned Timor. So today it's kinda a war between indonesian sunni and portugese catholics). While in Aceh it's the remnants of two kingdoms who are still fighting today like they always did</p>

<p>The history section needs a looking over by someone with knowledge in this area. Various facts strike me as confusing (like who was general-major Köhler?) and many statements are quite POV for example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Major J.B. van Heutsz, a colonial millitary leader, then wrote a series of articles on Aceh, proclaiming the use of excessive force to subjugate the province. This advice was followed: in 1898 Van Heutsz was proclaimed governor of Aceh, and with his lieutenant, later Dutch Prime Minister Hendrikus Colijn, most of Aceh was (nominally) brought under Dutch control. They charged colonel Van Daalen with breaking remaining resistance. Van Daalen destroyed several villages, killing at least 2,900 Acehnese, among which 1,150 women and children. Dutch losses numbered just 26, and Van Daalen was promoted. By 1904 Aceh was fully under Dutch control.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When news about the brutal acts in Aceh reached the Netherlands there was a public outcry against Van Daalen, and he was discharged. The true account of the Aceh war was never investigated, however. Estimated total casualties on the Aceh side range from 50,000 to 100,000 dead, and over a million wounded.</dd>

<p>Major Köhler was one of the generals charged with the first expedition against Aceh. He was killed in action. The only source for the number of victims is the book by Paul Van 't Veer.</p>

<hr />
<p><i>...Doubtful, since the spelling has changed through time and used to be Atjeh on many maps.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>Well, and why is the language called A<i>chinese</i>?</p>
<p>Hi, I edited some stuff on the Aceh war. The dutch called Aceh "Atjeh" or "Atchin", hence the Atchinese. The aconym above looks unfounded to me. Motorway</p>
<p>re: Arab Chinese European Hindu I also heard this when I worked in Aceh, from an Acehnese. He made it clear this is a word play, and behind the humour is a pride in diverse ethnic origins. Word play, eg imagining a common word is an acronym and creating expansions of it, is a common source of amusement throughout Indonesia.</p>
<p><br />
The Arab-Chinese-European-Hindu explanation of the name 'Aceh' is a modern invention, despites its great popularity in Aceh today. One hundred years ago other explanations were popular, e.g. that the word came from an Indian language. What is interesting is that an explanation is thought necessary for its origin. The name Aceh appears suddenly in the historical record when the kingdom formerly known as Lambri (Chinese Langpoli) was rapidly expanding its power. Why the name of 'Aceh' was adopted is unknown. The expression Achinese is the now out-dated English spelling, which goes back centuries. It is probably based upon a Portuguese source. The correct spelling in English today should be Aceh and Acehnese.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagleswings_0028.html" title="User:Eagleswings">Eagleswings</a> 13:07, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
