<dd>I think for now we're better-off using the units, spelling, etc. that are conventional for the "home" country of the article (and to give the alternative units as well). In general, I really don't care which order they come in and have no concerns about SI coming first but in this case, it looks like the "original" units for most of the numbers were American units (miles) so I think we should leave them as they were. (The fact that the "abouts" changed place from hard American units and "about" metric units to hard metric units and "about" American units supports this contention.)</dd>

<p>I've read <a href="../../../m/e/a/Wikipedia%7EMeasurements_Debate_12ae.html" title="Wikipedia:Measurements Debate">Wikipedia:Measurements Debate</a> and it is clear that the metric system should be used as measurement units. About 90% of the world population use this convenient system. If a few countries use a different system this should not interfere. The goal of this encyclopedia is to inform, not to not to make USAians think they ought to do. I don't think there is a "home" for this article, nor for any article. Every article in this encyclopedia is global, not local. It should use the units that everyone uses, not the units that locals use.

<dd>It's referring to spelling, but it still makes the point. The Acela Express is clearly a topic that is specific to the United States and to use the spelling "colour" would be improper. I believe the same principle applies to respecting the customary units used by a country, even if those units are old and obsolete.

<p>This link refers to spelling, not to measurement units. This Encyclopedia is aimed for the world, not just for one country. In a special Wikipedia for USA, the use of miles is ok, but not here. I cannot understand how we can support a measurement units that means nothing for 95% of the world population. I think this article is informative, and should be accessible to everyone. Using non standard measurement units cripples this.

<dd>What a silly argument. Amtrak, and all North American railroads, use the Imperial system of units (tho' I presume that US roads use US gallons). The speeds listed are from timetables - convert at your own risk. As for using decimals in the conversions, that's just foolish! Unless you have an Amtrak NEC timetable, how would you know if the distances are are correct in US units? And you want to convert to multiple decimal places? Not. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlaws_d66e.html" title="User:Plaws">Plaws</a> 22:00, 2005 May 31 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After all the changing of units here the version of 4.19.111.130 seemed like a fair compromise, Imp units first for an American subject, and a Metric conversion with no decimals. That is like most other articles. Wwoods’s innovation of replacing all the last significant figures with 0 or 5 is not mentioned in the measurement discussion. Would anyone support that as a general policy for all conversions on all other pages? <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMeggar_5476.html" title="User:Meggar">Meggar</a> 04:55, 2005 Jun 2 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Those speeds aren't really accurate ±1 km/h, or even ±1 mph. Note that all of them are in increments of 5 mph (~10 km/h). To say "about 241 km/h" is self-contradictory. On the other hand, when they give a distance of 18 miles, that implies it <i>has</i> been measured to the mile, so a more precise translation--29 or even 29.0 km--is warranted.</dd>

<dd>I see now that the way it was worded, “reaches a top speed”, would have given the impression that they were ballpark figures. The numbers, 150, 135, 125, 110, though they end with zeros or fives are not approximations, but defined maximum speeds over certain stretches of track, so are exact numbers and not roundable. The equipment itself is capable of going faster, but then the engineer gets fired. Railroaders take the last digit seriously. For example, by federal regulation in the United States the max speed for any passenger train without supplementary automatic cab control is 79 mph. Not 80 but 79, it says so in 49 CFR(236.567). The event recorders on board trains have high resolution and their outputs are reported to ±1 mph in accident investigations. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMeggar_5476.html" title="User:Meggar">Meggar</a> 02:21, 2005 Jun 6 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article states that you can now travel Boston-NYC in under four hours. Is this what it's supposed to say? I mean, the distance is about 300 kilometers, if you drive that distance doing 75 km/h (somewhat less than 50 mph) you could go by car in that time.</p>
<p>It's 3 hours 20-25 minutes. Boston to NYC is 346 km, giving a speed of 103 kph (64 mph). That's rarely doable on the Boston-NYC corridor. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 23:02, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Drive time does not account for stops both at stations and in traffic, the trains must run up and down the track at certain times and be in certain places at certian times because of track traffic. The NEC is used both as an intercity route and a commuter route. so train must be coordinated, that is why it takes so long. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKev62nesl_15ff.html" title="User:Kev62nesl">kev62nesl</a></p>

<p>To clear up any misinformation regarding the tilting, I am a high speed supervising technician, I work for Amtrak. I can be contacted at hammank@amtrak.com, the tilting is for passanger comfort only, the power cars do not having titling it is only for the trailing cars. There are no public source I can cite off hand, only proprietory sources of information in MGU-026 book for amtrak training. Further more tilting is not a <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safety_critical_component.html" title="Safety critical component">safety critical component</a> on a trainset, meaning it is not necessary for safe operation. this can be confirmed in FRA 238 Tier II HST Daily Inspection MECHANICAL book.</p>
<p>There is an error in the article regarding the decision to use a tilt train for Acela. In fact, there was no rational engineering or technical reason to use a tilt train on the route. It was done for purely propaganda reasons. There are plenty of NON-tilt passenger trains in use today that operate on tighter curves (and at higher speeds) than Acela.</p>
<p>The real determining factor for curve speed is superevelation. Hans-Joachim Zierke has an excellent write-up on this. A good starting point is: <a href="http://homepages.teuto.de/zierke/shasta_route/pages/15regulation.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://homepages.teuto.de/zierke/shasta_route/pages/15regulation.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and given the abysimal 60% on-time performance of NY-Boston Acela, the article should be careful in claiming a 3.5hr travel time.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem, of course, is that the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northeast_Corridor_e8a2.html" title="Northeast Corridor">Northeast Corridor</a> <b>ISN'T</b> superelevated for the speeds they'd like to achieve with the Acela.

<dd>If the NEC isn't superelevated for higher speeds, then using a tilt train won't fix that fundamental problem. As for passenger comfort, conventional trains throughout the civilized world (well, Europe at least) commonly run at higher speeds and through the same radius as found on the NEC. Moreover, tilt trains are more expensive to purchase and maintain, so they are not an "ideal operation" either. Like I said, there was no rational engineering reason for using a tilt train.</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure I understand your point. No, tilt-trains won't reduce the forces on the wheels/wheel-flanges/track that could be "zeroed out" by correct superelevation. But yes, tilt-trains will zero-out the forces on the passengers that are caused by incorrect superelevation by causing the carbodies to <i>bank</i> at the correct (coordinated) angle, and they can do this at a variety of speeds-around-the-curve rather than at just at one designed-for speed. So yes, as I stated, tilt-trains are a rational response to the demands for <b>passenger-comfort</b>. Whether that was worth the money is another debate, of course.</dd>

<dd>Given the huge number of modern NON-tilt trains running on a daily basis in places like France, Switzerland, Germany through <b>higher</b> curve speeds than Acela, it is very hard to make the case that there was a passenger-comfort issue -- unless you think the laws of Physics are different in Europe, or an American passenger is somehow different than a European. Furthermore, it has been reported on various rail-foamer newsgroups that the tilt mechanims on Acela has frequently cut out and as far as anyone knows, passengers never noticed the difference.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, the entry also claims that Acela captured "nearly half" of the Boston-New York market. The latest data I've seen (2003) showed it has dropped to 37%. However, the "nearly half" claim might still hold for New York-Washington.</dd>

<dd>You're arguing at cross-purposes with yourself. The European trains you reference are probably running on trackway that is correctly superelevated for the speeds at which the train is travelling, hence no need for the tilt mechanism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, the comparison is ROW with same superlevation through the same radius. Apples vs. apples. -EM</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also wonder why this is such a big deal with you; are you trying to prove the point that the money spent on the tilting mechanism was wasted? If so, fine; "it was wasted". We should have built a <a href="../../../t/g/v/TGV_cb6f.html" title="TGV">TGV</a>-class dedicated trackway with TGV-style trainsets running at 300 kph. But we're the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and we don't "do" rail, so we consider ourselves lucky to have gotten the Acela, such as it is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If your point is something else, perhaps you should make it plain.</dd>

<dd>I guess I've lost your point again, then. There's no doubt that tilt-train technology can provide a <b>better</b> passenger ride than the equivalent ride on an track which is incorrectly-superelevated for the current train speed. You haven't provided us with any facts that argue against this, nor do your European examples of <b>acceptable</b> rides argue against the concept of <b>better</b> rides. If you'd like to advance the claim in the article that the tilt-train technology was a waste of money, go ahead; edit it in and we'll see who supports your claim and who rejects your claim. If you'd like to argue that the tilt-train technology is often broken, go ahead. If the fact that the tilt-train technology's tilt-angle was limited by errors in the <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loading_gauge.html" title="Loading gauge">loading gauge</a> and that's not already in the article, go ahead and edit that in, too. But there's nothing wrong with the tilt-train technology, <b>in principle</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's the claim the article actually makes:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>These trains also tilt to negotiate the many curves on the densely populated route, permitting better passenger comfort and lower construction costs for the higher speeds.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Note the use of the word <b>better</b> with regard to comfort and <b>lower</b> with regard to construction costs. Both of these claims are true facts, supported by the physics of the situation. A train that is more-closely banked to the correct angle (whether through superelevation or through tilt-train technology) is more comfrtable than a train where the turns are not appropriately coordinated. And the roadbed construction costs (to do no special superelevation) are certainly lower than the roadbed construction costs to reconstruct all the turns to have the correct superelevation angle for the Acela Express.</dd>

<dd>No, the statement is incorrect and should be changed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As described above, the reconstructed track geometry did not require the use of a tilt train. Thus, the decision to purchase an active-tilt system did not in any way lower construction costs (in fact, the Acela will end up increasing the track costs too due to it being grossly overweight, but that is a whole other discussion).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I don't want to get into an argument over pedantics, but anything is true <i>in principle</i>. So, yes, <i>in principle</i> a tilt system would be more comfortable, just as <i>in principle</i> Peewee Herman could beat Shaq O'Neil in a game of one-on-one. In <b>practice</b> the tilt system isn't even switched on along the curviest segment of the line -- ever. In <b>practice</b> the industry has spent a lot of time measuring the amount of lateral acceleration that would be noticed by passengers. With Acela operating under that threshold, any gain from tilt is going to be theoretical. Thus, based on the engineering data, and the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BATN/message/14038" class="external text" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BATN/message/14038" rel="nofollow">overall incompetance</a> of the Acela project, many observers have said that the only reason for using tilt was only for its "gee-whiz" appeal.</li>

It is self-evident by the fact there is no tilting on the power cars, however tilting cannot be cut out as some claim. Through metro north territory tilting is disabled, not cutout. Metro north does not allow tilting because they the believe the tracks are too close together, however you can only run at 85mph anyway so titling is not necessary. However you do notice the difference in tilting when it is activated.</dd>

<p>I made several corrections here. First, it is not limited to RI. It was initially MP 162-170 in RI, and MP 195-205 in MA. Second, it is now more than 18 miles of track; I have ridden in Acelas that have done 150 mph through Kingston, RI (which is around MP 158 or so - well outside of the former MP 162 cutoff). I am not sure exactly how much more though; someone would need to get the most up to date Amtrak employee timetable to find out.</p>

<p>It previously stated the CDOT owns the MNCR track, seemingly implying that they owned all of it. In fact, the CT part is owned by CDOT and the NY part is owned by NYDOT. Furthermore, the 90 mph max is only on NYDOT track. CDOT track is limited to 75 mph. I have cleared up the ambiguity/potential errors here.</p>
<p>I have also added a section explaining that the 135 mph limit south (west, really) of NYP is due to catenary issues, not track issues. The track is in fact straighter on the ex-Pennsy than on the ex-New Haven, as most here probably know. I do not believe this is readily apparent in the article, since no NYP-WAS timings are cited.</p>

<dd>Are we sure that NYDOT owns the trackage in N.Y.? I thought it was the MTA. Nelson Ricardo 02:55, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I would concur on that. Amtrak's timetable cites MNRR as the host railroad, and MNRR is a division of the MTA. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam613_ccbd.html" title="User:Adam613">Adam613</a> 15:27, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Changed "North America's more stringent crash standards" to "North America's different approach to crash standards". This sentence was misleading, as North America and Europe have two opposite strategies to crash safety. While North American standards emphasize the robustness of the structures, Europe prefers lighter structures that distorts during crash to absorb the energy leaving a a "survival cell" made of very strong frame that protects passengers. This approach is used in the design of the TGV and European standards are no way less stringent than North Americans. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlastwizard_4fdf.html" title="User:Blastwizard">Blastwizard</a> 10:42, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

I don't mean to argue but the high speed trainset, aka acela express, are designed with the same survival cell that you refer to. On the HST anything outside of the interior doors (trailer car) are deisgned to crumple and the nose of the power cars are suppose to crumple. The engineers are suppose to dive into a little section behind his seat that are equiped with crash pads. These crumple zone are suppose to absorb over 50 megajewels.<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKev62nesl_15ff.html" title="User:Kev62nesl">kev62nesl</a></p>

<p>"With the completion of electrification between New Haven and Boston, all trains on the line have become faster; one can travel between Boston and New York in just over three and a half hours (an improvement of half an hour). New York to Washington runs take about two and three-quarters hours."</p>
<p>The semicolon here implies that any train on the NEC can get you from Boston to Penn Station in 3 1/2 hours, when in reality, only the Acela goes this fast. The Amtrak website shows a scheduled time of 4:15 for a Regional NEC train. I'm sure the article is is wrong here (unless I'm just reading the sentence wrongly), but I'm wondering whether the improvement of half an hour over earlier diesel to electric switches is still correct. Anyone have any thoughts? <a href="../../../m/j/l/User%7EMjl0509_36f6.html" title="User:Mjl0509">Mjl0509</a> 19:15, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I notice that we're coming close to an edit war on whether or not to include the May 25 NEC power outage in the "Outages" section of the article (namely, 84.49.106.92 and I have removed it, and Atlant has restored it).</p>
<p>I don't think that the power outage has any place in this article. Power outages on the NEC affect nearly all service, not just the Acela, as opposed to the other outages. The fact that several trains, including Acela trainsets, were stranded is hardly worth mentioning as part of this article; it's not the Acela's fault, it's not unique to the Acela, and power outages are not rare on Amtrak. Especially considering the magnitude of the other outages, which occured when defects were found <i>solely with the Acela</i>, including a paragraph about an electric locomotive being stuck when the power went out doesn't seem in the same league. —<a href="../../../l/r/d/User%7ELrdChaos_ee3f.html" title="User:LrdChaos">LrdChaos</a> (<a href="../../../l/r/d/User_talk%7ELrdChaos_e2dc.html" title="User talk:LrdChaos">talk</a>) 15:56, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I stated in my edit summary, though, it was primarily Amtrak's Acela service that took the bad press on this most-recent deep outage. And an outage is an outage, whether it's caused by falling-apart damper brackets, falling apart brake discs, or falling-apart electrical infrastructure.</dd>

<dd>Regardless of where the media focused its attention, the fact is that the power outage was <i>not</i> unique to the Acela Express. It stranded AEM-7s and HHP-8s, as well as New Jersey transit and SEPTA equipment. The outage was the result of a power system problem, not a fault in the Acela Express, and it only lasted a few hours. It was newsworthy at the time, but in a historical context, the affect of the outage on the AE was no different than it was on any other locomotive in use at the time, none of which have any mention of the outage.</dd>
<dd>You say that "an outage is an outage, whether it's caused by falling-apart damper brackets, falling apart brake discs, or falling-apart electrical infrastructure." What sets the "electrical infrastructure" item apart from the damper brackets and the brake discs is that those are internal components of the Acela Express; the electrical infrastructure is a larger, external problem that affects everything. It may have a place in an article for the incident, or in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northeast_Corridor_e8a2.html" title="Northeast Corridor">Northeast Corridor</a>, but it has no place being listed along with internal flaws/defects/problems with the AE. —<a href="../../../l/r/d/User%7ELrdChaos_ee3f.html" title="User:LrdChaos">LrdChaos</a> (<a href="../../../l/r/d/User_talk%7ELrdChaos_e2dc.html" title="User talk:LrdChaos">talk</a>) 17:35, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gentlemen, I'm certainly no fan of Acela, but it wasn't "Acela's" outage, it was Amtrak's, or the NEC's, or NJ. I thought that LrdChaos made a good point about that.</p>
<p>In a similar way, when an Acela train came nose-to-nose (almost) with a commuter train at S.Norwalk,CT, it wasn't because of an Acela flaw (although that was the train at fault), it was a flaw with the Amtrak engineer that had been running with the safety mechanisms cut out! That's why ALL Amtrak trains, not just Acelas, have to report the condition of their cab signal &amp; automatic train stop apparatus when they enter Metro North territory at New Haven,CT, or New Rochelle,NY. You wouldn't want "fatal safety flaw" listed under Acela's disadvantages, would you?

<p>Was there any such thing as a turbo Acela that was being tested? I heard rumors of an Acela Turbotrain that didn't pan out because it guzzled too much fuel and accelerated too slowly.
