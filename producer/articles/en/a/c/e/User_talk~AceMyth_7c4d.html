<p>Hi! I'm replacing several "names" in the Naruto articles with those used in the Shonen Jump magazine, and the wapuro style used there will give way to the circumflexes seen in Shonen Jump. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 14:42, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regarding Viz' "Evil Eye" - I saw the word used in the English language to describe a "bad" eye or an eye that is perceived as having evil powers. Viz used the same translation for Hiei's "Jagan" in YuYu Hakusho. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 23:30, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have they released any more volumes referring to the Byakugan? Because if they did and they're actually going to translate it as "Evil Eye" all the way I can't wait to see Kakashi go on an all-out lecture about the scientific properties of the Evil Eye =P --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceMyth_ce06.html" title="User:AceMyth">AceMyth</a> 23:50, Dec 7, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>So far, VIZ has not mentioned the Byakugan after the one episode, but since Hiei's Jagan is translated as such too, they might use "Evil Eye" again. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 22:56, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Great idea ^_^ However we should be careful not to obscure any of the relations between the characters, like Clan relations and such. There is also the question as to what exactly qualifies as a major character. E.g. is Hiashi a character worthy of his own page? and what about Shikaku?<br />
Anyway, I fully support your idea, and I'd be glad to help ^_^<br />

<p>I found you in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_Israel_b306.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians/Israel">List of Wikipedians in Israel</a>. You could help me on an article about <a href="../../../../de/f/e/r/Ferdinand_Stadler_26bf.html" class="extiw" title="de:Ferdinand_Stadler">de:Ferdinand Stadler</a>, who built a protestant (german source says <i>evangelisch</i>) church for a mission in Nazareth. The church opened its doors 1st of October 1871. Could you maybe find out what happened to this church and perhaps take a photo? I know Tel Aviv is not so close to Nazareth, but you might probably know someone who lives there. It would be really great to find out since its a gap in Stadlers list of works. The church should be the same style as <a href="http://matthaeuskirche-luzern.ch/mattha2.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://matthaeuskirche-luzern.ch/mattha2.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_Revival_architecture_6775.html" title="Gothic Revival architecture">Gothic Revival architecture</a>.

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">User:Gilgamesh</a> is now imposing his <i>own</i> views by changing the transliterated Hebrew names of articles with redirects to unreadable Hebrew names and fonts, as if <i>his</i> criteria are the only ones to reckon with, when there are in fact several. My computer, as I am sure many others' as well, does not pick up his type of fonts, and thus he is messing up articles such as <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safed.html" title="Safed">Safed</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadera.html" title="Hadera">Hadera</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holon.html" title="Holon">Holon</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/u/Afula.html" title="Afula">Afula</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arad%2C_Israel_f5a1.html" title="Arad, Israel">Arad, Israel</a> and many others defacing them and making them unreadable on the web. He is going to DESTROY the normal usage of Wikipedia's Hebrew transliterations to satisfy his own needs without there being any consensus. Common usages are being thrown out in favor of obscure and pedantic academic usages familiar to only a handful of unkown academics. He should be called upon to stop BEFORE he rushes to do further damage without any consensus being reached. All his changes should therefore be reverted.

<p>I originally thouhgt you called me a hate addict, but you didn't...</p>
<p>Forgive me if I have upset you. There will be day when this is over, but there much be justice. There was a time when Palestine was peaceful and if that Palestine still existed it would have probably been similar to Lebanon; Druzui, Jews, Muslims, and Christians living together in harmony. In fact may I point that the original Jewish population, the Palestinian Jews wrote letters begging the UN not to implement (Israel would have been created regardless, but the UN only served to legitimize it; it was as it still is a body serving elite interests) the creation of a so-called Jewish state--there are many reeason for their pleas. I have my whole life been someone who has angered both sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict and many other things, although it may not seem so. I know that Israeli does not mean Jew or Zionist or vice-versa.</p>
<p>Once again, I am sorry. Some were born into this, but they on both sides have to know that they are pawns and mislead, by something that goes beyond the existance of ISrael, something so sinister and so real, something that connects all history in an interlinked motion.</p>
<p>I am not a hate addict, I am not an Arab, I am someone who loses everytime Israelis or Arabs are hurt or killed. I too am a human being like yourself. I mean this in the politest way possible and have to say it; No one should die. I am outraged to see civilians and fighters day. All life is sacred, but there is one thing I must also point out...that Israel, the state was created under alterior motives and mislead much of the world's Jewry into beleiving that that was the only place where they would be safe. This was and as you can see is not true. And who is victimized, the regular people in multiple ways.</p>
<p>You have me wrong. I am someone who supports the rights of the Israeli people, but I also know how they are being used for cattle, and beleive me when I say I know.</p>
<p>Do you know who helped illeminate the majority of rabbis in Europe? Reserach it. It was not the Nazis. Do you know that the majority of the Rabbis in Europe were against the creation of a Jewish state and beleived according to the Holy Talmud/Torah to be against the will of God, until the Messiah comes? Even the Holy Quran says in the section, 'the Children of Israel,' that Gid had picked the Children of Israel with the highest favour above all nations but they turned their backs on God and their covenent. This is a motif for the Holy Torah, the Holy Bible, and the Holy Quran. Those were in exodus have forgotten what it was like and are collectively as an entity behind one the greatest exodus in the world.</p>
<p>Is the Holy Land really material or is it something much more? It seems that the delights of this world have fooled many to fight for land, but let us also get something straight here their is a difference with fighting for land and fighting for your rights.</p>
<p>The people in this region are all being sucked in and blinded by a black hole of hate and anger. Have you ever thought of how people, Israelis, Lebanese, etc. are all being de-humanized and the psychological warp that has been started?</p>
<p>I am not a hate filled person, but I also cannot allow these lies to be passed as fact. Look at the attempts to involve and smear Iran's name in this conflict. This was not about two Israeli troops.</p>
<p>Everyone must do what they think and know what they think is right. You have brought out your hand and stretched to me and I thank you for this. WHoever you are I will help you; remember this name and these things; Benjamin H. Freedman, the Balfour Declaration (including the date), Norman Dodd, the modern Banking System, 'the financial links between the West, Nazi Germany, and the Communists,' the concept of world government, and Michel Chossodovsky.</p>

<p>Listen to me my friend; I must apologize to you again. Those who use to preach to the masses 'we will push Israel into the sea' are gone. The Holy Torah says 'divide not God's land.' These borders--all of them--are man made, but let the original inhabbitants come back. History is a test as is life; we are all the result of conquered nations and no one can claim that anything was truly theirs. We must share this world; it was given to us. The Temple Mount is yours as much as anyone elses. You and all inhabbitants should stay, but the political entity that is Israel as we know it must go. This is not a physical entity that must go, but an established invisiable thing. It is this that must be replaced. There must be internal change too. This is how the Israeli people will be saved. It is these people that were suppose to be "a light unto the nations," not to let themselves and their names be hijacked for pain and suffering by a few who do not care for the people of Israel or Gaza and the world.</p>
<p>There must be new state for you and for those who yearn to return. If this state is created and with justice; it will be the nucleaus of a union that will envelope the whole Middle East. Look at the European peoples, they have realized that they are one; although the hopes of these people is being manipulated by those in power that have different interests and motivations for creating the E.U.</p>
<p>I once reminded a friend who had lost faith and was only Jewish in name who beleived that there would never be any union of the peoples of the Middle East and that Israelis stood alone that the menorah was the sign of a few who seemed to be standing alone and only with their faith, convictions, and God; these few stood against tyranny and fought for justice. This is why the Menorah is with us; this is what the menorah represents, this is an idea being forgotten. Today, to me it is those who call themselves Hezbollah (a name I would never take on myself), maybe in a misguided way, are the ones fighting against injustice of a state and a movement it represnts that are not the interests of the Israeli people. This hope and conviction is what the Israeli people should hold onto.</p>
<p><br />
This event has created animosity to such an extent that their will be a broader war that the peoples of the world will be suckered into and has been planned for years. And for what--for a few elite groups gaining more wealth and power and control. A few who have no allegance to any state or people, but just to themselves.</p>
<p>The land is yours to stay in and if anyone seeks to through you out their hearts are veiled, but also remember how those Palestinians felt when they were forced out. Also know that people are good and the will forgive, if they return and their is a single state solution with guaranteed rights for all and 'proper education' there will can be peace.</p>
<p>Before this can be done peoples must change their own societies. That means the Palestinians and Israelis; the people are being mislead. Fear and hatred is being cultivated as acontrol mechanism.</p>
<p>I appreciate you taking the time to write to me. What you wrote sturred a lot of good emotions from me. One last thing; the means never justify the ends...never ever will the means justify the ends. Nationalism is a plague and true religion is ignored or forgotten by most the world.</p>
