I've been editing this article today to try to get a better visual layout, waiting to get legitimate feedback and see what direction it should go in. These articles are currently undergoing renovation (see: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Digimon_Systems_Update_819b.html#Digimon_Fontier" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Digimon Systems Update">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Digimon Systems Update#Digimon Fontier</a>). I understand if you strongly feel that there should be a caption, and if so then ok, I don't have a major issue with that. I'm sorry if you felt I was attacking you, that was not my intent. A great deal of times in Digimon articles people fill out parts of wikicode simply for the sake of filling it out, I thought that was the issue here. Now that I see you feel that it is a necessary explanation, I don't have an issue with that and I can even see your point. So next time just calm down. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 23:40, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>And before you start insulting people, it could help to look at the history of certain pages. For instance: the Mastermind (Marvel Comics) redirects. Originally all versions were on the same page.

<p>Well, first of all, MgTurtle and MgHoneyBee are both me. I just use MgTurtle more since I changed my username. I don't know if you're allowed to have 2 usernames but if I can't can someone help me delete MgHoneyBee?

<p>Okay. I did read other people's comments. I just wanted to give my opinions about the whole thing that's all. And are you switching now? And how come you repsond so quickly? Just wondering. <a href="../../../m/g/t/User%7EMgTurtle_b391.html" title="User:MgTurtle">User:MgTurtle</a> Apr.27,2006.</p>
<p>In order: Switching? I respond quickly because it's my own talk page. I'm directly informed by the site of new messages and changes (sometimes even my own). Although I generally try to answer questions and post replies on talk pages in a prept manner. Furthermore, such pages are listed on my watch list, which i view quite frequently. Vandals, for one, are discouraged by fast reverts and new members are encouraged by fast answers. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">The Anti-Gnome</a> 20:32, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay. <a href="../../../m/g/t/User%7EMgTurtle_b391.html" title="User:MgTurtle">User:MgTurtle</a> Apr.27,2006.</p>
<p>What did you mean by "switching"? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">The Anti-Gnome</a> 20:53, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Switching usernames. Unless you also have 2 usernames. <a href="../../../m/g/t/User%7EMgTurtle_b391.html" title="User:MgTurtle">User:MgTurtle</a> Apr.27,2006. I changed my nickname. It shows up automatically when i sign stuff. If you check the link it's still to my userpage (a work in progress, I warn you). I notice you sign manually. Have you tried using four tildes (~)? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">The Anti-Gnome</a> 23:38, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes but I don't like the time to be on my comments. I'm just stubborrn I guess. User:MgTurtle. Apr.27,2006.</p>
<p>But the time is listed. You list dates. How will hours hurt? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">The Anti-Gnome</a> 01:08, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But the time and date are 2 completely different things.I just don't like the time on there. I guess you can say that I'm weird but that's me. So what other pages have you commented on or what part of Wikipedia do you normally edit? Just wondering. I feel like there's nothing left to say about Suri that has not already been said even though there are new comments on her page including a new suggestion about what to do about the page. <a href="../../../m/g/t/User%7EMgTurtle_b391.html" title="User:MgTurtle">User:MgTurtle</a> Apr.27,2006.</p>
<p>I see what you're saying, but, if this helps, the time isn't meant to met your area. It's universal and international, mention to give a clear indicater no matter where the reader is. Without a time and mention of a time zone (Like UTC, GMT, etc) your dates are subjective. You might as well just sign your username. It'd just as helpful as your current mode of signing, which, as I'm trying to point out, isn't very helpful at all. BTW, I think you forgot to sign just now. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">The Anti-Gnome</a> 02:00, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is the second conflict that I've gotten into but I got to say that you are more civil than my last conflict was. i mean that they just would not read my comments at all. Thanks for being civil. <a href="../../../m/g/t/User%7EMgTurtle_b391.html" title="User:MgTurtle">User:MgTurtle</a> Apr.27,2006.</p>
<p>Unless you're referring to an edit conflict, I don't believe the label fits. I've stated before (in this very section of this very talk page), I have nothing against you, young lady. I'm simply trying to show you the way. Ha. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">The Anti-Gnome</a> 02:04, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Young lady, I don't think that label fits either but whatever. Um, maybe a difference of opinions instead of a conflict. I know that you have nothing against me and I have nothing against you but it is sort of a conflict. <a href="../../../m/g/t/User%7EMgTurtle_b391.html" title="User:MgTurtle">User:MgTurtle</a> Apr. 27,2006.</p>
<p>Hmm. Perhaps not. So, I take it you're not interested in using the automated signing feature? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">The Anti-Gnome</a> 02:51, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I got a question: why do you like Japanese anime? Just wondering since i don't really understand why people enjoy watching it. <a href="../../../m/g/t/User%7EMgTurtle_b391.html" title="User:MgTurtle">user:MgTurtle</a> Apr.29,2006.</p>
<p>Why do you like wrestling? I never understood that, myself. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">The Anti-Gnome</a> 02:54, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's entertaining and I enjoy it. I was wondering if you like Japanese anime for the entertainment or for the characters. <a href="../../../m/g/t/User%7EMgTurtle_b391.html" title="User:MgTurtle">User:MgTurtle</a> Apr.30,2006.</p>
<p>Characters can be entertaining, but I think I understand what you're getting at. The way I see it, asking someone why they like Animé is like asking someone why they watch <a href="../../../t/o/o/Toon_Disney_b1b5.html" title="Toon Disney">Toon Disney</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon_Network_8384.html" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boomerang_%28TV_channel%29_0047.html" title="Boomerang (TV channel)">Boomerang</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animation.html" title="Animation">Animation</a> in general. It's a type of Animation. A perfect analogy would be "<a href="../../../c/h/o/Chocolate.html" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a>" or dairy products. Why do people like chocolate? Why do people like cheese, milk, et cetera.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough ranting. I happen to like a few shows that are made in that format. Certainly not all, but enough that I must admit I like the story, as well as the stories. I'm not scouting for new ones to check out, though. And I've found many to be clunkers, just like with U.S. pilots. I'm having a hard time getting into <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eureka_Seven_048a.html" title="Eureka Seven">Eureka Seven</a> for example. I first though "Giant Robots! Kickass!" and <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_Swim_e7c7.html" title="Adult Swim">Adult Swim</a> sure plays that factor up. Still, the feel of the show is just too...weird. Cultural differences, perhaps. The robot battles (that I've seen so far) are also kinda lame or at least taking a back seat to story development. Another one, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandread.html" title="Vandread">Vandread</a> is too weighed down by its own little messages, attempts to examine love, exaggerated gender differences (or attempted dispute of such), homosexual and lesbian [[under tones]] and a lot of other stuff that just turns me off. Yet, just like ES, it has "<a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecha.html" title="Mecha">Mecha</a>".</p>
<p>So, in the end, it's not so much that I like Animé, it's that I can appreciate things done in that style. Not all, but some. I bet you can, too. Did you know <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltron.html" title="Voltron">Voltron</a> was an early form of Animé?</p>
<p>Oh and as for wrestling, I've watched it before, but the fakeness and soap opera-esq storylines turn me off, I guess. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">The Anti-Gnome</a> 21:04, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay. I've known many people who have watched anime or cartoons just for the characters. That's why I ask. I know what you mean by the soap opera-esp storylines. I don't watch it as closely as I use to but I still occasionally watch it. I now watch Ultimate Fighting. I guess I'm just a violent girl. <a href="../../../m/g/t/User%7EMgTurtle_b391.html" title="User:MgTurtle">User:MgTurtle</a> Apr.30, 2006.</p>
<p>Ah. Well, when is comes to the cartoons I watch, the characters are a factor, but I can usually get over their faults of he overall story is good. I have my beefs with Goku, but i love DB(Z/GT). I like Sailormoon, but Damien is my favorite character. So, I guess it's not always te characters, no. Though, in Eureka and Vandread's cases, the characters might be the reasons I don't like the shows (as of late), or at least major factors. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">The Anti-Gnome</a> 23:10, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, ACS. I was just writing to suggest that maybe revealing the new Flash is not a good idea. I can understand both positions (for and against spoiling it), but I'm sort of disappointed that Wikipedia spoiled the surprise for me. You list the confirmation as Infinite Crisis #5, but that doesn't confirm anything. I'm guessing your real source is the Vs cards, but I haven't seen what they say. I know that on other pages (i.e. <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_Crisis_5b73.html" title="Infinite Crisis">Infinite Crisis</a>) the policy has been to not spoil plot details before they appear in canon, so I just wanted to throw my opinions out there.

<p>I can, but consider it this way, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Allen_145c.html" title="Bart Allen">Bart Allen</a>'s the new flash in Barry's suit. This would mean it was already revealed, but no one realized it. Going by that logic, it <i>is</i> canon, we just needed the games to confirm it. Sorry about the spoilers, but don't blame Wikipedia. That's totally shooting the messager, dude! I'll admit, I went a little nuts editing other articles. The effects of an Infinite Crisis, man. Friggin weird.

<dd>Thank you very much for your prompt reply. I understand your point of view now, and understand you view. As for "pointless edits," I think that that is what the "minor edit" checkbox is for. Users should be permitted to make said edits, provided they bring something to the article. Which is not to say that my edit was any more meaningful to the article. However, I do feel that unifying the city/state setup in the sentence is important. Would you mind if I changed the link to <i>New York City, New York</i>? Or, change <i>Cleveland, Ohio</i> to <i>Cleveland, OH</i>? I am not trying to edit a page to fit my point of view, I am only trying to make fairly uniform prose. Let me know what you think.</dd>

<dd>And as for <i>replying to the poster's talk page ... and really...kind of rude</i>, but I said, <b>if you wouldn't mind</b>. You had no obligation to respond on my talk page, but I thank you for doing so.

<p>I disagree with your accusation that I vandalized <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedding_Crashers_fdf1.html" title="Wedding Crashers">Wedding Crashers</a>. A good copy edit is not vandalism, even if several sentences of peripheral information gets deleted. On the first edit I gave a two line summary of my changes. The primary intent of my edits was to remove spoilers in the overly long character descriptions, such as Will Ferrell's character. Removing spoilers broadens the audience for the article. The opening of the article was very poorly written. For example, why list other members of the Frat Pack in the third sentence. When it comes to writing, less is often more, so deleting rambling or peripheral material is not vandalism. You may not agree with my changes, but please give me the respect of reviewing them individually rather than lazily reverting all of them. I would appreciate if you would retract your acusation of vandalism. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhosts%26empties_0e07.html" title="User:Ghosts&amp;empties">Ghosts&amp;empties</a> 23:50, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ha! Please. I pride myself on making the best edits for the article, even if said edits are manual, so don't even try to claim "laziness" on my part. As for your half hearted little rewrite, it reads like a child wrote it. I included the only thing of worth and reverted the mess. Furthermore, "a full-fled lout" is more a negatively bias comment than a summarize description. Thus, it's a violation of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy.

<p>You said I am: "°Incorrect about them not being superheroines. °Incorrect about their enemies not being villians (super or otherwise). °Incorrect about the notiblity of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Powerpuff_Girls_a848.html" title="The Powerpuff Girls">The Powerpuff Girls</a> and articles related to them." But since the characters are fictitious, the first two <i>do not</i> apply, and it is a matter of the individual's opinion what they should be considered. And why do you care so much about the matter of the Powerpuff Girls? Some articles related to the Powerpuff Girls are notable; I can agree with that. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus2_3f8f.html" title="User:Marcus2">Marcus</a> 11:40, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please, don't even, dude. "ince the characters are fictitious, the first two <i>do not</i> apply"? Do you even realize the outrught stupidity of that. The concept of a "villain" isn't exclusive to reality and certainly prominant in fiction.</p>
<p>In fact, your comment of "it is a matter of the individual's opinion what they should be considered" is actually backwards, in a sense. Villains outside of fiction are a matter of opinion. Villains in fiction are usually designed to fit the titles given to them. In other words, villains in fiction are designed to be such, and fit certain archetypes, stereotypes, et cetera. Villains of reality are usually labeled such unneutrally. For example, some might label our very own U.S. president a villain. However, since he's real, wasn't made to be one (and probably isn't such a bad guy intentionally, if at all), use of such a word in reference to him is <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I ask you to point out one real superheroine. Oh wait...they're <b>all</b> fictional. A superpowered human, no matter what their gender, isn't likely to exist now or anytime soon. Besidesm if your disagreement was with fiction in general, why only target the PPG (characters) and articles related to them? You could have taken it up with Wikipedia at large and its policies rather than wedging war with innocent little girls. No. You're biased, dude. I'm honestly sorry if you cannot see that. BTW, before I go, here are my examples of your bias, just in case you "missed" them: <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarcus2_df49.html#Powerpuff_Girls_.27Villains.27" title="User talk:Marcus2">1</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarcus2_df49.html#Powerpuff_Girls_Trivia" title="User talk:Marcus2">2</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Powerpuff_Girls%7E_Relish_Rampage_ce9a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Powerpuff Girls: Relish Rampage">3</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_superheroines&amp;diff=51763905&amp;oldid=51738759" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_superheroines&amp;diff=51763905&amp;oldid=51738759" rel="nofollow">4</a>. Wait a minute. I just took another look at your talk page. The PPG stuff is most prominant, to be sure, but your bias extends to a lot of other articles. Dude, for your own good, turn back off this self-destructive path of yours. Believe me, I know a thing or two about it. Just because a character is on a children's cartoon (such as fairly oddparents, ppg, et cetera). I read your have aspergers.

<dd>If you're such a good listener, listen to this. Do you call the <i>Powerpuff Girls</i> innocent? I have some things that counter this. They beat up a clown (who had turned into a mime) even after he was back to normal. They look vicious when they're fighting at times. They only care about themselves and seem cruel.

I've already explained why you're wrong and I doubt I can be any clearer about what you should do if you desire to change.

<p>The majority of your talk-page comments there regarding your removal of my edits are essentially insults directed at me. I made it very clear that I was aware the WAY the section was written may not be ideal, and encouraged others to make edits to improve it. But you in no way jusitified why you feel the section, en toto, is not valid. You say that it's gossip that belongs in a fanzine; I disagree. Perhaps you have a lack of understanding as to exactly <b>WHY</b> it is important and encyclopedic to discuss a famous person's sexuality, including rumours about it. I suggest you aquaint yourself with the history of the persecution of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people - particularly in the United States, and with a special eye to the practices of "old Hollywood" in relation to masking gay stars' true identity.</p>
<p>It would be one thing, indeed, if people were simply making gay jokes. Teri Hatcher, on the other hand, is implicitly stating (by <b>USING HUMOR</b>) that Ryan Seacrest is a homosexual. She has consistantly stated that she feels he misled her into thinking there might be romantic potential between the two of them in order to mislead the press, even so far as to set up their "kiss" for the papparazzi to photograph.</p>
<p>Documenting the history of gay people in the entertainment industry is vital to the history of GLBT people, because it speaks to our increasing voice in the world. Documenting the allegations that certain celebrities are gay and denying it, or closeted, is equally vital to demonstrating the longstanding history of homophobia - particularly in Hollywood - that has caused countless GLBT people to deny their identity. Rock Hudson. Robert Reed. Sheila James. Countless others.</p>
<p>There is nothing un-encyclopedic about documenting an ongoing insinuation by the media - particularly by people who *HAVE HAD A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP OF SOME KIND* with the subject - that a person is hiding their sexual identity...<b>PROVIDING</b> that it is made clear in the text that the allegations were ongoing, notable, but contested and/or unproven.</p>
<p>The allegations in this case are ongoing and notable. I am sorry if you don't understand <b>WHY</b> they are notable, but they are, and I can't do a better job of explaining. In closing, I fully appreciate your responses, but I'm not going to tolerate personal attacks. Temper yourself, and temper your response to be courteous, if not kind. I don't need to like you, but I need to feel like you are following wiki-policy in terms of how you deal with other users. For your reference, and in fact linked from your own user page: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">Writers rules of engagement</a>]. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 19:21, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now. Let's see. You're fuming over...the <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Seacrest_098a.html" title="Ryan Seacrest">Ryan Seacrest</a> thing. Okay. Now, you feel Teri Hatcher—Not Kathy Graffin, the comedian you also mentioned in your little section, who is known for calling <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Aikin_015f.html" title="Clay Aikin">Clay Aikin</a> gay, as well, but not based on stereotypes and rumors, just like Ryan—would know. You make fairly good points here. Shame you had not done so in the article. It <i>was</i> unencyclopedic the way you wrote and mentioning Griffin as well as <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cruise_61a0.html" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> hurts your cause, rather than help it. I really don't care much, either way, but for a person who wants this to be taken seriously (and seemed to have a vested interest edging toward negative bias), you certainly seemed to half-ass it at first. None of what I'm saying to you now or then is meant as a "Personal attack" either. Look beyond your sensitivity for a moment. The section, to me, said "Well, two celebrities are saying/inferring he's gay. they'd know". I thought I made that point clear. If you want to write something better focusing on Teri and how "shew would know", go ahead. I'm not inclined to stop you, and I'm definitely not ignorant. I just don't want the reader getting the wrong message from an article. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a> 19:45, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">VandalProof 1.2 Now Available</span></h2>
<div style="border: 1px solid gray; background-color: #fdffe7;">
<div class="floatright"><span><a href="../../../v/a/n/Image%7EVandalprooflock.jpg_b347.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/f/f4/Vandalprooflock.jpg/180px-Vandalprooflock.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="180" longdesc="../../../v/a/n/Image%7EVandalprooflock.jpg_b347.html" /></a></span></div>
<p>After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now <i>available for download!</i> Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Suggestions_Being_Considered" title="WP:VandalProof">here</a>. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof. Thanks to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a>, I now have an account on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://test.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">test.wikipedia.org</a></span> with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof, which I plan to make available in the near future. An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_SHM_0af5.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/SHM">simple history merge</a> tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Download" title="WP:VandalProof">download and install version 1.2</a> and take it out for a test-drive. As always, your <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_suggestions_a7f1.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/suggestions">suggestions</a> for improvement are always appreciated, and I hope that you will find this new version useful.

<p>This is 71.115.212.229. If you're wondering why I'm under a different number, it's because I'm using a different computer. I recently read you're response to my edit on the Teen Titans' Cyborg page:</p>
<p>(→Justice League Pilot Promo - What would that even mean? Cyborgirl? Cygirl? Cyborg sex change? Gees. Don't be so literal about this, it makes Wikipedis look stupid.)</p>
<p>You make it seem like I committed vandalisim. I refered to Natasha as a <b>Female Cyborg</b>, because that's what Bruce Timm refered to her as on the Justice League Season One Set. I apologize about not being as perfect and as flawless as you. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.115.236.171 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.115.236.171.html" title="User talk:71.115.236.171">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.115.236.171_510b.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.115.236.171">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Apology accepted. Believe me, I was toning it down. The entry wasn't informative enough. I wasn't mad at you then, though. If one could call Batgirl a female version of Robin, but that comment alone isn't a great description. A better description, from the limited knowledge you had to go on would be: "She is described as a "female Cyborg". What this commet meant was not verified." Just saying "they have a female version of cyborg" isn't bad, per se, but does leave something to be desired. And I did not imply vandalism. "Reverted edits by" implies vandalism. The constructive criticism I gave, combined with the fact that I didn't outright remove the section should indicate that I acknowledge your work. Oh and BTW, this was...what? Two weeks ago? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a> 21:00, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn't view it until yesterday, hence why I responded now. I know you aren't implying vandalism, but the way your tone was, you might as well implied it. You could have just said <b>Please try to be more specific next time</b> as opposed to <b>What would that even mean? Cyborgirl? Cygirl? Cyborg sex change?</b> Sometimes I think you like it when someone makes a mistake/error on wikipedia just so you can rub it in their faces. Now, when I correct someone's mistake (misspelling, leaving out a punctuation mark, etc) I don't crap on them about it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.115.236.171 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.115.236.171.html" title="User talk:71.115.236.171">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.115.236.171_510b.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.115.236.171">contribs</a>).</small></li>
</ul>
<p>I should hope you wouldn't defecate on someone for a simple mistake. Then again, not everyone would take offense to that. Anyway, I hope that's not how I made you feel. After all, you're my fellow wikipedian (errors and strange punishment pratices aside). My summaries aren't always...standard pratice, but you got my point, right? Besides, had I said the other thing, I have a sneaking suspicion you would have still said something like, "Don't be so harsh. I was working with limited information". No offense or anything, I just get the feeling you're hard to please. My summaries are meant to relate the work I've done in my own words. I just cannot be expected to phrase things exactly as you would like them. And quite frankly, I don't get anything like "the user is a vandal" off my summary. Is someone bothering you? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a> 21:40, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I just meant that the criticism tone came off like the kind you would use for somebody being a vandal or spammer. I occasionally take things a bit more personal, but I suppose I did over react in this case.</li>

<p>I changed the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_quo.html" title="Status quo">status quo</a>. I don't recommend ir, but that was the necessary course of action. You linked to "stature" which used to refer to a comic book character. Since I couldn't tell which one you really meant to link to, I just added the new name. Sorry if it was an unwanted addition. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a> 19:33, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disambiguating Octopussy</span></h2>
<p>I do not believe Octopussy needs to be disambiguated in its title. This can be easily achieved by adding a disambig notice to the top of its article, which is already present. Most of the links going to <i>Octopussy</i> are for the film. There is no confusion there. "Ask yourself: When a reader enters this term and pushes "Go", what article would they realistically be expecting to view as a result?" (<a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">WP:Disambig</a>) - clearly the film. There's the chance they may be looking for the short story, but that too is listed at the top and all of the relevant articles to that point correctly. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 20:51, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The character, the term of endearment for octopi. Believe me, I don't do this sort of thing for my health. It's a pain in the next, but the movie isn't the most common link. Looking at what links to "Octopussy", I see that. I'd rather not change the status quo, but it's necessary. Oh and please don't bother trying to mention disambiguation policies to me. If those were followed from the get go, things would either be listed the way I'm aiming for or a "Octopussy (disambiguation)" would have been made. Now, if you'll excuse meh...<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a> 20:56, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uhh, you didn't discuss it or attempt to gain any sort of consensus to do it in the first place - what you did even goes against Wikipedia's guidelines. If you're adamant about starting a disambiguation page, such as <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octopussy_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Octopussy (disambiguation)">Octopussy (disambiguation)</a>, then see {{<a href="../../../o/t/h/Template%7EOtheruses_bbf8.html" title="Template:Otheruses">otheruses</a>}}.

<dd>Sure. You want it done, right? Besides, you wouldn't believe how often stuff like that is done, anyway. I remember when I single-handedly changed the status quo with <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stature.html" title="Stature">Stature</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stature_%28comics%29.html" title="Stature (comics)">Stature (comics)</a>. Sometimes, you just have to take the bull by the horns. Also, between you and me, discussions hold up neccessary edits more often than they bring them about. I remember when I myself held up the "Thor (comics)" disambiguation debate. I didn't realize at the time how wrong I was, but I digress. Whether it's an someone trying to keep things as they are or a lazy/thoughtless/careless community who simply ignore your proprositions, I've found that actions speal louder thn words.

<p>I've resolved the problem with the copyright tainted revisions so there is no reason to protect the page now. I have to say, I don't think the editing was that bad on the article, and am surprised you would classify the frequency on a par with an edit war. Edit wars tend to see vast numbers of edits within the space of an hour, not six or seven edits over 5 or 6 days. Still, the problem is resolved. Also, you might want to rethink the number of userboxes on your user page, it took forever to load. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 13:07, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mature. You reverted my edits lazily rather than acknowledging I made some good changes. You could learn a thing or two from CovenantD, the guy who stood up for you. However, I'm not exactly as...soft...on vandalism. Furthermore, I see no point in trying to reason with a possible—notice, I could have said "known" or "confirmed"—vandal. In fact, I'll let you in on a little secret: actions speak louder than words. I'd gladly talk all of my (and, largely, Wikipedia's) problems out. Really, I would. However, if the results—or lack thereof—are any example, talking solves very few of the situations I face. At least, on Wikipedia, for the past few days, it has. Anyway, thanks for the warning which, as far as I can tell, is just for show and doesn't even refer to any specific incident. Ah well.

<dd>Actually, I saw some of your other edits and this is exactly the way you solve problems. You refer to other people's edits as "vandalism" if they edit something you don't agree with and then you put them down in some snide comment, which appears (though I may be wrong) to feed your need for attention. You could edit leave a comment on how and why you changed something, but instead you ridicule previous edits. "Talking solves very few situations" is a pretty poor response for someone with your history.

<p>Thanks for your concern, Steve-o. *Sniff* It helps. You're definitely one of the good Admins. Sorry I doubted you. You know what stresses me out? Warning vandals in excess, going to Admins and nothing happens. Heck, in general it seems like Admins suck—not offense—See {[User talk:SlimVirgin]]. That, my friend, can get stressful. Oh! And Admins who make irrelevent comments on talk pages. See <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETransformers_%282007_film%29_55a2.html" title="Talk:Transformers (2007 film)">Talk:Transformers (2007 film)</a>. It's not a big deal, though. I mean, every Admin was once a regular user. They're not so great, in general, either. Look at <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">ChrisGriswold</a>, the king of cleanup. Anyway, in general,—wow. I'm saying those two words a lot—this is how I am. It doesn't help that I'm finding less and less dependability within the community, but I'm dealing. I'll gladly work alone if I have to. Heck, I already am, aren't I?</p>

<dd>Seriously, you need to realise Wikipedia is a collaborative effort. I've advised you to tone down your edit summaries and show respect to fellow wikipedians. I suggest you follow that advice. The Wikipedian community values civility and respect highly, and users which disregard those policies, aren't really welcome. The Wikipedian project isn't somewhere people can attempt to work single handed. By it's very nature it is collaborative. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:26, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Don't you think you're overreacting? Think about it. How do you cite rumors? What? You link to a page that says "rumor has it"? That perpetuates the stereotype that any other site is more reliable that Wikipedia. I hate that, man. Besides, rumors can be wrong either way. Most people believe the afor mentioned stereotype and take everything here with a grain of salt. With this prefaced by "Rumors", even the village idiot should be able to think "Hey! This might be wrong." Now, if one wants to remove uncited rumors—even if they're valuable/relavent—be my guest. That's not what he did. The "citation needed" template is way overused. A person should be able to remove it without =citing a source as long as they have a good reason. Look at <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightwing.html" title="Nightwing">Nightwing</a>! <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">Talk to the Ace.</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ace_Class_Shadow_7799.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ace Class Shadow">See what I've edited.</a> 18:56, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not an over-reaction. You were offensive in an edit summary, which breaches policy. You should consider whether you over-reacted. Edit summaries are hard to remove, and using them to make attacks is viewed more seriously by some than making attacks on talk pages where they can be more easily removed from view. If you don't cite anything you add to Wikipedia in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, then other editors have the right to question it, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. If you can't cite it, then the verification policy advocates its removal. Again, you need to consider your own actions as well as those of others. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:26, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I disagree with your rational for putting the exact dates etc (one week and x days later...) in the Batwoman article, for two reasons. First, it doesn't matter to Kate. Secondly, adding in that much detail starts to nudge up on the line of <i>too much</i> detail. We're not supposed to be giving blow by blow recaps of comics (in fact, that would be possibly copyright vios), but a summary is certainly okay. Look at the <a href="../../../5/2/_/52_%28comics%29.html" title="52 (comics)">52 (comics)</a> article for an example of explaining it all without the weeks and days. Thanks for your edits, though, I didn't get the chance to pick up comics till today. Woot!

<dd>If time didn't matter, or was too much information, but would be ignoring it as they usually do. A year has gone by throughout the DCU and 52 takes place during it. The dates won't seem immediately important, but if this week's reference to "six weeks" is any example, time will be a feature. No offense, but by the logic you make use of, we should say "OYL" in articles, either. It's <a href="../../../t/m/i/TMI_d259.html" title="TMI">TMI</a>, right? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">Talk to the Ace.</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ace_Class_Shadow_7799.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ace Class Shadow">See what I've edited.</a> 23:24, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It also wasn't actually a year&#160;;) Bats was only gone about 10 months. A 'year' has gone by, but if we recount every event to the day, we're going to make all the articles longer than they need to be. Also, I don't think the in-reference to 'six weeks' is anything more than a media plot. Seriously, they made such a deal about 52 comics and each one going in 'real time', it's cool, and it's a nice schtick, but I don't see it as being all important such that <i>we</i> need to include it in every single article.

<dd>Technically, I only reverted twice. I also stated why and have been waited for the proof I requested above. I made a single revert of a GIPU's mistakes, followed by a revert of Inshanee's edits. Unless they are the same person, (which I would have never known/assumed,) that's only one revert par user in defense of what should be considered the better version. That's not edit warring, to my understanding. That is, unless you're willing to say the same of the edits made during that Thor copyvio situation. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">Talk to the Ace.</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ace_Class_Shadow_7799.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ace Class Shadow">See what I've edited.</a> 21:54, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Okay, You weren't as harsh as you could have been over the last 24 hours, which is a good thing, but come on...this warning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:201.121.16.226&amp;oldid=65095974" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:201.121.16.226&amp;oldid=65095974" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>?

I don't keep up with Batman, but I thought Jason Todd had turned evil? It's the first edits from that IP, cut some slack. I amended your warning to the standard {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest-n_7724.html" title="Template:Test-n">test-n</a>}}. I appreciate your efforts here, and I'm serious, if you want to insult anyone, feel free to insult me, on my user pages only. Blow off the steam that way.

<p>Steven, the user shows clear signs of bias. And no, Jason isn't "evil", despite what Fans might say. He's been written as possibly psychopathic, but that does not equal evil. I already explained that he's not evil to <a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/s/Talk%7EJason_Todd_5750.html" title="Talk:Jason Todd">Talk:Jason Todd</a>. However, she has an account and has proven to be reasonable. The user I warned is some rogue GIPU who obviously has a problem with these characters. Wikipedia isn't a soapbox and I'd rather just nip it in the bud. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">Talk to the Ace.</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ace_Class_Shadow_7799.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ace Class Shadow">See what I've edited.</a> 21:54, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, first up, my name is not Steven. Second, nope, you don't get to claim bias on anyone's perspective out of hand, see <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, least of all a user's first three edits, see <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. Third, your dismissal of GIPU's is not best practise, it leads you to dismiss edits and editors which are constructive. Many longstanding editors edit from an IP. They just do. Get over it. Third, what is a rogue GIPU, I don't see that term in <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. Fourth, nip it in the bud, but nicely: <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. Or should I start nipping you in the bud? Like I say, you want to blast someone, blast me. Everyone else, treat them like you would treat your own child.

<li>I couldn't load your user page, let alone read it. Besides, just because you don't have a child shouldn't stop you thinking about treating everyone as if they were your own child.

<p>The image licensing rationale are in place to ensure that Wikipedia does not infringe on the rights of any copyright holders.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dark Knight</span></h2>
<p>Depends on what you mean. There was a dispute as to what to call the page. Since there wasn't any other article named "The Dark Knight", and according to Wiki's guidelines for films, you do not need to have a "(film)" attached to the end. I thought that they were just trying to be stubborn and not accept the title. I didn't realize they had copied the page and created a "The Dark Knight (film)" article. They didn't move it, they just copied it and created a new one. When I went to the contributions of the anon that made "The Dark Knight" a disambiguous page I saw that he had also changed other pages to say "The Dark Knight (film)", so I clicked it and saw that it was the same page. So I left it as it was. I think it was just a bunch of miscommunication about which page should be used and what pages were already created.
