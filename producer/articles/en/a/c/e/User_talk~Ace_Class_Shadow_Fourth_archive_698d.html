<p>You have removed the reference to Hartlepool's monkey mayor from the discussion page of the Man of the Year (2006 film) article, and declared this reference "nonsense." Have you misunderstood something? It's a reference to the famous (in England) case of a football mascot winning a popular vote - which I mentioned as an interesting parallel to the film Man of the Year, in which this happens:</p>
<p>"When an offhand remark he makes prompts 6 million people to email their support, Dobbs decides to campaign for President. To nearly everyone's surprise, he is declared winner of the election."</p>
<p>What bit of this is nonsense? I'm just curious.</p>

<dd>It wasn't an apology. And your addition still isn't appropriate. Learn <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_3848.html" title="Wikipedia:How to edit">how to edit</a> where. Talk page comments should always be signed. Also, the whole "unlikely candidate wins" thing is common now. I remember <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Murphy_7d8e.html" title="Eddie Murphy">Eddie Murphy</a> was in a movie with that as theme. Anyway, thanks but no thanks. Don't add unsigned "see also" sections to talk pages, (especially archived ones,) and don't add it to the actual article, either. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 21:00, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, it's not that easy getting the hang of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> conventions. I was only just trying to help out by pointing people at a piece of information that I thought was interesting and relevant to the matter in hand: "unlikely candidate wins". Because it was slightly more relevant than that, I thought, but never mind. I was interested to know about the <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Murphy_7d8e.html" title="Eddie Murphy">Eddie Murphy</a> movie you mention. There may be an interesting connection to be made (?) but I don't know where I would go about making it. Any advice? thanks 81.130.215.14 16:28, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, they're not the "exact" same show, but several things are the same between them. The show name "Late Night", the timeslot 12:35 following "The Tonight Show" and it's in the same studio.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ant-Man</span></h2>
<p>I have a question about a comic book character. I wanted to merge <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto_%28film%29.html" title="Magneto (film)">Magneto (film)</a> into <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto_%28comics%29.html" title="Magneto (comics)">Magneto (comics)</a> as there's really no news about any kind of development. I planned to do the same with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ant-Man_%28film%29_88b8.html" title="Ant-Man (film)">Ant-Man (film)</a>, which was announced at Comic-Con with not very many details, but there's no actual <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ant-Man_%28comics%29_c10e.html" title="Ant-Man (comics)">Ant-Man (comics)</a>, just a redirect to a so-called disambiguation page that doesn't seem like it needs to be like that. Shouldn't the page at least summarize each Ant-Man incarnation and link to the main articles (<a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Pym_4cd4.html" title="Henry Pym">Henry Pym</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Lang_7444.html" title="Scott Lang">Scott Lang</a>, etc.), and that would allow room for an Adaptation section (with a Film subsection) to merge the Ant-Man film information into?

You and the others are all independent editors with histories (especially superhero-based) that predate this nomination, and this was a pretty clear-cut case.

<p>Shows that air after the SUPERBOWL (SB) have been known to increase their audience by at least 50% in viewers. That's a large increase if you ask me. Many producers hope that their shows air after the BOWL. X-Files highest reated ep was 23 million (aired after SB); Family Guy got about 20 million (aired after SB); The Practice got 23.1 (aired after SB). MANY shows highest rated ep was b/c of their post-SB time slot.<small>âThe preceding <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a></i> comment was added by Yrgh (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yrgh_378e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yrgh">contribs</a>) on 20:11, December 7, 2006 (UTC); <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">Please sign your posts</a>!</i></small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Stranger than Fiction, last names</span></h2>
<p>I added the links to the last names because the characters are clearly all named after famous men of science, and I found that to be an interesting little fact, possibly useful for analysis of the film. If you check IMDB you will see that there is also a Dr. <a href="../../../g/%C3%B6/s/G%C3%B6sta_Mittag-Leffler_e526.html" title="GÃ¶sta Mittag-Leffler">Mittag-Leffler</a> and Dr. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Cayley_9a49.html" title="Arthur Cayley">Cayly</a> (sp). It's perhaps an observation more fit to be mentioned as "trivia", but it should be there, I feel. Should I start a trivia section perhaps? Thoughts?</p>
<p>A comment on reverts...Personally it doesn't phase me, but you should know that a lot people take reverts very personally, and I have been persuaded to feel that they should be used almost only in cases of vandalism, talking is always better, and if one feel that one must revert, one should always make a talk comment to the person.

<p>Care to offer a reason why you removed this from the article? It was added because the article is used as a destination for bothe the character an the book. Without the tenant of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a>, an assumption could be made that you are engaging in vandalism by blanking information. â <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 15:28, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can appreciate concerns about page clutter, but using the positions of the "edit" links seems a bit of a stretch. By that logic the infoboxes should stop where the first section edit occurs and the {{-}} after most, if not all, right justified images. Even as the article is right now, between 1 on 3 of the "edit" links, depending on monitor resolution and font size, don't hit the right side of the page. Does this mean the character box should go as well?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for "vital data"... It did contain reference to the 2Â½ years the book ran, and it allowed for the inclusion of creative staff that worked directly on that book and linkage to other characters associated with the title. And it did this without the need to go to an outside source. Granted, the external link added at the same time as the box can fill the same role, but that brings up a question of what goes into the article and what falls under "Go look it up yourself."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And last, I phrased the comment about faith and the "v" word specifically because 1) I know you're along time contributor who does a lot of good and 2) you have the bad habit of not using the edit summary. There is strong reason to believe that the edits you make are well reasoned, but without that the actions can look like blanking if they aren't explained. Without that summary for explanation, someone looking at the edit either has to guess why you made it, has to think like you, or has to assume the worst. I went with what seemed like a reasonable route, ask and state in what I thought was an appropriate manner why I was asking. I will apologize that the why wasn't as clear as it could have been, but not for the word choice. â <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 18:28, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're drawing unverified conclusions, Josi. It's like the ChrisGriswold "idiot" thing. An edit summary, let alone nothing be a subjective analysis of it, generally shouldn't be grounds for any sort of punitive measures. Block (and/or <i>threaten</i>) vandals, not valued users. Also, if no one can disagree with Elonka, what's the point of anything you did? Wouldn't that make even the arbitration invalid somehow?

<dd>Yes, you did misunderstand me if you thought I was saying that no one can <i>disagree</i> with Elonka.

Or, to put it another way, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/don%27t_be_a_dick" class="extiw" title="meta:don't_be_a_dick">don't be a dick</a>. I'd like to draw your attention specifically to this paragraph in that essay:
<blockquote>
<p>Being right about an issue does not mean you're not being a dick. Dicks can be right â but they're still dicks; and, if there's something in what they say that is worth hearing, it goes unheard, because no one likes listening to dicks, no matter how right they are.</p>

<dd>Although Ace's temperment has been the subject of tlak numerous times, I can find nothing in the last 48 hours to prompt such a warning. Before that, there was a long talk about why the fanboy site Heroes Wiki shouldn't be linked to, in which some people continued to argue that linking to crap was good. Ace got frustrated. Who can blame him? I did too. Befoe that, we're into December. He's been getting better.

<dd>ACS has loads of questionable edit summaries. If that's the best you can find, you're wasting everyone's time. With almost no work at all, I found these edit summary gems on the first page of your contribution history: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Top_Chef&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98201638" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Top_Chef&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98201638" rel="nofollow">[8]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimineverdies&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97310596" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimineverdies&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97310596" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. The second edit overall is the nicest example of a personal attack and a <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> violation that I have seen in a long time. And I see the poor recipient of that attack has not edited since - I hope you're proud. â<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 18:35, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First off I am not trying to hunt down all of ACS' questionable moves, because I would probably grow old and gray by the time I found them all. I just provided a direct link to something I took offense too. As for the edit summaries you provided the first one was someone using different IP's to re-add the same POV statement over and over, breaking 3RR in the process. The Second edit is a friend, poking fun at his first few contributions. He hasn't edited since because he is extremely busy. I do not have the type of record ACS has. 00:51, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, sorry if I neglected to provide a citation for my sourses, but I don't know how to. But remember that plot section chat in the discussion page? It showed a link which says Sandman and Venom are allied, as well as the New Goblin. Well, actually, I don't think it included the New Goblin, but yeah, that's what I found. Also, it said on a very well designed webpage(not those fan-made Angelfire websites) which said Sandman wanted Peter's forgiveness more than anything.
