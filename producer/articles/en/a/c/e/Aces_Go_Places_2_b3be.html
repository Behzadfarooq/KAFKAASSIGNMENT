<p>Sam Hui, as King Kong and his friend Albert, a police officer who was noted for his bald head. The duo encountered several notable events in the show as they were being chased by mafias who intended to kill them.</p>
<p>The following summarises some of the notable scenes in the movie chronologically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Albert's marriage with superintendent Nancy Ho in a church met up with several catastrophes.</li>
<li>King Kong hid in Albert's flat under his direction, without the knowledge of Nancy. He was half-naked from the chest. As Nancy returned home, Albert hid King Kong in the bathroom tub, and excused himself to the bathroom under his wife survelliance. A scene showed him scrubbing himself with a sucker, clothes on. Albert realised his error and sucked the shower instead. After his wife left the bathroom, Albert gave instructions to King Kong to flee. Albert then left the bathroom, and Nancy immediately went into the bathroom to bathe. Albert was terrified upon learning his error of leaving the bathroom without King Kong, and told Nancy not to strip and bathe. As Nancy unbuttoned two of her buttons, she screamed as she saw King Kong hiding in the bathtub. Nancy scolded Albert for the ordeal, and Albert asked King Kong if he had saw Nacy strip. King Kong replied that he saw Nancy unbuttoned two buttons, but added on that she unbuttoned two sleeve buttons when Albert got furious upon hearing the news.</li>
<li>Albert was also seen drawing out a gun to threaten to kill King Kong for the satisfaction of his wife.</li>
<li>King Kong was seen leaving the house with a sad face, and Albert followed him, saying that friends must help each other whenever they are in need. As they closed the door, they laughed to themselves on Nancy's lone plight. The duo later re-entered the house, and Nancy left. King Kong took off his towel and revealed his swimming trunks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On one occasion, King Kong was eating in a fast food restaurant when he suddenly noticed his enemy and his men who were about to catch him. King Kong tried to hide his face with a newspaper, but it was too late. Suddenly, a man (<a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsui_Hark_8660.html" title="Tsui Hark">Tsui Hark</a>), simply known as the FBI spoke out to him from the opposite seat and confided him that the FBI would come in five minutes to arrest the men who were pursuing King Kong. FBI furthered his claim by saying that he is a FBI agent. King Kong, being delighted, boldly walked up to the rival and told them that the FBI would come and arrest them, and took away his enemy's cigar as he said. The "FBI" later turned up, but it turned out to be paramedics from the mental hospital who took FBI off. King Kong looked bewildered.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Albert and King Kong were instigated by King Kong's newfound Eurasian girlfriend (Valentino) to rob the diamonds in a bank. Albert showed his local police and Interpol warrant cards to pass himself and his friends to gain access to the second floor, the bank's reserves. The friends appeared rather afraid, and let King Kong and his girlfriend enter the office first, under the survelliance of the police doorman.</li>
<li>As King Kong waited for their turn, he waved his hand backwards and slapped Albert so hard that he rolled down the stairs. He climbed back up the stairs, bruised, and questioned King Kong.</li>
<li>King Kong's girlfriend gang raped the secetary inside the office, and ran out of the office. Both King Kong and Albert saw the secetary gagged up, trying to scream for help. They ran off, and the doorman looked rather suspicious on their odd behaviour and went inside the office. He gave the signal.</li>
<li>King Kong and Albert ran down the steps and out of the bank to chase King Kong's girlfriend. As they passed, Albert put up a hard stance to show his position as a policeman but King Kong pulled him off.</li>
<li>King Kong and Albert saw King's Eurasian girlfriend without waiting for them, and revealed her trap. The duo then ran off upon seeing the police. They ran to back lanes, and into a dead end road.</li>
<li>The duo suggested an escape plan using an unwanted wooden plank. King Kong intended to let Albert escape first, but jumped over the wall instead as Albert jumped onto the plank King Kong was standing on the lowered part. Albert than ran over to the raised part, but it lopsided. Albert called to King Kong for help, who replied that it was all up to him. The police found Albert, and ran past a police drill, thus accumulating an increasing number of police personnel chasing him. Albert then tried to grab the lorry's wooden enclousre during the escape, but it broke off as he tried to ascend onto the lorry. Albert called to the police as he thought that he was escaping, but ran as he noticed his error.</li>
<li>Albert ran into the police station, into the chief's officer, and locked his office door. The chief asked Albert for his plight, and Albert described that there were villains chasing after him.</li>
<li>The police personnel outside broke down the door and raised their guns against the police officer. Albert hid behind the chief, who also raised his gun in response to the "attack". The police fired a few shots at the police chief, one of which scrapped his cheek. He fell.</li>
<li>The police chief suspended Albert immediately after the ordeal, and demanded him to hand over his police warrant cards and whistle. The police chief blew the whistle as Albert left, but swallowed it down into his throat. The police chief tried to call Albert as he walked off, but his call only ended up in the whistle. He dismissed Albert, and called for other officers, who thought that he was blowing his whistle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Albert was watched by the mafias as he put on his sunglasses outside the police station.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Albert and King Kong were chased by the mafias. They robbed a stranger's car by tricking that his boss had called for him. The duo started off the stranger's car, leaving him screaming at the top of his voice. The car, a yellow hartop coupe car, had a number plate "XX 10".</li>
<li>The mafias who owned five red similar, hardtop coupe cars with the number plates "BG 1" to "5", chased the couple. They raced up to his car, and surrounded XX10. XX10 swerved, and banged onto the back part of a tanker. One of the cars raced up the hill and fell back due to steep inclination, upside down. The other mafias got off their car as they approached XX10. XX10 reversed, and in doing so, they broke the gearstick. The mafias chased XX10, around the streets, and banging onto street vendors wherever they go. They missed another accident from an oncoming lorry to the BGs in another scenarios. Two of the BGs survived as they lifted up their cars as the lorry approached them. One of the cars travelled with the front wheels raised at 50 degrees for a short interval before travelling on all fours.</li>
<li>They swerved at a road junction, and travelled forward but went in the opposing direction of oncoming cars. The car split into two as they banged onto a lampost. The two parts of the cars rolled on as King Kong and Albert discussed two ways for Albert's escape: One, jump back onto his car, two jump onto an oncoming vehicle, Albert jumped off, and off onto a lorry. As the BGs surrounded XX10 onto a piece of marshland off the mainroad, they banged onto XX10, leaving King Kong holding the steering wheel. The mafias then pointed a gun at King Kong's head, and he surrendered.</li>
<li>King Kong was then led to the mafias' hideout, and the boss explained his motive of kidnapping him; his brother was killed by him several years back.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>King Kong, Albert and Nancy chased their enemies to a tanker. King Kong and Albert entered a storeroom, and they were trapped by their rival with steel bolts. A silver table unfolds itself automatically from the ground. The rival appeared on screen, and asked them for the final time if they are willing to cooperate with him. Albert and King Kong refused and a black robot appeared. King Kong placed his white kit on the ground, both Albert and King Kong took out their helmets and a remote control for operating the robot.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As the rival robot fired the first missile, King Kong did the same, and both missiles headed each other and exploded in mid-air. Albert appeared very happy, and offered to try the joystick, but King Kong pushed him back. A second missile was fired (by the black robot) and hit Albert's helmet. Another missile was fired to destroy the robot, but King Kong managed to retract it back just in time before opening it out again.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The robots fought, until the black robot temporarily retires. Albert gave a great cheer as he thought that it was dead. King Kong revealed new robots and told their names as the came onto the battle scene.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Small robots used to fight the enemy's robot are named "Ant", "Hero", "Godzilla", etc. They sabotaged the enemies robot by damaging its electronic system. Others were hit by the black robot's laser fire. Both King Kong and Albert won the fight. A surviving robot gave a final blow to the black robot, and blasted an opening for Albert and King Kong to escape. Together with Nancy, the dup escaped from the ship. The ship blew up as they were heading for the port.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The trio later fought with their arch rival using a futuristic, batman-like vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The show ends with the police chief and the psychopath walked off marching, <i>"Bee Bo Bee Bo Bee Bo..."</i>, imitating the sound of the police siren as Nancy, Albert and King Kong looks on.</li>
