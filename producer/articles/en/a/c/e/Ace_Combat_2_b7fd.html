<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_2_b7fd.html" title="Edit section: Gameplay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gameplay</span></h2>
<p><i>Ace Combat 2'</i>s gameplay is very similar to Air Combat (its predecessor) however, <i>AC2</i> has considerably improved graphics (both the planes and environment) and detailed features such as: moving flaps, air-brakes and afterburner effects. One new feature is the ability to find (and shoot down) enemy Ace planes; doing so will result in the player being rewarded with a medal of the defeated Ace, that can be viewed in the games medal viewer. Also the player can unlock "extra" aircraft for subsequent replays. One more interesting feature is the branching story paths; basically two sets of missions split between Operations "A"lphaville" and "B"ellissima" they each contain unique missions and both branches lead to mission 19. (Jewel Box)</p>
<p><i>Ace Combat 2</i> also features realistic <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_fight.html" title="Dog fight">dog fights</a>, total <a href="../../../3/d/_/3D_computer_graphics_c308.html" title="3D computer graphics">3D</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygon.html" title="Polygon">polygons</a>, advanced artificial intelligence, dynamic mission debriefings, secret planes and hidden missions.</p>
<p>The game uses several elements that are still used in other <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_626c.html" title="Ace Combat">Ace Combat</a> games. There is the ability for the camera to focus on the last target that was destroyed, and also the ability to give wingmen orders.</p>
<p>There are numerous enemy Aces that the player can find and shoot down. While many of the normal pilots are Aces, the legendary pilots are the best forces that can be fought. They are distinguished from ordinary pilots by being named, and having a distinctive paint on their fighter. The legendary pilots all have different behaviours than other ones, and some of them work in a squadron. Shooting down a legendary pilot or the legendary squadron will earn the player a medal.</p>
<p>There are 3 different endings for the player to experience; a "normal" ending, a "bad" ending, and a secret "Bonus" ending. The player's actions during the game will decide what ending the player sees.</p>

<p><i>Ace Combat 2</i> features twice the amount of planes to choose from than its predecessor; each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The player can fly various types of aircraft, ranging from the <a href="../../../f/-/4/F-4_Phantom_II_3f6f.html" title="F-4 Phantom II">F-4 Phantom</a>, <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-14_Tomcat_c28a.html" title="F-14 Tomcat">F-14 Tomcat</a>, <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-117_Nighthawk_92ab.html" title="F-117 Nighthawk">F-117 Nighthawk</a>, <a href="../../../a/-/1/A-10_Thunderbolt_II_4496.html" title="A-10 Thunderbolt II">A-10 Thunderbolt II</a>, the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikoyan_MiG-29_d6fe.html" title="Mikoyan MiG-29">MiG-29</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/k/Sukhoi_Su-35_e50d.html" title="Sukhoi Su-35">Su-35</a>, <a href="../../../f/-/2/F-22_Raptor_e789.html" title="F-22 Raptor">YF-22</a> as well as other types, The ultimate aircraft in the game is the <a href="../../../x/f/a/XFA-27_Stealth_Fighter_f363.html" title="XFA-27 Stealth Fighter">XFA-27 Stealth Fighter</a>.</p>
<p>The aircraft are split into two categories: normal and extra. once the game has been beat once, the extra aircraft are unlocked and the player has the option of playing the game over with these new aircraft. These include the Mikoyan MiG-21, Sukhoi SU-25, SF-35 (Saab Draken), and the XFA-27. Normal aircraft include the ones mentioned in the above paragraph, with the exception of the XFA-27. Some aircraft are accessible in both normal and extra aircraft.</p>

<p><b>Fortress Intolerance</b></p>
<p>The Intolerance was a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortification.html" title="Fortification">fortification</a> in the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playstation_1.html" title="Playstation 1">Playstation 1</a> game Ace Combat 2, built in North Point. It was used by the Usean Rebel Forces in the war at that time. After both of their Extra Powerful Cruise Missile carrying <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine.html" title="Submarine">submarines</a>, the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragonet_1_%26_2.html" title="Dragonet 1 &amp; 2">Dragonet 1 &amp; 2</a>, were destroyed, the rebels had still one EPCM left in the Intolerance. This is why it is often counted as a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superweapon.html" title="Superweapon">superweapon</a> along with both of the giant submarines. After the battle at St. Ark, the rebel forces retreated to the fortress.</p>
<p>The fortress bears a strong resemblance to Megalith, a superweapon in <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_4_f5a9.html" title="Ace Combat 4">Ace Combat 4</a>. In fact, Megalith is on the island that you start AC2 in, while Intolerance is at North Point, where you begin AC4. The fortress has two power plants guarded by SAM's(<a href="../../../s/u/r/Surface-to-air_missile.html" title="Surface-to-air missile">Surface-to-air missile</a>) and tanks, while around the main hill the Intolerance is built on are more SAM's, small forts and a small runway. The fortress has an extreme arsenal of <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-15.html" title="F-15">F-15</a>'s in stock, and also has the Z.O.E. General, a pilot ace, flying in a common super plane in the AC series, the <a href="../../../a/d/f/ADF-01_e63c.html" title="ADF-01">ADF-01</a>. Inside the fortress itself is of course the gigantic <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruise_missile.html" title="Cruise missile">cruise missile</a> readying for launch. The players character in the game, "Scarface 1", is sent to destroy the Intolerance. After clearing out the tanks around the power plants, friendly forces are able to open a heat vent door in the Intolerance, which has just enough room for Scarface 1 to fly in and blow up the missile. After this is done, all the enemy forces are eliminated by a chain reaction of explosions.</p>
<p><b>Dragonet 1 and 2</b></p>
<p>The Dragonet class <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine.html" title="Submarine">submarines</a> (ancestors of the <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yuktobania.html" title="Yuktobania">Yuktobanian</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scinfaxi.html" title="Scinfaxi">Scinfaxi</a> class submarine in the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playstation_2.html" title="Playstation 2">Playstation 2</a>'s <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_5_a1cd.html" title="Ace Combat 5">Ace Combat 5</a>) were two <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superweapon.html" title="Superweapon">superweapons</a> in the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playstation_1.html" title="Playstation 1">Playstation 1</a> game Ace Combat 2. These submarines were huge, and they both carried one Extra Powerful Cruise Missile, just like the one in the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortress_Intolerance_605e.html" title="Fortress Intolerance">Fortress Intolerance</a>, another superweapon in the game. They were used by the Usean Rebel Forces in the war at that time.</p>
<p>Both submarines were armed with machine guns and SAM's (<a href="../../../s/u/r/Surface-to-air_missile.html" title="Surface-to-air missile">Surface-to-air missile</a>), and one EPCM. The Dragonet 1 was stationed in a submarine base on the south-eastern coast of the Usean/Erusian continent. It had very little to do in the war, as the players character "Scarface 1" destroyed it when he made a secret raid into the base, just as the Dragonet was leaving.</p>
<p>It is not known where the Dragonet 2 was built, possibly in the same submarine base, but as it arrived in the last stages of the war to the city of St. Ark, the city was already under siege of governmental forces. It proceeded to dive into the sea and left quickly to escape to the Fortress Intolerance, located in North Point. Just before it had managed to get on to the surface, it was detected and Scarface 1 was scrambled to the location. After a fierce fight, Scarface manages to hit the submarine fatally. All seems well until the last act of the now sinking sub is to launch its <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruise_missile.html" title="Cruise missile">cruise missile</a> at St. Ark, possibly hoping to eliminate any friendly forces left there. Scarface 1 proceeds to catch up with it. It is difficult as Scarface can't lock on to the target with his own missiles, but he manages to destroy the missile with his machine gun. Thus ends the terror of the Dragonet class submarines.</p>
