<p>Please read the Talk page before re-inserting Edits, and please comment on why you made those edits. I removed pre-Crisis from instances of "Pre-Crisis Earth Two" in Batman's statitstics panel because it was already HUGE, and because earth-two is by definition pre-crisis.

<p>The general consensus throughout the comic books entries is that same-name characters are presented chronologically. The very popular motorcyle-riding <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_Rider_fe79.html" title="Ghost Rider">Ghost Rider</a>, for example, does not precede the Western hero named Ghost Rider. Chronological logic is one of the basic tenets of encyclopedic writing, which is different from popular-press magazine writing. To return to encyclopedic form, we're revising the Lobo entry to its previous outline. Don't sweat it — there are lots of stylistic things in both Wiki in general and the Comics Portal community in specific. I've been doing this for more than six months and I learn some new technique or bit of etiquette still! — <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 19:59, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I like the work you've done helping clean up the <i>Infinite Crisis</i> page. Your reason for moving Air Wave to the Dead column made sense. However, whoever originally noted why he might be alive was wrong. The reason his death is debatable is not because he might have gone to Earth-2 (because he couldn't have, as you so accurately pointed out) but because dispersing a character of his nature in a million directions is unlikely to destroy him. In comics, any character like that will eventually reintegrate. That's always how it goes. This isn't a criticism. I just wanted to make sure you know that when I undid your change, it was not an arbitrary dislike of someone's edits.</p>
<p>Again, great work on all those other edits, Ace.<a href="../../../w/r/y/User%7EWryspy_d7ae.html" title="User:Wryspy">Wryspy</a> 07:09, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Glad we got everything straight, I had just copied Superman's family on to Cir-El's family, and in retrospect, you were right, those were way too many relatives for a genetically altered "daughter" of Superman. 204.116.172.145 02:26, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Kyle asks where they all went, it's pretty obvious that Kilowog, Kyle, and Hawkman are the only ones that didn't disappear. Even if you want to be skeptical about that point, we know at the very least that Starfire, Cyborg, and Hawkgirl are gone from Teen Titans OYL (for the first two) and Hawkman's line in IC for the last. I have no idea where you've seen any of those people in 52, but even if they do appear, they are currently missing as of Infinite Crisis. --<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocketgoat_8f80.html" title="User:Rocketgoat">Rocketgoat</a> 18:41, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As last editor, I'm mildly irked you weren't more clear in directing that snipey last edit comment to Chrisgriswold, who did the editing in question. Further, I think his purpose was mostly, by looking at it, Alpha by surname reorganization. That's a reasonable system for organizing lists.

<p>Hi -- I noticed your recent edit summery in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>. If my understanding is correct, unlike Superman and Wonder Woman, Batman's chronology was not restarted after Crisis, and the canon-ity Golden and Silver age stories are taken on a 'burn that bridge when we cross it' basis. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 21:59, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding your Infinite Crisis edit about Amos Fortune, I think that JSA Classified is designed to tie in to the JLA classified story, and both are set PRE-Crisis. Even if it's not, please remember that the IC article refers to the context of IC, and the talk page has multiple editors asking editors to focus on perception within the context of IC. It's been remarked that if we erase villians every time one's brought back from the dead, replaced, or otherwise returns to an active status, eventually the article would be empty, and pointless. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 03:45, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I undid your review on SHB; my edit summaries were unclear, but I fixed the glitch that was breaking <i>alter_ego</i>. The last touch was that last edit to fix a certain slim set of cases where the entire block wouldn't appear if certain parameters weren't used.

<p>I was not the one who put in this line but it seems relevant as one of his weaknesses: "In <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_Batman_f8cb.html" title="Superman/Batman">Superman/Batman</a></i> #8-13, he is willing to do whatever is "necessary" to destroy evil, including destroying an entire world of inhabitants." Furthermore... I think Wayne Enterprises HAVE caused much harm by the super-villains they've created such as The Joker, Clayface, etc. In the movie "Batman Begins" Bruce Wayne is thrown in prison for stealing food -- whcih is even more condemnation of his corporate culture. Poison Ivy is also very critical of the environmental devesttion caused by Wayne Enterprises (which is rather directly guided by Bruce Wayne).</p>

<dd>Oh, I see. I agree with you there. In fact, the inclusion of that sentence was suggested (in archived talk page discussion) by me and another editor as a compromise between his desire to include an entire paragraph about the "Batman as anti-hero" interpretation being prevalent, and my desire to erase any reference to Batman as an anti-hero (as it invokes POV, since the word "anti-hero" means "a protagonist with qualities not normally found in characters who the audience sympathizes with", rather than "a violent or otherwise unconventional hero", as many people commonly assume). --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 23:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tolkien's legendarium was much more about Middle-earth, and Middle-earth was not the only place in which many crucial events in his legendarium took place (just as <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> was not his only important work that illustrated the history of <a href="../../../a/r/d/Arda.html" title="Arda">Arda</a>; <i>The Silmarillion</i> really serves as the backbone of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>The Hobbit</i>, and the first half of the book takes place in <a href="../../../a/m/a/Aman.html" title="Aman">Aman</a>, which constantly plays crucial roles throughout the second half). <a href="../../../n/%C3%BA/m/N%C3%BAmenor.html" title="Númenor">Númenor</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/a/Aman.html" title="Aman">Aman</a> (<a href="../../../v/a/l/Valinor.html" title="Valinor">Valinor</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tirion.html" title="Tirion">Tirion</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formenos.html" title="Formenos">Formenos</a> — the Valar, who were pivotal players in the First Age of <a href="../../../a/r/d/Arda.html" title="Arda">Arda</a>, dwelled in <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valinor.html" title="Valinor">Valinor</a>, which is outside of Middle-earth). The Middle-earth title is a little misleading and in that matter, because many material goes beyond the boundaries of Middle-earth — that is why the word 'Middle-earth' is omitted.</p>
<p>Generally, Middle-earth is most commonly associated to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>The Hobbit</i>, and Arda or a plain 'legendarium' without the Middle-earth encompasses other works and places that are crucial to the history of <a href="../../../a/r/d/Arda.html" title="Arda">Arda</a> (e.g. <i>The Silmarillion</i>). The most respected encyclopedia for information related to Tolkien's legendarium is the <a href="http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/" class="external text" title="http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia of Arda</a> (we had some Tolkienites come up to us and point out that a reliable encyclopedia was already created and there was no need to build up more information in Wikipedia &gt;_&lt;), and note that it is called the Encyclopedia of <i>Arda</i>, not <i>Middle-earth</i>.</p>

<li>Fictional universe: <a href="../../../e/%C3%A4/_/E%C3%A4.html" title="Eä">Eä</a> (<a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe.html" title="Universe">Universe</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milky_Way_7069.html" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>; Tolkien didn't really distinguish between the two in relations from Eä to the real world)

<p>I know that many of Tolkien's articles state 'the fictional universe of Middle-earth', but it's deceiving (and oversimplifies facts) and we should be working to clear the matter up. A lot of the articles related to Tolkien's legendarium need to conform to the Standards; however, there are few actively involved in the WikiProject to actually bring Tolkien related articles to encyclopedic standards. However, I will keep the Middle-earth temporarily until a discussion takes place, because I don't think there has been a clear consensus on this; so thanks for bringing it up to my attention. <tt>:)</tt> —<b><a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirlen_c835.html" title="User:Mirlen"><font color="coral">Mir</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirlen_289b.html" title="User talk:Mirlen"><font color="darkorange"><span style="cursor:help">l</span></font></a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirlen_EA_ae3a.html" title="User:Mirlen/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirlen_289b.html" title="User talk:Mirlen"><font color="darkorange"><span style="cursor:help">n</span></font></a></b> 02:06, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am very familiar with the points you are presenting, Mirlen. In fact, had I enough time and/or motivation, I would call for every single reference in Wikipedia to "Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth" to be changed to "Tolkien's fictional world of Arda", and for the "Middle-earth" article to be deposed from its position as the "flagship" legendarium article in favor of the "Arda" article. I added the word "Middle-earth" to the template so users could use it to access the main article about the legendarium in adittion to being able to use it to access the articles about the works which build the legendarium (even if I disagree about the location of the former). --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 03:21, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I appreciate the seemingly good faith and clarification,—I did have a feeling—it would be better to make a note on the articles talk page. Consider these questions the next time you're tempted to leave a note elsewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was this a single content disputing revert?</li>
<li>Was no indication of vandalism?</li>
<li>Would a talk page comment be answered?</li>
<li>Has the user made substaniel edits before yours?</li>
</ul>
<p>If it's mostly "yeses" chances are that person might just be reasonable and respond civilly to a talk page comment. Editting can be confusing and people can make mistakes. Best not to worsen the situation with clutter to their talk page, if you can help it. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 18:39, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

The fact of the matter is that the InterAmerican Fundamentalist Society is not a reliable secondary source of the type a footnote can be attributed to (as they make no attempt to disguise the fact they ascribe to fundamentalism), nor does a list compiled by a very specific group of Evangelical individuals belong to an article which aspires to list more general Abrahamic/Dharmic/Pagan/Philosophical concepts of the Underworld/Hell. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 04:28, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've reverted your removal of Doc Magnus. IN the pre IC world, Magnus was the human inventor of the responsometer, which copied human mind patterns (or some such, it basically downloaded a perosn's persona and such into it's computer parts.) It was a sphere within the various Metal Men. After the death of his brother, whose mind was in Gold, Doc began to build a tougher Metal Man, named for some DC faked up metal, Viridian (note the paly on the name of the green color). At some point in that, there was an attempted theft, and the metal men downloaded Doc as he lay dying into a blank responsometer, and put him into Viridian. Post IC, Doc is human again, as a result of the time flux caused by Superboy-Prime. (See 52, I won't spoil anything you don't already know from your reading. Unless you ask me to.) As such, I've reverted. Itmight actually belong in a different subsection, but this is more than Cliff Steel's brain being dropping into a new chassis, it's a fundamental reversion of continuity. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 21:21, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ThuranX, Doc Magnus of the Metal Men wasn't the person who was listed as having died and subsequently removed from the list by me. It was Doc of the OMEGA Men, a robot which can (and has) been rebuilt more than one time. In other words, he can't "die" in any sense, much like Amazo or the Metal Men. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 21:42, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Why, exactly, is that paragraph an appropriate ending for the section? It reads like Wikipedia is including a disclaimer, something along the lines of "The views above do not represent those of DC Comics or its affiliates and are purely the product of noncanonical interpretations." I actually wondered, for a second, if Wikimedia had been threatened with a lawsuit if we didn't include such, but decided that that would be patently absurd (<a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> completely aside.) Wikipedia is a neutral source, and I feel that we would be far more neutral (and express the same point, which is that gay readings of Batman are not at all intended by the writers) by ending with the quote from that one writer about how no one (except possibly Shumacher) has ever written him gay. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESuntiger_1e08.html" title="User:Suntiger">Suntiger</a> 01:31, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that it reads a little bit like a disclaimer, but I also think that Alan Grant's statement is not enough to make it clear that no one has ever written him as a homosexual character, specially when the statement is followed by Devin Grayson's somewhat ambivalent opinion. I think that at least something resembling first sentence of the paragraph you removed (i.e.: "Batman creators have predominantly written him as a heterosexual individual") should remain in the article. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 04:14, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Your opinions on whether the article meets inclusion criteria and what should be done with the article are welcome; please participate in the discussion by adding your comments at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Justice_%28comics%29_37a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Justice (comics)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Justice (comics)</a> and please be sure to <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">sign your comments</a> with four tildes (~~~~). You may also edit the article during the discussion to improve it but should not remove the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">articles for deletion</a> template from the top of the article; such removal will not end the deletion debate. Thank you. <b>Please note:</b> This is an automatic notification by a <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">bot</a>.
