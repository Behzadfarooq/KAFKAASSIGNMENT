<b>Ace Lightning</b> is the main character of the television show, <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Lightning_c0ff.html" title="Ace Lightning">Ace Lightning</a>. A <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superhero</a> from a video game, Ace is like a cross between the heroic <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>. Like his name suggests, Ace can fire <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightning.html" title="Lightning">lightning</a> bolts from his wrist cannons in various forms.</p>

<li>Can launch the fiery attack from his wrist cannons sometimes called the Ring of Flame.</li>
<li>Can fire lightning from his wrist cannons in various forms, including electrical orbs, spears, and a lasso.</li>

<li>The Shield of Justice: The ultimate protection in the Lightning Knight weapons. It can absorb an attack and fire it back at a person. (Note: The Shield of Justice is a power up from the actual Ace Lightning video game, but in the game it only serves to render Ace temporarily invincible to harm)</li>
<li>A transciever: Ace uses this to stay in contact with Mark, Chuck and Sparx. It can lose its signal like radios.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Lightning_%28character%29_3aa0.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Ace is foremost of the Lightning Knights and leads the war against <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Fear_1f82.html" title="Lord Fear">Lord Fear</a> and his army of villains. Despite his powers and status, Ace is shown to be a bit klutzy and forgetful (two running gags in the first season involve Ace accidentally breaking things around Mark's house and constantly getting Mark's name wrong). Sometime before the events of the show, Ace battled against Lord Fear and crippled his right leg, presumably what made their enemies. Shortly before arriving on Earth, Ace managed to successfully imprison Lord Fear and his gang in chambers of pure energy (according to the yearbook). However, <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Illusion_220a.html" title="Lady Illusion">Lady Illusion</a> freed the villains and they stole the <a href="../../../a/m/u/Amulet_of_Zoar_9910.html" title="Amulet of Zoar">Amulet of Zoar</a>. A battled erupted over the Amulet but it was ultimately shattered to pieces. The destruction of the Amulet opened a portal to Earth which Lord Fear used to escape Ace. Ace followed and hried Mark Hollander as his sidekick. Shortly after his arrival on Earth, Ace was captured by Lord Fear but rescued by Mark.</p>
<p>Ace soon fell in love with Lady Illusion in secret but their relationship quickly ended when Lord Fear showed up looking for vengeance. Lord Fear summoned <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Villains_of_Ace_Lightning_60f8.html#Googler" title="Minor Villains of Ace Lightning">Googler</a> from White Hot Oblivion, Ace revealing he and Googler had a history together. Googler drained Ace of his superpowers, leaving him human. Ace disguised himself as a police officer using a disguise. He regained his powers back shortly afterwards. <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_Virus_%28Ace_Lightning%29_3c6d.html" title="Random Virus (Ace Lightning)">Random Virus</a> appeared soon and Ace had to care for him briefly. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparx_%28Ace_Lightning%29_df3f.html" title="Sparx (Ace Lightning)">Sparx</a> soon showed up and joined Ace, Mark quitting in the process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Googler's puppets zombified Ace and sent him to destroy Mark and Sparx. With help from Chuck, Ace was restored to normal. Sparx was later killed by Googler and sent back to the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixth_Dimension_4e55.html" title="Sixth Dimension">Sixth Dimension</a>. Ace and Mark were on their own again. During a downloading process, Ace was hit by a virus and frozen solid. Lady Illusion restored him to life with a kiss. Sparx was summoned back by Ace when he found another piece of the Amulet.</p>
<p>In the finale of Season 1, Lord Fear gained the Amulet and drained the Lightning Knights of their powers. Ace, Sparx and Random battled the villains at the Carnival of Doom but were beaten severely by them. Mark located the Amulet and shattered it, sending Lord Fear and his minions (except Lady Illusion).</p>
<p>In Season 2, Ace and Sparx decided to return home and take Random with them. Unfortunately, Random refused to. Mark deleted his game file and sucked Ace and Sparx back into the game, leaving Random and Lady Illusion stranded. Things got worse when Lord Fear returned somehow. Ace was summoned back to Earth by Chuck, leaving Sparx alone in the Sixth Dimension with Googler. Ace shortly afterwards gained an upgrade called the Ring of Flame. Kilobyte appeared and upgraded Lady Illusion, who gave Ace out-of-control human emotions, leaving him a wreck.</p>
<p>Ace grew to fear Kilobyte, and he couldn't control his anger (as demonstrated when he loses to Chuck in a table tennis match). Sparx soon returned to try and help Ace gain control of his emotions. Ace started to believe Kilobyte was being controlled by someone else (The Master Programmer). In the finale, Ace and Lord Fear joined forces to destroy Kilobyte. After taking out all of the minions, Lord Fear, Mark and Ace defeated Kilobyte. However, Lord Fear blasted Ace with a new attack but it was revealed this Ace was really Lady Illusion while the real Ace hid away. Lord Fear and Dirty Rat are chased off by Ace and Mark. Lady Illusion sadly dies in Ace's arms, Ace experiencing his first tear. In the cancelled Season 3, Ace was to venture into the game to save Lady Illusion, possibly releasing Kilobyte and Rick in the process.</p>
