<p>Looks like the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/upload/d/d9/Acetic-acid.png" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/upload/d/d9/Acetic-acid.png" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/upload/d/d9/Acetic-acid.png</a>" (acetic acid formula picture) needs another carbon atom.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>It's okay.</b> In organic structural formulas, symbols for carbon and attached hydrogens are usually omitted. That said, actually showing the CH3 on the left bond is not necessary. - (HS Chem Teacher)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the picture still needs to be changed though, as it is misleading for these reasons:
<ul>
<li>The hydrogen atom does not ionize by itself unless it is in an appropriate solvent, say, water. This should be indicated somewhere, perhaps this reaction with the solvent should be drawn explicitly in the diagram.</li>
<li>The diagram depicts the resonace incorrectly - the negative charge does not reside on the carbon atom - rather it is "shared" between the two oxygen atoms. Either we draw an extra resonance diagram where it clearly shows how the charge bounces around the two oxygen atoms (along with the push arrows) or we enclose the whole ionized molecule in square brackets, and indicate a negative charge on the outside of it, like [CH3COO]- . What are your thoughts? <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 04:13, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Personally I'd rather omit the resonance structure entirely since dissociation is a phenomenon of the acid dissolved in water, and does not occur to any real extent in the pure substance. We don't write the equilibrium H<sub>2</sub>O ←→ OH<sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> for the picture of water on account of the one part in 10<sup>-7</sup> that is dissociated at pH 7. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimmin_7c2f.html" title="User:Shimmin">Shimmin</a> 11:55, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Quite true, the resonance is only required provided that the dissociation occurs, and there is no reason why we should assume that the molecule is in water anyway. It could be in, say, methanol! In that case, I think we should just settle for the typical picture of acetic acid, without the dissociation illustrated. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 14:04, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is acetic acid lipid(oil) soluble? If yes, is the partition oil/water coefficient known?</p>
<ul>
<li>this depends very strongly on the identity of the oil.</li>
</ul>
<p>GILLIGANS ISLAND... the actual formula for acetic acid is much deeper then it seems. wen crossing over the binary compunds must use the valence number of the electronegative side.</p>

<p>As the official name for the acid is now Ethanoic acid, shouldn't we change everything around to reflect this? i.e. change the main article to ethanoic acid and make acetic acid a redirect, and change all the references around?</p>
<ul>
<li>No (sarcasm) chemist calls it "Ethanoic Acid" outside of the intro organic chemistry lecture hall.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I haven't heard it called "ethanoic acid" even in the lecture hall. Our naming convention (<i>Use the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict with the names of other people or things</i>) is to use the name that is commonly used, over the name that (even a well-respected governing body) feels <i>should</i> be commonly used. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimmin_7c2f.html" title="User:Shimmin">Shimmin</a> 22:17, Dec 13, 2004 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>That's not true - I haven't heard it called acetic acid for years. The substance is ethanoic acid. That's its name. I agree with the original poster. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatch_cde2.html" title="User:Match">Match</a> March 4, 2005</li>

<dl>
<dd>From the preamble to IUPAC's 1993 nomenclature recommendations:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In contrast to such systematic names, there are traditional names, semisystematic or trivial, which are widely used for a core group of common compounds. Examples are "acetic acid", "benzene", "cholesterol", "styrene", "formaldehyde", "water", "iron". Many of these names are also part of general nonscientific language and are thus not confined to use within the science of chemistry. They are useful, and in many cases indispensable (consider the alternative systematic name for cholesterol, for example). Little is to be gained, and certainly much to be lost, by replacing such names. Therefore, where they meet the requirements of utility and precision, and can be expected to continue to be widely used by chemists and others, they are retained and, for the most part, preferred in this Guide.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When the governing body that recommends a system of nomenclature acknowledges that for some compounds, their systematic name has failed to displace, and insofar as the future is forseeable will continue to fail to displace, the traditional name, and is OK with that, it seems foolish to promote that system of nomenclature more zealously than the governing body itself. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimmin_7c2f.html" title="User:Shimmin">Shimmin</a> 14:56, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>That's fair enough - I've always been taught ethanoic acid over acetic and have been told off by chemistry teachers for using it, so from my experience the point was valid. I still think we should switch to ethanoic acid but never mind. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatch_cde2.html" title="User:Match">Match</a></li>

<p>If you follow the link to IUPAC nomenclature it mentions eth- as the valid prefix and not ace-. I have always been taught ethanoic acid.</p>

<dd>Ethanoic acid is the systematic name. What the excerpt quoted from the IUPAC guide above says, however, is that for some substances, there exists a deeply entrenched non-systematic name that the systematic name has mostly failed to displace, and that in such cases, IUPAC does not insist that the systematic name be used. It specifically mentions acetic acid as an example of such a substance. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimmin_7c2f.html" title="User:Shimmin">Shimmin</a> 11:24, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>HAc</b> is, in my humble opinion, <u>the</u> common abbreviation for acetic acid (suggesting hydrogen acetate). The Ac abbreviation for this is even noted on the <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acetate.html" title="Acetate">acetate</a> wikipage, whereas no such abbreviation is mentioned on the <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acetyl.html" title="Acetyl">acetyl</a> page. HAc notation is also in line with the inorganic terminology for <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monoprotic_acid.html" title="Monoprotic acid">monoprotic acids</a>, such as <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrochloric_acid.html" title="Hydrochloric acid">HCl</a>, and <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitric_acid.html" title="Nitric acid">HNO<sub>3</sub></a>. The AcOH abbreviation in the this context wrongly suggests an alkaline instead of acidic behaviour.
<ul>
<li>(<i>checks <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Karl_von_Clausewitz" class="extiw" title="q:Karl_von_Clausewitz">q:Karl von Clausewitz</a>...</i>) the abbreviation is mentioned on <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acetyl.html" title="Acetyl">Acetyl</a>, and <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acetate.html" title="Acetate">Acetate</a> has a {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputed_d59f.html" title="Template:Disputed">disputed</a>}} notice on it! <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> 18:12, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>And it does happen that my personal experience is in line with the HAc as the common abbreviation (and never used/seen AcOH for this purpose).</li>
<li>The ref of PC is about ligands only. I admit that for indicating the Acetyl as ligand in an organic structure, there is no acetate ligand, hence no abbreviation for it. But the text HAc is here about an abbreviation for the whole compound, to indicate its acidic nature.</li>
<li>The AcH is not in question here, whether it indicates another chemical or not.</li>

<p>I have an Organic chemistry M.S. degree. My experience among organic chemists is Ac stands for acetyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>CO-) and OAc (or AcO) is for an acetate group (CH<sub>3</sub>COO-); the acetate ion (CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup>) is abbreviated as OAc<sup>-</sup> or AcO<sup>-</sup>&#160;; acetic acid is HOAc or AcOH. Although I've seen a couple of analytical/inorganic chemists use HAc for acetic acid and Ac<sup>-</sup> for acetate, organic chemists I've seen remark on this tend to regard such guys with a bit of skepticism as if they don't pay attention to the fine detail of doing things correctly.<br />

<pre>
  NOTE: Footnotes in this article use names, not numbers. Please see <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">Wikipedia:Footnotes</a> for details.
    1) Assign your footnote a unique name, for example TheSun_Dec9. 
    2) Add the macro <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_TheSun_Dec9"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/c/e/Talk%7EAcetic_acid_1bbf.html#endnote_TheSun_Dec9" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/c/e/Talk%7EAcetic_acid_1bbf.html#endnote_TheSun_Dec9" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span> to the body of the article, where you want the new footnote.
    3) Take note of the name of the footnote that immediately precedes yours in the article body. 
    4) Add #<cite id="endnote_TheSun_Dec9" style="font-style: normal;"><a href="#ref_TheSun_Dec9" title=""><b>↑</b></a></cite>  to the list, immediately below the footnote you noted in step 3.  No need to re-number anything!
    5) Multiple footnotes to the same reference: see <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">Wikipedia:Footnotes</a> for a how-to.
  NOTE: It is important to add footnotes in the right order in the list!

<p>Martin, it wasn't an error in your text that said that acetic acid was used <i>as a solvent</i> in the manufacture of indigo dye: it was an intentional addition by me to adjust your statement in the first place. Actually, I can't find any corroboration that either acetic acid, or more lower in the text monochloroacetic acid (MCA), is used in the production of indigo dye, not as raw material nor as solvent. Could you please check your reference about this? If the application is (was?) really as large as you indicate, I would have expected to have read about it in my CEH documentation, even if it were merely as a solvent. <a href="../../../w/i/m/User%7EWimvandorst_0265.html" title="User:Wimvandorst">Wim van Dorst</a> 22:41, 2 November 2005 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suspect that the 3000 tons of HOAc were chlorinated to MCA then converted to indigo. The BASF synthesis (1897) goes phthalimide + NaOCl gives anthranilic acid. Anthranilic acid + MCA gives HOOC-C6H4-NH-CH2COOH, which upon treatment with alkali gives indoxyl. In air indoxyl forms indigo blue. The improved Hoechst process (1901) goes aniline + MCA gives phenylglycine, which is treated with NaOH then NaNH2 to give indoxyl. I was planning on writing this synthesis up as part of the support material for the acetic acid article anyway. What do your sources give as the synthesis of indigo?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Martin book is 1917. I have Perkins "Organic Chemistry" from 1922 in my lap, and it states three uses, "(Anhydrous) acetic acid is largely used in chemistry laboratories, and <i>in the manufacture of organic dyes</i> (my emphasis), as well as for the preparation of many acetates...(meaning metal acetates). In 1922/1917 there was no PVA or PET, but indigo was big business - and glacial acetic acid was not such a major commodity then.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I located my more modern source on indigo, Wittcoff &amp; Reuben, <i>Industrial Organic Chemicals in Perspective</i>, Part 2, p450-451, Wiley, 1980. It mentions the $2 million invested in 1897 by BASF to develop their process, "an enormous sum for those days." That implies that synthetic indigo was an important product at that time. The book states that the Hoechst process is "still in use," and since the book is mainly focussed on current production, not history, that carries the implication that the Hoechst sodamide process was the main process used in 1980. Unfortunately this book is poor at describing the uses of acetic acid itself. I will post more info here tomorrow when I'm at work and can consult other books. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkerma_c63c.html" title="User:Walkerma">Walkerma</a> 03:35, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>UPDATE. In Tedder, Nechvatal &amp; Jubb, <i>Basic Organic Chemistry, Part 5: Industrial products</i>, Wiley, 1975, page 65 it lists the end uses of acetic acid ("in the USA in 1970") as follows – Cellulose acetate 44%, Vinyl acetate monomer 31%, Solvent esters 14%, <b>Chloroacetic acid 3%</b> (my emphasis), Others 8%. Since your company makes chloroacetic acid, can you find what it is used for these days? Based on Wittcoff &amp; Reuben I'd guess that in 1970 some of that went into making indigo. I've also worked a little with chloroacetyl chloride in the synthesis of a major drug intermediate, I suspect pharma is a major end use these days.</dd>

<dd>The source of the problem is that we have a lot of things that want to be at the right-hand side of the screen, and if the the font is small or the screen is wide, the point in the text where they appear is reached before the right side is clear, and so either the text or the images appear in a suboptimal location.</dd>

<dd>IE handles the problem by moving the text, opening up a blank space in the text, so that this paragraph is pushed below the bottom of the infobox, but the associated images do appear to the right of the paragraph. Firefox moves the images instead, and the text appears uninterrupted, but not next to the images. This isn't so much a problem with these images, since the text doesn't really need them at any given point, but would be a problem if the images were actually relevant to the history text.</dd>

<dd>I've balanced it now. It was done in an "organic chem" style, we often don't balance equations, but the missing oxygen rendered that very confusing!

This has an <a href="../../../e/n/o/Enol.html" title="Enol">enol</a> form (vinyl alcohol) which can then form its ester, vinyl acetate; or it may well go directly to the ester, I'm not sure.

<p>The section "Production" contains the claim <i>This makes it [acetic acid] the most widely produced acid in the world.</i> Does it mean, produced in the most locations? If so that is probably true but only if we include non-synthetic(vinegar) production, whilst ignoring non-synthetic production of of other acids.

<p>Okay, recently in my Chemistry class, we did a reaction that allows us to produce indigo dye and involved glacial acetic acid. I feel that it needs mentioning in the article under Applications, but I fear that my edits won't be up to FA quality, and I don't have any supporting sources, not yet at least. This is what I have so far:</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/e/Talk%7EAcetic_acid_1bbf.html" title="Edit section: Indigo Production">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Indigo Production</span></h3>
<p>In the past century, glacial acetic acid has become important in the prouction of synthetic <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigo_dye.html" title="Indigo dye">indigo</a>. In 1897, the first feasible reaction on an industrial scale was perfected, allowing this once hard to obtain dye to be widely available, and is the dye used in making blue jeans their distinct color. The process involves the mixing of various chemicals, such as glacial acetic acid, o-nitrobenzaldehyde, sulfuric acid, dimethyl thionate, sodium hydroxide, and acetone in a specific and fairly complex sequence that will result in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigo_dye.html" title="Indigo dye">indigo</a>, which must be converted into <i>leucoindigo</i> before being introduced into the fabric to be dyed, and will quickly revert back into normal indigo. This is a fairly well known reaction, and is done as a basic intro to organic compounds in high school science labs.</p>
<p>If I can get my hands on the sheet, I can detail the process and provide a bit of sourcing, but I think it still needs more work than that. Can you guys give me a hand here? Also, I can provide a picture of the effects of it. I have some socks I dyed with the dye I made. --<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMaster_4e27.html" title="User:RockMaster">RockMaster</a> 01:55, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
