<p>Hiya, thanks for the welcome you posted on my talk page.</p>
<p>I've actually had a Wikipedia account for a while, and have made some minor corrections to articles (generally just correcting links to disambiguation pages) and added some redirects, but haven't contributed in a major way. I don't imagine I ever will, since I don't have a great depth of knowledge on any one subject, nor do I trust my ability to write in a NPOV style. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephenw32768_ae92.html" title="User:Stephenw32768">Stephenw32768</a> 17:27, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ryan! Thanks for the nice welcome message. Why do you use Acetic Acid as a nom de plume? I took organic chemistry, so it triggered a flashback...--<a href="../../../m/y/3/User%7EMy3seadogs_f702.html" title="User:My3seadogs">my3seadogs</a> 19:59, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Acetic acid is one of the most useful of the organic acids (not to mention that vinegar contains it), so you did pick a good name. Good luck with homework! I actually liked chem better in high school than I did in college; my teacher was better.</p>
<p>College chemistry isn't necessarily a torture, though some of the courses were pretty hard if you're not good at memorizing long lists of facts and figures. College inorganic is pretty much the same as high school inorganic, so if you're doing well now, you should do well then. Organic was a little more challenging, but not as hard as the hype would let you believe. I liked lab better than classroom. Physical chemistry (a.k.a. p-chem) was really hard, but I felt like a Spartan for having survived it. You'll do fine.--<a href="../../../m/y/3/User%7EMy3seadogs_f702.html" title="User:My3seadogs">my3seadogs</a> 20:17, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good evening (I'm in Australia.) A.A. I said I'd need help, and I do!</p>
<p>I'm a bit of a mediaeval history buff.</p>
<p>I have looked at the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Brackenbury_19af.html" title="Robert Brackenbury">Robert Brackenbury</a> article. It contains what I think is a factual error. (That Sir Robert was not killed in battle at Bosworth Field in 1485.) I have 3 primary sources indicating he did and certainly that he did is the accepted wisdom amongst historians.</p>
<p>Do I just "charge in" and change the article? Do I mention my concerns in the discussion page first?</p>
<p>Secondly, is there a "spell-checker" tied into the edit feature?</p>
<p>What is the etiquette? <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvalon_8adf.html" title="User:Avalon">Avalon</a> 10:11, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the welcome wagon. You're right, it is a little different on here, but I think I'm getting the hang of it. I looked at the process, and actually dissected a few of the ones I added to before saving them to see what the notations and such did. Thanks for the info, I'm sure it will be super useful. Onward, eh?</p>

<p>Suddenly I'm more clued in! I've been around a while, making small revisions to some articles but only signed up with an account a few days ago when I decided to add an entry for my relatively remarkable hometown of Cloughjordan.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the smorgasbord of info and tips!</p>
