<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thing_6e13.html" title="The Thing">The Thing</a></span></h2>
<p>Why did you change <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thing_6e13.html" title="The Thing">The Thing</a> to a disambiguation page? There is already a disambig page with all this info at <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thing.html" title="Thing">Thing</a>. - <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepheus_6d02.html" title="User:Zepheus">Zepheus &lt;ツィフィアス&gt;</a> 23:47, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but much of the information of the two pages is shared. There are many other disambig pages which show instances with and without a "the" or "a." See <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sentinel.html" title="Sentinel">Sentinel</a> for example. - <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepheus_6d02.html" title="User:Zepheus">Zepheus &lt;ツィフィアス&gt;</a> 00:07, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thing.html" title="Thing">Thing</a> contains all the links on the dab you created, and then some. At best <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thing_6e13.html" title="The Thing">The Thing</a> should have been re-created as a redirect to the existing dab when you moved the film. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 00:12, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree. - <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepheus_6d02.html" title="User:Zepheus">Zepheus &lt;ツィフィアス&gt;</a> 00:13, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>This is true, but notice that these thing are best known with "The" appended. The majority of the articles are titled as "The Thing", not just "thing". Plus, a person searching for "The Thing" is looking for these articles alone, like with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Joker_c9e6.html" title="The Joker">The Joker</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Joker_%28disambiguation%29_9724.html" title="The Joker (disambiguation)">The Joker (disambiguation)</a>. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 00:22, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fair point... though "The Joker" may not be the best example, since <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker.html" title="Joker">Joker</a> is an article of a single topic that refers a reader to the dab for other uses.</dd>
<dd>Given the relative lengths of the list and sub-list, the rational seems a bit of a stretch though. If I logged in to find the song from 1950, there is all but no difference between looking through a list of 15 items and one of 6. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 00:50, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, and the way I reformatted <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thing.html" title="Thing">Thing</a> should help with that easy sifting. However, "Thing" is still a very ambiguous term. Far more ambiguous than <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thing_6e13.html" title="The Thing">The Thing</a>. Even as a rehash of content from another page, "The Thing" serves the purpose of excluding all inrelavent content by one word. Plus, the <i>listed</i> uses are hardly representative of how many uses there are. As "thing" grows, "The Thing" will still be exclusive. Like...the <a href="../../../b/e/h/Behavioral_Analysis_Unit_f0bc.html" title="Behavioral Analysis Unit">BAU</a>. The FBI's a big group and growing, but the <b>Behavioral Analysis Unit</b> is still only like...twenty people. Also, consider <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mastermind.html" title="Mastermind">Mastermind</a> versus <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mastermind_%28comics%29.html" title="Mastermind (comics)">Mastermind (comics)</a>. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 01:04, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Better point... I also ran across <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Hand (disambiguation)">Hand (disambiguation)</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hand_2199.html" title="The Hand">The Hand</a>, and <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Hand_09fb.html" title="Mr. Hand">Mr. Hand</a> so I think I may be looking at this from the wrong perspective.</dd>
<dd>Looking at these examples, you're right. The structure and precedent is there for the dabs as you presented.</dd>
<dd>Also, looking at the "Hand" trio, it might be an appropriate idea to include a link to "Thing" at the bottom of "The Thing" as a "just in case" measure. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 01:17, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Okay. Another question: Why did you revert my edit to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thing_6e13.html" title="The Thing">The Thing</a> with the edit summary "Not really"? - <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepheus_6d02.html" title="User:Zepheus">Zepheus &lt;ツィフィアス&gt;</a> 01:19, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yet another question. Why not discuss it on the talk page before moving it and making a disambig page? - <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepheus_6d02.html" title="User:Zepheus">Zepheus &lt;ツィフィアス&gt;</a> 01:21, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough. Done. Thanks for the recommendation and coming around.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>First, because you claimed cleanup when all you did was make POV content changes. It's a bad habit. I specified what "the remake" was recreating, but the game is a separate entity made many years later. Since they're ordered by time of appearance, it belongs at the bottom.</dd>
<dd>What's to discuss? Nothing's happened at that TP in almost a month. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 01:30, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't see what's POV. The first two lines of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thing_%28film%29_1ffe.html" title="The Thing (film)">The Thing (film)</a> article state that it's based on the original movie AND the novella. Also, I italicized the film title and fixed the wikilink formatting for the video game. I fealt that since the video game was a derivative of the movie, that it fit well tabbed beneath it. - <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepheus_6d02.html" title="User:Zepheus">Zepheus &lt;ツィフィアス&gt;</a> 05:50, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't say it was bad POV. Anyway, it's no big deal. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 06:06, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I concede to you on the redirect. So you know, I added The Thing to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disambiguation_link_repair.html" title="Disambiguation link repair">disambiguation link repair</a>. - <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepheus_6d02.html" title="User:Zepheus">Zepheus &lt;ツィフィアス&gt;</a> 23:54, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes. <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_of_view.html" title="Point of view">Point of view</a>. Just kidding. Actually, I think the point I'm trying to make is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Thing&amp;diff=86831873&amp;oldid=86776029" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Thing&amp;diff=86831873&amp;oldid=86776029" rel="nofollow">my edit to The Thing</a> was inherently different compared to the anonymous user's. I was attempting to clarify information on the page which was incorrect (or incomplete) and organize it in a way that made it clearer. I guess that I fail to see how correcting information is a POV edit. - <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepheus_6d02.html" title="User:Zepheus">Zepheus &lt;ツィフィアス&gt;</a> 23:22, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You see it as correcting, but that's not necessarily the case. The data was moved based on one person's opinion, not the existing policy to list by "date of release". The connection the articles may have can be made elsewhere. And no, POV does not mean the act is malicious, either. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 23:28, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a></i> trailer</span></h2>
<p>Since I couldn't hear the trailer, I wanted to work out the information about Sandman. First of all, was he ever called Flint Marko, or was he William Baker the whole film? In addition, it seems that the Plot section could mention briefly this story arc, since the trailer seemed to go on about it. I don't think it would be disputable to say that Sandman was accused of having killed Uncle Ben, so we can tip-toe around wording that indicates flat-out accusation. (Personally, the dude seems like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fugitive_%281993_film%29_2405.html" title="The Fugitive (1993 film)">The Fugitive</a></i> whose innocence will come out.) I'll mention this on the talk page as well. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 07:09, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Speedster</span></h2>
<p>The expansion of the article is, like many of the expansions I've done, one I had been wanting to do for some time, and now seemed like a good one. Your continued condescending comments ("I fear you are trying to overgeneralize, perhaps out of the belief that you have no other options" and "I'd hate to see you lose your way") continue to be irrelevant, particularly in light of your history of irritating others with your uncivil behavior, as seen on your Talk Page. I'll see if I can get others to weigh in on the issue, so we can achieve some consensus. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightscream_713e.html" title="User:Nightscream">Nightscream</a> 10:05, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Super_Hero_Template" id="Super_Hero_Template"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Super Hero Template</span></h2>
<p>Please explain why you are persisting in deleting fields from the Super Hero Template.</p>
<p>This template applies to BOTH Comic Book Heroes AND Cartoon Heroes, so it is only right that it should have details for both. If you want a template that is exclusively for Comic Book Heroes please make one and leave the general template alone.</p>
<p>Both of the fields that you deleted contain the IF clause, meaning that they only show up if and when they contain any data. This does not impact on any pages that do not contain such data, however, your removal of them actively prevents pages that contain this information from displaying it.</p>
<p>For example, a number of animated hero pages have been using the "voice" parameter to display their voice artists for some time, and so DO NOT contain this data in the article itself. You're deletion means that they now DO NOT contain this information AT ALL.</p>

<p>While the work "Comic" does appear on the info box page, it is also clearely labeled under "Fictional character infobox templates" an overriding catagory for all super heroes. It also contained a voice parameter, indicating that <i>somebody</i> intended it to be universal (Comic and animation). Please advise on the name of the <i>correct</i> template for character appearing in both comic and animation.</p>
<p>Please also advice on what the distressing content was?</p>

<p>I'm not sure how much we need a film series article. I looked over at <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html#Film" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man#Film</a>, which seems to accommodate the film series nicely enough. But if you're keen on creating the article, I'd suggest plot summaries (no more than a paragraph for each film), as well as a paragraph per about box office information. Not sure if I'd go into detail about anything else such as production information unless it was really relevant, since the links to the films would be right there. Also, I suggest not worrying about the state of disrepair of the first two film articles; that's just how Wikipedia is, there's a bad wiki-link in every article. I checked out <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lotus_position.html" title="Lotus position">lotus position</a>, which I had linked in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fountain_212e.html" title="The Fountain">The Fountain</a></i>, and some wise guy edited that it was popular in breakdancing. (That's wrong, right? I hope so.) I'm hoping that after dealing with <i>The Fountain</i> and <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_16f4.html" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a></i> that I'll help improve the Spidey film articles. Bignole's trying to do a little bit with them, too, but I think he's busy at this time. I'll see if I can get Wiki-newbie on it, too -- he's done some worthwhile LOTR stuff (I guess there <i>is</i> that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy_1b2c.html" title="The Lord of the Rings film trilogy">LOTR film series</a> article, so go ahead and do the Spider-Man film series one). Hope that helped; let me know if you have any questions. I'm not "done" with superhero film articles, but I might drop some lesser articles that I wouldn't typically care about, like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Punisher_2_e098.html" title="The Punisher 2">The Punisher 2</a></i> or <i>Fantastic Four</i>. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 18:30, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Otherwise checking through the list currently, there are Deathbird,Devastation,Delilah,Domina, and Titania which shouldn't be there.</p>
<p>One that I added and got yanked later was Dark Angel (or Hell's Angel)Shevayne Haldane.She's one of the Marvel UK characters like Motormouth.</p>

<p>Please let me know what your definition of superheroine is.Feedback would be much appreciated. I see your point with Mystique and Man-Killer(I added only b/c she was Amazon in the Thunderbolts). I also can understand pulling Asp,Black Mamba,etc.Does that include Diamondback (Marvel)?The ones that fall into what I would call the "grey area"?Recent examples being adding the female Wetworks members,Avengelyne,or Aspen Matthews? I'll take Amanda Waller off the list of course.I only added her b/c I saw Angela,Lara Croft,Red Sonja (etc) were already on the list.None of which are superheroines, but are heroines.I was mainly adding what I considered relevant or important females to the list. Just would like to get this clarified so not wasting your time and my own limited time.Thanks! Jedi Master Stewie 00:43, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ace, I'm sure you're well conscious about the concerns regarding some of your remarks. Obviously, your remarks are established in a fairly public environment, as Reynoldsrapture so kindly demonstrated. I don't know what to suggest to you, as you've heard from those in our mutual contributing circle already, but you're a good editor. I just suggest that you acknowledge the fact that people have different learning curves. I jumped aboard ship fairly easily, but the experience isn't the same for everyone. Believe me, I know the feeling about constantly reverting, especially a leaked Venom footage tidbit from <i>Spider-Man 3</i> for the umpteenth time — but generally, in each case, it's a different person who doesn't know any better about image policies and such, and it's easy to group them as one entity that keeps coming in and bumping out of form a decent article. Swallow your pride if it's necessary — your edit record speaks for itself. If anything, I'd suggest your course of action by leaving a message on Legs of boe's talk page to amend the <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bite</a> you allegedly took out of his calf. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 21:41, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

On the other hand, you can choose not to. I'm not trying to parent you, but I'd really prefer not to see this situation again.

<p>Could I suggest that mundane editorial disagreements are most likely to resolve quickly and productively when editors observe the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remain polite per <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a>.</li>
<li>Solicit feedback and ask questions.</li>
<li>Keep the discussion focused. Concentrate on a small set of related matters and resolve them to the satisfaction of all parties.</li>
<li>Focus on the subject rather than on the personalities of the editors.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding Bette Kane</span></h2>
<p>Hello, my fellow Ace. What I meant by "nonsense" is that what the article said about Kane's relation to Earth-Two was unnecesarilly complicated, and mostly a conjecture. Flamebird was not transported to Earth-Two because she "had originally been the Earth-Two counterpart to Bat-Girl". Rather, it was because Bette Kane, both as Bat-Girl or Flamebird, had always been an Earth-Two character. DC's current editorial stance, according to their 2004 book <i>Batman: The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Knight</i>, is that all characters and events featured in Batman books before their 1964 revamp should be considered part of Earth-Two's history. Though DC's reasoning is a bit flawed due to the fact that there had obviously been an Earth-One Batman running around in 1960 working with the Justice League and Superman (and also because Bette Kane - along with Air Wave, Vigilante, Sargon the Sorcerer, Zatara, and others - was among the Earth-Two characters who in the 1970s started appearing in Earth-One stories without any explanation), we must accept it (unless we disagree with DC's decision to keep the late 1950s stories where Batman fought dinosaurs and aliens out of Earth-One/Post-Crisis continuity). Check the "Silver Age" section in the Batman article to see how other problems arose because of Batman not having been updated significantly for Earth-One until 1964, while most other characters which DC had published in the interim between the Golden and Silver ages (Green Arrow, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, etc.) had been revamped around 1958/59. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 15:34, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Venom</span></h2>
<p>Do you know why there are 3 different Venom pages? <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venom_%28comics%29.html" title="Venom (comics)">Venom (comics)</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venom_%28Eddie_Brock%29_1ba6.html" title="Venom (Eddie Brock)">Venom (Eddie Brock)</a>, and <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_Venom_43aa.html" title="Ultimate Venom">Ultimate Venom</a>; they should probably all be under one name: <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venom_%28Marvel_comics%29_9857.html" title="Venom (Marvel comics)">Venom (Marvel comics)</a>. At least there shouldn't be a page about just the "venom" symbiote. I've looked over it and it seems to fail NPOV, there is a lot of assumption on the page. The first paragraph says "Since Venom is the result of symbiosis between an extraterrestrial symbiote and a human host, the name "Venom" can also refer to the alien symbiote alone." That's an opinion, seeing as Peter never called himself "Venom" when it was attached to him. The (Comics) page doesn't seem to contain anymore information that the (Eddie Brock) page. The character started out as Brock, so everything else should just be some subsection under that page, at least I would think so. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 23:21, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's all kinda sloppy, but I'm trying to make the best of it. I consider myself maintaince; I revert the vandalism and fix/spruse up where needed. I might work on the links/articles and try not to make it so much of a tree. (i. e. V (c) to Mac or Eddie to Jr.) Still, I'm okay with the situation as is. I mean, the symbiote's notible and the movie will further that. Jr will get notibility from his adaption for the film. I'd say having the three articles—four, counting mac—was just bound to happen. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 23:33, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It just seemed a bit much, but if you are taking care of it then ok. I mentioned the "symbiotes name is Venom" because that was a theme on the "Symbiote (comics)" article. What happens if the only thing taken from Junior's history is his name and his appearance, then there won't be much to say in reference to his page. Oh well, I just thought people had started creating the same page over and over again (kind of like that one guy just did for Venom (Ultimate), before you redirected). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 23:40, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From what I can see, he <i>will</i> be an amalgamation of past Eddie Brocks, but, having a thing for Gwen, Blonde hear, taste for black and such are all ultimate qualities.

<p>I hope you don't mind that I continued this here, but I felt that the talk page for the article wasn't the appropriate place, since I'm getting into the realm of pure speculation. Of course, after next week this question hopefully will be answered.</p>
<p>So I'm confused. What you're saying is that when Hiro went back in time, he wasn't around to write his blogs, so they disappeared. This doesn't make sense to me, because, the way I see it, he was there to write his blogs. As of the end of "Homecoming", there are now two Hiros. One is in Japan, about to discover that he has super powers. The other is in a restaurant in Texas, trying to save a waitress. The one in Japan should live his life as we have seen up till he travels back in time to try and save the waitress. Which would include writing those blogs. What I conclude is that Hiro A(in Japan) is prevented from writing his blogs by the actions of Hiro B(in Texas). Is there some fatal flaw in this theory that I'm not seeing? <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldsCollide_aa73.html" title="User:WorldsCollide">WorldsCollide</a> 21:46, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Simply put: Heroes isn't the most practical show in the world. A <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural_%28TV_series%29_83ff.html" title="Supernatural (TV series)">supernatural</a> fan had to point this out to me. I wouldn't over think it. Logically, though, let's just say certain things will never add up. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 21:51, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But logically it does add up. Hiro wrote his blogs, Hiro travels back in time six months and the blogs disappear. Ergo, Hiro actions in the past prevented him from writing the blogs. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldsCollide_aa73.html" title="User:WorldsCollide">WorldsCollide</a> 22:39, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
