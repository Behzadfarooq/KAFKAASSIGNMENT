<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hi Ryan</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for your welcome (1st August)... sorry for the delay, I've been away from Wiki for a few weeks. Thanks also for the technical support, it's been fun learning how to edit just by doing it. I was surprised by the speed at which my work was corrected by others who know better.

<p>...even if the greet was automatic, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I believe in this project and in its bright future as the new standard of information. Hope to see you around&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 07:53, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah, might be automatic, but I was thankful for the greeting myself, and I've figured out that I am an Inclusionist. Thx, Acetic.</p>
<p>(Wasn't automatic, actually!)</p>
<p>Danny, watch your back - there be dragons. I know this now, but it's took me a fair few days to be able to see them.</p>

<p>Thanks, too. It feels so nice to be loved.</p>
<p>Heres something you can discuss (if it's not intruding)…</p>
<p>You are casually walking down the street when, lo and behold, you find a “Purchase one assassination, get another two free” coupon for the Russian mafia. Having a few grand spare, you decide to splurge and take advantage of this unusual situation. Which three people would you have assassinated, and why.</p>
<p><br />
Well?</p>
<p>P.S: I can't figure out how to do the wiggly thing, for my name. Its Parson Parcel by the way.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Many Thanks</span></h2>
<p>Thanks Acetic for welcoming me to the world of Wikipedia. The Wiki has been one of my favourite haunts for a while, always providing information when I needed it most. It's people that take time to do the little things, like welcoming someone, that make the world a better place for everyone in it. Once again, many thanks.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Thank you for the "note"</span></h2>
<p>More and more I've been using Wikipedia as my main encyclopedia, inspite of allegations that it may be "inaccurate". Of course, I don't believe that Wikipedia is any more inaccurate than any paid encyclopedia; in fact, my personal observation is that it provides much more accurate and up-to-date information.</p>
<p>I'm too poor to help fund Wikipedia, and I don't see how I can support Wiki in any major way by writing articles and all; but I do support Wiki in any way I can.</p>
<p>So thank you for the "reminders" of how to do things properly. See you around, mate!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">From Fastifex and ...</span></h2>
<p>Actually, I am NOT new to Wikipedia, but my account is&#160;: since last April, I have been making quite some contributions, I lost track how many (an Admin on the Welcoming committee called my the 'best ever user without an account' while suggesting I'ld better start an account), but under an anonymous IP. So, return greetings from Fastifex and his anonymous, more experienced alter ego!</p>
<p>I must say I'm imazed how Anon (yes, even shortened, as if it were a dirty word) seems to be taken by some vandals as a license to abuse serious contributors, naturally rarely hindered by any knowledge of the subject, or even without reading the contribution, to simply undo any additions to their precious (often premature) brainchild, or to mark an article as, say, in need of deletion, to be moved to Wiktionary, or 'not up to standard' in stead of doing some usefull edit (refrase, move and link ...). I suppose it's somewhat naive to hope they will refrain from such abuse on account of my account status. as an Admin suggested, but still here goes the proof of the account pudding Unlike many, apparently, I feel the only thing that realy matters is content, not credits, file history, social aspects of a Wiki-'community' or some sacred cause that blinds the required objectivity. <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastifex_6571.html" title="User:Fastifex">Fastifex</a> 12:53:10, 2005-08-31 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks mate, but like someone before I've been using Wiki for about a year, but anonymously... but unlike the person before, it was purely because I didn't realise you could sign up!</p>

<p>I don't understand why you removed the CSD tag on this article. It's clearly an attack on elderly gentlemen. It is flooded with stereotypes. There is a movie called <i>Grumpy Old Men</i>, which would be fine to write about. But this isn't a movie.

<dd>POV violations aren't CSDs, and I don't think this qualifies as an attack page. We have lots of pages describing stereotypes, many of which have passed VfD.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Help for my friend in Evolution Talk Page</span></h2>
<p>My friend Arturo Cruz (another Filipino) just posted a comment in the Evolution talk page, posting a quote from Ratzinger. The quote is from credible scientists on evolution (Maynard Smith is a multi-awarded evolutionary biologist). He says something like there is no evidence that things proceed to complexity. My friend's plea is merely based on <b>NPOV rules (use credible experts)</b>, not creationism. But there are a lot of "dogmatic" evolutionists in that page.</p>
<p>Can you help? There is another powerful administrator there who is blocking his placing any criticism.</p>

<p>I popped over to thank you for welcoming me &amp; my new acct. I've been a wikipedia user &amp; supporter now for quite some time. I mention its valuable services whenever the opportunity is appropriate. While visiting your discussion/talk page, I noticed you've developed quite a list of "thank you" notes and I almost decided not to leave this note, as everyone else had essentially writted what I wanted to convey. I finally determined that I should post anyway, as it would be rude of me not to do so. I'm not sure how you're able to keep up with the comings and goings of the people on this site, but keep up the good work! --<a href="../../../d/y/m/User%7EDymaxion_40fb.html" title="User:Dymaxion">Dymaxion</a> 21:56, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Im really sorry if I was harsh in any way and for "opening my big mouth"&#160;:); I realize that I could have been a bit more constructive. To tell the truth, Ive seen you around and my first impression was that you were a bureaucrat or something. You definitely had the <i>presence</i> of one. Just alert me when the time comes for your next RFA, and I will give you my full 500,000,000,000% support! Theres no doubt in my mind that you will have unanimous support.</p>
