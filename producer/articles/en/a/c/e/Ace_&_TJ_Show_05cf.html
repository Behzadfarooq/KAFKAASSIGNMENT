<p>Ace and TJ also run their own charity called <a href="http://www.grinkids.org#" class="external text" title="http://www.grinkids.org#" rel="nofollow">Ace &amp; TJ's Grin Kids</a>. They run this charity solely on the donations from the Radio Family, which are listeners to the show. The goal is to take a plane-load of permanently disabled and terminally ill children to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney_World_ce48.html" title="Disney World">Disney World</a> each year in October. The charity went on its first trip to Disney World in 2000 and just recently made its 7th consecutive trip. The trip each year is cost free to the participants and has brought joy to over 100 children.</p>
<p>Charity Case is Ace's Band that plays solely to raise money for Grin Kids.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_%26_TJ_Show_05cf.html" title="Edit section: Current Show Gags">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Current Show Gags</span></h2>
<p>- TJ's Wife: Jodi, according to TJ she is 351 Pounds of Half-nubian nasty.</p>
<p>- TJ's love for the Latinas: On many different occasions TJ has expressed his love for the women of Latin descent and especially loves their beautiful accents.</p>
<p>- Elvis and his colon: On everything related to the late <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis.html" title="Elvis">Elvis</a> TJ, and sometimes other members of the show, make sure to note that "At the time of Elvis's death, his colon was twice its normal size due to the build up of white fecal matter".</p>
<p>- Friday Morning Weekend Blastoff: A weekly segment during the last segment of the 7 O'Clock hour in which they play roughly 4 songs, including a sing along clip, to get everyone listening ready for the weekend. One of the longest running bits in the history of the show.</p>
<p>- The Ryan Curse: Very often members of the show like to note that the person that a woman dates after they have ended a relationship with Ryan will be the one that they marry.</p>
<p>- 5 Things to know: At the end of every show the Yankee Pete will rundown a list of the 5 Things you need to know for the rest of the day. Some of these are funny in nature, others are more comical in nature.</p>
<p>- Stupid News: Ace &amp; TJ's longest running segment where the Yankee Pete will run through some of the dumbest things that appear in the news each day. This segment now features music introductions that tie to the story in some way.</p>
<p>- The Circle of Life: One of the show's newest gags where, during every story that features something to do with Africa, this will be the introduction to the story. Each show member gets a great deal of joy from hearing this song and it has been stated that the Yankee Pete paid over $10 just to find the right version.</p>
<p>- Drunk Kiss Fan: Recorded by Breezekat, who is no longer on the show, before a Kiss/Aerosmith concert and is constantly used throughout the show to add an extra bit of humor.</p>
<p>- Drunk Motley Crue Fan: Recorded by Ryan at the Motley Crue/Aerosmith concert, is used now just as much as Drunk Kiss fan and the favorite saying from the clip is "I did myself".</p>
<p>- Super Ace: Funny running joke that started a few weeks before Ace's High School Reunion, where it was noted that Ace has the ability to save all reunions when they are in jeopardy.</p>
<p>- The Ace Curse: In opposition of Super Ace is the Ace Curse, where Ace always goes too far when interviewing celebrities and asks the wrong questions, which does a good job in embarrassing the show and making others feel bad for him. Some very funny incidents were when Ace asked Carolina Panthers' Wide Receiver <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Smith_6342.html" title="Steve Smith">Steve Smith</a> about his love for the show <a href="../../../i/_/l/I_Love_Lucy_f6db.html" title="I Love Lucy">I Love Lucy</a>, to which Smith replied that he had no idea what Ace was talking about. Another even more comical incident was when TJ and Madden played a prank on Ace when, shortly after the death of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Nicole_Smith_1541.html" title="Anna Nicole Smith">Anna Nicole Smith</a>'s son, they interviewed singer <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Blunt_6f74.html" title="James Blunt">James Blunt</a> and, in Blunt's bio report put together by Madden, it stated that Blunt had done a song for the Anna Nicole Smith's show called Hats Off, to which Blunt replied, "are you sure you're interviewing the right person", as well as some other very funny comments on Ace's behalf.</p>
<p>- Sombrero and ZZ Top Beard: Pete's costume for when his "ladies of the evening" arrive during the afternoon at Pete's apartment.</p>
<p>- Saturday Night Lights: A game where each show member is paired with a college football team (Ace is Tennessee, TJ is UNC-Chapel Hill, Pete is Penn State, Ryan is Alabama and Madden is the University of South Carolina). At the end of the season, the person with the worst record will have to do a "seductive dance" at an amateur night. (TJ will have to do a seductive dance as UNC-Chapel Hill had the worst record.)</p>
<p><a name="Past_Gags" id="Past_Gags"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_%26_TJ_Show_05cf.html" title="Edit section: Past Gags">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Past Gags</span></h2>
<p>- Herman: Ace's "real name". Has made a slight comeback recently.</p>
<p>- Who's Got the Best Song: A segment where each show member would bring in a song that they're really in to at that point, but is not one that you would hear on any of their stations, i.e. not Top 40, and callers would vote on Who has the best song. TJ won this more than anyone else, and, despite the popularity of the segment, it is rarely used.</p>
<p>- Ace &amp; TJ's Pop Quiz: A segment running during mid 2005 and early 2006 where, around the 8:30 segment, Ace &amp; TJ would offer up a question to be answered during the 9:30 segment, where the first caller wins a prize.</p>
<p>- Farting Preacher: A video clip that Ace &amp; TJ linked up to their website and has been regarded as one of the funniest things ever to be put on the website.</p>
<p>- Dr. Phil: Most of the members of the show have expressed their love for the television personality and earlier in the life of the show TJ did an impression of Dr. Phil in answering questions about peoples' problems. One day TJ stopped "feeling it" and said that they went to the well one to many times on this one.</p>
<p>- Pet Psychic: Another one of TJ's personalities where he imitated the Pet Psychic that was featured on Animal Planet. He also interviewed a few dogs, including Angie's, a former show member who now works for the <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Carolla_Show_65f6.html" title="Adam Carolla Show">Adam Carolla Show</a>, dog and making some very funny, suggestive comments. This was also declared by TJ as "going to the well one too many times" and has been dropped as one of their bits.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_%26_TJ_Show_05cf.html" title="Edit section: Controversies/Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversies/Criticism</span></h2>
<p>-There was, during the fall of 2005 and spring of 2006 great controversies over some of the sarcastic remarks that the members of the show made. Most of them had to do with women and were brushed off as being sarcasm, but some radio family members refused to listen after that.</p>
<p>-Also an April Fools Day prank played by the show in 2005, right before the departure of Angie, cause controversy in the radio family because the show announced that former <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor.html" title="Survivor">Survivor</a> contestant <a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Hawk_e8be.html" title="Sue Hawk">Sue Hawk</a> would be replacing Angie. She even used derogatory terms for southerners and a derogatory term for a Mexican. The show, after a commercial break, told everyone that it was a joke and then apologized for the 'wetback' remark from Sue.</p>
<p>-The show seems to take more commercial breaks than the average morning show, leading to many long time listeners to switch to other radio shows in the listening area.</p>
