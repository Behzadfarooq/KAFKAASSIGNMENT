<p>The video-game characters all are created using <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer-generated_imagery.html" title="Computer-generated imagery">CGI</a> and special effects. Each character breathes, eats and sleeps, as do humans. The Lightning Knights each have an inbuilt information screen in their programming (as seen by Ace during the early episodes) which includes a map, the location, and a health bar (a la a POV from someone playing the game). If a Lightning Knight is harmed, they will be weakened and flicker, until the point where they are destroyed and sent back to the game, seen when <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparx_%28Ace_Lightning%29_df3f.html" title="Sparx (Ace Lightning)">Sparx</a> is destroyed by Zip and Snip. This now appears to apply to <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Illusion_220a.html" title="Lady Illusion">Lady Illusion</a> as in the final episode where she is destroyed by <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Fear_1f82.html" title="Lord Fear">Lord Fear</a>, she flickers before she disappears.</p>
<p>The villains are destroyed frequently is the series, but instead of returning to the game, they all morph into various items around the Carnival of Doom. All the villains except Lady Illusion and Fred are known to morph into an object. All the villains except Fred have been sent back to the game. No character has been destroyed for good, or what the fans call "deleted". Below is a list of what the villains morph into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lord Fear/Staff Head â€” Skeleton with staff.</li>
<li>Kilobyte â€” <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferris_Wheel_8f6e.html" title="Ferris Wheel">Ferris Wheel</a></li>
<li>Lady Illusion â€” Unknown, perhaps inapplicable</li>
<li>Dirty Rat â€” <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gargoyle.html" title="Gargoyle">Gargoyle</a></li>
<li>Pigface â€” <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bin.html" title="Bin">Bin</a></li>

<dd>The heroic superhero from Mark's game and the foremost of the Lightning Knights. Ace can fly, has super strength and speed and can fire electricity from the wrist cannons he wears. He is brave and reliable, but is clumsy, often breaking objects in Mark's house in curiosity. Ace's mission is to stop Lord Fear from using the <a href="../../../a/m/u/Amulet_of_Zoar_9910.html" title="Amulet of Zoar">Amulet of Zoar</a> to become extremely powerful and imprison him back in prison in the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixth_Dimension_4e55.html" title="Sixth Dimension">Sixth Dimension</a>. Ace is a caring hero and looks after Mark, who he enlisted to be his <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidekick.html" title="Sidekick">sidekick</a> early in the series. He develops a relationship with villain Lady Illusion after saving her life and it is kept a secret from everyone, but Mark, Sparx and Staff Head discover it. In Season 2, Ace receives uncontrollable emotions from Kilobyte, in an attempt to destroy him. He also receives an upgrade called the Ring of Flame, which projects a series of fire attacks at enemies. Ace not only uses his wrist cannons in battle but fights with the Lightning Lance, a hi-tech electrical lance; and the Shield of Justice which can absorb energy attacks and fire them back at the sender (this happened to short-circuit Random Virus).</dd>

In the past he was badly wounded in an attack, causing the loss of some of his limbs and his controlled programming, creating two personalities, one of good and the other of evil. Random has difficulty controlling his evil side and hides away in a junkyard when summoned to the real world. Random is good friends with and equally good enemies. He possesses a massive robotic claw which is his main weapon. He can control machinery and doesn't appear to restore his energy like the others Lightning Knights. Random is one of two CGI characters who has not returned to the game yet, the other being Fred, who originated from Earth.</dd>

<p>The villains inhabit the Kent Brothers Carnival, because of its similarity to the Carnival of Doom which is their headquarters in the game. They can be blasted into nothingness by the Lightning Knights, but in true video game villain fashion will never stop coming until the heroes manage to win the game. Upon being defeated they return to a carnival fixture to recover and soon return. On the official Ace Lightning site they were called "the Evil Gang," but are not given a group name in the show.</p>

<p>The first season was produced in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> and was shown in several countries like the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. The season introduced the mian characters throughout the 26 episodes. Episode 8 was a <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> special and Episode 18 was a semi-<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Fools_Day_8caa.html" title="April Fools Day">April Fools Day</a> special. Episode 20 was a <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clip_show.html" title="Clip show">clip show</a> episode featuring the character Duff Kent seeing a psychiatrist about his life with the evils. The graphics were poor in some episodes, but overall decent. Throughout the series, the characters obtained pieces of the Amulet of Zoar which they used to summon reinforcements from the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixth_Dimension_4e55.html" title="Sixth Dimension">Sixth Dimension</a>. These characters included Googler, Sparx and Random Virus. Originally the characters were going to originate from a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic book</a>, but it was altered in terms of popularity against a video game.</p>
<p>Note: When broadcast in America, the episodes were shown out of order, which sometimes resulted in severe continuity errors. For instance, "Tunnel of Love" was shown before "Once Upon a Hero." Meaning Random Virus would show up as an established character the day before he would be established.</p>

<p>The second series first aired in most countries in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, but it aired in the United Kingdom during the summer of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> for unknown reasons. Due to the poor reception of the first season, this season was not aired in the United States. The graphics were greatly improved, and several of the characters including Staff Head and Pigface were changed to look more like the animals they resembled. Kilobyte, Rotgut, Kat Adams and Rick the Master Programmer made their debuts in the season. Chuck also meets the Lightning Knights and Mark gets his own weapon, allowing him to battle the villains as well. There were only 13 episodes, and focused on one overall storyline. Some people consider this season to be Season 3 (with most television shows having each season with thirteen episodes).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Lightning_c0ff.html" title="Edit section: Season 3">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season 3</span></h2>
<p>A Season 3 was in the making but was cancelled due to the show's unpopularity and not enough money from merchandise to continue the project. Known facts about the show included Ace would go into the game and rescue Lady Illusion, possibly freeing Kilobyte and Rick too. Lord Fear, Staff Head and Dirty Rat would live together with Mr. Cheseborough for a while, Lord Fear using the teacher's knowledge and technology to find a way to release Anvil, Pigface, Googler and Rotgut from the game without the use of the Amulet. Candy Floss was also to be introduced in the series, presumably in the first episode (like Rotgut was in Season 2). Nothing else is known about the season but likely events would include Kat spending time with the Lightning Knights, Random Virus continuing to hide away and Ace and Lady Illusion having romantic moments together. It is unknown whether or not the season shall be revived for creation.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Lightning_c0ff.html" title="Edit section: Connections Between the Show and Game">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Connections Between the Show and Game</span></h2>
<p>After the first season, a series of video games were released for the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playstation_2.html" title="Playstation 2">Playstation 2</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Boy_Advance_f612.html" title="Game Boy Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">PC</a>. They seem to take place before the television show. There are connections between the show and games but very limited. Below are several connections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lady Illusion's game character is very different from the show's interpretation. She is very dull but appears to have a "soft spot" for Ace. Fans consider her to be more dependent in the game adaption. Also in the game, Lady Illusion is seen with her explosion upgrade (an orange ball) â€” whether or not this is a homage to Season 2 is unknown.</li>
<li>Random Virus is slightly different. He seems very schizophrenic and when his evil mode is in control, both of his eyes turn fully red.</li>
<li>Ace Lightning is rather overconfident in the game and doesn't possess his personality in the show.</li>
<li>Ace is unable to fly in the game as he can in the show, and needs to use trampolines and platforms to reach high places, and can die from falling off ledges.</li>
<li>All of the characters were not voiced by their original actors, just others who impersonated them. Sparx was not even properly featured in the game.</li>
</ul>
