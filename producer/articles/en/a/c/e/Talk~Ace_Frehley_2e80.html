<p>Gene and Paul left Wicked Lester to make their new band, KISS was never called Wicked Lester. 24.108.68.4 02:07, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, according to several direct sources including the box set liner notes and <i>Sex Money Kiss</i>, Gene and Paul were still thinking of the band that would soon be KISS as a new lineup of Wicked Lester when they auditioned Peter and Ace. It wasn't until Ace joined that the name KISS was decided upon. Gene's statements in particular have been contradictory and inconsistent about this, though. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 02:26, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Precisely. There was no one left in Wicked Lester to fire by that point anyway.

Hi Cholmes75,</p>
<p>Regarding this, I must mention that not all info was without references. I added the info on the VH1's Most Metal Moments countdown, even citing in what place his incident came in. I thought I was specific enough as to where that came from, and is easily verifiable. Do you need a link the to countdown on VH1's site or is just mentioning where it came from enough for you? The same goes for the Dimebag Darrell tattoo, info which is also on Dimebag's article and also shown on VH1.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<ul>
<li>After pondering the issue more, I think the trivia section should stay out, even when stuff is supported by cites. I refer to the guideline at <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIV_4692.html" title="WP:TRIV">WP:TRIV</a> for my reasoning. Simply put, I don't think Dimebag Darrell having a tattoo of Ace is something that the article needs. For other things, it would be much better if they could be integrated into the main article body. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7ECholmes75_fc51.html" title="User talk:Cholmes75">chit chat</a>)</sup> 17:51, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Why was this delted? He has stated in various interviews that he has a German grandfather, he wrote a song called Cherokee Boogie (instrumental) as a tribute to his Cherokee heritage. I'm not sure which side of his family is German and which is Cherokee but there is no dispute in the matter it is fact.
