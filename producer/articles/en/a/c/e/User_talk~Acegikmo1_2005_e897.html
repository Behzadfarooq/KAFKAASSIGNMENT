<p>I significantly expanded the Elagabalus in late March and would like to nominate for featured status by the end of April. He is rather controversial figure, and I've tried to go out of my way to cite sources and present differing accounts about his rule. It probably still needs some work which is why I'm asking several people to review/edit before it's nominated. I'd appreciate it if you would review it and get back to me about what you think.

<p>(Sorry for the length of this!) Re your comments on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Robinson_1447.html" title="Mary Robinson">Mary Robinson</a> articel. I don't think you grasped the impact of Robinson on the office of president. She took an office that was low-key, under-utilised and frankly dull (no disrespect to Paddy Hillery, whom I have immense respect for) and <i>completely reimagined it</i>. The office changed fundamentally in its structure, role, public respect and impact on Irish life. It is hard to explain fully just how dramatically she reshaped the office. But one can get some idea by some statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>93% support rating, unheard of <i>ever</i> in Irish polling (where a 70% is regarded as a miracle and very very rarely achieved by any Irish politician.)</li>
<li>opinion polls that showed that, had she run again, she would have been the 'first choice' for 70% of <i>Fianna Fáil supporters</i> - her opponents in 1990, whereas her nearest Fianna Fáil potential challenger within Fianna Fáil, a former party leader and prime minister, had 12% support;</li>
<li>in polls, had she run in 1997, she would have been the perferred choice of Fianna Fáil supporters, Fine Gael supporters, Labour supporters, PD supporters (where she nearly had 100%, and they too were opponents in 1990), Green supporters, even Sinn Féin supporters.</li>
<li>In polls she was described unambiguously as "the best ever president" by every category; political, social, economic, religious, young, old, rich, poor, an astonishing achievement.</li>
<li>Historians, both traditional and revisionist, have <i>universally</i> acclaimed her as the best ever president, "by a mile" in the words of one.</li>
<li>When a Catholic priest attacked for for supposedly breaking Vatican protocol in how she was dressed when she met the pope (she hadn't. He obviously hadn't realised that dress codes in the Vatican had changed under Pope John Paul and the pope was perfectly happy with how she dressed. But then her office had consulted the Vatican first) he was condemned by his bishop, his parish priest, his parishioners and even his family, including an uncle of his who was a priest, <i>publicly</i>.</li>
<li>When one columnist in the Irish Times attacked her he was verbally abused in the street.</li>
<li>When she took on the office, 40% wanted the office abolished. When she left 99.8% wanted to keep it.</li>
<li>When she ran in 1990, her biggest detractors was the controversial journalist <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Browne_f266.html" title="Vincent Browne">Vincent Browne</a> who dismissed her plans as unworkable, impossible and nonsensical. By 1997 Browne, one of Ireland's most notoriously controversial journalists, hero-worshipped her, re-echoing the words he had used early on in the presidency during her visit to Rwanda, saying "You were magnificent". (Browne, in 40 years of journalism, has never ever praised anyone in public life so fulsomely. Indeed, in a move that astonished - and amused - all of Ireland, he actually apologised, saying about his 1990 analysis, "I was wrong". That's like a pope saying 'I'm not infallible. I'm gay. And by the way, lets have women priests!')</li>
<li>An office where at elections parties struggled to find candidates for, and where <i>three</i> candidate races had only happened twice and were looked on with astonishment, suddenly had <i>five</i> nominated candidates seeking to replace her. A former prime minister could not even get a nomination to become his party's candidate, as his party, Fianna Fáil, sought to find its own 'Mary Robinson' style candidate. (It succeeded and she won. BTW her highest opinion poll rating was an amazing 86%. But she had a 'guaranteed' 40+ (Fianna Fáil voters) in there. Robinson had a guaranteed 13% (Labour voters) and had to win all the rest over.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was in the Áras for her resignation and the main party leaders (opponents in 1990) were practically scrambling to be photographed beside her. It was astonishing and very very funny. Bertie Ahern was beaming like a proud parent. As was John Bruton. (Both had been opponents in 1990, but by 1997 called her "incredible" and "remarkable" in the office.) Pat Rabbitte was even more smug than normal. (Labour leader Dick Spring stayed away because he had had a notorious falling out with her. According to tracking polls, his support dropped by 1/3 overnight, when he, previously the most popular politician in Ireland, was revealed to have had a major row with her.) So if the article praises her strongly it is because that is how she is judged, by the media, by politicians, by historians and commentators, but most of all by the Irish people. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="green"><b>Fear</b><font color="orange"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a> 23:18, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I regretfully concede the admin nom, but I hope that you would reconsider the WikiProject. You are more active than some participants, and a very active user chose not to participate in a recent vote. Despite other commitments you always respond, it may take time but you respond— some of the current particpants do not. By joing the project you could only enhance the project even with only a very minmal commitment from you would be more helpful than some current participants. I also find your new flavour and organisation of writing intriguing; I however am rather fond of the letter z, but I digress. Likewise you are welcome to come to Marshall. I missed the first bloom of Spring in with my pics but I hope to catch them the second time around latter in the summer, whrn the wisteria, red bud, dogwoods and vibrant color to the woods and also some pics of Caddo Lake. Again on the WikiProject, two more things: <i>S'il vous plaît</i> y <i>Por favor</i>, Jonathan.

<p>The project's aim is to create fair and accurate articles on U.S. regions, and the way they are referenced in articles. Many sources about regions use stereo-types... the wikipedia article on the Southwest I found when I first joined it had Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, and New Mexico in it. The article talked about the Southwest mostly being desert and that it was sparsely populated. Most of Texas and Oklahoma are not desert, so are significant portions of Arizona and New Mexico. East, Central, and North Texas are quite populated, so is the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Dixie_5ce0.html" title="Little Dixie">Little Dixie</a> in OK. Texas and Oklahoma were not mentioned in the text outside of their inclusion in the region, however Las Vegas and Imperial Valley, not included on the map were. I, as a geography literate person, I found this a poor article (unfortunately I've seen worse on paper). Further more, many East Texans are a little sensitive to being excluded from the image the state likes to put forth, thus I was also offended. This being my first day on wikipedia, I had a rather novice solution to this— I removed Texas from the article and the map, something the lovely <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a> quickly and politely corrected me for.</p>
<p>Referencing was also problematic, <b>Texas</b> <i>is a state in the Southeastern United states</i>. That's only one possibility, Texas is also part of; the South, the West, the Southeast, as well as being a South Central, Central, Gulf, and Plains state. Using only one, region for states like, CA, TX, PA, MO, and others is disingenuous. Referencing for regions which have no official definition also pose problems for comparison. <i>DART (Dallas Area Rapid Transit) was the first light rail system in the Southwest.</i> Which Southwest? If Texas is excluded it isn't and if California is included <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit_e646.html" title="Bay Area Rapid Transit">BART</a> beats DART. Likewise, Atlanta would take the title in the South and South East, BART gets the West. DART <b>is</b> the first light rail in Texas, and Texas' borders have been well defined for over a century. Thus, <i>DART was the first light rail system in Texas is more accurate.</i> Where concrete regions are needed we use the Census Bureau definitions for South, Midwest, Northeast, and West, (we probably need a foot note for that we can place in articles, but that’s the future.)</p>

<p>Stylistically we've had a breakthrough in that all but one article, (actually two, I'll explain latter) are located at standard article titles, e.g. <i>Southern United States</i> &amp; <i>Northeastern United States</i>. This is not a great victory in terms of our initial goals, but it does show that wikipedians are willing to accept the WikiProjects setting standards for regional articles. The exception is <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._West_bbc8.html" title="U.S. West">U.S. West</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_West_ca70.html" title="American West">American West</a> which should be merged at <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_United_States_afd6.html" title="Western United States">Western United States</a>, I'd appreciate your assistance with that.

<p>The fairness we must always watch for, stereo types are always going to rear there ugly heads. The larger the article is the less problem small insertions will pose and mass deletion of text will draw in people from outside the project because its obvious vandalism, thus article expansion is also something I'd like to make a concerted effort at in the future. The referencing, which was approved by the project, has never been implemented, and it needs to be.</p>
<p>I'd also like to expand membership, thus my harassment here, as I've had poor turnout of the current members- only myself, <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a>. We need more members if we are to be effective. Jmabel is very modest when it comes to his importance to the project and has been honest that its not his priority. I'd rather have people who only have a passive interest in it who turnout, and make meaningful contributions than no one at all, which is why I'm being so persistent, all right annoying, in pursuing you, Cyrius, Walabio, and Jengod.</p>

<p>Yeah, I've been trying to compile all the Billboard charts with the most accurate name. And with Billboard it can get heavy on the semantics (like trying to decide if the chart is called Mainstream Top 40 or Top 40 Mainstream) or having The Billboard Hot 100 spelled out exactly as that.... And sometimes adding that extra "chart" in there I think kind of loses touch with what the chart is. I hope you don't mind, just trying to make the charts as exact as possible. But that chart was your creation, and I don't want to step on your toes, (I know how I feel when I write stuff and people move it and I dont exactly agree) so it could be changed back if it's bothering you. Or would Modern Rock Tracks (Chart) work too? <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegaWikipedia_90c1.html" title="User:OmegaWikipedia">OmegaWikipedia</a> 30 June 2005 11:03 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Here is why I think the hangings is completely out of place on a page like <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mashad.html" title="Mashad">Mashad</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>What is exactly the significance of this news item?</b> This is not the first or last such hanging in Mashad. It isnt the first or last such acts in anywhere in Iran in fact. People, including teenagers, are routinely hanged or executed. Should such <i>news items</i> even be mentioned on geographic pages? The incident you mentioned in MASS caused <i>riots</i>. I hardly see any similarity to Mashad. <b>I guarantee you there are <u>hundreds of thousands</u> of people living in Mashad that dont even know that these teenagers were hanged.</b> It was practically insignificant. And in light of the thousands that have already died such deaths in Iran, this incident doesnt have any considerable weight. Im sure you will not accept any of this, but remember that incidents far more important than the teenage hangings in Mashad have not been mentioned on the Mashad page. For example, the bombings in the Imam Reza shrine a couple of years ago that killed dozens, or the ongoing war with narcotics smugglers on the nearby borders of Mashad that have resulted in 30000 casualties in total. Or Mashad's acute heroin and opium problem. Or the fact that minorities were persecuted here. Or the "Spider" serial killer in Mashad, ad infinitum. So what makes you think these 2 teenagers are more significant than others to mention on this page? Is it only because it is a sexually related case? Now if this were some sort of incident like the 1999 college student uprisings that shut down the entire city, it would be worth mentioning. But this is not. I know. My brother and 3 aunts live there.</li>
<li><b>Consistency</b>. If youre gonna mention such things about Mashad, then you should be consistent and do the same on pages everywhere else. I'd like to see you mention gay or teenage slayings or executions on the main pages of <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/f/Isfahan.html" title="Isfahan">Isfahan</a>, or even <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming.html" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, etc. Heck, <b>the page <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> absolutely mentions not even a word about the tens of thousands of Iraqis that have died.</b> THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE SENTENCE ABOUT THE ONGOING WARS IN AFGHNAISTAN OR IRAQ. only a feeble tiny link. Now how do you expect me to believe you when you say youre not trying to smear the image of Iran? If you successfully put up a table about the list of executions and slayings on the US main page, then we can talk about doing a similar thing on the Mashad page.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 17:05, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>I completely agree with the excellent points that Zereshk has made, and there is not much more that can be said. Specifically in regards to this issue in Mashhad, I will also add that they were <b>not</b> from Mashhad themselves. Also, there have been numerous, numerous political murders (such as <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahra_Kazemi_e6bc.html" title="Zahra Kazemi">Zahra Kazemi</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dariush_Forouhar_a649.html" title="Dariush Forouhar">Dariush Forouhar</a>) and assassinations in Tehran since the very beginning of the Revolution and to this very day - but they are not addressed in the <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a> article and rightly so. Surely you are very familiar with the case of Zahra Kazemi who was from Montreal herself? Should we list her in every single article related to Montreal and the Canadian government and how Canada literally did nothing to stop her brutal and heinous torture and eventual murder? As with Zereshk, I don't like double standards and certainly I oppose any prejudicial anti-Iranian POV which is clearly apparent here.</p>
<p>The issue is dealt with in the proper context in several different and more appropriate articles, as is the case with other executions and political murders/assassinations. There is no need to flood numerous other articles with this information, which again, would be entirely inappropriate and POV. If you can address this issue of double standards and the problem of listing every single execution/asssassination in the articles of each city that they have occurred in, then we can talk.

<p><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bigearz_d135.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bigearz">User Bigbearz</a> independently created a Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../m/u/s/MusicOMH.com_090f.html" title="MusicOMH.com">musicOMH.com</a> and has been adding reviews and external links to the site on numerous albums and artist pages. While it's perfectly fine for the reviews, it's very OTT for the artist pages. A lot of albums have review links to the likes of <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a>, <a href="../../../n/m/e/NME_8ba4.html" title="NME">NME</a>, etc, but there aren't corresponding links to the artists pages for those sites.</p>
<p>There's increasing a lot of ppl spamming the artist pages with links from certain music sites.

<dd>Disambiguation pages are not meant to contain content, instead, the have one purpose: to resolve ambiguity between article names. Dictionary definitions and expansive descriptions do not belong on disambiguation pages, which is why I removed them. Almost all of the content concerning Rough Trade Records is already on its respective article page (the only item of importance not in the article already was "Early signings included Young Marble Giants, and Scritti Politti", which I've now incorporated). I have also added the dic-def of "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rough_trade" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:rough_trade">rough trade</a>" to Wiktionary.
