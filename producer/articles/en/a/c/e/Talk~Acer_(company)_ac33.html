<ul>
<li>Agreed. Well, tentatively agreed. I have two suggestions:</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A merge <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_computer_hardware_manufacturers.html" title="List of computer hardware manufacturers">List of computer hardware manufacturers</a> or</li>
<li>Creating a new page for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Computer_System_Manufacturers_20ff.html" title="List of Computer System Manufacturers">List of Computer System Manufacturers</a> and then adding a link on the bottom of the <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acer_%28company%29.html" title="Acer (company)">Acer (company)</a> page in the "See Also" section directing the user to the newly created page. -- <a href="../../../b/b/o/User%7EBboyskidz_e5a6.html" title="User:Bboyskidz">Bboyskidz</a> 05:52, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I'd tend to agree with the second suggestion. Whatever, the list doesn't belong in this article as it should then be reproduced in every other manufacturer's respective article (which is clearly unmaintainable). The list probably needs to quote the markets that the companies operate in (US, UK, etc) so that competitors can be identified. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalsteadk_f45b.html" title="User:Halsteadk">Halsteadk</a> 19:15, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Done. I've created a new page (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Computer_System_Manufacturers_20ff.html" title="List of Computer System Manufacturers">link</a> and done what I suggested on the second point -- <a href="../../../b/b/o/User%7EBboyskidz_e5a6.html" title="User:Bboyskidz">Bboyskidz</a> 22:39, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nice work, much more useful and objective. I could see there might be an argument that as it doesn't say where each company markets its products it doesn't cover who is in competition, so it doesn't really replace the original content. However, I'd argue that the original content was fairly meaningless anyway - naturally all the big names are in competition with each other and this doesn't need to be stated. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalsteadk_f45b.html" title="User:Halsteadk">Halsteadk</a> 23:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have never edited a page, so I am not sure I want to, but there are some incorrect things in the second paragraph of this section. First the corporate headquarters are in San Jose, Califonia. Second, Acer bought out the Texas Instruments laptop/notebook division. This divison of TI was in Temple TX and Acer decided to keep it there. Also the Temple, Tx facility employs about 200 and that is with significant growth over the past few years (and more to come). Temple handles the repairs and is the only repair center in the US (another is in Missisauga, somewhere in canada). Any comments on this or advice about making the change would be appreciated. <a href="../../../m/f/e/User%7EMfergason_ec6b.html" title="User:Mfergason">Mfergason</a> 17:58, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think Taiwan is <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">treated as a geographic term in Wikipedia</a> .

<dd>I don't think we should use ROC. Ideogram, so you mean the poll you started is suppose to set like a boundary between political and non-political articles? I don't think it really matters in this article, this is obviously not political.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerrypp772000_ce5c.html" title="User:Jerrypp772000">Jerrypp772000</a> 21:21, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The poll I started is to establish consensus for an official policy. There are currently three proposals, one to leave everything as it is (no policy), one that tries to rationalize something close to what we have now (which has no support), and one to replace ROC with Taiwan almost everywhere (except in official titles). As I noted there is no official policy right now. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 21:27, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You aren't necessarily following <i>the rules</i> since they are also disputed. You are simply making things more confusing.

<dd>We still need a consensus here. So I think we should use Taiwan in this article, because Taiwan is the common name of the ROC. We don't need to use the official name everywhere in Wikipedia, and it wouldn't matter if ROC doesn't confuse people, but it does. People that don't know the Chinese history wouldn't know any difference between ROC and PRC. ROC is usually used only in political contexts anyways.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerrypp772000_ce5c.html" title="User:Jerrypp772000">Jerrypp772000</a> 00:19, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
