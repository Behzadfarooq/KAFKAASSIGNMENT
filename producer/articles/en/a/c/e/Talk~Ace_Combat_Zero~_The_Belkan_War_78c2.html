<p>Why were these deleted? There was no reason at all to get rid of these.</p>
<p><br />
A lot of work was ruined with this "trimming", pointless to delete something and give it a 'dicitonary' layout, as in two sentences instead of the hundreds that expalined the game before. I'm going to stop usuing this site, and surely others will too. 24.131.40.5 22:08, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_27.html" title="August 27">27 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)Lyle</p>

<p>I just noticed that the Aircraft section was deleated to. I'll agree there was no reson to delete it. There are simmilar sections for all of the other AC games, this is no different. If anyone knows how to restore things like that, I beleive it was deleted on 22:16, <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">9 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> by an unregistered user.

<p>Is it possible to format the section so we have two or three columns instead of all left-justified? I'd try to do it, but I have to go to class.

<p>It's been long enough. It's time to start putting down more factual stuff regarding the game. I'm not going to be satisfied with "is unclear what X..." and "perhaps character Y will..." statements. I've put down a story framework to the best of my ability surrounding Cipher, Pixy, and PJ. Now's your chance to make a mental note not to read the article if you don't want to have something spoiled for you. A spoiler warning is up at the top; let's hope that people heed it if they truly don't want to have things spoiled for them. Also, here's a notice - if you add information and I've removed it, please do not add it again without providing pertinent information as to why it should be re-added. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 07:01, <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_29.html" title="March 29">29 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)</p>

<li>Could you give a link to where they did that, since I'm certainly not poking around ever corner of the Namco website, let alone all the gaming news sites out there. Tempest2</li>

<dd>Ummm. Duh? Everyone knew the release date to be sure, 100% locked in stone by the end of March. You don't even need official confirmation when you can preorder the US AC0 at any local game store, they all tell you it'll be there on March 25. My local EBgames, however, gets the shipment at April 26. -<a href="../../../r/p/h/User%7ERPharazon_748c.html" title="User:RPharazon">RPharazon</a> 00:19, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_23.html" title="April 23">23 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can anybody confirm whether or not the aces in the SP mission are random? I keep getting the same guys to face when I play, but I have only played it on Ace difficulty recently. I've changed the mission description so it's technically ambiguous, but it should either be nailed down to "random" or listing the exact aces. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 13:55, <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">1 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed that in one of the gameplay videos they talk about Huckebein and at that time i was thinking if it was pops' code name. In the video, galm squadron chases him then i think the rot squadron shows up and the Galm squadron turns around and fights. I have heard rumors that at some time or another we will be able to see bartlett and pops. so i was wondering if they were true. thepeacemaker</p>

<p>It looks like you cannot choose planes for pixy. Every picture that shows pixy and the player shows that Pixy uses his trusty F-15. Not saying this is a downside but it would have helped if we could've chosen planes for our wingmen.ThePeaceMaker</p>

<dd>It's kind of natural if you ask me. Would you feel nice if someone else choose the plane you're going to fly in the mission? Maybe pixy has some sort of emotional attachment to his F-15.

<dd>By the looks of the trailer (if you pause it or play it real slow) one J35 Draken and one RAFELE M make up her (The woman of undying faith) squadron. But I can't be certain. The Squad of SU-47 Berkuts is actually the same squad you fight in the last mission of Ace Combat 5 right before you take down the SOLG, the Gault Squadron. With regards to PJ he becomes your full time copilot after &lt;MASSIVE SPOILERS&gt; Pixy defects to "A World with no Boundaries" mercenary group and tries to shoot you down and fails. Though Pixy comes back and rips through and kills PJ with a TLS equiped ADFX-02 (experimental version of the FALKEN) &lt;/MASSIVE SPOILERS&gt;.

<dd>Nah. Let the people find out for themselves. If you tell a person what the outcome will be, it won't be so much fun. I down aces because I want to listen to their life story in the Assault Records. If someone tells me that n Ace dies in n way, it takes the fun out of doing the missions over after you beat them on all the styles. The aces are in there because they're an added replayability factor. Don't you wish you could read the life story of "Cypher" from Fortress or that female F-14D ace in Mission 3 in Ace Combat 5?

<p>Just found out some more info, the ADFX-02 what Pixy uses against Cipher (and PJ) is equiped with all three special weapons. So you have to contend with the Tactical Laser System, Ballistic Missles and a Infinite ECM pod&#160;:| (Also this is what makes the ADFX-02 different to the ADFX-01, 02 has all the special weapons equiped where as the playable ADFX-01 only can be equiped with one special weapon per mission). I would add this to the wiki but IMO it gives away the most interesting part of Zero's story line and I don't want to spoil it for the general public just yet&#160;:) Maybe after the US release of the game. I also confirmed that The Woman of Undying Faith is apart of a 2 person squad named "Espada" and pilots a RAFALE M. Her wingman/woman pilots a J35J Draken. DXPetti</p>
<dl>
<dd>The ADFX 01 and 02 are exactly the same plane and have exactly the same specifications. The 02 plane does not have all three weapons equipped at the same time. It switches from TLS to MPBM to ECMP after you damage it enough. In essence, you have to "down" the plane three times to beat it. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 07:57, <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_28.html" title="March 28">28 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Close to 90% of the game is in English in one form or another. MOST of the menus are entirely in English with only a very few things in Japanese (options descriptions, and things like that), but they're pretty easy to figure out if you're familiar with the options of most games. All of the audio can be selected from either JP or EN when you start a new game, but subtitles come in only Japanese and two options: on or off. So, if you want to know what a de/briefing is about, just listen to the announcer. Anybody with a decent knowledge of English who has played Ace Combat 4 or 5 will be able to pick this game up with absolutely no problems. The only thing that I'm not sure about is how to "unlock" the Falken. It's definitely not memory-card data-based (most likely all S ranking somewhere or another). Yes, the game was a bit short on a single playthrough, but I've yet to beat every level on each M/S/K ranking. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 16:18, <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_23.html" title="March 23">23 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1 method of unlocking the FALKEN and the X-02 is memory card based. You have to have AC4 and AC5 saves but the only catch is the saves have to be from AC4 and AC5 in the same region as your copy of AC0. In other words saves from North American copies of AC4 and AC5 wont work with a Japanese copy of AC0.

<dd>I finished AC0 for the first time tonight but I didn't unlock the X-02 or the FALKEN. I think it must be because my saves from AC4 and 5 are NTSC and my copy of AC0 is JAP.

<dd>I got AC0 today, and unlocked the X-02 after beating the first mission. I have AC04 and AC5 saves, all beaten on Ace. Although the X-02 costs an exorbirant amount of money (200k-ish) and you can't afford it for most of the first playthrough. I have not unlocked the ADF-01 as of yet. AC0 is a wonderful game. In mission 7, I was 300 points from the 16000 point goal, when I got shot down by an unexpected missile. - <a href="../../../r/p/h/User%7ERPharazon_748c.html" title="User:RPharazon">RPharazon</a> 03:39, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_27.html" title="April 27">27 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found at the end of the Trivia section, it says "there is an ace called Regen as in reference to Ronald Regan. he flys a F-117." I doubt it's a reference to Ronald REAGAN (see the link, also). Am I right about it not being a reference, or is it?</p>

<dd>Personally, whenever I see "Regen" I associate it with the Final Fantasy magic spell Regen which recovers health.

<p>I propose a new policy of Trivia. All trivia facts must be posted in the talk page before addition to the article for public inquiry. The Trivia section is getting huge and hard to maintain, and I'm not entirely sure that all the so called 'facts' are actually true and pertain to the game. There have been too many dumb and fake trivia postings that I think come from a certain site of fanboys and misled people. All we need to do is put a "Please visit the Talk page before adding any facts to the Trivia" sign at the beginning of the section. Any agreements, comments, disagreements? - <a href="../../../r/p/h/User%7ERPharazon_748c.html" title="User:RPharazon">RPharazon</a> 14:04, <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">28 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)</p>

<p>This isn't to dispute PJ's death but the deaths of Crow 1 and Crow 2. Where does it specifically state that these two were killed? In The Stage Of Apocalypse, after the nuclear detonations, Crow 1 and Crow 2 can both be heard on the radio, and throughout the remainder of the mission all three Crow aircraft are in the air. Perhaps their deaths have been assumed because they no longer appear in any other missions? I think the (KIA) tags should be removed. (MIA) may be acceptable but whenever I play that mission I naturally assume that Pixy is the only one who is not accounted for.

<p>It never actually clarifies in game what happened to these 2, I thought they were supposed to be killed in the explosion, as it doesnt show them on the radar after it occurs, until and unless there is ever proof that they survived, I think the part about them being reassigned should be left out.</p>
<p>They're not dead. Crow Team is still flying a 3-plane formation, theres still a blue radar signature, so fly toward that, and you see 3 planes. Crow 1 and 2 survive the blast.</p>

<p>This reads a lot less like an encyclopedia article than a GameFAQS walk-through. It is not within the scope of a general encyclopedia to list every airplane in a game, nor how to earn every medal, nor list all of the characters and missions. There is probably a game walk-through wiki out there that would gladly take this kind of information, but Wikipedia ain't it. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 15:16, <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_18.html" title="July 18">18 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe transwiki to <a href="http://strategywiki.net/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://strategywiki.net/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">StrategyWiki</a>?

<p>Nevermind, they're currently in the process of switching away from GFDL to a custom license they're working on that's tightly based on Creative Commons.

<p>Alright, I've done a lot of trimming. The characters section needs to be rebuilt with just a brief amount of info on the main character, Solo Wing Pixy, PJ, the narrator, and, uhh, anyone else who's majorly notable.

<p>I think the Trivia section is fine as it is. It is not uncommon to see this kind of secition in wiki, especially when we consider the fact how many people love to find out interesting facts and real world counterparts behind a game/film. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>NoName</b></span></a></p>
<p>Well, I think the Trivia section is a bit too gigantic for its own good. It's just as big as the rest of the article, and some of the things there have bad spelling and grammar. I'd rather see it gone, moved to a special article ("Trivia in the Ace Combat Series" or something) or just trimmed and weeded. - <a href="../../../r/p/h/User%7ERPharazon_748c.html" title="User:RPharazon">RPharazon</a> 22:07, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">2 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Okay, I've brought back a trimmed characters section and trimmed the trivia section somewhat, I still think the Trivia section should be moved to it's own article with a few good ones left in the main ACO article.<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurning_phoneix_fbe2.html" title="User:Burning phoneix">Burning phoneix</a> 22:14, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_31.html" title="August 31">31 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Not this "stuff" again! Both the Ace Combat 5 and Ace Combat 4 have full mission descriptions AND full aircraft tables which ARE different from Zero's. Wikipedia is a storehouse of information that transcends the accepted idea of a dictionary by allowing a deeper wealth of knowledge and inteconnectivity between ideas and articles.

Err... You sure about that? I was pretty sure it was June 6. I don't remember anything about August. I was pretty sure that in the cutscene the guy said June 6.........

<p>Well first i think they should have a squadren maker. Where you make a squadren name, plane, colors, and pilot names. Ace Combat Zero had great music and Ace dogfights. So what they should do is make things kinda realistic like not haveing 10 on 2 aircraft. Now i want to know if anyone has a storyline that the new game should have. ONLINE GAMEPLAY MUST BE ADDED!</p>
<p><br />
Dogfight Dialog by me ______________________________</p>
<p><br />
you finish a bombing mission</p>
<p>plane 2 "Nice work Cipher!"</p>
<p>plane 3 "Belkas supply line has been destroyed"</p>
<p>plane 2 "Yo Cipher! Ever hear the song 'The Candy Shop'?"</p>
<p>AWACS "Galm team four aircraft approching, theres no time to head back eleminate the enemy pilots and get back home"</p>
<p>plane 4 "Oh great Belkan Aces..."</p>
<p>plane 2 "So #4 this will be your first dogfight right?"</p>
<p>plane 4 "yeah."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Four enemy planes fly in</p>
<p>Enemy squadren is called 'Team Sabre' put that music from mission three during the fight with indigo team</p>
<p>Sabre1 "Look Ustios best pilots"</p>
<p>Sabre2 "We're late."</p>
<p>Sabre1 "You pilots fight for a lost cause"</p>
<p>plane 2 "Lost cause!?"</p>
<p>Sabre1 "Target the leader"</p>
<p>after 35 secs</p>
<p>Sabre1 "Damn Ustios! How you get so good!?"</p>
<p>plane 3 "We fight for a right cause thats why!"</p>
<p>Sabre1 "No matter what side your on the country you serve is always good"</p>
<p>1 plane down by u or squad mate</p>
<p>Sabre1 "This is fun"</p>
<p>Sabre2 "Sabre 4 is down"</p>
<p>2nd palne down</p>
<p>Sabre1 "Those bastards!"</p>
<p>Sabre3 "don't let'em win this!"</p>
<p>3rd plane down</p>
<p>Sabre3 screams in pain</p>
<p>Sabre1 "Damn it! Those bastards know what their doing!"</p>
<p>plane 2 "Let me take'em down Cipher!"</p>
<p>Sabre1 "you! demon lord! how did you learn to fly so good?"</p>
<p>Final plane down</p>
<p>Sabre1 "Damn!!!!!"</p>
<p>plane 3 "Whoa that was a hell of a dogfight!"</p>
<p>AWACS "You did it again! good work guys! get over hear so we can celebrate!"</p>
<p>plane 2 "It's sad..."</p>
<p>plane 4 "what's sad?"</p>
<p>plane 2 "They sucked so badly! ha ha ha!"</p>
<p>End</p>
<p>IF YOU DIE THE DIALOG IS</p>
<p>plane 3 "Damn it!!!! Cipher is down!"</p>
<p>Sabre1 "Wilddog 1 is down! ha! i knew they couldn't win!"</p>

<p>I've just completed the game (again) and I've watched the last cutscene. I think that the guy who says: "I bailed out here, the catain was gone. I've lived a comfartable life since then, and I probably have him to thank for that." Is PJ. You don't see his face but the camera is panning across pictures of two men, and a woman and two children. This could be a reference that PJ's girlfriend, who his wingmates annoy him about on various missions, has 2 children with PJ.</p>
<p>As for the part with the airoplane part with flowers laid on it. Didn't it say that Cipher dissapeard after the mission (or war). So many peope who "Watched him go off on sortie" (Pixy), his 'fans' may presume he was killed. But that is just a assumation, because it shows Ciphr landing, doesn't it? Please post your thoughts on this. Thanks. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerrado_da1a.html" title="User:Gerrado">Gerrado</a> 12:14, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I'm Villakid and that was not PJ. That was Gelb 2 who was shot down and lived in the capital of ustio. The other guy in the picture was his captin who was killed fighting with Galm. Villakid 1:15 18 March 2007</p>
<p>But he sounds different. If you compare the two voices they sound different. (I'm losing my argument) --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerrado_da1a.html" title="User:Gerrado">Gerrado</a> 19:04, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I havn't seen the video in a while but i think the bed of flowers with a piece of metal is the mark that shows that P.J is dead. If it has a heart mark on it that's his plane.Villakid March 19</p>
<p>Dude, that was Gelb 2. Watch the first interview with him.</p>
<p>This is villakid again. It is P.J's plane. the picture of the metal slab has the crow team symbol. HE'S DEAD!</p>
