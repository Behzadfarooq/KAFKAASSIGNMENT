<p>Maybe we should use the forward slash, that is the way the other Spider-Man pages distinguish characters. It could be assumed that it would be the best way to go about things, to follow how the previous pages note them. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 21:06, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right. Maybe we should start saying "Pwn" instead of "own", too. I want to pwn a car, et cetera. Give them an inch...you know the rest. Direct me to articles I can fix. This is bad grammar no better than not spacing after using commas or caps abuse. I'm really surprised you'd cave like this after all you went through to keep spec out. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">Talk to the Ace</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ace_Class_Shadow_7799.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ace Class Shadow">See what I've edited</a>. 21:10, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's hardly caving, I've just never put the effort into fighting to keep the forward slash with the aliases. That is the way they appear in the credits, and the way the other two Spider-Man pages distinguish between character aliases. It's just fair to keep all the associated pages together. If you have 5 Batman pages, you don't call him by a different name on each page, do you? I think in this case it may be best to go with the "pwn" crowd (even though it pains me to even say pwn..cause I want to smack people for actually saying that). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 21:37, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, i'm tucking this in this section so it's not so obivous... take a deep breath on the Spider-Man 3 page. Most of the editors who actually use the talk page there really want to help... some are dumb, but they mostly mean well there.

<p>Hey, just to let you know, there is no page called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_burden_of_proof.html" title="The burden of proof">the burden of proof</a>. However, seeing it makes me wonder if it wouldn't do a lot of good for those of us who pay attention to the future comic-themed films to pursue a 'Wikipedia:Burden of Proof' page, or find somethign with the same purpose and create a linking header template for adding to such films, instead of what was previously done at the The Dark Knight page by Erikster and myself, putting a comment warning of the need for citations. Thoughts? <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 17:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm. Well, clear policy about citations and such would certainly help.

<dd>Alright, give me a little time to look around wiki, and if I find nothing, I'll try to comp up some text for the template box, post it here, and after agreement, create a subpage off my userpage for staging, and we'll work from there.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 17:45, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Or not. I've got to find a place for it, because the citation templates are for creating citations, not for asking for such citations. I'll ask over there, find a place for it.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 18:09, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

I intended the template to be on the Talk page, not the main page. I'm not sure if putting it on the article itself is confrontational or not.

<dd>Well, you worded it very nicely. It doubt anyone would take offense or want to remove it—for non-vandalous reasons—any time soon. Honestly, though, I also sometimes wonder what good templates do on talk pages. Look {{<a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EControversial_f891.html" title="Template:Controversial">controversial</a>}}. Someone can just, like, look up any "controversial article" and edit it at their leisure. No sign of a problem. No thought to facts, tension or disputes. With something like this, especially, I'd think that it's critical we place it on the top front page. Even a simple change to the cast would need some sort of source. Plus, it's not so much a "matter of fact" or "this needs to stay (out of sight)" thing like..."this got a grade A! lol". The template would be largely useless after all the facts have been gathered. However, right now we can't even prove Holmes is in or out. That's...bad. Then there's this between stuff and the Harvey Dent casting. It's not <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a>, but if the casting of the Joker is any example, this is an article which needs a majority of it's edits to include citations. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">Talk to the Ace</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ace_Class_Shadow_7799.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ace Class Shadow">See what I've edited</a>. 04:25, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah. Well, I'm mostly about maintainance with upgrades. Don't necessarily known how to fix it, but I suppose the place to start would be the "internet leaks" section. It's probably the most blatent issue. There and other places in the article, most of the external links could stand be transformed—forgive the pun—into proper references. Statements about "fan reaction" or "controversy" should probably be removed or changed. As mentioned on the talk page, there probably shouldn't be too many instances of nicknames being used over real names.

<dd>(here's as good a place as any...) I like the split reflection image you made and added to the SM3 page... I wonder though, is there an 'original' comics page image available? That would probably be even better if available, and eliminate the 'middle step' of the cartoon. We've seen other covers and such built into the films as shots, (like the trash can costume shot, peter's back to the viewer walking away in #2). Just a thought...

<dd>A new section would have been fine. It's easy to archive my usertalk if I feel the need. Oh and thanks for adding me. I really dig that what I'm doing is really appreciated. Now then, the comic image in question is far less relavent, I'm afraid. For starters, the SG cover is not the originator. The bonding, history, character, time of day, positions, etc are all different. Still, I'll let you see your yourself. <a href="http://spyder-25.com/covers/spider_girl/spidergirl76.jpg" class="external text" title="http://spyder-25.com/covers/spider_girl/spidergirl76.jpg" rel="nofollow">click here</a>. I do see a similarity in how the symbiote is coating/immitating the costumes of SG and Movie-Spidey, but with the differences outweighing the similarities, I'd rather not complicate things by trying to show all three images. I think i'll change the text in the trivia section and mention this on the article talk page. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">Talk to the Ace</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ace_Class_Shadow_7799.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ace Class Shadow">See what I've edited</a>. 21:42, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>NOt what I meant. What I was getting at was that I suspect that there's a panel or cover from the late 80's, right when the whole 'suit is teh ebil' story started, that that scene is meant to evoke, like the aforementioned trashcan suit shot. I may be wrong, but clearly, the cartoon predates the spidergirl cover, and I wonder if there isn't an actual spiderman comic cover which predates the cartoon. It is that original shot which i'm interested in. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 23:22, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nah. I see where you're coming from, Basi-Boy, but it's a perfectly fine term. No worse than "BTW" or "NPOV". I use it to quickly point out the difference between GIPUs and...say...registered Wikipedians. I'm not saying GIPUs shouldn't be allowed to edit, just know their accountless place. I mean...if you have an account, use it. Don't hide behind an IP address. Also, I've found that there are certain generalities relating to unregistered users. They do tend to make moire mistakes and be less aware of Wikipedia's policies. Also, they don't seem to respect registered users. I mean, if I didn't have the courage, integrity and/or dedication to register, I'd respect those who did. And you. You, yourself, seem to change (for the worse) when you're in that GIPU guise.

<p>Geeze, Ace... I keep your talk on my watchlist for bot hthe common pages watches we have, AND the comedy value, but... really, dude. Don't ask him his race like that. No one can tell yours, so no one can tell if you use brother as a sign of camaraderie, or derision, or out of ignorance, or what. Finally, I agree that those who have accounts should use them and not hide behind passive-agressive GIPU/acc't behaviors. However, if it becomes an issue, remember we already have sockpuppet remedies for that. I don't think Bas counts for that though... <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 20:50, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Really? Well...&gt;.&gt; I'm black. I know I act like a crazy white boy, but I digress. I don't usually say "brother", but I thought he'd react better to it. I can't say I understand him, but I if he <i>is</i> black, it would at least explain a bit. He might take "boy" to be condescending or something statement of his inferiority/immaturity.

<dd>I speak my mind. I know it's a rare trait around here, but I do. Forgive me if I don't thank vandals for "experimenting" and such. Admittedly, Cyber's a good guy who just made a mistake. Still, he seemed to be a bit careless and hurried (or "tired", in his words). Looking at the situation, I suppose could have been a bit nicer, but I didn't feel like it. I don't want to put on the nice ("Hey! BTW, you kinda made a little mistake; nothing serious.") front. He was presenting a new, misspelled category and including it in multiple pages. Category's aren't my speciality, but I'm pretty sure they need to use proper spelling. And later, he still tried to add a nonexistent category in place of the original. Sure, his category will probably get speedily renamed and become useful. However, looking at the facts and his actions, he seemed a little rude, too. Not in the overt way you might consider me to be, of course, but still. He's assertively called on a mistake and then makes another. In his position, I'd be mortified over the first error and just avoid the second as common sense.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Oh and speaking of rudeness...who, exactly, are you to be coming to me with this? From what I can see, it's A or B. A: Someone who forgot to log in. (ooh "tired" or hurried. You have stuff in common with Cyber already!) B: a person who did not register—commonly called a "GIPU"—and yet wants to tell a registered user about Wikipedia policy. No offense, but do you have any idea how insulting that is? You either didn't think I was important enough to log in for—he don't know me very well, do he, folks?—or want to pull a "I know better even though I couldn't possibly have any idea" move.</dd>

<dd>You're serious? Okay, look, if I wanted to lash out, I would have given you an eye-full at your talk page. The edit summary was just...writing how I feel. Comics are comics; JLU is no different. Also, everytime the information was added it looks sloppy. I couldn't unde understand what it meant the first time and had only a bit less trouble the second. Sectioning is one thing and very relative. I could understand that. However, when you put something in the wrong section and miswrite it, I can't tell if you're talking about an episode, action figure or anything else, for that matter. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">Talk to the Ace</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ace_Class_Shadow_7799.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ace Class Shadow">See what I've edited</a>. 07:37, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>However, I do have a suggestion for you. Since anyone who disagrees with you apparently is not only wrong but malicious, it is important that any Wikipedia article that uses the link <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blur.html" title="Blur">Blur</a> when referring to a band must be changed.

<p>Not "just removing." Changing. Fictional Americans is sufficient when the character is already otherwise classified as a DC character. And a lot of those characters have never been confirmed as American, even if they are operating in America. Anyway, this is just an answer to your question. The change bugged someone else too, so I'll leave it alone. (As for how we do things in Wikipedia, hey, the guidelines say to be bold. Of course, then if the consensus doesn't favor the bold move, be grown up enough to let it go.) <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 18:24, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know we've tlaked before about this, but you're kinda biting the newbs again over at the Spider-man 3 page. I know the guy asked sloppily, and so on, but don't drag it down to a forum level by replying.

<dd>Chris, I was serious about the medication. Anyway, thanks for using my talk page for this guys. (THAT'S sarcasm.) Seriously, though, I wasn't being sarcastic or even a mild dick, Rey. I just made a short—possibly unclear—comment like Chris would recommend. Then I get all this flack for stuff other users said/did to you, Rey? Not cool. (BTW, since I wasn't in this conversation—despite it being my TP—I'm excluded from Chris' "uncool" statement. I guess you losers are lucky to know me. (<a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html" title="Irony">Irony</a>/Kidding on the last statement.) But whatever, I don't hold grudges over this kinda stuff. I ain't mad at ya. Rey's not a "newb" though, X. Look at his contributions. I admit, I give off this "air of experience", as <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_Kent_46f6.html" title="Clark Kent">Clark Kent</a> would say, but I often find my "equals" and "lessers" still have many months to a year on me. The only newbs I know are people I've taken directly under my wing or stopped from vandalizing articles. Still, that doesn't matter. I wasn't talking to him as a newb or a pro, just someone who asked a weird question on an encyclopedia site. I honestly didn't care about policy. I just saw it as an honest mistake and tried to handle it nicely.

<p>Hey there. Hum... I was just unsure as to why you deleted my addition to the Heroes article. I added an IMPORTANT (well, seems to me that it will be very important anyway) element to the story at the main topic page, and you reverted it without any modification or comment. I just wondering why? I mean... it seems that the page was not blocked from editing for registered users, just to unregistered users. Also, I am aware that I have had no prior contributions, but that is because I did not feel there was anything I needed or could contribute to any articles prior to today. Just wondering if you could explain that to me, or alow me to re-add that information. Seems like you just want to keep the page to yourself. Sorry if that is not the case and I seem to be just judging without knowing better.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>Logan Pendragon</p>
<p>Hey there. Thanks for the reply and about being nice about how you did it. I'm a bit ashamed now, to perhaps let off more steam (though I hope not too much) than I should of over the topic. I'm replying right after getting your message, so I am thinking about what you said as I write.</p>
<p>I believe I see your point when it comes to the fact that this is an enciclopedia and thus, presents facts and not speculations. However, I believe that this does not have to be true for wikipedia. The show is in constant evolution as is the website. Therefore certain factitious speculations (n this case, just observations) should be availible to people. This is because this information is truely availible in a visible sense for people to access and begin speculation for themselves. More than this, if (in the particular case) that symbol is actually something that exists in the "real world" and has meaning in it, the availibility of this information online as a factitious piece, allows for users who come here seeking information and who might have some knowledge of some aspect of the availible information to then add it, making it less guesstimation work and more fact (even before actual development of the show).</p>
<p>These are however just my thoughts. I will try and become a more active participant here, and thus learn the ropes beter. I'll trust you to guide me through it in any site where you are coordinating. Seems like you have an interest in comics and movies - I can understand the passion.</p>
<p>Anyway. Thanks for reading what I have to say. Overall, I'd say you should reconsider and repost that information.</p>
<p>Laters bub.</p>

<p>I'd suggest that, in light of the nature of the information removed, your response could use a little more polish.

<p>Also, it is almost always best to discuss article edits on the <i>article</i> talk page. If someone makes a series of edits across several pages, for example, it might then be appropiate to raise it on the user talk page. But that was not the case here.</p>

<dd>Not to dogpile on you here, but I want to second what Brenneman is saying here. You are a colorful editor (and there's nothing wrong with that), just be aware that your responses may be received differently than you intend and that a harsh response can go a long way towards counteracting the whole purpose of wikipedia. I've been noticing that you sometimes skirt the lines of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/_/WP%7EPA_04e2.html" title="WP:PA">WP:PA</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>, and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> (especially when dealing with an anon or GIPU as you call them) from time to time. Just taking a look over your talk page, I also can't help but noticing how many strong reactions you elicit from fellow editors. That might be a sign. Remember that there is a difference between having a colorful personality and just being rude.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As a newer user myself, I started out editing as an anon just to kick the tires (I had my own reasons for not signing up, but it wasn't to avoid editing accountability). In contrast with Wikipedia's goal of building a better encyclopedia, the response that I got from some editors seemed very rude and elitist. Obviously I did end up deciding to register, and I don't post anonymously anymore, but I very nearly decided that editing wasn't for me because of peer responses. Instead, I've spent three months lurking around to get the handle on posting, precisely so that I wouldn't end up dealing with an abrasive peer. Sure, it probably means that my contributions are less likely to need cleanup from more seasoned editors, but it is counter-productive from our collective goal and makes me less willing to just <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a>. I would also say that I am the exception to the rule — for every one of me there are nine other people who just decide not to contribute instead. Even though it is encouraged for people to register, Wikipeda is <i>not</i> better off without anon contributions and everybody starts out as a newbie at some point.</dd>

<p>Reason why I put it in was because I noticed that the criticism is a small stub when it used to have a significantly substantial section. (A while back, there <i>was</i> criticism on cinetography, manner of presentation, etc. and I wonder why that was all removed.) Its not perfect in its initial form but as it the criticism section stands, it makes it look like it is ridiculing those that find fault with the movie. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldDragon_0042.html" title="User:GoldDragon">GoldDragon</a> 03:48, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why are you deleting that entire section on the evolution of Kazuma/Ryuho's Alters? It could use some rewriting, but the information it contains should definately be noted. -- The Norse 21:30, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for replying so colorfully to this, you're a real cut-up, y'know! The section deleted wasn't mine, it's just been there almost as far back as the article's creation and I was readding it, so there was no need to call <i>my</i> views and perceptions worthless and not notable. All it needed was a rewrite to make it sound like less of a personal view. As such, I still stand against the section's removal and that asinine OR rule because all information is "original research". If that section's information were published by some magazine, would it be anymore credible or valuable? No, it wouldn't. When a stale and convoluted policy asks for the removal of 1/5th of an article it's doing nothing but detracting from the site.

<dd>Ace, I'm gonna have to agree here. I saw this, and jumped through a few of your recent contributions. While I appreciate your work here, on many pages we edit in common, I've also noticed that you're getting very blunt and rude with people. I used to enjoy your straightforward talk, but it seems like you're experiencing a build-up of frustrations with the true pinheads, nitwits and idiots who vandalize wikipedia. Unfortunately, it looks like your retribution's cast with a wider net, which is catching some innocent newbs and some experienced editors who don't approach wikipedia like you do. I know I've talked to you about this before, and you've said you're fine. You're not fine, man. You're really being aggressive to some editors who ARE trying to help. It's hard to tell sometimes, but try to look at their contributions list or their talk pages to see what they've already done before reverting and making the comments that people take offense to. I've been guilty of it too, but I've been working on chilling, and reserving my ire for genuine ree-rees. I don't know how you'll take this, but I hope you take it as advice from someone who actually likes 90% of what I see you doing here, it's jsut this 10% that I hope to see change.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 03:19, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>People shouldn't take offense. When I started out, I knew just how little I counted and cherished not being reverted. I never editted as a GIPU. The first time an edit of mine was reverted, I made a calm, reasonable comment on the article's talk page. The guy made a mistake! He still believed he was largely right, but met me halfway. When myself or my edits are questioned, I take it, let it go or respond redirectly. I've taken offense and gotten personal, but only brought in a third party as a last resort. You notice I'm getting more responses from people I never talked to before? I don't know if they're watching me, the article, the other user, some combination or what, but it's annoying. If I offended someone, I'd like <i>them</i> to tell me. I don't want someone else, asked or butting in, to speak for them. Who says I'm wrong? Who asked them? What? I can't revert? I can say "this is inappropriate/vandalism/etc."? What can I do, then? Am I suypposed to ignore it? Revert without comment, never bringing their mistakes to their attention in upfront fashion? Make a comment on the talk page when this is a user issue? What? What do you people want? I'm a volunteer, too. I'm not a bully or ill-intentioned. I can be nice. I <b>have</b> been nice. Do I say, "you suck! Quit editting! STFU, newb!"? What have I done wrong?! <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">User talk:Ace Class Shadow</a>. 03:36, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>YOu can revert, you can edit, and you can bring up issues with edits on talk pages and user pages. But for example, shouting 'what the FUCK?' in your edit summary on Heroes??? that's just vulgarity for the sake of shock value and temper. Ace, I'm not asking you to leave wiki or anything ridiculous like that. Let me try putting it this way. Remember your early work on wiki, and think about the first few editors who talked nicely to you and guided you. Try to approach others in the same manner, and see if things work smoother more often. (and a final note, good work on that TDK casting section.) <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 03:42, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>ACE&gt;</b> You're hitting the nail's head. I've gone through your edits and you are a good contributer. You make a lot of good edits (and some bad). What you need to control is your tendency to conclude that your edits are <i>superior</i> to others. Keep your summaries to the <i>content</i>. You too often editorialize on the <i>editor.</i> If you feel that a previous edit was better, <b>say so</b> --&gt;<i>rv to previous ver. more encylclopedic</i>. Something like that. If you want to make a comment to the prev. editor, make it constructive like <i>Hey, I reverted your edit because I think that you were overly speculative. If you have any questions or want some advice, let me know! &lt;SMILE&gt;</i></dd>
<dd>Just stop being so combative. You're going to get yourself into a pile. And, I have <b>NO PROBLEM</b> throwing jackassy newbie-biters into a pile.&#160;:) <a href="../../../e/l/l/User_talk%7EElliskev_db08.html" title="User talk:Elliskev">Elliskev</a> 03:53, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't bite newbs, especially not by intent. I've made an effort to make my comments more about edits than the user. Still, if my comments make a GIPU or new Wikipedian think "Oh, gees. I messed up. Okay." I think I'm helping, Tell me, what, exactly, brought this on? Were you asked to contact me? Did you just think "Oh, heavens! This jackass—his words, folks, not mine—needs to be taught a lessen...possibly with piling!" Seriously, what "bad" are you referring to? I don't go out and comment on a user page with the intention of "biting" or being combatantive, but I'm not going to put on an act like you, either. Tell me, if I only made the kind of comments you seem to find objectionable with senior users, would you even have a problem? If not, take a good look at yourself. That's a far worse hypocrisy than not being polite when you tell others too. I see now what the real problem is. I treat new users the same way I treat old ones, right or wrong. That's not newbie biting. It's more...equality. And if you don't like it, tell someone. Please, by all means, "pile" me or whatever. I'm obviously a repeat offend and I'd rather just get this over with. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">User talk:Ace Class Shadow</a>. 04:40, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Your move was probably the correct one, and I have expressed support for it in the de facto "poll" that has sprung up, and protected the redirect, too. Your edit summary, though ("Obvious. If you can't see a problem, I'd recommend a mental examination"), was not helpful. Normally, I wouldn't even issue a warning for this, but it seems you've had trouble with civility before. Please be very careful to use dispassionate language. It appears you are treading close to a block, which I'd hate to see, given that the offending conduct is so easy to cease.

<p>Those lists need some serious cleanup. I see that you've done some work on them. I found some pranks on the male page.

<p>Right. It's a recreation of a previously deleted article with no new information, thus liable for speedy deletion. The appropriate tag is {{db-repost}}. I've placed it, and the article should be gone very soon. If it continues to be a problem, the page can be protected against re-creation.

<p>I'm getting mixed signals. I could be an admin or get blocked? Some crossroads. How 'bout neither? If I'm ever admin material, I'd recommend revising the qualifications.

Could I suggest that mundane editorial disagreements are most likely to resolve quickly and productively when editors observe the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remain polite per <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a>.</li>
<li>Solicit feedback and ask questions. This can be done without any formal procedure on article and user talk pages. For instance, "One question: why didn't you move the article to Siege of Orleans? That is certainly the more appropriate name. So, before I move it, I thought I would ask if there was some reason for your not having moved it already."</li>
<li>Keep the discussion focused. Concentrate on a small set of related matters and resolve them to the satisfaction of all parties. Afterward open unrelated issues as a separate discussion.</li>
<li>Use bullet points to organize a discussion that includes several matters.</li>
<li>Focus on the subject rather than on the personalities of the editors.</li>
</ul>
