<p>The instructions given in this article for acetone peroxide production are not very good and seem out of place. I looked at other Wikipedia articles on chemical substances, and none gave instructions as detailed as those given here for amateur production. Neither is it customary for print encyclopedias to give this sort of detailed how-to for preparing chemical substances. I would suggest replacing the instructions for production with references to chemistry literature containing such instructions, like the older edition of <i>Chemical Demonstrations</i> by Shakhashiri. But I am a newly registered user here so I would like to get some input rather than immediately making the modification. Should the instructions for home production be removed from this article, or should I begin adding how-to instructions to the other articles on explosives as well?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it is not encyclopedic content. Certainly, one would not expect to find such synthesis steps in say, the Encyclopedia Britannica. Similar content has been removed from related chemistry pages, and following this lead, I have removed this content from this page too. See for example the history in <a href="../../../t/n/p/TNP_4ace.html" title="TNP">TNP</a>. I think the alternative you suggested - adding references to chemistry literature - is a suitable one.

<p>I do not believe that the individual elements in chemical formulae should have links to their base articles. Both the steady state formula and the oxidation process would read more easily without the links and the use of links becomes repetitious and distracting. I have looked at other articles (eg hydrocarbons) and they do not use such links (I admit that others such as Oxidation do but they are difficult to read). I suggest removing them. Thoughts?</p>
<dl>
<dd>They seem to be linked like this more commonly in inorganic chemicals than organic ones. If the chemical has a page, the formula should link to that, not the elements. For the formula of the chemical that the page is about, it is ok to link to elements.--24.16.148.75 02:00, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do "Shock sensitivity 0.3NM" and "Friction sensitivity unknown, possibly as low as .1NM" mean? Firstly, the notation is not like that of any commonly known standard unit (<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_31_13dd.html" title="ISO 31">ISO 31</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_ce77.html" title="SI">SI</a>, etc.). Was that meant to be "Nm" (newton meters), for example? Even if, such a unit can be related to a "sensitivity" only via some conventional test, so a link to the standard specifying the test setup is clearly needed here. At present, these figures are utterly meaningless and should be removed unless someone can link to accurate information regarding the unit and test method. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkus_Kuhn_4bd1.html" title="User:Markus Kuhn">Markus Kuhn</a> 11:17, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The statement "the products formed by disintegration and recombination of its molecular components (in case of TATP, three molecules of acetone and two molecules of ozone)" can't be correct because there are only 3 oxygen atoms left over, so they'll form just 1 molecule of ozone.</p>

<p>if I remember my organic chemistry, the acid acts as a "catalyst" by absorbing the water and thus you should concentrated sulfuric acid.</p>

<dd>My information is that HMTD, not TATP was used in the London bombings. Neither was TATP going to be used in the latest aircraft bombings. This is a different peroxide-based liquid explosive. The Russians have something similiar in a rocket called an RPOA. It is a single shot rocket, like a LAW rocket, designed to destroy bunkers.

<p>I was somewhat embarrished after reading the article on TATP in the NRC last afternoon and I indeed saw a link to a evil-destructive looking site.</p>
<p>Since a couple of months I enjoyed this free encyclopedia as a true form of ENLIGHTMENT in the sense of Voltaire and Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>As an older chemical engineer of 60 years I appreciated the articles on sciences and on music very much. I enjoyed broadening my mind on Gamma functions as extension of the integer number faculty, listening to the Etudes Symfoniques of Robert Schumann , your clear transparant explanations on hydrodynamics, magnetism etc etc.</p>
<p>In fat I was a somewhat irritated with my quality newspaper nrc as they called this enlighted encyclopedia an anarchistic one, serving terrorists/ murderers of 55 innocent citizans on their way to work in London. Regretably I noticed that one link indeed looked destructive to menkind. The redaction of Wikipedia should be very carefully in selecting their links.</p>
<p>Links to evil-destructive sites (with respect to bomb-recipes) make this enlightening encyclopedia vulnerable for the counteractions of the establishment, petit bourgeoisy and commercial market players on scienific publications.</p>
<p>It evokes measures which might smother this encyclopedia as scource of enlightment. Then your reader is thrown back in the 'restauration', as the market economy prefers Al Bundy typs above Benjamin Franklin types&#160;!</p>
<p>Ergo: Please be carefull in selecting links w.r.t. tools / aids for terrorists.<br />

<p>May be you are wright, mr. Quill. The same journalist who earlier named wikipedia an 'anarchistic' encyclopia wrote a detailed article in the NRC describing timers for 'kitchen made'bombs, inclusive a detailed sketch. I better start calling the NRC an anarchistic newspaper.</p>

<p>On the subject of palestinians killed while making the explosive, calling them either "terrorists" or "freedom fighters" is POV.</p>

<p>It is POV because it begs an edit war.</p>

<dl>
<dd>First of all, just because something starts an edit war doesn't mean its POV. There are many reasons for them. In this case, I felt that just saying "Palestinians" by itself implied that, by and large, the Palestinians like playing with acetone peroxide. And because, generally, one doesn't just play with a chemical such as Acetone Peroxide in an area of violence such as Palestine without having intentions to blow things up, it was fair to say that the people that were handling it were terrorists. I think its naive to <i>not</i> say that the 40 Palestinians that were killed handling TATP were terrorists... what else are they going to be? The source that is quoted gives the quote and then states something along the lines of "TATP is almost exclusively used by Palestinian terrorists." I think its ok to say that the people killed were terrorists. I <i>don't</i> think its ok to imply that all Palestinians play with explosives. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Pollo_Diablo_def4.html" title="User:El Pollo Diablo">El Pollo Diablo</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/_/User_talk%7EEl_Pollo_Diablo_1f7c.html" title="User talk:El Pollo Diablo">Talk</a> 23:21, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because Palestinians engaged in armed struggle against a colonial occupational settler state such as the Zionist Entity are not considerede terrorists by many. This is why it is POV.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For example, many consider the actions of the Zionist Entity government to be terrorist, this is also POV.</p>
<p>As to Jayjg's boneheaded comment, that is only true if your POV is that all military actions are terorrism, and even then, it is POV!!! The point is not to discuss if Palestinians who engage in armed actions are terrorists or freedom fighters, but if describing them as either is POV. Which it is.

I believe that, whilst Wikipedia is not paper, it is incumbent on us to behave responsibly, and to not bring this site into disrepute. In the UK it is proposed that providing assistance to someone creating bombs (including websites) will be illegal, and I'm sure that homeland security in the USA takes a similar view on the matter, let alone the views of other countries around the world. There is also the danger that we could assist "inquisitive" people to blow themselves up in their garages. I believe that WP must be seen as sensible and trustworthy on this matter and that whilst it is right that we continue to inform about chemicals we should not condone, enable or assist in any way anyone to make bombs or explosives.</dd>

<p>I would also add that, in my view, were we to list such details of how to create explosives then should someone decide to do so and later point to WP as the source of that information then we could be open to legal action.

<p><b>People can easily find how to make Acetone Peroxide and other explosives.</b> Some of this knowledge is even taught at school at the chemistry classes. Preventing accidents by hiding the information is impossible because you can't remove it from everywhere. Because of that people should provide better, clean and correct articles. <i>We shouldn't encourage bomb making. It's personnal decision with personnal responsibility.</i> But providing the correct information can also save a life, as bombs are not always made with bad intentions. Evil-destructive sites should be distinguished from Informational sites. <i>Moral and education are not the same thing</i>, despite closely tied. If they were the same thing then the inventors should take the responsibility for the damage brought by their inventions, not the ones that used them or intended their use (think of the nuclear bomb). I think the place for the instructions is at <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis:Acetone_peroxide_synthesis" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Chemical_synthesis:Acetone_peroxide_synthesis">Wikibooks</a> and some professional chemist like mr/mrs Hanzeman should pay attention to it.</p>

<p>In my opinion it is Wikipedia's duty to record knowledge and knowing how to make TATP isn't the cause of terrorism. I do think that the Wikipedia article should include a history of TATP's use in bomb making though. In my opinion highlighting the human tragedy caused by bombs will be a more effective deterrent to bomb making than the minor inconvenience of having to go to another website for TATP info. Would you rather a potential bomber get their TATP info from a website that appeals to them to use that knowledge humanely, or one that screams at them to kill as many people as possible? <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/tatp.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/tatp.htm" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a reference to some of TATP's bomb making history. <a href="../../../2/0/2/User%7E202.154.105.254.html" title="User:202.154.105.254">202.154.105.254</a> 04:00, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Confronted with an easy to make explosive compound, the choise presented to Wikipedia is simple. Do we engage in censorship, or do we stand by our principles of unrestricted access to information?</p>
<p>Let me say that when I was a young and reckless I made this stuff in fairly large quantities. I got the information from professional chemistry literature, not one of your run of the mill do it yourself guides. I was lucky to have stopped my activities before I hurt myself, but I've had close calls. Once 50grams of the compound was drying and denoted without reason (I had just walked away) blowing out all the front windows of our house.</p>
<p>So kids who want to make this are inherently curious by nature and its very sad if you kill that wonderful trait by denying it and throwing up obstacles. What you must do instead is provide accurate and professional information with [i]lot's[/i] of warnings. We musn't allow 'the terrorists' to play a role in this. If someone wants to wreak havoc they'll find a way. They too have chemists.</p>
<p>But above all, I propose to keep the information contained in this article professional, by removing the references to where to get the various compounds in household articles. This makes the article resemble too much as a cookbook and is the purpose to guide youngsters to how to make this step by step? If they really want to, let them find out on their own where to get acetone or hydrogen peroxide. 82.72.43.69 14:19, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree - the risk is not that terorists will use Wikipaedia; it is that many ordinary children and others with no evil intention will show foolish curiosity when given explicit instructions for an exciting explosion. The method is of no general value, so omit it. Adults don't give razors to babies, either. <a href="../../../j/e/z/User%7EJezzabr_f3fe.html" title="User:Jezzabr">Jezza</a> 12:00, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If somebody really wants to make explosives nobody can stop him, but children should not have direct access to the really simple methodes. A synthesis procedure for TNT or Sarin is harmless for children, because they will never get the necessary chemicals. With terrorists its basically the other way round. So lets give not perfect cooking book recepies, but state the danger.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_0f5f.html" title="User:Stone">Stone</a> 12:05, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>don't be so sure. Without going into details, TNT is made out of toluene, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid. Toluene is a common solvent under a common name everybody knows, and both the acids are readily obtained from car batteries and fertilizer. Albester 14:36, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In acetone peroxide, mode of explosion, OK, but for the synthesis not more than a oneliner with a very rough synthesis: 'acetone peroxide is synthesised from a controlled, acid-catalysed, oxidation of acetone with hydrogen peroxide.(ref) (full stop)' (and I would be gratefull if all other articles in chemistry would obey the same, even if they don't do that at the moment, so please don't use that as an argument). --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 09:51, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I feel like cutting it down even further .. what about 'catalyzed oxidation of acetone.' or even 'controlled oxidation of acetone.'

<dd>i may be missing something, but.. inclusion of this sentence fragment doesn't make any sense. every news outlet is talking about "peroxide-based" <b>liquid</b> explosives, which are banned from carry-on luggage in the US and the UK. the word "liquid" doesn't even appear once in this article. not even out of context! the most likely liquid peroxide explosive in this plot was <a href="../../../m/e/k/MEKP_6d4e.html" title="MEKP">MEKP</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathans_2823.html" title="User:Jonathans">jon</a> 14:48, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article claimed that TATP was used in "toy fireworks of the 'snapper' or 'torpedo' type" until a BoingBoing reader exposed that as a hoax today. It was changed to claim that this was a "rumor" which was false, or to be precise, it was a rumor started four days ago by a false addition to a Wikipedia article.

<p>Blogs are not reliable sources, and the sentence referring to conspiracy theorists is unhelpful, and POV.

<p>Isn't acetone peroxide the wrong name, as acetone already is the oxide? It should be 2,2-acetonediyl peroxide, 2-oxyacetone, acetanedione, or acetone oxide. (I'v another rant when it comes to aromatics.) -lysdexia 16:19, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gotta be careful to avoid mixing it up with dimethyl dioxirane, of which acetone peroxide is something like a dimer (or trimer). Acetone oxide is an actual compound that is unlike any of these--it's structurally a carbonyl oxide, not a peroxide; see the fragmented intermediate in an <a href="../../../o/z/o/Ozonolysis_reaction.html" title="Ozonolysis reaction">ozonolysis reaction</a> for an example.
