	    <p><b>ACES Educational Center for the Arts</b>, or ECA, is an American public arts magnet high school located at 55 Audubon Street in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Haven_5452.html" title="New Haven">New Haven</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>. The school is primarily located in the former Mishkan Israel synagogue with studio spaces across the street. The school has two theatres - the Arts Hall in the main building, and the Little Theatre at 1 Lincoln Street - and multiple gallery spaces throughout the main building. The school is made of approximately 260 students and is divided into five distinct departments: Music, Dance, Theatre, Creative Writing, and Visual Arts. Students take academic courses at their "sending schools" (public high schools) during the morning and attend classes within their departments during the afternoon from 1:00 to 4:00, Monday through Thursday. Students are may apply to up to three individual departments at a time and must prepare a portfolio, audition piece, or interview depending on the department to which they are applying. Accepted students may enroll at the beginning of any year of high school. ECA is based on the idea of artists teaching artists, employing working artists to teach high school students their art form of choice.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/e/ACES_Educational_Center_for_the_Arts_6c40.html" title="Edit section: Theatre Department">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theatre Department</span></h2>
<p>The Theatre Department is located on the third floor studio, in the Little Theatre, and in Studio 70. Run by five permanent faculty members and numerous guest artists, the curriculum stretches from basic acting techniques such as Uta Hagen's Nine Questions to specialty classes such as Theatre for Social Change projects and Viewpoints. Experience in technical theatre is also required. The goal of the curriculum is to teach young actors that there is more to theatre than just standing on the stage. Students take two theatre classes per quarter and one elective per semester. First semester, students have a main class three days per week (1:00 to 3:00 on Mondays, and 1:00 to 4:00 on Tuesdays and Thursdays). The main class focuses on a particular element of theatre such as Scene Study or Playwriting or a special topic in theatre such as Feminist Theatre. Occasionally, the first quarter course will be continued during the second quarter (ex. Scene Study into Classical Scene Study. The second class is a technique class that meets from 1:00 to 3:00 on Wednesdays. Placement in the techniques classes is based on a student's grade in high school and year at ECA. School-wide electives meet on Mondays and Wednesdays from 3:00 to 4:00. Classes are divided into one or two productions during the second semester. Students audition for roles within the two plays over the course of a week and are cast based on their auditions, class work, and previous experience. Not all students are cast in the productions. The students in the cast(s) use class time to rehearse while the other students take either a technical class for the production or another specialty class. Every three to four years, the theatre department performs a department-wide mainstage performance in which every person participates. Whether acting in the play, making the costumes, working backstage, building the set, or stage managine, everyone plays an important role in the production. Each quarter, the theatre department attends a play at a local theatre, and students are required to write a graded theatre review. In addition to class work and performances, the theatre reviews are the basis of grading for the department. Students within the theatre department often take private Saturday classes or attend a summer program run by the ECA staff as a supplement to their classwork. Graduating seniors receive a portfolio of all their work completed while attending ECA.</p>

<p>The Visual Arts Department is located on the fifth floor of the main building with an additional studio on the first floor. The curriculum is divided into three mediums: two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and media. Two-dimensional courses include drawing and painting, while three-dimensional courses include a variety of sculpture classes. Media includes photography, animation, and digital art. The classes offered each quarter fluctuate due to the small, specialized staff. To evenly distribute students, each student is required to take one class in each medium during the first three quarters of the year. The fourth quarter class may be taken in any of the three media, and students may repeat a class within a medium. Classes meet daily from 1:00 to 3:00 on Mondays and Wednesdays and from 1:00 to 4:00 on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>

<p>Electives are semester classes, offered to all students in all departments. Classes meet from 3:00 to 4:00 on Mondays and Wednesdays. Electives students the chance to mingle with the other departments, as well as receive some instruction in an area outside of their chosen department. Students are occasionally excluded from electives that fall within their normal range of study (ex. Dancers may not take Hip Hop).</p>
