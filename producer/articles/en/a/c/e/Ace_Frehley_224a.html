<h2><span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h2>
<p>Ace Frehley was born and raised in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bronx_bb96.html" title="The Bronx">The Bronx</a>, and was the youngest of three children. As a youth, Frehley was in a New York street gang called <i>The Duckies</i> with Steven Edward Duren (aka <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackie_Lawless_d7f6.html" title="Blackie Lawless">Blackie Lawless</a>, who would later become <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frontman.html" title="Frontman">frontman</a> for heavy metal band <a href="../../../w/2E/a/W.A.S.P._2420.html" title="W.A.S.P.">W.A.S.P.</a>). The Frehleys were a musical family, and when Ace received an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_guitar.html" title="Electric guitar">electric guitar</a> as a Christmas present in 1964, he immersed himself in learning the instrument. Frehley has cited guitarists such as <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Townshend_41b5.html" title="Pete Townshend">Pete Townshend</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Beck_5473.html" title="Jeff Beck">Jeff Beck</a> as his major musical influences.<sup id="_ref-leaf_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-leaf" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Frehley's band, Cathedral, started earning a series of paying <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert.html" title="Concert">gigs</a>, Frehley dropped out of high school. At the insistence of his family and girlfriend, Frehley eventually returned and earned his diploma. After graduation, Frehley held a string of short-term jobs—<a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail_carrier.html" title="Mail carrier">mail carrier</a>, furniture deliverer, messenger, and liquor store delivery boy.<sup id="_ref-leaf_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-leaf" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Frehley spent the early 1970s in a series of bands, none of which achieved any success. In January 1973, best friend, Bob McAdams, spotted an advertisement for a lead guitarist in the <i><a href="../../../v/i/l/Village_Voice_bbe7.html" title="Village Voice">Village Voice</a></i>. Bob showed the ad to Ace. Both Bob and Ace went to 10 East 23rd Street above the Live Bait Bar. Ace auditioned for the trio of <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Stanley_b44c.html" title="Paul Stanley">Paul Stanley</a> (<a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhythm_guitar.html" title="Rhythm guitar">rhythm guitar</a>), <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Simmons_c10e.html" title="Gene Simmons">Gene Simmons</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">bass guitar</a>) and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Criss_3e13.html" title="Peter Criss">Peter Criss</a> (<a href="../../../d/r/u/Drum_kit.html" title="Drum kit">drums</a>). Frehley (who showed up wearing one red <a href="../../../s/n/e/Sneaker_%28footwear%29.html" title="Sneaker (footwear)">sneaker</a> and one orange sneaker) (documented in the book Kiss &amp; Tell by Gordon G.G. Gebert and Bob McAdams - isbn# 0-9658794-0-2) was less than impressive visually, but the band liked what they heard from his playing. About three weeks after Frehley auditioned, the new group named him their lead guitarist. By mid-1973, the unnamed band decided on a name - <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kiss_%28band%29.html" title="Kiss (band)">Kiss</a>. Frehley designed the band's unique, double-lightning-bolt logo.<sup id="_ref-logo_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-logo" title="">[2]</a></sup> The band quickly decided to paint their faces for live performances, and Frehley decided to start painting silver stars on his eyes. When the group eventually decided to adopt stage personas to go with their makeup designs, Frehley became "Space Ace," an alien visitor from the planet of Jendel.</p>
<p>While Kiss spent their early days rehearsing and playing in empty clubs, Frehley took a job as a part-time cab driver to pay his bills. In September 1973, Kiss began to receive a salary from new manager <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Aucoin_7a9b.html" title="Bill Aucoin">Bill Aucoin</a> that paid each member $75 a week. This enabled Frehley to quit his job.</p>
<p>Kiss released their debut album, <i><a href="../../../k/i/s/Kiss_%28album%29.html" title="Kiss (album)">Kiss</a></i>, in February 1974—Frehley's sole songwriting contribution was "Cold Gin." Due to Frehley's lack of confidence in his own singing voice, however, the vocals were performed by Simmons. Frehley wrote or co-wrote several of the band's songs over the next few years but didn't record his vocals on a song until "<a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_Me_e11a.html" title="Shock Me">Shock Me</a>" (inspired following his near-electrocution during a concert), which appeared on 1977's <i><a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_Gun_1769.html" title="Love Gun">Love Gun</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-leaf_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-leaf" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>As lead guitarist, Frehley was known for his frenetic, atmospheric playing, becoming one of the most popular guitarists in the 70s and spawning a generation of new players. Indeed, Frehley stated in the book <i>Kiss: Behind the Mask</i> that many guitarists have told him his playing on 1975's hit <i>Alive!</i> prompted them to pick up the instrument.</p>

Ace's 1978 Solo Album</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Along with the three other Kiss members, Frehley released an eponymous <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Frehley_%28album%29_c4d4.html" title="Ace Frehley (album)">solo album</a> in 1978. His was the best-selling of the four, and the album's lone single (the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russ_Ballard_7db5.html" title="Russ Ballard">Russ Ballard</a> written "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Groove_e071.html" title="New York Groove">New York Groove</a>") reached the Top 20 in the United States.</p>
<p>Frehley's songwriting presence within the group increased in 1979, contributing 2 originals and a cover (The Rolling Stones' 2000 Man) for 1979's <i><a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynasty_%28album%29.html" title="Dynasty (album)">Dynasty</a></i> and 3 originals for 1980s <i><a href="../../../u/n/m/Unmasked.html" title="Unmasked">Unmasked</a></i>. While this was not the best time for Kiss on a commercial level in the United States, they were only just beginning to take off in other countries (mostly in Australia where Dynasty and Unmasked are their highest selling albums). But even as his songwriting role within Kiss was increasing, Frehley found himself increasingly at odds with the musical direction of the band. After Peter Criss left Kiss in 1980, Frehley was often outvoted 2-1 in band decisions, as replacement drummer <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Carr_4d8c.html" title="Eric Carr">Eric Carr</a> was not a partner in Kiss and had no vote. Frehley's participation in the recording of 1981's <i><a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_from__The_Elder__1e4b.html" title="Music from &quot;The Elder&quot;">Music from "The Elder"</a></i> was far more limited than with previous albums. This was, in large part, due to his unhappiness with the band's decision to create a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concept_album.html" title="Concept album">concept album</a> rather than a straightforward rock album.</p>
<p>Exacerbating the situation was Frehley's escalating erratic behavior and substance abuse. In April 1982, Frehley was involved in a serious automobile accident (although Anton Fig was the driver). In May, he led police on a 90-mph car chase on the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronx_River_Parkway_e9b8.html" title="Bronx River Parkway">Bronx River Parkway</a>. This incident led to a $600 fine and a six-month suspension of his driver's license.<sup id="_ref-focus_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-focus" title="">[3]</a></sup> Although Frehley appeared on the covers for 1982's greatest hits album <i><a href="../../../k/i/l/Killers_%28Kiss_album%29_af17.html" title="Killers (Kiss album)">Killers</a></i> and studio album <i><a href="../../../c/r/e/Creatures_of_the_Night_4bc9.html" title="Creatures of the Night">Creatures of the Night</a></i>, he had no involvement with either project. Frehley's last appearances with the band were the video for "I Love it Loud," a series of European promotional appearances in November 1982 and a band interview with <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a> in early 1983 promoting their world tour.</p>
<p><a name="Solo_career" id="Solo_career"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Solo career</span></h3>
<p>Although Frehley was no longer a legal member of Kiss as of March 1983 (he was replaced by <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinnie_Vincent_d599.html" title="Vinnie Vincent">Vinnie Vincent</a> for the start of the <i>Creatures of the Night</i> tour in December 1982), he retained a one-quarter share in the Kiss partnership until mid-1984. Wanting to avoid any potential legal or monetary entanglements, Frehley did not actively begin his solo career until he was out of the partnership.<sup id="_ref-focus_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-focus" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1984, Frehley started his post-Kiss solo career by assembling a band that included, among others, drummer <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_Fig_9d37.html" title="Anton Fig">Anton Fig</a> (who had performed on Frehley's 1978 solo album and on two Kiss albums). Bassist <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Regan_8765.html" title="John Regan">John Regan</a> (who had worked with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Frampton_c4fb.html" title="Peter Frampton">Peter Frampton</a>), whom Frehley met in 1980, was also an original member of the band as was guitarist Richie Scarlett.<sup id="_ref-focus_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-focus" title="">[3]</a></sup> The group, whose name alternated between 'Ace Frehley' and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frehley%27s_Comet_803c.html" title="Frehley's Comet">Frehley's Comet</a>, recorded a series of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demo_%28music%29.html" title="Demo (music)">demos</a> throughout 1984 and 1985.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[4]</a></sup> The band performed their first ever live show at S.I.R. Studios in New York City, NY on November 20, 1984.</p>
<p>After a few unsuccessful attempts at securing a recording contract, the group eventually signed to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megaforce_Records_c568.html" title="Megaforce Records">Megaforce Records</a> and released their first album, <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/Frehley%27s_Comet_%28album%29_c859.html" title="Frehley's Comet (album)">Frehley's Comet</a></i>, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">July 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>. The album was co-produced by <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Kramer_817f.html" title="Eddie Kramer">Eddie Kramer</a>, who had produced not only a number of Kiss albums, but Frehley's 1978 album and some of his 1984-85 demos. Before <i>Frehley's Comet'</i>s release, Anton Fig left the band to become the in-studio drummer for <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Letterman_d46f.html" title="David Letterman">David Letterman</a>'s late-night television show, but did perform on the album. He also played on the 1987 tour in the U.S. when Frehely's band played a double bill with Y&amp;T, and new band (at the time) White Lion opening the shows.</p>
<p><i>Frehley's Comet</i>, a mixture of hard rock and pop metal, was a successful return to the music scene for Frehley. The album peaked at #43 on the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_200.html" title="Billboard 200">Billboard 200</a> (selling nearly 500,000 copies<sup id="_ref-focus_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-focus" title="">[3]</a></sup>), and the single, "Rock Soldiers," reached #27 on the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainstream_Rock_Tracks_ef63.html" title="Mainstream Rock Tracks">Mainstream Rock Tracks</a> chart. "Rock Soldiers" was an autobiographic song, written partially about Frehley's April 1982 car accident. The video for "Rock Soldiers" received moderate airplay on <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a>, particularly on <i><a href="../../../h/e/a/Headbangers_Ball_ed35.html" title="Headbangers Ball">Headbangers Ball</a></i>.</p>
<p>Despite the positive reviews and healthy album sales of <i>Frehley's Comet</i>, Frehley was unable to maintain much commercial momentum. Two 1988 Frehley's Comet albums—the live <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extended_play.html" title="Extended play">EP</a> <i><a href="../../../l/i/v/Live%2B1.html" title="Live+1">Live+1</a></i> and <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophomore.html" title="Sophomore">sophomore</a> studio album <i><a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Sighting_f6db.html" title="Second Sighting">Second Sighting</a></i> peaked at #84 and #81, respectively. A pair of tours in support of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Cooper_62c7.html" title="Alice Cooper">Alice Cooper</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Maiden_6b08.html" title="Iron Maiden">Iron Maiden</a> ended prematurely, with the band claiming lack of payment in both cases.<sup id="_ref-chronology_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chronology" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In order to reverse his band's declining commercial fortunes, Frehley dropped the Frehley's Comet moniker and issued 1989's <i><a href="../../../t/r/o/Trouble_Walkin%27_731b.html" title="Trouble Walkin'">Trouble Walkin'</a></i> under his own name. <a href="../../../t/o/d/Tod_Howarth_c30b.html" title="Tod Howarth">Tod Howarth</a> also decided to leave before recording started on the album, and was replaced by Richie Scarlet. Despite the return to a more traditional hard rock style, <i>Trouble Walkin'</i> continued the pattern of declining sales, and peaked at #102.</p>
<p>One notable aspect of <i>Trouble Walkin'</i> was the guest appearance of Peter Criss, who provided vocals for the track "2 Young 2 Die." It was the first time Criss and Frehley had performed together on an album since Kiss's 1979 album, <i>Dynasty</i>, although Peter had shown up briefly at a Frehley's Comet show in Los Angeles in 1987, playing drums on a final encore of "Deuce". In contrast to the somewhat adversarial relationship Frehley had with Kiss (particularly Gene Simmons) throughout the 1980s, he and Criss had maintained good ties during the decade. In June 1995, Frehley's and Criss's bands embarked on the "Bad Boys Tour." The shows ended with Frehley and Criss joining each other to perform "Nothin' to Lose" and "<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_Roll_All_Nite_48b5.html" title="Rock and Roll All Nite">Rock and Roll All Nite</a>."<sup id="_ref-chronology_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chronology" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Kiss reunion and beyond</span></h3>
<p>The beginning of the "Bad Boys Tour" was followed a few months later by Frehley and Criss both performing with Kiss for their <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">August 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> appearance on <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_Unplugged_b3a6.html" title="MTV Unplugged">MTV Unplugged</a>. It marked the first time the original members of Kiss had performed in public since the end of the <i>Dynasty</i> tour in 1979. Fan response was overwhelming, and rumors of a full-fledged reunion circulated. By December, the paperwork for the reunion was completed, although no official announcement was made at the time. In January 1996, Frehley underwent <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic_surgery.html" title="Plastic surgery">plastic surgery</a> in preparation for the upcoming reunion.<sup id="_ref-chronology_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chronology" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_28.html" title="February 28">February 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, the original members of Kiss appeared (in makeup and costumes) at the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_0dda.html" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Awards</a>, to a standing ovation. On April 16, Kiss officially announced their reunion and plans for a tour during a press conference aboard the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Intrepid_%28CV-11%29_3784.html" title="USS Intrepid (CV-11)">USS Intrepid</a>. The Alive/Worldwide Tour kicked off on June 28 at <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Stadium_%28Detroit%29_4914.html" title="Tiger Stadium (Detroit)">Tiger Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit, Michigan</a>. The tour lasted through July 1997 and was a financial windfall for the group, earning $43.6 million.<sup id="_ref-AP_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AP" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The reunited Kiss issued <i><a href="../../../p/s/y/Psycho_Circus_1af0.html" title="Psycho Circus">Psycho Circus</a></i> in September 1998. Frehley's lone song on the album, "Into the Void," was performed during the subsequent tour. The <i>Psycho Circus</i> tour commenced on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">November 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> (a Halloween show on October 31 at <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodger_Stadium_72ba.html" title="Dodger Stadium">Dodger Stadium</a> had several songs simulcast live on FOX's Mad TV), and was followed by the "Farewell Tour" beginning in March 2000. Frehley, expecting that the tour would be Kiss's last, chose not to remain in the band when it ended. His last performance with Kiss was on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_24.html" title="February 24">February 24</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, during the closing ceremonies of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Winter_Olympics_9ecf.html" title="2002 Winter Olympics">2002 Winter Olympics</a>.</p>
<p>Frehley was soon replaced by <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Thayer_3e54.html" title="Tommy Thayer">Tommy Thayer</a>, who had served in a variety of roles for Kiss and had helped Frehley relearn some of his guitar parts for the Alive/Worldwide Tour. Since Kiss owned the copyright to Frehley's makeup and costume designs, Thayer became the second "Spaceman."</p>
<p>Frehley's guitar style was influenced by Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton, but he's just as familiar for his visual effects, such as the smoke bomb hidden in his guitar pickup, sparks and rockets fired off from his guitar head, and others. Frehley has been a significant enough influence on the hard rock and heavy metal guitarists who followed him. In the mid-1990s, Gibson struck a special-edition model of its Les Paul guitar for Frehley (who has played Les Pauls since the beginning of Kiss), with his famed Space Ace face in the head and the Kiss-style lightning bolts in the fretboard inlays.</p>
<p>In an appearance on <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Stern_a7e1.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a>'s <a href="../../../p/a/y/Pay-per-view.html" title="Pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a> program in 2005, Ace said that he left Kiss at least partly because Gene and Paul wanted Kiss to open for <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosmith.html" title="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>, Kiss had opened for Aerosmith twice before in March 24 and April 7 1974. They have never headlined over their biggest rivals. In reality, the two bands enjoyed playing together, with <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Perry_%28musician%29_19f8.html" title="Joe Perry (musician)">Joe Perry</a> becoming the only outside member of Kiss to join them onstage for "Strutter", twice near the end of the tour. Ace also said that Thayer's use of the character he created "didn't matter" because "I created the character." Frehley had gone on Stern's show thinking that he would mostly be talking about the DVD release of his movie <i>Remedy</i>, but when Stern continually talked about Kiss, Ace's business manager called the show, stating that the continuous mentions of Kiss were "upsetting Ace". Behind-the-scenes personal report that Frehley agreed to come on the show on the contingency that there would be no mention of the books Kiss &amp; Tell (by Gordon G.G. Gebert and Bob McAdams) and/or Into The Void... With Ace Frehley (by Wendy Moore). Stern's staff members had Gordon Gebert and Wendy Moore on the phones waiting to confront Frehley. Also, Stern continuously tried to get Ace to admit that he hated Gene Simmons; Ace responded with "Not true; I love Gene." Frehley, learning of the confrontation about to unfold, left the show pre-maturely. Gary Dell'Abate stated that "the Frehley interview was one of the worst in Howard Stern history" and "I would never have Frehley return as long as I work here".</p>
<p>Frehley appeared with Rob Zombie, Tommy Lee, Scott Ian, Slash, and Gilby Clarke on VH-1's Rock Honors special on May 31, 2006. This supergroup played Kiss's "God of Thunder."</p>
<p>Frehley has also attempted acting (not counting a walk-on in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_%28TV_series%29_b678.html" title="Millennium (TV series)">Millennium</a> or his part in the ancient <i><a href="../../../k/i/s/Kiss_Meets_the_Phantom_of_the_Park_3197.html" title="Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park">Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park</a></i>), making his debut in 2005 in <i>Remedy</i>, an independent crime drama. According to Eddie Trunk Kissmass special 2005, Frehley has been sober for several years, and is supposed to be working on a new solo album, scheduled tentatively for a 2006 or 2007 "spring" release. <a href="http://www.eddietrunk.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eddietrunk.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
