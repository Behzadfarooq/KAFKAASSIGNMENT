<p>Hey man, thanks for your welcome. Well, I haven't really made any major contributions to Wiki, so bleah. Anyways, I will read through the links you sent me.</p>
<p><br />
Hi Ryan, thanks for your welcome. If you're not busy, would you mind looking over my contribs and seeing if I'm following all the rules and being precise in how I comment edits, edit the right section, make interwiki links properly, etc? I'd certainly like to hear if I'm going about something the wrong way or there is a better way and wouldn't take it personally.

<dd>I looked over the post you made on Stairway. If you feel that strongly about it, you can go ahead and remove the link. If there are any disputes about it, it can be discussed on the talk page. <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan.html" title="Ryan">Ryan</a> 18:39, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>thanks, ryan, for encouragement to join the fray.</p>
<p>i scanned some of the other references in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stairway.html" title="Stairway">Stairway</a>, and the quality is distinctly uneven, at best.</p>
<p>funky footnotes<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stairway" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stairway" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> aside, the bulk of the material on stairs is not all that bad. matter of fact, the wiki entry is head and shoulders above any of its cited source material -- even if it did not succinctly address my particular query, the answer to which google located elsewhere.</p>
<p>for me, the catch here is that i happen to be a competant copy editor with experience writing on architecture, and it is a topic that tends to excite my passions. there is a strong chance that a polish for clarity might improve the article. nor would ferreting a few superior supporting links be a bad idea, either. no way could i content myself with merely the fixing of one foul footnote.</p>
<p><b>but</b> that would mean learning the wiki style sheet, the weird mark-up and buddha-knows-what other conventions, not to mention a measure of plain old work practicing the writer's craft. all-in-all, tweaking the thing toward perfection adds up to a hefty investment of time and effort that yields minimal benefit for me or anyone else.</p>
<p><b>and</b> as i said, the piece is far from a fiasco, as it stands.</p>
<p>all that said, if in the future i stumble across something on wikipedia that <i>really</i> offends my sensibilities, i'll have at it.</p>

<p>Hi Ryan. Thank you for supporting my recent RfA. I was surprised and humbled by the number of positives votes. I'll be monitoring RfA regularly from now on and will look for a chance to "pay it forward". Thanks also for pointing out the vandalism on the RfA page: it's annoying, silly, and generally pointless, but more or less expected given the recent history of 60+ sockpuppet vandals (long story).

<p>So how long do I have to rebut all these allegations? You know its really a distortion of my record to comb through my entire history and nitpick little phrases and present them out of context like that. You people are worse than lawyers! Furthermore, its not quite fair to have to rebut the denunciations of over 10 people. But anyway, I will respond, I was just wondering how long I have. <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainbowwarrior1977_bac3.html" title="User:Rainbowwarrior1977">Rainbowwarrior1977</a> 03:36, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wanted to let you know of a change I made to an edit of yours, and explain my reasoning. When you reverted some vandalism to the test3 template, you added a sentence creating a link to the Sandbox. I removed the Sandbox link from the Template. My feeling is that by the time youre using this Template, the edits in question are beyond the stage of potential tests, that's what the earlier test templates are for, so by this time there's not as much point having the Sandbox link, in my opinion.

<p>==Goodbye &amp; Thanks for all the Fish== Just wanted to repeat my thanks for the welcome, I loved the fact that there was a welcome committee, it made me determined to try and create a number of good articles.... I envisaged investing significant time into the Wiki enterprise...</p>
<p>What you didn't warn me about was that the Helpers (I hoped for: Early Trainer, Coach and Mentor) roles are not as proactive as your welcome role, WHEREAS the Nihilists who jump around dropping "WIKIFY"? Templates with absolutely no explanation or helpfull comments are positively Hyperactive!! I experienced other such unhelpful to newbies templates being parachuted into my early admittedly poor quality attempts, again without any helpfull hints. Worse the Delete Template was quite a shock on my return from vacation. I found I had already gained 3 delete votes in my absence, so I spent 6 hours learning the expectations of good WIKI pages and words like POVing! and editing the page of De-Perimeterisation till it was half decent (or so I thought, I'd certainly got rid of the POVing!!) only to find this evening that it has been deleted. Your welcome notes remain the only communications in my wikipage....</p>
<p>So I thank you again for your welcome and politely and hopefully without too much rancour, I say goodbye to Wiki. I was ready, willing and "able" to learn! I mistakenly believed that "victimised" was a Bootcamp term for recruit. I hadn't realised that Wiki is turning into a massive Gaming Zone that involves Newbie "Victims" and Nazi "Admins".</p>

<p>For your help last August 5. It was so kind of you. I just opened my account again today. It's so nice to hear that I have other Roman Catholics here. My friends will like to hear this news.

<p>My name is Peter (aka <a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlehmen_2490.html" title="User:Flehmen">Flehmen</a>). I'd like to thank you for your welcome. I have found that usually it is hard to break into a site (message boards) without "paying your dues"</p>
<p>You might have noticed that I've jumped in with both feet and already have created a disambiguation page, and did some work on eyepieces with more to come. Wiki is surprisingly complex but, as long as you can track down the information, easy to use. BTW, knew about the (~~~~) thing and had already looked at <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">How to edit a page</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/t/Wikipedia%7ETutorial_f7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Tutorial">Editing, policy, conduct, and structure tutorial</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/c/Wikipedia%7EPicture_tutorial_cbf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Picture tutorial">Picture tutorial</a>. I had thought that I had read over <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_write_a_great_article_687a.html" title="Wikipedia:How to write a great article">How to write a great article</a> but apparently I hadn't so I'll be doing that today. I find that one of the best ways to create good work is by finding something that looks good, clean, and informative and then using alt-e to take a look at the innards in edit mode.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate any comments you might have on my wiki-style and wiki-philosophy if you have a few moments to spare. A link to a talk page that has some newbies and some oldbies on it in actual discussion would be great too.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Thanks once again for the welcome and, yes, contributing to the wiki world is exciting and sometimes even a little scary. I find that if I let myself stop to think about what the wikipedia could become, and how information is created(well perhaps not created, but captured) in todays world I can see how important every good contribution is.</p>
<p>P.S. Here is a trick I found out yesterday that you might find of use as I noticed you didn't use it in your message to me. [[User:Flehmen|]] gives the same output as [[User:Flehmen|Flehmen]]. Hope that's a tip you can use now I have to get to work!</p>
<p>Take care! <a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlehmen_2490.html" title="User:Flehmen">Flehmen</a> 11:39, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
