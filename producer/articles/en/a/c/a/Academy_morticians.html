<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_morticians.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h3>
<p>Formed in 1997, the Academy Morticians played their first few gigs in their school canteen at nights they promoted themselves. Inspired by DIY punk bands from the USA such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dead_Kennedys_91c7.html" title="The Dead Kennedys">The Dead Kennedys</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Religion_627f.html" title="Bad Religion">Bad Religion</a>, they self financed and released their first EP "The Forbidden Curriculum" in 1998. The limited run of 50 copies sold out quickly with notably, one copy going to horror author <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_King_bf4f.html" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a> and another ending up in the hands of Dead Kennedys frontman <a href="../../../j/e/l/Jello_Biafra_fa4d.html" title="Jello Biafra">Jello Biafra</a> which would come in useful at a later date. The EP was recorded across three sessions with Mckee and Mastrantone doing the bulk of the performing. Drummer Christian Rot played drums on three of the tracks with Mastrantone playing drums on the rest.</p>
<p>Encouraged by favourable press from the UK underground, the band recorded their first album "Shallow Permanence" in summer of 1998, this time sharing the release between their own imprint Cursed, and small independent Welsh label Smokin' Troll. With a title borrowed from the poem No More Hiroshimas by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Kirkup_6aa1.html" title="James Kirkup">James Kirkup</a>, the album was 14 tracks long and recorded in three days. Due to a last minute walk out by Rot, Mastrantone was forced to play drums and once more the bulk of the musicianship was done by Mastrantone and Mckee. One notable addition to the line up was Tim Cadman who guested on the track "Malleable"; Cadman would later join the band on second guitar.</p>
<p>The album was released in 1999 and it was at this stage that the band began its bond with the influential fanzine <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fracture_%28fanzine%29.html" title="Fracture (fanzine)">Fracture</a>, who reviewed Shallow Permanence with the words "a band this country would not be the same without." Both musically innovative with its blending of influences and lyrically ambitious with its interlinking songs themes, the album is considered by most fans to be their most consistent and entertaining. It was also well received by the UK underground press.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_morticians.html" title="Edit section: College Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">College Years</span></h3>
<p>In 2000, while at Sixth Form college, the band recruited drummer Steve White. At around this time the band met up with Jello Biafra who turned out to be a fan of "The Forbidden Curriculum" and put in a good word for the band with Leeds based label Crackle records, who in turn took a shine to the Morticians Shallow Permanence album. From this came the Morticians second EP, "Consumerism is an STD". The EP was recorded in two sessions, the first session featuring a three piece line up with White on drums and the second featuring a four piece line up featuring Tim Cadman on second guitar.</p>
<p>While remaining in the spirit of the Shallow Permanence, the EP was musically more complex, in part thanks to the ambitious drumming of White. Some fans felt the EP lacked some of the enthusiasm of the prior releases but the critical acclaim was strong again from the underground in the UK and abroad. The notable exception to this was US based <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximum_RocknRoll_6740.html" title="Maximum RocknRoll">Maximum RocknRoll</a>, who seemingly missing the bands ironic slant on their own political stance, accused them of band wagon jumping and ordered the band to "never record this kind of shit again."</p>
<p>The bands reputation grew at this point and they played high profile shows alongside <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Fish_b4c6.html" title="Citizen Fish">Citizen Fish</a>, The Mad Caddies, <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Prophets_b174.html" title="Lost Prophets">Lost Prophets</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Showbusiness_Giants_5c3e.html" title="Showbusiness Giants">Showbusiness Giants</a>. Tim Cadman left band shortly after this period and Tom Wise replaced him.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_morticians.html" title="Edit section: What Happened? Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">What Happened? Years</span></h3>
<p>Despite the success of the EP, Crackle were reluctant to put out a full length album by the Morticians due to the new direction the music was evolving in. Eventually, the label gave the green light and the band began work on their second full length studio album in October 2000. At this stage, the albums working title was "Somebody should have told you, we live in a causal universe." The album was the was the first since "The Forbidden Curriculum" not to have been recorded at The Zoo in <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nuneaton.html" title="Nuneaton">Nuneaton</a>; the band opting instead to use Bag Siddens and framework studios in <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>. The album was co-produced by <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napalm_Death_8a12.html" title="Napalm Death">Napalm Death</a> guitarist <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitch_Harris_95ba.html" title="Mitch Harris">Mitch Harris</a> who was in the studio and heard and liked the band.</p>
<p>At 12 tracks the album was the most full sounding the Morticians had ever done. Wise had solidified a rock edge to the bands sound that had started to creep in when White had joined. On the songwriting side, Mastrantone had taken a more progressive direction, whereas Mckee had taken a hardcore punk direction. The resulting combination proved both difficult and fascinating listening for fans and critics alike. <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drowned_in_Sound_93e0.html" title="Drowned in Sound">Drowned in Sound</a> raved that the album made the Morticians "one of the quirkiest bands in the UK."</p>
<p>Before being released in 2001, the album faced a difficult period in record label limbo. Crackle pulled out when studio costs escalated and faced with a dead end and increasing personal difficulties, the band split up before getting a chance to master the record. Simon began a solo career with Steve White on drums, and the Mckee, Wise and White formed Bullet of Diplomacy. At this stage, record label Three Days Dead offered both new acts a new label alongside a guarantee of releasing "Someone should have..."</p>
<p>The band parted ways with Three Days Dead, somewhat acrimoniously, after nothing happened for nearly a year. At this point both Mastrantone and McKee were regular contributors at Fracture and the Zine ran an article about the odd goings on at Three Days Dead and the ordeal the Morticians had been through.</p>
<p>In 2001 the album was retitled "What Happened" and was split released on Mckees label "Who Killed Culture" and Birmingham based <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Records_f855.html" title="Badger Records">Iron Man</a> records.</p>

<p>After What Happened was released, the band reformed for a series of shows across the UK, the last one being at the Cardiff Barfly in April 2003. While never officially splitting up, the band have been inactive since.</p>
