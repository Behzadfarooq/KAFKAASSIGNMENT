<p>Training to be a doctor in medicine is challenging. The constant advances in technological services which are readily used in diagnosis and treatment of diseases necessitate a balanced curriculum between teaching bed-side medicine and high technologically oriented techniques in patient-management. Medicine as a discipline is based on science (logical and evidence-based thinking), the art of diagnosis and human touch in patients care. In Sudan, endemic diseases, mainly of tropical nature, constitute a significant cause of diseases and also lay an extra burden on medical students learning etc. and expond the curriculum even further. With these challenges in mind, the Faculty of Medicine in the Academy was established in 1996 with the following objectives. 1. To graduate medical doctors equipped with scientific basis of medicine, trained on patients care (actual patients, not simulators or actors). And properly advised on ethical conduct and behavior. 2. To train the future doctors on modern diagnostic and treatment modalities including advance imaging techniques and advance therapeutic treatment. 3. To enable the student to think in terms of critical analysis of medical conditions equipped with sound research methods and be able to answer a research question in an acceptable way and be able to produce a research thesis on graduation. 4. The graduate shall combine knowledge of primary health care and hospital and institute early treatment of primary health problems. The Faculty of Medicine is equipped with lecture theatres and advance laboratories (Biochemistry, Physiology, Physics, Dissection room, Biology/Molecular biology and Skills laboratory). The Teaching Hospital and a number of health centers were also established to receive the students. Moreover, two-specialized high tech diagnostic/treatment clinics were opened to receive the students for training: a) Yastabshiroon Centre (where advance imaging techniques were housed e.g. MRI, Spiral CT, ultrasound and echo scan, EEG, EMG, Endoscopy with laproscopic surgery, lazer treatment facilities. b) An advanced fertility clinic.</p>

<p>The faculty computer science and Business Administration was established to satisfy an urgent need for a program of advanced study &amp; training in the ever-developing field of Information Technology. Our objective is to achieve levels of qualification worthy of being recognized by the relevant international computer Science institutions. The faculty offers a distinguished program of advanced study and training tailored to prepare the students for an interesting and rewarding career in the burgeoning computer industry underpinning the economic growth and social developments now gathering pace. Information Technology plays a vital role in all aspects of our lives and has become an essential function in the activities of both private and government institutions. We endeavor to turn out career-ready graduates well trained in current technologies, and equipped with the necessary foundation and theoretical knowledge that will enable them to update their skills and keep abreast with new developments in a fast moving industry. Our curriculum is designed to give students a solid grounding in both theoretical and practical topics in computer science. We continually review our curriculum to keep abreast with the latest developments in computer science education. The dean recently returned from Britain where we conducted a comprehensive review of the curriculum with the assistance of some of the leading computer science experts in the British Universities. Our computer facilities are of the highest specifications, and all facilities are linked together through a superior digital network linking over 150 computers. All computers all connected to the Internet through a high-speed broadband connection. Our laboratories and lecture theatres are equipped with modern audiovisual equipment, employing large format plasma screen technology, for efficient and accurate instruction and delivery of the subject material.</p>
<p><br />
The mission of the faculty is to serve our society in Sudan by building a breed of modern, creative and innovative administrative and Financial science graduates. Our courses are designed to enable students to conduct modern business using the latest inputs of science and technology thus leading towards development and sustainable peace in the country</p>
<p>Our vision is that the Faculty of Administrative and Financial Sciences will be the leading Business Faculty in Sudan , Africa and the Middle - East in the near future. The Objectives of the Faculty To equip students with the basic knowledge pertaining to the conduct of modern business in the Sudan in accordance with the inputs of science and technology. To help in building a breed of potential managers who possess appropriate skills to run profit-making as well as non-profit making enterprises. The graduates are expected to demonstrate a range of cognitive and intellectual skills, together with the techniques directly related to business management.</p>
<p>The proposed programs should furnish broad analytical and integrated study of business and management. Students should not only be exposed to theories, concepts and business operation, but also be able to link environmental issues and problems with conceptualization. The program should prepare students to work on the integration between the academic and business community in such a way that the components of the program reflect the areas of concern and problems emanating from local, regional as well as international practices. Entrepreneurs are intended to be involved in program implementation for their prospected valuable inputs. Preparation of students to solve business problems via quantitative techniques, without glossing over the qualitative approach when deemed necessary. The program aims at capacity building of self-learning beside the classical methods of teaching. Through harnessing the cyber education and E-learning the program focuses on heavy use of the internet to search for data and using whatever available in the learning process. 7The ‘‘creation’’ of manager is a focal objective. It is hoped that path-finding leaders are to be prepared, not just technocrats or mediocre administrators. Varieties of skills-building modules (courses) serve the purpose.</p>
