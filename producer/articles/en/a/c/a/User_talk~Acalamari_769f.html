<p>This is definitely a sensitive article which warrants semi-protection. However, I would like to see all pages, even those vulnerable to vandalism, such as George W. Bush, be unprotected from time to time. When I joined in 2005, no article ever received indefinite protection. I am particularly willing to unprotect a page if vandalism has been subdued and if it's on my watchlist. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilliam_7bdc.html" title="User:Gilliam">Gilliam</a> 03:10, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Glad to help, you're a good editor. Feel free to ask, anytime you have an article you're personally interested in. Do feel free to add back some of the details I've deleted, though. I can't tell if one article I looked at copied from Wikipedia or Wikipedia copied from it. To be on the safe side of copyvios (none), I've deleted quite a bit.

<p>Hey there Acalamari! Not so sure it will make it as a userbox in Template space. Why not try implementing it in User space. For example you can create the template on <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_Awards_giver_b02c.html" title="User:Acalamari/Awards giver">User:Acalamari/Awards giver</a> and implement it like a template by typing {{User:Acalamari/Awards giver}}. Lots of user boxes work that way now adays due to many of them not directly relating to Wikipedia. Hope this helps.<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal"><font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b>¤~Persian Poet Gal</b></i></font></font></a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 00:36, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Acalamari! I edited this morning the text on the lead part of the article about Cicero, and I was pretty satisfied with it.

<dd>AVG is not the most trusted anti-virus around because I seemed to get more virus with AVG than without it but by far the most trusted anti-viruses around I think is Norton and/or E-trust although McAfee also gets the job done.

<dl>
<dd>Actually, we went with AVG because we didn't trust Norton and McAfee. We did have E-trust for a while, but then it kept registering viruses that weren't there. As for firewalls, we don't use the Windows one. In fact, the Windows one itself does say that it's only a basic one, and a better type should be installed. However, I am not endorsing any type of software with this message. I, like Wikipedia, am not an advertising host. As long as we have a good firewall and a good anti-virus program, we should all be okay. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 18:59, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, no one has <i>ever</i> vandalized my user page--does this mean you're more popular than me? I bet it does.

<dd>Acalamari, if you have any time to do some reading, can you add to this article <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwabena_Frimpong-Boateng_eb14.html" title="Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng">Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng</a>? There are a couple of references added to the article, but they need to have some text from them incorporated into the article, and I am way too busy right now. The doctor is rather interesting. I worked with a Kenyan doctor briefly who talked about this guy who was Ghana's first and only heart surgeon. It's interesting because in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, possibly excepting Kenya, the rich go to Europea for medical treatment--even in Kenya Europeans buy special medical insurance that pays for and provides medivacuation to Europe, or maybe the Middle East, in case of emergency. In Ghana primary care for malaria, river blindness and AIDS is hard enough for most people, but this guy is a world-class cardiac surgeon practicing in his native land. The editor who started it has been a bit of a pest adding commercial links to other articles (ethnobotanical plants), but the links in this article are good references and the doctor is rather fascinating and deserves a delete-proof article. I did add the proper categories. Cheers. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:24, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi Acalmari. Please read <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a>. In future, any entires made to WP:RFCN reporting user names where the guidelines are not followed will be removed. You made no attempt to ask the user to change his name, instead going straight to RFC.

<dd>Hi Acalamari. You did indeed use tags. But if you read the top of the page, you're asked to <b>ask</b> the user, nicely, if he would mind changing his username. There's even a template for it - {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameConcern_47f1.html" title="Template:UsernameConcern">UsernameConcern</a>}}. You shouldn't just <b>tell</b> them they have to change their name and submit it immediately to RFCN; we always try and be friendly and helpful, especially to the newest editors, who may not be aware what is and is not acceptable, so we ask them to change it, first.</dd>
<dd>And I'm not picking on you in particular for his - I often just remove the RFCNs if nobody made an effort to ask the user to change their name first. I noticed you did mention Betacommand "getting away with it" - there were plenty of people who asked him to change how he was handling user names, and I was just one of them. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Neil</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../n/e/i/User_talk%7ENeil_9072.html" title="User talk:Neil"><span style="text-decoration:none"><small>(not Proto ►)</small></span></a> 17:47, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Is there anything wrong with autograph pages? I really don't think so. I KNOW so.

<dd>I personally don't think the autograph pages are appropriate for Wikipedia; but I only speak for one user: myself. If I was administrator, I would not delete any of the autograph pages, including yours. There are two reasons why I wouldn't delete them: 1: I would be seriously questioned for such an action; and two: I'm not going to root through millions of users just to find autograph pages. Anyway, from what I've seen, you have nothing to worry about with your autograph page: the MFD will likely close as no consensus or allow; meaning that your signatures, and everyone else's, will remain intact. I agree with you about removing the "sign my book" link on some users' signatures if the books remain; we can do without links to user subpages in signatures. By the way, I also wish to apologize if I've been hostile to you in any way over this entire incident. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 00:27, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Asking users to engage in the MFD discussion would be considered spamming. You say you want to get rid of spamming, but if you or I went to the talk pages of all the users with autograph books asking them to participate, that would be spamming. As for saving the autograph books, you can do that if you want; but remember: Wikipedia is not just about autograph pages.

<dd>What do you mean by "save the pages"? The fate of the page is being decided at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Autograph_books_d78a.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Autograph books">Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Autograph books</a>. As for spamming, as far as I know, you're the only user to ask well over a hundred user to sign a signature book. As for the signatures...a new policy would have to be <i>suggested</i> to eliminate the fancy spamming signatures. I could suggest the policy myself, but I am busy with suggesting another policy at the moment. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 20:11, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're welcome. As for my own RfA, that probably won't happen for another month or two, depending on what happens. I've got about 3900 edits at the moment, and I won't attempt adminship until I'm at a figure of <i>at least</i> 5000 edits. Also, I want to get more mainspace edits (I have about 1650 I think), and more experience on Wikipedia-pages. As for RFC, I'll be there; I just won't be reporting as many user names as I used to, but I'll still give input for other users who report names there. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 21:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hey, Acalamari, I saw your name next to a quote that she had on her user page.. "Don't put anything on Jimbo's talk page. Acalamari" And, I looked on the talk page, and you NEVER said that, you merely said to only use Mr. Wales' talk page in only some occasions.. I wanted to bring this to you first, and you can choose to bring it up to Anna if you wish.. By the way, your actual quote: "It's best to only use Mr. Jimbo Wales' talk page in special circumstances. The first time I posted to his talk page was close to a month ago when I asked about a reporter. I thought the situation required his attention, as it was to do with the press; Mr. Wales quickly and calmly resolved the situation for me. You see, his talk page should really only be used for very unusual, or immensely large events. Acalamari 00:53, 10 March 2007 (UTC)" If you need to reach me, please reply on my talk page&#160;:) .

<p>If we're looking at things from a technical standpoint, then yes, I believe they could -- admins can unblock themselves. <i>But</i>, from a policy standpoint, doing so is widely frowned upon and can lead to an instant desysopping depending on circumstances. x.x – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 02:58, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

If in the future you are marginally concerned about a username, you can always ask a few RFCU regulars for their opinion before you start the process. I did that recently (see <a href="../../../f/l/y/User_talk%7EFlyguy649_8c24.html#Username_query" title="User talk:Flyguy649">User talk:Flyguy649#Username query</a> for their responses) and it seemed to work well.

<dd>Well, thank you; none of my reports there have been in bad-faith, and I do get tired of users who imply that my reports there have been. However, I used to be a regular, but I decided to limit my presence there. In fact, that was the first name I've reported there for some time. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 17:31, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yea, i felt like my response could have been a little harsh. In general, we are all suppose dto <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume Good Faith</a>. By stating that something is not bad faith (which most of us assume or should be assuming it is not), most of us start looking around wondering who did assume bad faith? (Just the way it was stated seemed accusatory (which I know it is not)). I think that stating it is not in bad faith is a bit reduntant though (in my personal opinion). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 19:18, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If the names were "probably acceptable", why would you have sent them to RFCN in the first place? {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameConcern_47f1.html" title="Template:UsernameConcern">UsernameConcern</a>}} simply suggests to the user that "some users" may find their username objectionable, and they can avoid this going any further by voluntarily changing their name. This does happen, as most people are happy to follow guidelines once they are made aware of them. If they are sure they want that username, and/or believe it would be acceptable (ie, they disagree that the username would be objectionable), <i>then</i> it goes to RFCN. for further comment and input from the community. That's what an RFC is - a more formal way of assessing and resolving a potential issue when simple discussion has not been able to resolve it. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Neil</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../n/e/i/User_talk%7ENeil_9072.html" title="User talk:Neil"><span style="text-decoration:none"><small>(not Proto ►)</small></span></a> 22:46, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I posted them there in case they <i>did</i> violate policy. That step saying: <i>Contact the user on his or her talk page and bring their attention to the problem and Wikipedia:Changing username.

<dd>Just came across it, thought I'd toss in a link at the very bottom to a compromise solution, a separate /Warnings subpage where stuff could be moved off the talkpage if one wanted the talkpage kept clean.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not that it should really be <i>necessary</i>, because as long as the warner left a good edit summary, even just the name of the warning template, anyone can go through the talkpage history, spot the warning entries, and bring up the original postings with all details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But for those who really don't want to make things harder for anyone, archiving them on a subpage is a nice way to show: "Hey, I'm not hiding anything, I just want my talkpage kept for actual <b>talk</b>, warnings are all kept over there."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Or if you need to keep clear and easily found records on a real troublemaker, a protected /Warnings subpage would preserve the warnings from deletion, while letting the user chat (or rant) on the talkpage to his heart's content -- something you can't do if the talkpage has to serve <b>both</b> purposes at the same time.</dd>

<p>Somebody, who thinks he is smarter than what he is in reality, has removed from the Cicero article the sections in "Early life" about Cicero's philosophical studies in his youth. What he/she/they do not realize is that Cicero's importance at present has much to do with his philosophical works. (I am going later to write about Cicero's own philosophical works, - if I ever get over all these reverts after reverts!?) My text about Cicero's studies in philosophy in his youth you can find in "Revision as of 10:01, 21 March 2007".Can you tell me how to add this text into the present article?? Or can you put these sections back into the article? Or should I ask the Help Desk?

<dd>Indeed; it's best to use neutral edit summaries. As for the issues on my RfA; instead of waiting until the RfA ends to begin addressing them; I'm working on them now.

<p>What exactly do you imagine you'll be resolving? Chris conveniently expunged all discussion of his questionable role in the matter from his own talk page through his move-delete, and blanked the user's talk page, hiding any critical comments from anyone to see.

<p>Dang, you're still much more popular than I am. Don't avoid all the situations, evaluate people's comments and decide what you think you should do to become a better Wikipedia editor and potential administrator--not everyone who criticizes you is always right. Frankly, I think you'd be wasted as an admin, but you do edit in areas where there are few admins, but high activity, and you could contribute well as an admin, I have no doubt. If you become an administrator I will probably have to find someone else to dump those little obscure intellectual biographies on, though, and that will irritate me, as I've cut back, enough that finding new <s>victims</s>, er editors, will be difficult. I personally think being a great editor is a step up from being an admin, and you are the former, imo. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 02:00, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

His daughter started the article, then hesitated for COI reasons. The article came up for AfD, but he's rather a spectacularly well-known craftsman among those who care about wood, so the article stayed. Meanwhile I begged his daughter to provide a photograph--rather rare acquisition for a modern crafstman, as they want to protect their work from being knocked-off. However, the daughter did provide Wikipedia with an excellent photograph of a unique piece. I really don't have much time to work on anything Wikipedia as I'm working on my art right now, but this one came up on my watchlist courtesy of a BLP bot.

<p>Thanks for your message, Acalamari. I didn't think you were offended but I don't think it would make you biased if you were offended. My own RfA was relatively painless (160/4/1) but it was still a pretty rugged experience and I think it would be quite natural to feel hurt when they don't succeed. As far as the age thing goes, I personally don't agree with using age as a criteria for assessing someone for adminship but I know that other people think it is important that admins be of a certain minimum age. I think it's a rather silly criteria myself since anyone can say they are whatever they want and we would have no clue if a 14-year-old, for example, claimed they were 30. I don't like using arbitrary criteria like age, gender, education, etc for evaluating candidates (believe it or not, I have seen someone opposed for being female), however, I feel that people participating in good faith should feel free to apply whatever admin criteria they feel is appropriate. I didn't agree with that editor's oppose rationale, but I wasn't upset or unimpressed or whatever. Thanks for taking the time to comment.

<dd>You did great on your own RfA: <a href="../../../1/0/0/WP%7E100_d2fb.html" title="WP:100">WP:100</a>! As for the age criteria, I disagree with it; not because of my age, but because it would mean de-sysopping a load of good admins, like Persian Poet Gal and Majorly; who have done a great job as administrators. Having their administrative tools removed simply because they are not old enough would be a huge loss. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 18:43, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
