<p>I believe the reference to rags in the origin of the commoner's gown is incorrect. The streamers on the commoner's and graduate students gowns are the remnants of long closed sleeves, which still can be seen on the flap-collared lay gowns of the higher faculties (BCL, BM, etc), and the very similar gowns of QCs, and even that of the Lord Chancellor. Like the MA gown, 3/4 of the sleeves are purely decorative, there being a slit just above the elbow for the arm to come through, and in effect the lower 3/4 of these sleeves could be called streamers. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 04:44, 11 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

As it is stated on the page, it is often claimed that it is illegal for undergraduates to wear their mortarboards before graduating; however, on other university documents it says the mortarboard should be worn outside (but not inside). Does anyone know how this "myth" came about? <a href="../../../l/j/a/User%7ELJade728_bd61.html" title="User:LJade728">LJade728</a> 13:17, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Probably influence from other universities that do not have a tradition of undergraduate academic dress. It must be very recent, because in pictures of matriculations/degree ceremonies up to the 1990s you can see women undergraduates wearing their mortarboards, as they were then required to do. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 18:06, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Does anyone know if visiting students are required to wear any sort of academic dress? I may be overlooking it in the article, but either way, a line regarding the policy on that should probably be included. <a href="../../../b/e/g/User%7EBeginning_2e6d.html" title="User:Beginning">Beginning</a> 22:01, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not entirely clear - as visiting students do not matriculate and are not members of the University, whether or not they wear academic dress appears to depend on the college of which they are members. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 15:10, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Should it be mentioned that Oxford is currently considering making subfusc voluntary for exams?</li>

<p>May I suggest to anyone wishing to see some of these hoods visit the Burgon Society wardrobe<a href="http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/wardrobe/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/wardrobe/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I can also recommend the Burgon Society for anyone who wishes to learn or get involved with academic dress <i>Wilfrid Jones</i></p>
<p>In relation to sub fusc becoming voluntary, it was not the university, but the student union who proposed a referendum on the subject. There was some very amusing sub fusc-related campaigning (including free rides on tour buses and pancake races in oriel quad). 81% of students voted to keep sub fusc and the turn out was very high. In any case, the referendum would only have been a recommendation, and in all liklihood the university would have simply ignored it.</p>

<p>I should be grateful if anybody could clear up a few things for me on Oxford academic dress.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Talk%7EAcademic_dress_of_the_University_of_Oxford_a885.html" title="Edit section: MA DPhil">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">MA DPhil</span></h3>
<p>Firstly, why is it that a person who holds the degrees of both MA and DPhil customarily wears the dress of an MA? Most Oxford dons would fit into this category and one very rarely sees them wearing any of the possible DPhil outfits. In fact, the only time I have seen the DPhil robe worn is at degree ceremonies when new DPhils wear their robes afterwards and at college Valediction, when the rule seems to be to wear the most colourful dress one owns, so that non-Oxford doctors (who are however Oxford MAs) wear the PhD robe and hood of their other university (London and Nottingham being the most regular appearances) and DPhils (most of them also MAs) wear the DPhil robe, but not with subfusc (which I happen to think looks rather a mess). For examination invigilation they always seem to wear the MA gown and hood. I know that the MA traditionally conferred voting rights in Convocation (although I don't think that is true now). I have also been told that the MA is a higher degree than DPhil, which I think is wrong, since somebody who is an MA <i>and</i> a DPhil still ranks higher than somebody who is only an MA.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but someone who is only MA outranks someone who is only DPhil. The answer would seem to be practicality and cost - you only need an MA gown and hood (£157 from S&amp;W) to be properly turned out for all occasions. On the other hand a Doctor of Philosophy would need undress gown, hood, bands, full dress robe and convocation habit (£460 + another £200-300 for the habit) to cover all occasions. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 00:02, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've recently seen people in convocation habit at ceremonies that I didn't think required it. I understood that convocation habit was worn only for the admission of the Proctors and Assessor and of the Vice-Chancellor, Pro-Vice-Chancellors, and Clerks of the Market, by Deans presenting at degree ceremonies, and at the Court Sermon. However, I have seen convocation habit worn at matriculation and Encaenia. Is this because they are both a kind of degree ceremony? I.e. does the Dean presenting at matriculation and whoever is presenting candidates for honorary degrees at Encaenia wear convocation habit because they are there to function as if in a degree ceremony?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Encaenia is a meeting of Congregation (used to be Convocation - <i>Causa huius Convocationis est ut iuxta institutionem Honoratissimi et Reverendi admodum Nathaniel, Baronis Crewe, Episcopi Dunelmensis...</i> - but Convocation no longer has the power to grant degrees), so convocation habit is appropriate. I don't know the rationale for matriculation <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 00:02, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Finally, I wonder why most honorands seem not to wear subfusc for Encaenia. Usually they wear suit and tie (men)/suit, dress, etc (women). Some do seem to wear it, so I take it that it is allowed, and maybe even correct. On the other hand, is it only Oxonian honorands who wear subfusc and others wear the lounge suit option? Are non-Oxonians forbidden to wear subfusc?! (Would seem unlikely). I'm sure the university could tell them to wear it, or even go to the expense of giving each one a white bow tie to wear. Subfusc looks so much better...</p>
<p>On which note, when at some point in the future I have to attend a degree ceremony at a university that does not usually use subfusc, would it seem appropriate to wear subfusc anyway? People seem to wear pretty much anything to degree ceremonies that aren't Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, St Andrews, Edinburgh, and anywhere else requiring subfusc, so I can't see it would matter, but maybe it would look offensively "foreign".--<a href="../../../o/x/o/User%7EOxonian2006_e7e1.html" title="User:Oxonian2006">Oxonian2006</a> 08:57, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Probably because until they are granted their degrees they are not members of the university, unlike other graduands who are necessarily student members before admission to their degrees - I doubt they are forbidden to wear sub-fusc, merely not required. I suspect this has stratified into custom. At other universities you can do what you want, although remember if you are attending someone else's degree ceremony in Oxford as a spectator (i.e. neither graduating nor presenting) you would wear cap, gown and hood but must _not_ wear sub-fusc. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 00:02, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
