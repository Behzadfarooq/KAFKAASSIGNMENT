<p>you said that one or two bands have to get famous for our genre to be accepted.. the fact of the matter is you should screen things that exist.. ex: you have many genres on this site that only have a couple bands, and ones that have no famous bands (ie: Cyber Grind, Doom Metal, Goregrind, among others). and Reggae-Grind does have at least one band in the genre, and they have an underground following, so they are famous in some peoples eyes.. remember 'fame is in the eye of the beholder'.</p>

<p>maybe u should stop spending so much time being a nazi and trying to ensure your way as hitlers little youth brigade leader, and maybe start learning how civilized people operate with one another in todays society. People went to war in the 1940's to put an end to the needless censorship of what people want others to know as information, instead of moving along in an openminded society which people are attempting to create, you have reverted back to trying to control everything in a facsist internet regime.</p>

<p>Re: Eduardo Montealegre Why do you replace a version that has outright innacuracies (i.e. the wrong political party), and nothing but allegations. All you need to do is read the local press and realize that what you are supporting as a credible article is totally biased, stemming from the most corrupt elements of Nicaraguan views. Montealegre worked under the Aleman government, but as soon as his misdeeds became public he disassociated himself from him. Aleman and Ortega entered into a pact and Montealegre is the anti-pact standard-bearer. The most recent polls (today's local press) place him neck-to-neck with Ortega!</p>
<p>Eduardo Montealegre Edit by Academic Challenger Because of my lack of Wikipedia experience, my edit did not have the proper links. My apologies. However, your edition still contains a lot of innacuracies and allegations: (1) Montealegre is not running for the Conservative Party, but for The Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance, to which the Conservative Party has added its support. The Conservative Party, by the way, used to be a very important party historically (before the Sandinista revolution); today it is a tiny party. (2) That Montealegre is a Bush fanatic, etc. is just plain silly and wrong. Such statements do not belong in an encyclopedia. (3) That Montealegre has been "charged" is completely false. The facts (as current as today) are that a self-appointed commission in the national assembly has been threatening to charge Montealegre, as well as the former head of Nicaragua's central bank and the former superintendent of banks with enriching themselves in the issuance of CENIs (government bonds). They are only threats, because there really is no legal ground for those allegations. I will try to correct your "contributions". I would appreciate that you would look further into the truth, before admitting allegations.</p>
<p>I am a member of the Louisiana and Florida Bar and would gladly explain to you the legal grounds for the allegations that Eduardo Montealegre faces. Give me a call, 615-310-9169. Eduardo Montealegre was a stockholder in BANCENTRO bank therefore BANCENTRO bank could not participate in an auction where banks that were intervened by the government were auctioned off. You cannot be, in any modern society, a judge and a party. He also illegaly re-classified the worth of the intervened banks in order to charge the Nicaraguan government a compensation. Regarding the Nicaraguan Press, La Prensa is owned in part by P.J. Chamorro, who is a member of Eduardo's political party and stands to gain a seat in parliament with him. It is clearly biased towards Eduardo Montealegre and has always been seen as a newspaper that glorfies the candidate that the Nicaraguan government favors, who is Eduardo in this case.</p>

<p>Hi, Academic Challenger - You deleted the article Elusion recently, and I noticed that User:El-sheikh (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=El-sheikh" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=El-sheikh" rel="nofollow">contribs</a>) has recreated it.

<p><br />
Your reason for deleting "Russian brides -The Facts" is baseless. I agree that some of the information is opinion based, however, it is based on facts collated from the Department of Immigration and scholarly works. Furthermore, this is based on my own research and experiences. Stifling essential information for those would be men out there seeking a bride is to censure what could be, to some, a life saving and informative article.</p>

<p>I have said nothing but that which is proven fact.I was the coroner that examined the bodies in Nebraska and Oklahoma.I felt maddened when I saw that there was no article dedicated to the panzanickel, which is certainly not a myth, but a fact.I ask that you reconsider your deletion of my article, if for no other reason, out of respect for those that died.I understand why you might believe this was fiction, but believe me, it's fact.Thank you, sir.I wish you the best of luck.Good day, now. --User talk:Bluepotato 2:00, 19 August 2006 {USCT}</p>

<dd>*sigh* that's what i was afraid of and hence haven't reverted again - he's blanking content and inserting POV into wikipedia though, that's blatant POV pushing he's doing - especially after his comments on talk pages (including my own) I really think that should be considered vandalism&#160;:( <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordkazan_5201.html" title="User:Lordkazan">Lordkazan</a> 21:39, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Academic Challenger, you have indicated that IYO some of my edits "may constitute vandalism". I'd much appreciate it if you sent me a note telling me which edits are of concern to you, and why you think they may constitute vandalism. Thanks. <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDasondas_79c4.html" title="User:Dasondas">Dasondas</a> 21:59, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I removed some content after checking the cited reference and noticing that it did not support the text in the article. I removed other content as OR because it made unsubstantiated claims. When I claimed vandalism, it was in response to the wholesale, uncommented reversion of several of my previous edits by an editor who has engaged in personal attacks and has indicated strenuously his intention to attempt to block all of my edits on that subject -- I believe this does indeed constitute one of the definitions of vandalism. Please in the future make an attempt to discuss any such issue with me first before speculating as to what may or may not be motivating or characterizing my behavior. I'm sure you'd expect no less of me if the shoe was on the other foot. Thanks. <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDasondas_79c4.html" title="User:Dasondas">Dasondas</a> 22:10, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just responding to your message yesterday (had to leave the computer and was away from the internet for over 24 hours, or I'd have left this sooner). Thanks for your help with those vandals. Yeah, I don't know much about range blocks either: I know how to do a wide range block, but not one of those small ones you usually want so you don't end up affecting too many innocent users. (I'm an admin at a smaller wiki, which is how I know these things.)

<p>Dear Academic Challenger,</p>
<p>Thanks kindly for reverting the vandalism on <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Rebel_%28singer%29_1b29.html" title="Johnny Rebel (singer)">Johnny Rebel (singer)</a>. I have had problems with this vandal for two or three weeks now, I suppose, and lately he has been vandalizing the site daily -- almost always by deleting the external link to an online newspaper article about the subject in question. He recently also left racist graffiti on the site. Again, I appreciate your effort!

<p>I'm having a hard time understanding why you removed my entry on <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezigurler_118f.html" title="User:Nezigurler">User:Nezigurler</a> with no explanation. It should be pretty obvious that it has nothing to do with any personal issue of mine; I've never worked on any of the same pages as he has or exchanged a single word with him (or anyone else who has had a problem with him) until I issued those warnings. His most recent edit was more uncivil nonsense on someone's talk page, a few minutes after I posted my report on AIV. Aside from blanking warnings on his own page, he has removed cited statements from articles and has used abusive language in his edit summaries. What about that is "not really" vandalism? I put him back in with the assumption that it was just an oversight; if you really think he doesn't belong there, please just clarify the situation for me.

<p>Thanks for catching that. I've merged the pages to the earlier one. I accidentally typed an "r" instead of a "k" when I initially looked to see if there was an article on him. On another note, is there a master directory of Wikipedia policies I can find? Specifically, I'm looking for policies that deal with sources and content style.

<p>You recently gave him a vandalism warning. Why? I checked his contribs and there was nothing. --<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYancyfry_jr_2b16.html" title="User:Yancyfry jr">Yancyfry jr</a> 01:56, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Sorry. Just a misunderstanding. --<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYancyfry_jr_2b16.html" title="User:Yancyfry jr">Yancyfry jr</a> 02:16, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
