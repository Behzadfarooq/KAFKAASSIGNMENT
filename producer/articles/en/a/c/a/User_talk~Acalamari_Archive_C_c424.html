I doubt you will experience any crashes on your first try. Experiment with the popups code give above (click the link provided by cometstyles). After saving the code on the page be sure to refresh your browser cash (Ctrl+F5 for Internet Explorer, follow the note on the page if you are using any other explorer). If the code and refresh works properly you should see yellow popups whenever you hover over a wikilink.

<p>This is definitely a sensitive article which warrants semi-protection. However, I would like to see all pages, even those vulnerable to vandalism, such as George W. Bush, be unprotected from time to time. When I joined in 2005, no article ever received indefinite protection. I am particularly willing to unprotect a page if vandalism has been subdued and if it's on my watchlist. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilliam_7bdc.html" title="User:Gilliam">Gilliam</a> 03:10, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey there Acalamari! Not so sure it will make it as a userbox in Template space. Why not try implementing it in User space. For example you can create the template on <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_Awards_giver_b02c.html" title="User:Acalamari/Awards giver">User:Acalamari/Awards giver</a> and implement it like a template by typing {{User:Acalamari/Awards giver}}. Lots of user boxes work that way now adays due to many of them not directly relating to Wikipedia. Hope this helps.<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal"><font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b>¤~Persian Poet Gal</b></i></font></font></a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 00:36, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since getting an account on Wikipedia, my computer has caught around 130 trojan horse viruses!!! What the... Coincidence or what?

<dd>I would have to say it's a coincidence. I've only found the one virus on Wikipedia. If there were more viruses, I'd know about them. Having an account does not make you more prone to catching viruses. Don't you have any anti-virus software and/or a firewall? <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 17:20, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If the only page you've been visiting is Wikipedia, then it makes sense the viruses would come from here, but if you've been to other sites, they get thrown into the equation.

<dd>AVG is not the most trusted anti-virus around because I seemed to get more virus with AVG than without it but by far the most trusted anti-viruses around I think is Norton and/or E-trust although McAfee also gets the job done.

<dl>
<dd>Actually, we went with AVG because we didn't trust Norton and McAfee. We did have E-trust for a while, but then it kept registering viruses that weren't there. As for firewalls, we don't use the Windows one. In fact, the Windows one itself does say that it's only a basic one, and a better type should be installed. However, I am not endorsing any type of software with this message. I, like Wikipedia, am not an advertising host. As long as we have a good firewall and a good anti-virus program, we should all be okay. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 18:59, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, no one has <i>ever</i> vandalized my user page--does this mean you're more popular than me? I bet it does. Or else it means you spend time in pop culture articles--it happens there, because some users are overly personally invested in their idol worship. Don't take it personally, even if you are enjoying the vandal count. And thanks for taking time in this area, as it's nice to know that a responsible and capable editor is monitoring what's going on in these heavily edited and frequently vandalized articles.

<dd>Acalamari, if you have any time to do some reading, can you add to this article <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwabena_Frimpong-Boateng_eb14.html" title="Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng">Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng</a>? There are a couple of references added to the article, but they need to have some text from them incorporated into the article, and I am way too busy right now. The doctor is rather interesting. I worked with a Kenyan doctor briefly who talked about this guy who was Ghana's first and only heart surgeon. It's interesting because in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, possibly excepting Kenya, the rich go to Europea for medical treatment--even in Kenya Europeans buy special medical insurance that pays for and provides medivacuation to Europe, or maybe the Middle East, in case of emergency. In Ghana primary care for malaria, river blindness and AIDS is hard enough for most people, but this guy is a world-class cardiac surgeon practicing in his native land. The editor who started it has been a bit of a pest adding commercial links to other articles (ethnobotanical plants), but the links in this article are good references and the doctor is rather fascinating and deserves a delete-proof article. I did add the proper categories. Cheers. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:24, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Acalamari. You did indeed use tags. But if you read the top of the page, you're asked to <b>ask</b> the user, nicely, if he would mind changing his username. There's even a template for it - {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameConcern_47f1.html" title="Template:UsernameConcern">UsernameConcern</a>}}. You shouldn't just <b>tell</b> them they have to change their name and submit it immediately to RFCN; we always try and be friendly and helpful, especially to the newest editors, who may not be aware what is and is not acceptable, so we ask them to change it, first.</dd>
<dd>And I'm not picking on you in particular for his - I often just remove the RFCNs if nobody made an effort to ask the user to change their name first. I noticed you did mention Betacommand "getting away with it" - there were plenty of people who asked him to change how he was handling user names, and I was just one of them. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Neil</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../n/e/i/User_talk%7ENeil_9072.html" title="User talk:Neil"><span style="text-decoration:none"><small>(not Proto ►)</small></span></a> 17:47, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Take a look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_an_account_ae6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Request an account">Wikipedia:Request an account</a>. Basically, what's going on is that users who cannot read the captcha when signing up for an account have to use this page, where another user can create the account for them, and e-mail them the password.

<p>Hi there. As agreed, I hacked it about and added a "now" argument.

<p>I was in the middle of leaving him a message about the RFC when we were edit-conflicted! I thought I'd use my own words not the template, to explain the problem directly, so I left my message after yours.

<p>Good work. I did some translations into English terminology, added a redirect for House officer on Wikipedia to Residency (medicine)--I'm getting braver creating pages. I don't think there is any worry now about AfD.
