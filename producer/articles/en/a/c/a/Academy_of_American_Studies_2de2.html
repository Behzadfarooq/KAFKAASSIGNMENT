<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_of_American_Studies_2de2.html" title="Edit section: History and Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History and Background</span></h2>
<p>Academy of American Studies Otherwise known as: Academy, AAS</p>
<p>The Academy of American Studies was developed by way of a collaborative effort between the Gilder Lehrman Institute and the Queens High School superintendent. They believed that preparing students by teaching them about the past would lead to inevitable success. This school is the first history school in the United States, which is why it is called the Flagship School of the Gilder Lehrman Institute. The first principal of the Academy of American Studies was Mr. Michael Serber, who currently works for the Gilder Lehrman Institute. The second and recent principal, Ms. Ellen Sherman, used to go to Long Island City High School when it was in that very building, so one can see how history really is a huge part of this school's role as a college prep school. Nine years since its opening, the school has grown into a "community". Now with a campus (a "south building" and a "north building"; the latter is shared with Newcomers High School), this college preparatory school has a "college feel" like it never has before. Due to the academy's success, the Institute has founded 44 other schools across the nation and the Academy is the model for all of those schools.</p>
<p>In the year 2005, as a result of a collaborative effort between the administration, parents, and some students, the Academy of American Studies boosted security by adding crosswalks to the street where students are in most danger of being in any trouble.</p>
<p>October 12, 2006 was a significant day for the Academy. First of all, that day was its 10th anniversary celebration. Secondly, it marked the grand opening of its student-run history research center that contains many primary sources that were donated by the Gilder Lehrman Institute. Thirdly, a Proclamation that was signed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg was presented in the Academy's ceremony to publicly announce that October 12th was going to be celebrated in New York City as The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History Day.</p>
<p>The Academy of American Studies (via Gilder Lehrman) offers summer 1-3 summer scholarships to outstanding freshman each year. In order to be eligible to compete for this scholarship, freshman must rank in the top 10% of their class, as of the end of their December report card. After being notified of such, they must write an essay, and if their essay makes "the cut", they can go on to the interview round. From the interview, 1-3 stellar students are selected. The school also offers 1-2 summer scholarships to juniors each year. In order to be eligible, each junior must write an essay about why s/he would benefit from a trip to China, and must then be interviewed.</p>
<p>Trips are key parts of the educational process at the school. All freshmen are invited to Philadelphia in the fall and Boston in the spring. Sophomores go to historic lower Manhattan in the fall and spend an overnight in Gettysburg in the spring. Juniors take a college tour in the fall and visit Plymouth with a whale watching cruise in the spring. The seniors spend 3 days &amp; 2 nights in Washington, D.C. in the fall and have a self-chosen senior trip in the spring. The academic trips are offered at a discount due to our relationship with the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. No trip prior to the senior spring trip is above $100!</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_of_American_Studies_2de2.html" title="Edit section: Curriculum">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Curriculum</span></h2>
<p>Students take four years of history (including senior thesis &amp; economics senior year, law&amp;government junior year). They also take a required Research &amp; Writing course freshman year, in which they learn how to use the MLA format for citing and writing bibliographies.</p>
<p>Math at the school ends at Precalc/AP Calc. An average student, however, will end with Math B in their senior year. Students who have slightly better grades at the end of the 8th grade are placed in the 1.5 year Math A/B course. These students are then invited to take either precalculus or AP Calculus their senior year. Students need not take precalculus in order to take AP Calculus. One can easily go into AP Calc without taking the other, granted the grades are high enough.</p>
<p>English at the school ends with a Conflict in Literature course senior year, in which students read rather controversial books (Brave New World, Frankenstein). AP English students are at a slightly faster pace, but usually learn many of the same things as their classmates.</p>
<p>Science at the school is limited (physics is taken with Newcomers High School), but it is still offered. Any student interested in physics is placed in physics. The sciences students have to choose from are: living environment, earth science, environmental science, ap biology, physics, and chemistry, so rarely does anyone have a problem finding his/her niche.</p>
<p>Languages end at the AP level. With intensive curricula in both French and Spanish, it is not at all weird that students are invited to AP French/Spanish immediately after completing the regents course.</p>
<p>AP courses are offered in many subjects. The school recently decided to reinstate AP European History as an option. Due to a lack of motivated and apt students back in the 2002-2003 school year, the school had to cut the program. Because the Class of 2006 and the Class of 2007 were not offered the course their sophomore years, both are getting the option of taking it their senior years with sophomores. AP courses offered are: AP Calculus (w/ Newcomers), AP Biology, AP US History, AP European History, AP English Literature, AP French Language, AP Spanish Language, and AP Law &amp; Government (juniors only).</p>
<p>Note: Students are limited at 2 Humanities AP classes. Juniors can only take 2 APs, and seniors can only take 3 (but English, Spanish, and Euro <b>cannot</b> be those three).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_of_American_Studies_2de2.html" title="Edit section: Enrollment and Alumni">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Enrollment and Alumni</span></h2>
<p>The Academy of American Studies consists 620 students, who all applied using the normal NYC Public High School application. Students apply to either the screened program, the Ed Opt program, or both. In order to be eligible for the screened program, students must have fewer than 8 absences, must have grades of 90+ in humanities classes and 85+ in math and science. The Ed Opt program is selective, and anyone who ranks within the top 2% of the 7th grade test takers (98th percentile+) is automatically accepted. The Ed Opt program, however, must also accept the bottom 16% of applicants. Therefore, a student with a score of 1 on the exam has a better chance of getting in than a student with a 3 or a 4, since there are so many more of the latter applying. It is encouraged that students with test scores below the 98th percentile, but stellar grades, apply for the Intensive Humanities Academic program.</p>
<p>Students at this school prove that they are capable of success, even after high school.
