<p>The idea of an academic boycott against Israelis first emerged on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_06.html" title="April 06">April 06</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> in an open letter to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> initiated by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Rose_e0a0.html" title="Steven Rose">Steven</a> and Hilary Rose, lecturers in biology at the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_University_3bc9.html" title="Open University">Open University</a> and social policy at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Bradford_cce2.html" title="University of Bradford">University of Bradford</a> respectively, who called for a moratorium on all cultural and research links with Israel.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> It read:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Despite widespread international condemnation for its policy of violent repression against the Palestinian people in the Occupied Territories, the Israeli government appears impervious to moral appeals from world leaders. The major potential source of effective criticism, the United States, seems reluctant to act. However there are ways of exerting pressure from within Europe. Odd though it may appear, many national and European cultural and research institutions, including especially those funded from the EU and the European Science Foundation, regard Israel as a European state for the purposes of awarding grants and contracts. (No other Middle Eastern state is so regarded). Would it not therefore be timely if at both national and European level a moratorium was called upon any further such support unless and until Israel abide by UN resolutions and open serious peace negotiations with the Palestinians, along the lines proposed in many peace plans including most recently that sponsored by the Saudis and the Arab League."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>By July 2002, the open letter had gained over 700 signatories, including those of ten Israeli academics.<sup id="_ref-GoldenburgWoodward_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GoldenburgWoodward" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In response to the open letter, Leonid Ryzhik, a lecturer in mathematics at Chicago University, led a rival web-based petition that condemned the original's "unjustly righteous tone" and warned that the boycott has a "broader risk of very disruptive repercussions for a wide range of international scientific and cultural contacts". By July 2002, the counter petition has gathered almost 1000 signatories.<sup id="_ref-GoldenburgWoodward_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GoldenburgWoodward" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fink, in a letter published in <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_%28journal%29.html" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a>, criticizes the open letter for its weak argument for singling out Israel: "As it stands, the petitioners have not made a cogent argument for why they selected Israel alone — from the many imperfect nations of the world — for their proposed academic boycott."</p>

He argues that this is a well-known <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitic</a> motif, whereby a Jew could remain a university professor only if he converted, or in this case, severed ties with his own state.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mona Baker's email to Prof Toury read:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Gideon, I have been agonising for weeks over an important decision: to ask you and Miriam, respectively, to resign from the boards of the Translator and Translation Studies Abstracts. I have already asked Miriam and she refused. I have 'unappointed' her as she puts it, and if you decide to do the same I will have to officially unappoint you too.</dd>
<dd>I do not expect you to feel happy about this, and I very much regret hurting your feelings and Miriam's. My decision is political, not personal.</dd>
<dd>As far as I am concerned, I will always regard and treat you both as friends, on a personal level, but I do not wish to continue an official association with any Israeli under the present circumstances.<sup id="_ref-GoldenburgWoodward_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GoldenburgWoodward" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Prof Toury replied:</p>

<dd>I would appreciate it if the announcement made it clear that 'he' (that is, I) was appointed as a scholar and unappointed as an Israeli.<sup id="_ref-GoldenburgWoodward_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GoldenburgWoodward" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Mona Baker replied that:</p>

<dd>I'm damned if I'm going to be intimidated. This is my interpretation of the boycott statement that I've signed and I've tried to make that clear but it doesn't seem to be getting through. I am not actually boycotting Israelis, I am boycotting Israeli institutions. I am convinced that long after this is all over, as it was with the Jews in the Holocaust, people will start admitting that they should have done something, that it was deplorable and that academia was cowardly if it hadn't moved on this.<sup id="_ref-GoldenburgWoodward_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GoldenburgWoodward" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>

<p>On April 22 <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the Council of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_University_Teachers_ed25.html" title="Association of University Teachers">Association of University Teachers</a> (AUT) voted to <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boycott.html" title="Boycott">boycott</a> two Israeli universities: <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haifa_University_886e.html" title="Haifa University">Haifa University</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar-Ilan_University_d3e1.html" title="Bar-Ilan University">Bar-Ilan University</a>. The motions<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[8]</a></sup> to AUT Council were prompted by the call for a boycott from nearly 60 Palestinian academics and others.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[9]</a></sup> The AUT Council voted to boycott Bar-Ilan because it runs courses at colleges in the occupied <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> (referring to <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariel_%28City%29_8304.html" title="Ariel (City)">Ariel</a> College) and "is thus directly involved with the occupation of Palestinian territories contrary to United Nations resolutions". It boycotted Haifa because it was alleged that the university had wrongly disciplined a lecturer. The action against the lecturer was supposedly for supporting a student who wrote about attacks on Palestinians during the founding of the state of Israel (despite the fact that the student's research had been <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandroni_Brigade_0b6a.html" title="Alexandroni Brigade">proved false in court</a> and the University denied having disciplined the lecturer<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[10]</a></sup>).

<p>The AUT's decision was immediately condemned by Jewish groups and many members of the AUT. Critics of the boycott within and outside the AUT noted that at the meeting at which the boycott motion was passed the leadership cut short the debate citing a lack of time. Specifically, The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_Jewish_Students_2785.html" title="Union of Jewish Students">Union of Jewish Students</a> accused the AUT of purposely holding the vote during <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passover.html" title="Passover">Passover</a>, when many Jewish members could not be present<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<dl>
<dd>"Bridging political gulfs - rather than widening them further apart - between nations and individuals thus becomes an educational duty as well as a functional necessity, requiring exchange and dialogue rather than confrontation and antagonism. Our disaffection with, and condemnation of acts of academic boycotts and discrimination against scholars and institutions, is predicated on the principles of academic freedom, human rights, and equality between nations and among individuals."<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[12]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Israel's embassy in London issued a statement criticizing the AUT's vote as a "distorted decision that ignores the British public's opinion", and condemning the resolutions for being "as perverse in their content as in the way they were debated and adopted." The embassy also noted that "[t]he last time that Jews were boycotted in universities was in 1930s Germany."<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In May 2006, on the last day of its final conference, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Association_of_Teachers_in_Further_and_Higher_Education_817f.html" title="National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education">National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education</a> (NATFHE) passed motion 198C, a call to boycott Israeli academics who did not vocally speak out against their government.</p>
<p>The following portions of the resolution are quoted by <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Klug_eea2.html" title="Brian Klug">Brian Klug</a><sup id="_ref-Klug_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Klug" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<li>"The conference invites members to consider their own responsibility for ensuring equity and non-discrimination in contacts with Israeli educational institutions or individuals, and to consider the appropriateness of a boycott of those that do not publicly dissociate themselves from such policies."</li>
<li>"The conference notes continuing Israeli apartheid policies, including construction of the exclusion wall, and discriminatory educational practices. It recalls its motion of solidarity last year for the AUT resolution to exercise moral and professional responsibility."</li>

<p>A group of 8 Nobel laureates preemptively denounced the policy before it was passed from the perspective of limiting academic freedom.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[19]</a></sup> Frank Wilczek of MIT expressed his concerns as such: "The primary value of the scientific community is pursuit of understanding through free and open discourse.

<dl>
<dd>"In short, the intention of the Natfhe motion - what it seeks and why - is obscure. But even if the policy and rationale were clear and unambiguous, there is a deeper problem with motions of this sort that prevents them from attracting a broad base of support: they rely on <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">the false (or limited) analogy implied by the word 'apartheid'</a>. This is not to say that there are no points of comparison, for there are - just as there are in a host of other countries where minority ethnic and national groups are oppressed. Nor is it even to say that the suffering experienced by Palestinians is less than that endured by 'non-whites' in South Africa: it may or may not be (although I am not sure how to do the sums). But as I have argued elsewhere: 'The validity of the analogy does not depend on a catalogue of atrocities, however appalling'."</dd>

<p>The Association of Jewish Sixthformers (AJ6) issued a press release expressing dismay and concern "about the affects of any boycott on Jewish and Israeli Sixthformers."

<dl>
<dd>"It is profoundly unjust for academics in the only democratic country in the Middle East -- the only country where scholarship and debate are permitted to freely flourish -- to be held to an ideological test and the threat of being blacklisted because of their views. No one would expect a British or American professor to have to withstand such scrutiny of their political views.

<p>Mackney, the general secretary of NATFHE and who opposed the motion as passed, is quoted after the fact by the Guardian:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The ironic thing, is if we had put this to delegates a couple of weeks ago, before the international <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-Israeli_lobby_3ec3.html" title="Pro-Israeli lobby">pro-Israeli lobby</a> started this massive campaign emailing delegates and trying to deny us our democratic right to discuss whatever we like, it probably wouldn't have passed. People feel bullied, and what we have seen is a hardening of attitudes. All they achieved was making the delegates determined to debate and pass the motion."<sup id="_ref-TraubmannGuardian_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TraubmannGuardian" title="">[23]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Tamara Traubmann and Benjamin Joffe-Walt, reporting for the Guardian, conducted an analysis of "whether the campaigns against such boycotts are actually motivated by concerns for academic freedom, or whether they are using the universalist ideal to stifle critical discussion of Israel." They describe their findings this way:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Through discussions with anti-boycott campaigners and a trace of the most common emails (not necessarily abusive) sent to the union and handed over by Natfhe, we found the vast majority of the tens of thousands of emails originated not with groups fighting for academic freedom, but with lobby groups and thinktanks that regularly work to delegitimise criticisms of Israel."<sup id="_ref-TraubmannGuardian_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TraubmannGuardian" title="">[23]</a></sup></dd>

<p>The academic boycott of South Africa is frequently invoked as a model for more recent efforts to organize academic boycotts of Israel.<sup id="_ref-BeckettGuardian_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BeckettGuardian" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some invoke the comparison to claim that an academic boycott of Israel should not be controversial based a misconception that the academic boycott of South Africa was uncontroversial and straightforward. The reality, at the time, was very different. The effort was the subject of significant criticism and contentious debate from diverse segments. Andrew Beckett writes, in the Guardian, on this frequent mistaken comparison:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In truth, boycotts are blunt weapons. Even the most apparently straightforward and justified ones, on closer inspection, have their controversies and injustices."<sup id="_ref-BeckettGuardian_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BeckettGuardian" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Other, such as Hillary and Stephen Rose in Nature, make the comparison and argue for an academic boycott of Israel based on a belief that the academic boycott of South Africa was effective in ending apartheid. George Fink responds to this claim in a letter to Nature:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The assertion [...] that the boycott of South Africa by the world's academic communities 'was instrumental in ending apartheid in South Africa' is a deception.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Apartheid was actually terminated by two pivotal and interrelated political events. First, the United States Congress, on 29 September 1986, overrode President Reagan's veto and imposed strict economic sanctions on South Africa. Second, F. W. de Klerk was elected president of South Africa on 14 September 1989. Two months later (16 November 1989), de Klerk announced the scrapping of the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separate_Amenities_Act_3025.html" title="Separate Amenities Act">Separate Amenities Act</a>, then, on 11 February 1990, freed Nelson Mandela from prison. The rest is historical detail."</dd>
