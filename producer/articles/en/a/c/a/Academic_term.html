	    <p>An <b>academic term</b> is a division of an academic year, the time during which a <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">school</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">college</a> or <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">university</a> holds classes. These divisions may be called 'terms', 'semesters', 'quarters', or 'trimesters', depending on the institution and the country.</p>
<p>Institutions often have two <b>semesters</b> (four-month terms, though it literally means "six months") in an academic year, each lasting between 15 and 18 weeks. A <b>quarter</b> or <b>trimester</b> (three-month term) lasts between 8 and 12 weeks, and there are typically three per year. Other permutations are sometimes used – for example, two semesters each divided into two quarters, four quarters, or even three semesters.</p>
<p>In contrast to a <i>calendar year</i>, in most countries an <b>academic year</b> ends at the start of the summer, and starts again at the end of the summer. This is because it follows the medieval agricultural pattern of the year in northern Europe, in which July and August were when able-bodied young people were needed on the farms.</p>

Most schools have a first term from <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a> to mid-July. The exact date of the beginning of the summer break and its duration vary across regions, but commonly the break lasts for about one or two months.

A second term lasts from early September to late December with a winter break at the end of the year. The term is followed by a third term from early January to early March and a brief spring break lasting several weeks. The <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graduation_ceremony.html" title="Graduation ceremony">graduation ceremony</a> occurs in March, and the enrollment ceremony in early April.</p>
<p>Some universities and colleges accept students in September to let those students from other semester systems enroll. In recent years a few colleges have begun experimenting with having two semesters instead of the traditional three with the break between two semesters in summer.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, an academic year — particularly in universities — usually runs from <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a> to <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_31.html" title="July 31">July 31</a>, although actual teaching usually runs from September or October of one year through to late May, June or July of the following year, with the time split up into three terms. The school year usually runs from <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a> to <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_31.html" title="August 31">August 31</a> although the full extent is usually only noticeable in determining the year of admission. Most primary and secondary schools open on the first Monday of September and ends on the 2nd Friday of July.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_term.html" title="Edit section: Schools">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Schools</span></h3>
<p>Most schools run a three-term school year. They usually have a week's break half way through (half-term) and are structured as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autumn term: September to December (half-term, October)</li>
<li>Spring term: January to March (half-term, February)</li>
<li>Summer term: April to July (half-term, June)</li>
</ul>
<p>The time between the end of school and the start of the next academic year is known as the summer holiday or, as was the traditional length of the break, the six-week holiday. Some <a href="../../../c/o/u/County.html" title="County">counties</a> and schools have recently experimented with different school year arrangements with the general idea of having shorter blocks of both school and non-school time.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, school begins in late August, and ends around late June or early July, usually in eastern counties from the third Monday in August to the first Friday in July and in western counties from the second Monday in August to the last Friday in June. Pupils attend school for approximately 190 days a year.</p>
<p>Most schools run a four-term school year and are structured as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summer term: August to October (October Holidays: Two Weeks)</li>
<li>Autumn term: October to December (Christmas Holidays: Two Weeks)</li>
<li>Winter term: January to March (Easter Holidays: Two Weeks)</li>
<li>Spring term: April to July (Summer Holidays: Six Weeks)</li>

<p>As with many aspects of UK universities, there are a lot of differing practices that use confusingly similar terminology. Many universities run 10-week Autumn, Spring and Summer terms, though some use different names or a semester system, with the new semester beginning halfway through the second term. Many other universities run unevenly lengthened terms, with the autumn term usually the longest. Even within individual institutions practice can vary from year to year to accommodate factors such as the changing date of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter.html" title="Easter">Easter</a>. Some universities also have a "reading week" in which no teaching takes place at all, the equivalent of a school half term. At other universities "reading weeks" are not uniform and may be in different weeks in different faculties, departments, modules or even seminar groups. Some reading weeks only cover seminars whilst lectures continue; others suspend both for the week.</p>

</ul>
<p>An exception is the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_University_3bc9.html" title="Open University">Open University</a>: most of its undergraduate courses do not coincide with the academic year used by universities in Britain and elsewhere. Instead, they largely coincide with the calendar year — they typically start in February, with examinations in autumn.</p>
<p>In England, academic and judicial institutions traditionally organised their year into four terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilary_of_Poitiers_789f.html" title="Hilary of Poitiers">Hilary</a>: approx January–April</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter.html" title="Easter">Easter</a>: approx April–May</li>

<li><a href="../../../m/i/c/Michaelmas.html" title="Michaelmas">Michaelmas</a>: approx October–December</li>
</ul>
<p>In Scotland, academic and judicial institutions traditionally organised their year into four terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Candlemas: 2 February, Candlemas, which fell forty days after Christmas, marked the presentation of the infant Jesus in the temple and the purification of the Virgin Mary.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whitsunday: originally a moveable term day, coming the seventh Sunday after Easter, was fixed in Scotland at 15 May in 1693. Whitsunday was originally the feast of Pentecost, around which a great many christenings would occur, so it became associated with the color white.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lammas Day: 1 August, feast of St. Peter ad Vincula was a corruption of loaf-mass, the Sunday on which the first fruits of harvest were offered, first corn ground, and first loaf made. In Scotland it was associated with hand-fasting and some fairs on this day were called handfasting fairs. (Originally synonymous with betrothal, handfasting became a contract binding a man and woman to live together for a year and a day before they decided on permanent marriage.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Martinmas: 11 November, was known as St. Martin in Winter or St. Martin of Tours to distinguish this from another feast of St. Martin in July.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Specific dates varied between institutions, and all except Michaelmas were determined by the date of Easter).</p>
<p>Over time, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a> dropped Trinity term and renamed Hilary to Lent, then <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a> also dropped Trinity term, and renamed Easter term as 'Trinity' thus establishing the three-term academic year.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_term.html" title="Edit section: Primary and secondary schools">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Primary and secondary schools</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, the academic year for most K-12 institutions typically consists of two 18-week semesters, each divided into two nine-week marking periods, and typically constituting 180 instructional days. An instructional week is five instructional days, measured Monday–Friday at most public and private schools; Sunday–Thursday at some Jewish private schools; Saturday–Wednesday or Sunday–Thursday at Muslim private schools; and so on.</p>
<p>The traditional start date for the school year has been the day after <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_Day_663d.html" title="Labor Day">Labor Day</a> (the first Tuesday after the first Monday in September), but many schools now start in the last two weeks of August and some schools (especially private ones) may start as late as the end of September or the first week in October. The school year ends 36 instructional weeks after it begins. Also, some schools are now moving to the first Wednesday in September (usually two days after Labor Day, unless it falls on September 1 or 2) to allow a short week as people adjust to being in school again.</p>
<p>School holidays, which are not counted as instructional days, typically include Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Thanksgiving Friday (two days), a break at the beginning of winter federal holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day (10 days), Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday, spring break during the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Christianity_00b9.html" title="Western Christianity">Western Christian</a> <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Week_45de.html" title="Holy Week">Holy Week</a> and sometimes the day after <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter.html" title="Easter">Easter</a> (five or six days), and Memorial Day. Some schools also observe one or more of Columbus Day, Veteran's Day, Lincoln's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, and other state or local holidays. Some schools have additional holidays for students that are workdays for the staff, such as parent–teacher conference days. The aggregate of school holidays typically amounts to 20 days, so an academic year that starts the last week of August or first week of September will typically finish the second or third week of June.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_term.html" title="Edit section: Community colleges">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Community colleges</span></h3>
<p>Many community colleges originated as extensions of the primary and secondary school system. These colleges often continue to follow the K-12 system calendar in their jurisdiction. Many, however, have changed to one of the standard collegiate calendars discussed below.</p>
<p><a name="Collegiate_calendars" id="Collegiate_calendars"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_term.html" title="Edit section: Collegiate calendars">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Collegiate calendars</span></h3>
<p>Three calendar systems are used by American colleges and universities: quarter system, <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semester.html" title="Semester">semester</a> system, and trimester system. These are ways the calendar year, measured September–August or August–August, are organized into a formal academic year.</p>
<p>The quarter system divides the calendar year into four quarters, three of which constitute a complete academic year. Quarters are typically 12 weeks long so that three quarters amount to 36 weeks of instruction.</p>
<p>The semester system divides the calendar year into two semesters of 18 weeks each, plus an optional summer session of nine weeks. The two semester together constitute 36 weeks of instruction, so that three academic quarters equal two academic semesters. Thus, academic credit earned in quarter hours converts to semester hours at 2/3 of its value, while credit earned in semester hours converts to quarter hours at 3/2 of its value. Or, to put it another way, 3 quarter hours = 2 semester hours and 2 semester hours = 3 quarter hours.</p>
<p>The trimester system evolved out of the semester system. It divides the calendar year into three equal portions of 15–16 weeks each. The fall and winter (or spring) trimesters constitute an academic year of 30–32 weeks. The reduced maximum course load that accompanies the shortening from the traditional semester makes the trimester system compatible with the semester system. Academic credit is thus measured on the trimester system in semester hours; there is no such thing as a "trimester hour" of credit.</p>
<p>The quarter system is typically found in western states, while the trimester system is very popular in the Midwest. The semester system still prevails in eastern states.</p>
