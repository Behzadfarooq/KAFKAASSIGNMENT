<p>I'm sorry; but I'm not sure what you are asking when you say, "what is the meaning of this page?" in regards to <a href="../../../5/7/_/Wikipedia%7E57_Varieties_of_Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_eab5.html" title="Wikipedia:57 Varieties of Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense">Wikipedia:57 Varieties of Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense</a>. Are you asking about that specific page, <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a> in its entirety, or just the specific edit you mention later in your message on my talk page?</p>
<p>As for why I added User talk:Dr. Stephen J. Krune III to BJAODN; I found that entire talk page to be hilariously funny. I'm sure, being one of the parties to that discussion that you would disagree, but humor is subjective anyway.</p>
<p>I found Krune's hystarics amusing; hence I added it to BJAODN. Of course, it seems more than likely that he was here to troll in a misguided effort to be amusing anyway, so perhaps per <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> I shouldn't have added it. But <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> is an essay, and BJAODN is for bad jokes and frankly, I think Krune was here to pull a bad joke and even if he wasn't, his talk page reads like a bad joke (to me).</p>
<p>Does that answer your question? If not let me know. ~ <i><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="color:#0cc">ONUnicorn</span></a></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup><small><a href="../../../p/%26/s/WP%7EP%26S_1d27.html" title="WP:P&amp;S">problem solving</a></small> 19:27, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, it is a joke page. Check out <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a> to learn all about "Bad jokes and other deleted nonsense". There are, at this point, 57 pages of bad jokes and other deleted nonsense. Some are better than others. When I'm bored I go look at them, and when I find something I think is funny I add it. As for how I found out about Krune... I was reading the firestorm over at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_ee2f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship</a>, so I took a look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Ryulong_3_6713.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ryulong 3">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ryulong 3</a> to see what the fuss was about, saw your question to Ryulong about what he (she?) would do with that user, and went over there to see what that was about. In other words, just poking my nose in everything that it doesn't belong in because I'm curious.

<dd>I've removed it. The page has been deleted and can only be viewed by admins. Additionally, we now delete most pages about vandals and trolls per DENY and posting such pages to BJAOAN just undermines that. <b>Sarah</b> 16:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ahh, the rule there is less clear-cut than we might expect. While <i>free</i> images are allowed on userpages, any <i>fair-use</i> images are restricted (per policy) to the article namespace.

I wouldn't consider myself an expert in this particular policy area by any stretch of the imagination, but as a pretty good rule of thumb, fair use on userpages is discouraged. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 23:21, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I <i>did</i> check; and read through them extensively. The comments you removed were not vandalism or disruptive; they would not have been kept or archived by those who regularly edit the pages if they had been. Your removal of Talk page comments, however, <b>is</b> vandalism -- of an egregious sort. I'm sorry, because I can tell you think you were doing the right thing, but it wasn't. Not by a long shot.--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 19:53, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's not vandalism if the messages are rude. I've read that. However, I recently wrote on Mr. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">ChrisGriswold's</a> talk page that I will revert my removals if asked to.

<li>I know you didn't "intend" to vandalise, but you did just the same -- in large part because you were given the go-ahead by Chris who should have known much better. That's why I'm posting this up for others to review on the <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">Admin's Noticeboard</a>: not because of your actions-- which, yes were wrong-- but because Chris prompted you to do so. I understand that you are a fairly recent user and want to "learn the ropes' so to speak; it's just highly inappropriate to delete comments by other users, even if you consider them "rude" -- which I do not, nor apparently did the regular editors on the Talk pages you took to "helping". I think you realised that it wasn't appropriate, when you went to Chris to ask if it was alright. --<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 20:04, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Let's also be clear - no good faith contribution to the encyclopedia can ever be vandalism. It is transparently obvious that those comment removals were obviously in good faith, and thus not vandalism. In addition, they were obviously correct actions that helped the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 21:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Let's be further clear, then: mass removal of legitimate comments for no other reason than because they were left by an IP address claimed to be a banned user is an inherent assumption of bad faith.

<li>One of the edits you mentioned on the noticeboard, Krune's edit to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Talk%7EElizabeth_%28film%29_c49f.html" title="Talk:Elizabeth (film)">Talk: Elizabeth (film)</a>, you say was fine. The last time I looked commenting on what the film is about <i>does not</i> belong on talk pages. No one should care what someone thinks of a film: talk pages are to discuss the article, not the subject. Also, do not accuse me of bad faith. I'm not giving out any accusations here. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 22:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You didn't notice that the Elizabeth comments were left under a section "<i>Perhaps some discussion of how historically accurate this film is...</i>" making it an entirely legitimate there.

<dd>A closer look, actually, reveals that you deleted the comments not of the IP, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Elizabeth_%28film%29&amp;diff=104243268&amp;oldid=92301928" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Elizabeth_%28film%29&amp;diff=104243268&amp;oldid=92301928" rel="nofollow">those of user UUCP</a> -- which makes your action even more grievous.

<dd>Further, I stand by the statement that it is an inherent <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF"><i>assumption</i> of bad faith</a> to delete wholesale a single user/IP's comments on the belief that the user is banned.

<li>I understand you feel that way. Reverting yourself was an appropriate action; but "urgency" is not a requisite description for reverts. Edit summaries-- particularly for minor edits, which is what reverts are considered-- don't have an "importance" qualifier.

<p>I've just seen your conversation on <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a>'s talkpage. Please don't delete your barnstars. As to your comment: "<i>I was more concerned that I had gone from a "reasonable" user to an idiot in less than 24 hours</i>". I certainly don't think this has happended. <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a> has always been a bit of a mess and procedure there is very unclear. The notification template, for example, was only <i>created</i> on Jan 29... I know we haven't seen eye-to-eye on a few of your latest reports but I do not think you are looking to get users blocked. I think you may be preempting difficulties where none may arise, and I'm not sure that's helpful, but have no question you are doing this in the utmost good faith. Ultimately <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a> policy is still developing and people are bound to have differences of opinion as to how it should work.

<p>You deleted a significant amount of material from User:George Carlin's talk page, commenting that it was a "personal attack", when in fact it was clearly complementary towards User:George Carlin.

<p>Acalamari, if you find a problem, come to me. You don't have the experience to handle many of the things you are getting into, and it would be better to get someone with experience. For example, your removing comments from talk pages. Don't do that anymore. You simply don't have the experience yet. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 20:39, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You said on my talk page a day or so ago about losing your patience, so I decided to stop asking you for any help, as I didn't want to become irritating. Even before then, I decided to limit asking you for help in order to stop myself from becoming an annoyance. As for removing vandalism or personal attacks from talk/user talk pages...I won't remove any messages from user talk pages other than my own (personal attacks or not, I'll leave the attack messages alone to avoid being called a vandal), and with other talk pages, I'll only remove the vandalism if it's obvious vandalism (like blanking). <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 21:34, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your note. Yes, you've caught on to one of the major flaws with wikipedia, that "anyone can edit". And when someone famous is in the news for some reason, the vermin come out and chew on the articles. I've found it's best to let the commotion die down for a few days. Or, given that there are plenty of others reverting, you could just check back once in awhile and see if some vandalism has been there for awhile. Then it's safer to revert, i.e. the fix might last a little longer than in the peak of the day. What a nuisance, though. I like writing on this site, but it seems you have to take the bad with the good. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:09, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
