<p>I would like to note that this article is an uneasy pair with <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy.html" title="Academy">Academy</a>. IMO it is very difficult to make any reasonable cut between what facts belong with one article, and which ones with the other. Can I suggest that they be merged, with the one being a redirect to the other?</p>
<p>I have no opinion on which should redirect to which. -- Cimon</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the current separation is fine, with this article discussin contemporary academia and the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy.html" title="Academy">Academy</a> article on Plato's Academy. The <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy.html" title="Academy">Academy</a> article should probably have a disambiguation note pointing to this page up at the top, rather than just at the bottom. "Academia" never refers to Plato's Academy, so this page doesn't need disambiguation. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a> 21:29, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What about</p>
<ul>
<li>historical development -- ie University classrooms - 13 of them recently excavated in Alexandria, Egypt - perhaps related to the Library in Alexandria.</li>
<li>relationship to teaching clerics -- as at Oxford and Cambridge.</li>
<li>Land grant act in the US - funding state universities</li>
<li>John Barth's <i>Giles Goat-boy</i> where the entire world is a university</li>

Certainly politics and fundraising are more fundamental to Academia than the statement of past history.

<dd>I'm of two minds about this. The history of the university is scattered around Wikipedia -- there's some discussion in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">University</a> article and a good article I just now found on the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval_university.html" title="Medieval university">medieval university</a>. This article should link those, but probably not reduplicate their entire contents (although it's indisputably relevant here).

<p>Also, the section on "Practice and Theory" lists some criticisms of academics being Ivory Tower-types; this could do with some rebuttal from the academic-POV for neutrality.</p>

<dd>The Roman Catholic Church revolutionized their own system of educating young men at universities with the introduction of a standard core curriculum that would be the same at each institution. They called it the seven liberal arts. The first three were called the trivium: grammar (reading and writing), rhetoric (literature and complicated forms of writing), logic (philosophy). The other four were electives called the quadrivium: arithmetic (number theory), geometry (number relations), music, and astronomy. Another subject was considered the eighth and highest form of liberal art: theology (study of God).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>After the ban on the Roman Catholic Church in England, the national Church of England seized control of the universities at Cambridge and Oxford. They continued the practice of teaching the liberal arts curriculum introduced by Catholicism at these institutions, as well as in new schools begun by various Protestant denominations throughout Europe.</dd>

<p>The material has some potential merit, but currently has many problems. I propose removing it until some of these have been remedied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy US centricity. If the decline is just in the US is it really that important to overall academia? If just the US, then this belongs somewhere other than this article, if it is more widespread, then discussion of the greater problem is necessary.</li>
<li>Lots of <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel words</a> - some believe, etc.</li>
<li>A complete lack of reference to actual sources. Currently the section reads like an essay, an example of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">what wikipedia is not</a>. Wikipedia is a secondary source. Addition of actual notable sources holding the POV noted would fix this problem, and the one above.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will remove the addition later today and move it here to the talk page if it is not fixed. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 12:01, Aug 19, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it might be best to leave it in a little longer and see what happens. Not everything can get fixed overnight, and this section points to a real issue in a lot of current discussions of academia. I think the major problem is the lack of sources -- this section really needs references and citations to some of the ever-growing literature on this subject. Maybe someone can begin to fix that if the section stays for a while; I can take a look through some books by Stanley Aronowitz and Cary Nelson for good citations later. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a> 14:36, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks -- but I think it still needs a lot of work. Once we get a better summary of the issues, I'd love to spawn a separate full-fledged article on the corporatization of the university; there's a lot of material out there from the last couple of decades, but summarizing it is no simple task. There's some relevant material in Wikipedia articles on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graduate_student.html" title="Graduate student">graduate students</a> and <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_publishing.html" title="Academic publishing">academic publishing</a> as well (probably elsewhere too). -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a> 16:53, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Qualifications</li>
<li>Conferences (or fold this into Societies)</li>

<li>(all its subsections remain intact)</li>

<li>Economic changes</li>

<dd>Please don't retitle Early to Medieval -they are not the same and the section in this article is not limited to the Medieval period. Practice and theory should be earlier and expanded -somewhere we need to fit in town versus gown issues, commercial versus pure research, etc. You seem to have missed Societies in your structure. It is currently in its position as the bridge between early and modern structures. This article is in need of several other expansions -our discussion of modern universities covers only the U.S. and only till the early 1800's. And even then no mention of land grant colleges, practical colleges -teaching colleges, mining schools, etc., admission of women. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 23:09, Aug 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've reordered things and introduced new sections for the conflicts you mentioned (town/gown, research/commerce). I don't get your point about the "Early" section not referring solely to the middle ages (since it begins with a reference to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval_university.html" title="Medieval university">Medieval university</a> and refers exclusively to medieval dates), but I retained the title "early" so that it can be expanded later on to include whatever else is necessary.

<p>There are some snippets in this article that seem to me to merit removal. From "Economic Changes", some pure unattributed opinion:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Cynical observers remark that the low levels of pay and respect given to liberal arts Ph.D.s (and even moreso to secondary and elementary teachers) are testament to the fact that our society no longer values disciplines such as philosophy, literature, and other humanities and may represent an even more pervasive decline in American society, education, and values not limited merely to academia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The poor academic job market is considered to be one of the early 21st-century's three most prominent spark factors, along with healthcare and housing costs.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And from "History of academic journals", a completely false historical generalization:</p>
<dl>
<dd>For over 2,000 years following the founding of Plato's Academy, research was, for the most part, communicated orally. Little, if any, research was published: publishing was expensive, and academics typically just circulated papers, letters, or notes of their work-in-process among a small group of their peers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can these be fixed (factually corrected and better attributed), or should they just be scrapped as I suspect?</p>
<p>I have some doubts about the appropriateness of including here exaggerated claims about the demise of traditional publishing attributed to Andrew Odlyzko (apparently from papers like <a href="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/tragic.loss.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/tragic.loss.txt" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue6_2/odlyzko/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue6_2/odlyzko/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), as well. As far as I'm aware Odlyzko and these publications are not widely cited nor widely discussed in the academy as a whole, and his articles seem to discuss academic publishing in mathematics (his own field) almost exclusively. Can someone improve that section with better citations and possibly also move it to a more appropriate article like <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_publishing.html" title="Academic publishing">academic publishing</a>? -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a> 22:45, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>China had academies of learning from the axial age (Warring States) onwards. Didn't the ancient and medieval Arab world have institutions of higher learning as well? Is this the right article to insert such matter? Perhaps there are some qualities of the ancestral European university that distinguishes it from those of the Arabs and the Chinese. Other groups, such as the Mayans and their remarkable scientific and literary skills, also must have had some setting of learning, but does it count as an "academic institution"? As a sinologist I should try to research and add anything that may prove relevant for China. For the Arabs or anyone else, we will need someone more qualified.</p>

<p>The content of the article says that "In fact it is often seen that many academic developments turn out only much later to have great practical results." As an academician myself, as well as for the good of the content of this article, I would like to see some examples cited of this. <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhoistheroach_a0c3.html" title="User:Whoistheroach">whoistheroach</a> 14:44, 15 Dec 2005</p>

<p>I really, really like this article; I can see why it was a featured article. This a relatively minor point, but I thought it might be utilitarian to insert an image of Plato aside from the one culled from the painting of The Academy of Athens. The picture is not an accurate representation of the man; anyone who knows their art history will know that's actually Leonardo da Vinci, who served as the model for that particular representation of Plato. (Michelangelo and other renaissance artists, consequently, are also seen in the painting, standing in for their ancient counterparts). Anyone who can find a suitable image (such as the famous greek bust of Plato), feel free to replace it. Otherwise, leave it be. <a href="../../../k/a/e/User%7EKaelus_4c2d.html" title="User:Kaelus">Kaelus</a> 13:04, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point! Why not mention Raphael's portrait of Leonardo as Plato in the context of the Renaissance revival of the idea of "Academy"? --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 16:27, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why is there no section in this article of criticisms or critiques about academia? For example, as a university student, I often hear of people referring to academics as being disconnected from the rest of the world because they are "stuck in their <a href="../../../i/v/o/Ivory_Tower_fb51.html" title="Ivory Tower">Ivory Tower</a>," and that specialization in academic disciplines has become overspecialization in that many academics cannot even effectively communicate with contemporaries in somewhat related fields because they can't speak the same language, etc. The critiques brought up in the article are not too easy to spot, and they are scattered around, as the article is very long. Is it even worth it to add a new section like this? If one is added, how should it be organized, especially considering many of the critiques have their own articles? Should I just try something and see what happens? -- <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleg_79f4.html" title="User:Doubleg">Doubleg</a> 05:26, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As far as I know, many conferences/workshops DO NOT distribute accepted papers in advance. Attendees only get copies (either printed copies or digital ones) just before the conference/workshop starts, or one day earlier. The main objective of conferences/workshops is interaction instead of criticism on the accepted papers. --Eng2007 20:38, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
