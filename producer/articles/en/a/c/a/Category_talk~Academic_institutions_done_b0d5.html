<p>I propose unification of "Colleges" and "Universities" categories into "Universities and Colleges" categories because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost all existing articles and lists and subcategories combine colleges and universities.</li>
<li>Some institutions (like say, MIT, a "degree-granting institution of higher learning) are difficult to classify.</li>
<li>Almost all readers are looking for a unified list, anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>This entails doing the following (shown in existing tree):</p>
<pre>
Category:Colleges -&gt; Redirect to Category:Universities and colleges
 Category:Military colleges -&gt; delete
  Category:Military colleges and universities
         -&gt; Universities and colleges; Military
 Category:Colleges by country -&gt; delete
  Category:Universities and colleges of COUNTRY X
         -&gt; Move to Category:Universities and colleges by nationality
  Category:Universities and colleges by nationality 
         -&gt; Should be in Category:Universities and colleges only
Category:Universities -&gt; Redirect to Category:Universities and colleges
 Category:Military universities -&gt; delete
  Category:Military colleges and universities (shown above)
 Category:Universities and colleges by nationality (shown above)
 Category:Lists of colleges and universities 
        -&gt; Move to Category:Universities and colleges
 Category:Grandes écoles
        -&gt; Move to Category:Universities and colleges?
 Academia operosorum Labacensis
        -&gt; Assign to the appropriate country?
</pre>
<p>I'm not sure if Category:Grandes écoles should be translated into English, and whether or not it should be "Universities and colleges in France"? -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 04:27, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would like them separated. If an article doesn't fit into cat:colleges nor cat:universities then create a category for itself or add it to cat:higher education institutions or something like that. The problem with cat:univ &amp; colleges is that we have many contributors that use cat:univ instead of cat:univ &amp; colleges because the first makes more sense. The problem is that there are so many using cat:univ &amp; colleges that doing it by hand sucks, ask andre engels or angela to do that with bots or somthing. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnCrawford_051e.html" title="User:JohnCrawford"></a> —<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnCrawford_051e.html" title="User:JohnCrawford">John</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnCrawford_b3e7.html" title="User talk:JohnCrawford">Talk</a> 04:41, Aug 20, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I want them merged, with two exceptions. <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandes_%C3%89coles_ce6d.html" title="Grandes Écoles">Grandes Écoles</a> are a particular kind of French university, so <a href="../../../g/r/a/Category%7EGrandes_%C3%A9coles_b5ca.html" title="Category:Grandes écoles">Category:Grandes écoles</a> should first of all be capitalized properly, and then should be made a subcategory of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUniversities_and_colleges_in_France_0d91.html" title="Category:Universities and colleges in France">Category:Universities and colleges in France</a>. Category:Lists of colleges and universities should also be kept as a subcategory of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUniversities_and_colleges_acb3.html" title="Category:Universities and colleges">Category:Universities and colleges</a>. Not my thing, but based on the proliferation of these kinds of categories in many other areas, a lot of people seem to like grouping list articles all together. I agree that all of the remaining should be merged into <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUniversities_and_colleges_acb3.html" title="Category:Universities and colleges">Category:Universities and colleges</a> and then deleted. There is no use to having separate categories for universities and colleges. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 04:54, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Postdlf says, <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandes_%C3%A9coles.html" title="Grandes écoles">grandes écoles</a></i> are a particular kind of French colleges. Administratively speaking, they are distinct from normal public universities: they recruit their students differently, and are organized very differently in general. I removed the capitalization, since it should be lowercase.</dd>
<dd>I don't think you can do a translation of the concept into English. A direct translation is "great school", which does not mean anything. "Elite school" sounds pretentious, and anyway not all <i>grandes écoles</i> are elitist.</dd>
<dd>I note that many articles in English on this topic on other sites and newsmagazines leave the original French word. I think this is appropriate for foreign concepts for which there's no clear unambiguous translation. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 07:37, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are <i>grandes écoles</i> in Italy too - they are called <i>scuole superiori</i> and, from what I know of them, they work just like grandes écoles. This leads me to suppose they exist in other countries too: wouldn't it be better to regroup all of these institutes under something like 'College-like institutions' (surely someone can provide a better name)? 62.98.115.74</dd>

<p>Check out Category:Universities by nationality and compare it to Category:Universities and colleges by nationality. Category:Universities by nationality had 17 entries before I started to include univ&amp;colleges under it, while Category:Universities and colleges by nationality had only 2 (US and India, all the others were added by me).

<dd>My statement was more that it doesn't make sense as a classification to divide colleges and universities, not whether people are inclined to do it or not, because practice can be changed. Logically, there is nothing gained. I also think if we kept them separate, we'd have a lot of arbitrary inclusions in both, and it hamper navigation because it would be difficult to know which one to look in. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 05:24, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Take a look at the discussion of the use of the terms "college" and "university" in <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">college</a>, and the comparison between the U.S. and U.K. usage. It looks like the distinction means more in the U.K., and it's a different kind of distinction from that in the U.S. which is more of an imprecise separation between the kinds of degrees offered. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 08:22, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Damn, what a freaking mess! I never saw it that way cuz for Puerto Ricans a college is either an institution that offers associate degrees but no bachellor degrees or a private K-12 school. Over here a university is any higher education system that offers bachellors (even if it doesn't offer masters or doctoral degrees). By the way, in many Latin American countries a "college" is a K-12 school while a higher education system is a "school".

<dd>It seems that what is the most consistant is that colleges and universities are designations given to instititutions of higher education, period, with a difference in usage between the two words varying wildly. I still think the best option is to keep a unified <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUniversities_and_colleges_acb3.html" title="Category:Universities and colleges">Category:Universities and colleges</a>, merge everything under that, delete <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUniversities_5575.html" title="Category:Universities">Category:Universities</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Category%7EColleges_7250.html" title="Category:Colleges">Category:Colleges</a>, and simply police every now and then to move articles if those categories are recreated. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 19:16, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Before you get too far, I had a thought—because "university" and "college" seems to be an important distinction in the UK, I think there may be reason to have a separate category for each in this instance, with the <i>only</i> parent being "Universities and colleges in the United Kingdom". I think if we do it that way, without having separate <i>root</i> categories for colleges and universities, we can respect differences where they exist (as the differences will, er, differ, country by country), but we won't be stuck with the split all the way down where it may not mean anything. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 02:52, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>I didn't touch the contents of the individual-country articles...your proposal makes a lot of sense, since those distinctions and vocabulary can be made on a per-country basis in a more useful fashion.
