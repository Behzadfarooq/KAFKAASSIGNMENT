<dd>I have heard some people claim that Paul Bunyan was based on "Ti-Jean" a trickster character from french canadian folklore (Different Ti-Jean stories are told by Acadians, Quebecois, and Franco-Ontarians). The Claim is that 'Bunyan' comes from 'Bon-Jean' or 'Jean Bonhomme', alternate names for Ti-Jean. Since Ti-Jean was usually not a giant though, I don't know what basis for this claim is. IMHO, a much more likely source is the Mikmaq legends of the giant Glooscap.<a href="../../../a/d/j/User%7EAdjusting_e72f.html" title="User:Adjusting">Adjusting</a> 07:59, 2005 Apr 4 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The current article reports the entire French speaking population of the maritimes, which isn't exactly the same thing. I suggest an Acadian is somebody who may or may not speak French, but identifies their ancestors as being Acadian (descended from original French settlers in maritimes), which is what the census provides. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 21:32, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I put in the above change. Somebody else (properly) put back the old number as a footnote. I do agree with doing this, but I edited it to use the latest census information. So people can now read both the "French maritime" and "ethnic origin" numbers, both at a provincial level of detail. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 07:07, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks. Better. I was just restoring the citation that was there before, but yours is almost certainly more authoritative. (For some countries I'd trust Ethnologue's count of a linguistic minority more than the government's, but I don't think Canada is under-counting French speakers.) -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:42, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Using those who "identif[y] their ancestors" as criteria for counting members of an ethnic group or nationality is dubious at best. In parts of the world where racism, discrimination or violence against, or criminalization of minorities has existed for centuries, members of minority or ethnic groups may be reluctant to identify themselves as belonging to anything but the majority group. In other cases, older generations have hidden their ancestry from their offspring so that younger generations have a fairer chance in violent, racist, unjust societies. I am not saying that these things have happened in the case of the Acadians. However, if a standard for identifying ethnic groups around the world and across wikipedia is to be found, perhaps identification of such on an official government document is not the best standard. Furthermore, if one goes by the 2001 Canadian Census to count members of a group, there were only 11, 682, 680 Canadians <a href="http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo26a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo26a.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Of which, almost 45% (4, 934, 545) believed they were only half Canadian and half other. Shall we put on the Canada wiki that there were only 11,682,680 Canadians as 2001? <a href="../../../d/d/d/User%7EDDD_DDD_0d37.html" title="User:DDD DDD">DDD DDD</a> 03:50, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More on those numbers from Stats Can. Let's look at them, shall we. While Acadians are listed as +26,000, the number of French in N.B. is listed as +193,000 out of a 700,000 population. <a href="http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo26e.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo26e.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Are they recent French immigrants? Of course not. They are Acadians. One of the many problems with the Canadian census form is that labels/ethnic origins are not clear nor black and white, but grey and fuzzy, which render many of the ethnicity statistics meaningless. And when names for nationalities and languages overlap, confusion reigns. <i>Chinese</i> is one category that doesn't differentiate between speakers of <i>Putonghua</i>, <i>Cantonese</i> or any other of China's many different ethnic groups and languages. Nor does it allow for Taiwanese to be counted outside of the <i>China brand</i>. <i>East Indian</i> covers anything between Bangladesh in the east, Pakistan in the west, Sri Lanka in the south and Nepal in the north. Another "ethnic" category on the Canadian census is <i>Canadian</i>. And another of my favourites, the 250,005 strong "ethnic" <i>Americans (USA)</i>. I wish I were making this up? What do we make of the category <i>British (not included elsewhere</i> or <i>African (Black), not included elsewhere</i> <a href="http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo26a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo26a.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<p>from what i can tell, it appears that the acadians of canada and the cajuns of louisiana are somewhat distinct, though also somewhat related, ethnic groups. i'm going to have to do some research on this...</p>

<li>Acadians (modern ones, as in the people in eastern Canada/New England) and Cajuns are both the descendents of the French settlers (the original Acadians) who were expelled by the English. Their being distinct comes from having been split up for so long, and the social evolution that comes with that. Acadians and Cajuns are largely members of the same families, if you trace the heritage back to the 1700s. My family in Nova Scotia is Comeau. There are people in Louisiana named Comeau, but also some named Comeaux. We would trace our ancestry back to the same original Acadian family. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScoops_f29c.html" title="User:Scoops"><em><font color="#0844D0">Le Scoopertemp</font></em></a> <font color="#000000" size="1">[</font><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScoops_690b.html" title="User talk:Scoops"><font size="1" color="#0844D0">tk</font></a><font color="#000000" size="1">]</font> 15:48, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It would be helpful to have a more descriptive heading on the table. I assume that the population figures are the numbers of people who settled in the various regions after the Expulsion. However, a title like "Destinations of Deportees 1755-1764" or something more concise or descriptive would make it more clear. --<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMego2005_f66a.html" title="User:Mego2005">Mego2005</a> 18:12, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I also thought the table was a bit strange. First, it seems malplaced. If the table is to be kept, it should probably come after the next paragraph. And yes, a title is VERY necessary. Neither is there enough description of it. Perhaps it would read better if it was simply information in a paragraph.<a href="../../../d/d/d/User%7EDDD_DDD_0d37.html" title="User:DDD DDD">DDD DDD</a> 12:00, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe I was a bit hasty (well, I waited 5 days). And if I was, please tell. But that table listing the destination of the deportees was driving me mad. What's more, it didn't reflect the more accurate table found on the Great Upheaval wiki. So, I re-wrote the table as a paragraph. If someone can come up with a better table (with a proper title!), please do. But don't just put the table in the middle of the page please. It needs some description.<a href="../../../d/d/d/User%7EDDD_DDD_0d37.html" title="User:DDD DDD">DDD DDD</a> 07:25, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The present populaton figures are completely absurd. The population for N.B. should represent the number of French speakers in the 2001 Canada census which is almost 10 times the amount that is self-identified. The note at the bottom of the page should reference the self-identified number. No one in their right mind believes there are only 26,000 Acadians in N.B.<a href="../../../d/d/d/User%7EDDD_DDD_0d37.html" title="User:DDD DDD">DDD DDD</a> 12:19, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would guess (tell me if I'm wrong) that most French-speakers in N.B. today are transplanted Quebequers, not descendants of the Acadians. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:18, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That one-word amswer "wrong" is a bit harsh. A late-night, 3-beer, 2-glasses of red response. Apologies Jmabel. No, most of the couple hundred thousand Francophones in N.B. are indeed Acadiens and not Quebecois. The 2001 Canada Census figures are misleading. Imagine, statistics that lie? Hmm... The same Canadian census that identified less than 100,000 Acadiens throughout Canada also identified less than 12,000,000 Canadians. <a href="../../../d/d/d/User%7EDDD_DDD_0d37.html" title="User:DDD DDD">DDD DDD</a> 04:54, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Right, and I want to add: Acadia is a multi-ethnic society, which while pre-dominantly composed of those of Acadian ethnicity, it's not uniquely Acadian. Most Acadians are actually a mix of French, Mi'kmaq and some ethnicity from the British Isle, usually Irish or Scottish, so to restrict the number of Acadians on the basis of what they identified as their ethnicity is wrong. Plus, many who call themselves Acadians proudly, would put down "Canadian" or "French Canadian" on their census, not realizing that the first obscured their Acadian identity and the second referred to the early settlers of New-France, not of their identity as a French-speaking citizen of Canada. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheJF_bd76.html" title="User:TheJF">TheJF</a> 11:52, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've begun working on the early history of the Acadian settlers. If anyone can help. I've done up to first year on St. Croix and then moving across the bay to Port Royale. including the pre-settlement explorations.

<dd>Still working on the history. It's slow. I wonder... is this even necessary? Hmmm... Well, I'll put in the details as I can.

<dd>I was on the train tonight and I started thinking, maybe the Acadia page - which I had yet to look at - has much of the history. Sure enough. Well, I'll get around to fixing this up, still. And or please help.</dd>

<dd>I had this really bright idea. Make a new page for the "History of the Acadians". And then, (are you breathless yet?) make a "History of Acadia", which I would re-direct to the History of the Acadians. So I made the "History of the Acadians" wiki, well, just, and just a one-line blurb. Then, as I began the "history of acadia" wiki, I noticed it was already redirected back to the "Acadia" (just) page. Doh. Hmm. So, what to do? What to do?...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>OK. I thinned out completely the history section in the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acadians.html" title="Acadians">Acadians</a> article. I moved all the history that was there almost completely verbatim to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Acadians_5885.html" title="History of the Acadians">History of the Acadians</a>. On that newer history page there is MUCH to do. A lot of the early settlement history has been written, but I suppose it's not finished. Then there are large gaps up til the deportation. And then again until 2003. So, it needs work. Also, there are several links to many of the early settlers and so on that go nowhere, so those links need to be upgraded.</li>
</ul>
<p>While doing all this, the whole time I've been wondering if it is worthwhile or not. Hmmm. <a href="../../../d/d/d/User%7EDDD_DDD_0d37.html" title="User:DDD DDD">DDD DDD</a> 07:05, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The map showing distribution of Acadians shows PRESENT DAY acadian (french speaking) areas. It shoudl be lableed as such and SUPPLEMENTED by a map showing the pre-expulsion (1752) areas alaong the Fundy Basin. {iain T. 17 Nov.06]</p>

<p>I've never heard this before. Can someone verify this or provide other details?</p>
<p>&gt;Furthermore, Acadians to a great extent hail from different parts of France than do Quebeckers. <a href="../../../d/d/d/User%7EDDD_DDD_0d37.html" title="User:DDD DDD">DDD DDD</a> 07:57, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is probably controversial, but I have trouble "back-dating" phrases which clearly are "modern" creations. In this case, post-1991 when the term "ethnic cleansing" came into use after a number of horrendous war-crimes during bungled UN Peacekeeping Missions (and in which Canada's political and military was heavily involved) including Rwanda and Bosnia. To me it is demeaning to those events and its survivours to use this term and smacks of "historical revisionism".</p>
<p>That said I have no trouble "parenthetically" applying the term to the Jewish Holocaust of WW2.</p>
<p>What is relevant to me is the growing awareness that throughout history, many such "forced migrations" took place.</p>
<p>Thank-you for your efforts.</p>
