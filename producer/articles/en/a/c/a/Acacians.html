<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Acacians.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>In order to understand the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theological</a> significance of Acacianism as a critical episode in both the logical and historical progress of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianism.html" title="Arianism">Arianism</a>, it is needful to recall that the great definition of the <i>Homoousion</i>, promulgated at <a href="../../../i/z/n/%C4%B0znik_bb99.html" title="Ä°znik">Nicaea</a> in <a href="../../../3/2/5/325.html" title="325">325</a>, rather than putting an end to further discussion, became the occasion for keener debate and for still more confusion of statement in the formulation of theories on the relationship of Our Lord to His Father. Events had already begun to ripen towards a fresh crisis shortly after the advent of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantius_II_b1bd.html" title="Constantius II">Constantius</a> to sole power, on the death of his brother <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constans.html" title="Constans">Constans</a> in the year <a href="../../../3/5/0/350.html" title="350">350</a>. The new <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus.html" title="Augustus">Augustus</a> was a man with a turn for theological debate (<a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammianus.html" title="Ammianus">Ammianus</a>, XXI, xvi) that soon made him a strong promoter of the Eusebian faction. Roughly speaking, there were at this period only three parties in the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">Church</a>: the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene.html" title="Nicene">Nicene</a> party, who sympathized for the most part with <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athanasius.html" title="Athanasius">Athanasius</a> and his supporters; the Eusebian or Court party and their Semi-Arian followers; and, last of all, the <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomoean.html" title="Anomoean">Anomoean</a> party which owed its origin to <a href="../../../a/e/t/Aetius_%28theologian%29.html" title="Aetius (theologian)">Aetius</a>. In the summer of <a href="../../../3/5/7/357.html" title="357">357</a>, Ursacius and Valens, the advocates of this latter group of dissidents in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_world.html" title="Western world">West</a>, through the influence which they were enabled to bring to bear upon the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor.html" title="Emperor">Emperor</a> by means of his second wife, Aurelia Eusebia (Panegyr. Jul. Orat., iii; <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammianus.html" title="Ammianus">Ammianus</a>, XX, vi, 4), succeeded in bringing about a conference of bishops at <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirmium.html" title="Sirmium">Sirmium</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Sirmian_Manifesto" id="Sirmian_Manifesto"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Acacians.html" title="Edit section: Sirmian Manifesto">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sirmian Manifesto</span></h2>
<p>In the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> creed put forth at this meeting there was inserted a statement of views drawn up by Potamius of Lisbon and <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hosius_of_Cordoba_0adf.html" title="Hosius of Cordoba">Hosius of Cordoba</a>, which, under the name of the Sirmian Manifesto, as it afterwards came to be known, threw the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">Church</a> into disorder. In this statement the assembled prelates, while declaring their confession in "One God, the Father Almighty, and in His only-begotten Son, Our Lord <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>, generated from Him before the ages," recommended the disuse of the terms <a href="../../../o/u/s/Ousia.html" title="Ousia">ousia</a> (essence or substance), <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homoousion.html" title="Homoousion">homoousion</a> (identical in essence, or substance), and homoiousion (similar in essence, or substance), "by which the minds of many are perturbed"; and they held that there "ought to be no mention of any of them at all, nor any exposition of them in the Church, and for this reason and for this consideration that there is nothing written about them in divine <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scripture.html" title="Scripture">Scripture</a> and that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding" (Athan., De Syn., xxviii; Soz., ii, xxx; Hil., De Syn., xi). The effect of these propositions upon conservative opinion was like that of the proverbial spark in a barrel of <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunpowder.html" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a>. In spite of the scriptural disclaimer against the employment of inscrutable terms, nearly all parties perceived that the Manifesto was a subtly Anomoean document.</p>
<p>The situation was assuredly rich in possibilities. Men began to group themselves along new lines. In the East, the Anomoeans turned almost as a matter of course to <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acacius_of_Caesarea_2cf9.html" title="Acacius of Caesarea">Acacius of Caesarea</a>, whose influence was growing stronger at court and who was felt to be a shrewd temporizer. In the West, bishops like Ursacius and <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valens.html" title="Valens">Valens</a> began to carry on a like policy; and everywhere it was felt that the time called once more for concerted action on the part of the Church. This was precisely what the party in favour with the Emperor <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantius_II_b1bd.html" title="Constantius II">Constantius</a> were eager to bring about; but not in the way in which the Nicaeans and Moderates expected. A single council might not be easily controlled; but two separate synods, one sitting in the East and the other in the West, could be kept better in hand.</p>
<p>After a number of preliminary conferences accompanying an inevitable campaign of pamphleteering in which <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilary_of_Poitiers_789f.html" title="Hilary of Poitiers">Hilary of Poitiers</a> took part, the bishops of the Western portion of the Empire met at <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariminum.html" title="Ariminum">Ariminum</a> towards the end of May, and those of the East at <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silifke.html" title="Silifke">Seleucia Isauria</a> in the month of September, <a href="../../../3/5/9/359.html" title="359">359</a>. The theological complexion of both Synods was identical, at least in this, that the party of compromise, represented at Seleucia by Acacius and at Ariminum by Ursacius and Valens, was politically, though not numerically, in the ascendant and could exercise a subtle influence which depended almost as much on the argumentative ability of their leaders as on their curial prestige. In both councils, as the result of dishonest intrigue and an unscrupulous use of intimidation, the Homoean formula associated with the name of Acacius ultimately prevailed. The Homo usion, for which so much had been endured by saintly champions of orthodoxy for over half a century, was given up and the Son was declared to be merely similar to -- no longer identical in essence with -- the Father. <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome.html" title="Jerome">St. Jerome's</a> characterization of the issue still affords the best commentary, not only on what had come to pass, but on the means employed to obtain it. The whole world groaned in wonderment to find itself Arian -- <i>ingemuit totus orbis et Arianum se esse miratus est.</i></p>
<p><a name="Influences_and_decline" id="Influences_and_decline"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Acacians.html" title="Edit section: Influences and decline">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influences and decline</span></h2>
<p>It was Acacius and his followers who had skilfully managed the whole proceeding from the outset. By coming forward as advocates of temporizing methods they had inspired the Eusebian or Semi-Arian party with the idea of throwing over Atius and his Anomoeans. They thus found themselves thrust into a position of importance to which neither their numbers nor their theological acumen entitled them. As they had proved themselves in practice all through the course of the unlooked-for movement that brought them to the front, so were they now, in theory, the exponents of the Via Media of their day. They separated themselves from the orthodox by the rejection of the word homoousios; from the Semi-Arians by their surrender of the homoiousios; and from the Aetians by their insistence upon the term homoios. They retained their influence as a distinct party just so long as their spokesman and leader Acacius enjoyed the favour of Constantius. Under Julian the Apostate, Atius, who had been exiled as the result of the proceedings at Seleucia, was allowed to regain his influence. The Acacians seized the occasion to make common cause with his ideas, but the alliance was only political; they threw him over once more at the Synod of Antioch held under Jovian in <a href="../../../3/6/3/363.html" title="363">363</a>. In <a href="../../../3/6/5/365.html" title="365">365</a> the Semi-Arian Synod of <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lampsacus.html" title="Lampsacus">Lampsacus</a> condemned Acacius. He was deposed from his seat, and with that event the history of the party to which he had given his name practically ended.</p>
