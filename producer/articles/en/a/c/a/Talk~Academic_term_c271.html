<p>"Thailand There are two semesters in Thai academic year with an optional summer semester. From kindergarten to high school the first semester opens from mid May and continues until the end of September. The second semester lasts from November until end of February (or early March). The university academic year is slightly different, lasting from June to October and mid November to mid March"</p>
<p>Doing my calculations there is no way such definitions of academical terms allow for any kind of optional seasonal semester, let alone an optional summer semester as those dates override both Thailand's winter and Thailand's Summer... And Spring and Autumn. Therefore this information must be inacurate somehow and a specific definition for the optional summer term must be given. (There is just a two-month space between 2nd and 1st semester, and a one-month space between 1st and 2nd semester)--GTB 15:56, 7th September 2005</p>

<p>It has been suggested to merge Year-Round School with Academic year. This would be extremely inappropriate as year-round school is the rearranging of existing components of the academic year, not the definition of them. WesWalker 03:32, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not really clear on what is being discussed in this article. Are we talking about colleges and universities only (i.e. post-secondary institutions), or do elementary and secondary schools count? In my personal experience, most public elementray schools in the U.S. have two semesters, each divided into two <i>quarters</i> (which are quite different from the post-secondary <i>quarters</i> which are really a third of the regular school year). Is this some peculiarity of my state, or am I misunderstanding the article, or is it just incomplete? -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 21:13, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am looking for information on a specific topic--if this is the right article for it to be in, I hope someone could edit it to include the information I'm looking for. If not, I hope they could direct me to the appropriate article. I would like to know if there is a general standard by which colleges and universities decide how far into a semester they will allow students to drop a class. My local college has a 15 week semester. During the first week, classes can be dropped without either academic or financial penalty. Thereafter, classes can be dropped for an additional nine weeks, but with both an academic penalty (i.e., one's records show that the student withdrew from the class) and a financial penalty (i.e. one must still pay for the credit hours even though those credit hours will not be received). After ten weeks, the student is bound to remain in the class, even if he is failing. Is this typical for most colleges or not? And on a similar note, I have heard that in Japan, if one does not show up for the final exam, he is considered to have dropped the class--thus, no one ever fails a university course in Japan. Is this true? --GnatsFriend</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the US, each college and university has almost complete freedom to do whatever it likes, resulting in a huge variety of practices. At some colleges, you can even <i>choose</i> which courses will appear on your transcript, as long as the ones that remain give you enough credits. I don't know the situation in Japan, but in much of Europe, the notion is that the only purpose of coursework is to prepare you for the exam: the exam is the entire grade. Practices vary by country. I would guess there are countries where you can take the exam as many times as you want, and not even have to register in advance. But I'm afraid that won't convince anyone at your college to change its practices (unless of course there are legal or regulatory issues). --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 14:34, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I assume the words semester and trimester were mistaken for divisions of a year, but -mester refers to a length of time equal to a month, and tri- and se- are multipliers, not divisors (e.g. tricycle--three wheels).</p>

<p>This is a tricky page to edit, due to sometimes arcane terminology, and widely differing practice, with most individuals being aware only of one system. I've tidied up the introduction which had some statements which while true in certain places, are not true generally; I've indicated the etymology of semester and trimester, which so often confuse; and I've added a history section, originally to clarify etymology, but in the end just for interest's sake! – <a href="../../../c/d/v/User%7ECDV_8549.html" title="User:CDV">CDV</a> 12:42, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page should not be merged with <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year-round_school.html" title="Year-round school">Year-round_school</a>. Year-round education is more than just an <i>academic-term</i> - it is an entire schema set up to increase student-throughput and appropriate funding in areas of rapid growth. I will make some major contributions to this article, including grabbing a snapshot of the <i>Warning - School Pedestrians - Year Round Operations</i> from a local elementary school up the road. I will also put in some explanations of the 'big-picture' of year-round education, from a demographics and funding standpoint.

<p>From the original Latin, I believe, the word "semester" actually means six months. Any info on that?</p>
<pre>
    -Since six months is half a year, then half of a school year is a semester.
