<p>why is the list of members of the Academy numbered and indented in this peculiar manner? They should be listed either chronologically or alphabetically. Unless someone can explain why they are presented like this, I will reorganise the list. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:17, 10 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have attempted to explain the numbering at the beginning at the list. The "seat" thing is relatively important, and it makes some sense to list academicians by seat number. <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlivier_5e7f.html" title="User:Olivier">olivier</a> 08:16, Jan 11, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for that, I suppose that makes some sense, but why then are there lists for some seats and not others? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 08:26, 11 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I strongly object to having my edit described as "vandalism" and all my improvements to the text reverted for no good reason. I will return to this article when I have found a complete list of Academie members. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 01:11, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have re-entered my edits and corrections to the opening sections. Two comments. The musician Gourville must be extremely obscure - he is not in my dictionary of music or encyclopaedias or findable with Google. So he gets no link. Using a ===heading=== for each seat creates a very long and ugly and not very useful table of contents. Why not just list the seat numbers in <b>bold</b> intead? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:50, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree about Gourville; I tried to find something about him myself. I did find a Gourville who was involved in finance in that period, and who was known to host meetings, but no evidence to say that this was the same person. Is the person who enterred this "fact" still around to check it? The only musical Gourville was a modern rock band. These unchecked, and perhaps uncheckable, "facts" are likely to have a deeper impact on the credibility of the 'pedia than whole articles whose nonsense is obvious to the reader.</dd>

<dd>You can always hide the table of contents. There have been 705 members so this will be a long list that would otherwise be difficult to navigate. Perhaps we should suggest something to the tech department about these lists so that they can appear differently. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology"><font>☮</font> Eclecticology</a> 18:06, 2004 Jan 12 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you are going to rename the article Academie francaise, then you will need to change all the text references as well. In fact, since this is an English-language encyclopaedia, the article should be called <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Academy_0a38.html" title="French Academy">French Academy</a>, with a redirect from the French, and all the text references should be to the Academy rather than to the Academie. Then this problem wouldn't arise. I will make these changes when I get time, plus the one suggested above. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 07:55, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did change the internal text references, but I can now look to changing the links to it. The encyclopedia may be in English but we are dealing with a French institution, and the French title is often used in an English context. The change in capitalization is consistent with the <i>Oxford Style Manual</i>, and also follows French usage. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology"><font>☮</font> Eclecticology</a> 18:06, 2004 Jan 12 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree about the capitalisation, but I think you'll find that Wikipedia policy is to put names of foreign institutions in English - if we have Academie francaise, why not put <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences_4415.html" title="Chinese Academy of Sciences">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> in Chinese? I might solicit some opinions at Village Pump on this. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 23:47, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences_4415.html" title="Chinese Academy of Sciences">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> is hardly a good example since it is normally written in a different script. Even its romanization would not be recognized. There is no doubt but that the Académie française is recognized for what it is. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology"><font>☮</font> Eclecticology</a> 02:19, 2004 Jan 13 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)</a> says to "name your pages in English and place the native transliteration on the first line of the article unless the native form is more commonly used in English than the anglicized form" but I'm not sure how you can decide whether Académie française or French academy is the more common. A google search doesn't help as searching for "French academy" shows up a lot of irrelevant hits. There are a lot of hits for Académie française, even when you limit the language to English, but beyond that I can only offer my personal opinion that Académie française is commonly used in English. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 00:09, Jan 13, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suspect that the English form may include a lot of generic academies in foreign countries with objectives like teaching basic French. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology"><font>☮</font> Eclecticology</a> 02:19, 2004 Jan 13 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If it is the general view that the French form is acceptable, I won't pursue the issue, although I do think this is privileging French in comparison to other non-English languages. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:41, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks to the anonymous individual who pointed out that "ordonance" was a misspelling. Nevertheless the correction should be to "ordinance" rather than to "ordonnance" as it is the former that refers to a law or decree.

<dd>I will ask someone who lives in Canada to verify this because it is quite hard to believe that this is true for the vast majority of English-speaking Canadians. In any case, even those few who may perhaps use or also use the French term to flaunt their level of education will have no trouble understanding the normal English name French Academy, which therefore should be the title for UK and US citizens and <b>can</b> be the title even for those Canadians who use the French term. --<a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspoo_d646.html" title="User:Espoo">Espoo</a> 01:13, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My suspicion has been confirmed that you're presenting your personal preference or that of your small social group, not an objective picture of actual Canadian use. The English name is more than twice as common as the French one on Canadian English websites. Although quick searches with "French Academy" and "Académie française" find about the same number of English pages each (which still does not defend use of the French name in the WP title), a quick look at the results shows that many are in fact written in French and incorrectly indicated as English pages by incompetent and/or sloppy webmasters. As a result, the real number of English pages with the French name is much less than the number of English pages with the English name. By adding the article "the", we can compare pages truly written in English, and here the results show almost the exact same strong preference for the English name as on all English language websites and all edu sites: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22the+Acad%C3%A9mie+fran%C3%A7aise%22+site%3Aca&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22the+Acad%C3%A9mie+fran%C3%A7aise%22+site%3Aca&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">197 English pages for "the Académie française" site:ca</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22the+French+Academy%22+site%3Aca&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22the+French+Academy%22+site%3Aca&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">458 English pages for "the French Academy" site:ca</a>.</dd>

<dd>Most of these seem to be talking about the only institution correctly referred to as only "French Academy" in English; the others are all called by their longer names in carefully edited texts such as in encyclopedias.</dd>
<dd>These results show that the English name is at least as common as the French one on Canadian websites in English because many of the results with the French name are actually in French. In addition, many if not all of those websites using the French name in English are not written for the general public and are not carefully edited.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Where did you get that number from? Even if there were only 7 pages in French incorrectky identified as in English by the webmaster, that still means less pages than with the English name. In fact, according to WP naming policies, we should use the English name even if it's less common than the French one as long as it is well-established and widely used. Google searches cannot change the fact that the French name is used in most encyclopedias and carefully edited texts meant for the general public.</dd>

Your wild claim about use of the French name in the middle of an English sentence in Canada is highly prejudicial and not based on actual Canadian use except among English speakers with some knowledge of French.

<dd>Your logic and search technique are flawed. You should search for "academie francaise" with quotes because you don't want every page that only has either one of those terms.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> The vast majority of <a href="../../../2E/e/d/.edu.html" title=".edu">.edu</a> domains belong to U.S. institutions.

<dd>Clearly I missed that - although I'm not sure how. I suppose my overall point is that even if "French Academy" wins out in this case, it shouldn't set an automatic precedent for all foreign-language names. As the top of <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)</a> says: <i>These guidelines are <b>under development</b>.

<dd>I agree that decisions on whether to use the English name of an institution or thing or concept in a non-English-speaking country or foreign language should not be in any way automatic. I also agree that the WP naming guidelines can still be improved, but i think very few people would question the wisdom behind the combination of these two main principles of the WP guidelines: 1) <i><b>If there is no commonly used English name</b>, use ...the name in the original language.</i> and 2) <i>use the most commonly used English version of the name for the article, <b>as you would find it in other encyclopedias and reference works</b>.</i> (my emphasis, and my deletions of irrelevant parts)</dd>
<dd>I agree that it would be strange, ideological, impractical, and clearly amateur to use English equivalents that are rarely used or to even coin them. However, i find it very disturbing and depressing that huge amounts of WP editing time are wasted on unnecessary and clearly amateur discussions of this and related naming and spelling issues. We should simply do as other encyclopedias and reference works do and not waste time speculating and Googling unless necessary, e.g. when dealing with a new term not yet in existing reference works. For example, it should be enough to end this discussion (and the similar one at <a href="../../../y/l/e/Talk%7EYleisradio_7b8e.html" title="Talk:Yleisradio">Talk:Yleisradio</a>) by quoting Britannica or other well-edited reputable sources. There is a reason why Britannica uses the English name "French Academy" but the French name "Institut de France", and the reason is precisely the part of the WP guideline i labeled as 1) above.</dd>
<dd>More importantly, we shouldn't go Googling concerning naming issues unless we have serious reason to believe Britannica or some other reference work goofed. Such a serious reason should not be based on what we feel is usual in our small social group; the only kind of thing that qualifies is an opinion expressed by an expert, and even then we have to first find out what other experts say about this.</dd>
<dd>We should not try to reinvent the wheel. Britannica and other reference works are copyedited by professionals and most of us are amateurs. We should concentrate our efforts on having better and more up-to-date content, which is where we can be better than traditional reference works, even in their online, updated forms. Almost all spelling and naming discussions on WP are unnecessary and a huge waste of time. Worse still, the often amateur results give WP a bad name because many people still judge people and texts on the basis of errors and amateurisms in spelling, naming, punctuation, and similar things. --<a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspoo_d646.html" title="User:Espoo">Espoo</a> 23:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I feel quite sure that within the academic world the standard form is Académie Française. For instance, the Harvard University Press' page for <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/DUBHIS.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/DUBHIS.html" rel="nofollow">vol. 2 of <i>A History of Private Life</i></a> notes that "Georges Duby, a member of the Académie Française, is Professor of Medieval History at the Collège de France."</dd>

<dd>In my opinion, then, the usage of several prominent publishing houses and news organizations supports the title "Académie française" (or Academie Francaise). In fact, I would guess that Harvard U. Press and <i>The Economist</i> would regard "French Academy" as undesirable, and would ask authors to change it to "Academie Francaise" or "Académie française". On some of the other issues raised by <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspoo_d646.html" title="User:Espoo">Espoo</a>, I fully agree that too much time is wasted on naming disputes, but at least some of that is caused because WP contributors make the issues more emotional than they need to be. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 21:23, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you, Akhilleus, for this first constructive and mature contribution including reputable sources contradicting my claims. The reason i got so emotional is because it seemed that nobody gave a damn about basic WP policies. More specifically, nobody seemed to give a damn about my research showing usage in reputable sources. If important editorial decisions in WP are based on personal opinions or sloppy Google searches, that should be something that upsets anyone interested in not letting WP go down the drain. And allowing foreign names in titles where not necessary would indeed set a very strong and dangerous precedent that would soon start multiplying like crazy.</dd>

<dd>I will look at your search results in more detail later, but it is obviously not possible to claim that "within the academic world the standard form is Académie Française" unless one ignores all my research above including the 46 to 0 and 29 to 0 results shown above for Googles on US edu sites and on a Canadian university site. It seems that, once again, this may be a mainly UK/US difference, although Harvard, NYT, and WP seem to be exceptions. I will contact Harvard University Press to see if this is indeed their policy and if this is indeed an exception in the US or if other US universities also follow this OED and perhaps UK usage.</dd>

WP policy says very specifically <i><b>use the most commonly used English version of the name</b> for the article, <b>as you would find it in other encyclopedias and reference works</b></i>. It does not say "never use the English version of the name unless it is more common than the foreign name" and it does not say "ignore usage in other encyclopedias and reference works if this contradicts the usage at some university or newspaper publishers."</dd>

Your search results only show that some sites prefer the French name; they do <b>not</b> show that the reputable sources i cited are incorrect and they do <b>not</b> show that the sources you provided would necessarily consider the English name incorrect. More importantly, they do not demonstrate that "French Academy" would be incomprehensible to English speakers used to the French name or incorrect or ambiguous to English speakers in general. There are many instances of other institutional names used in an abbreviated form that resemble or are identical to another organisation, but these instances do not occur in titles or at first mention.</dd>

<dd>I'm quite sure that the vast majority of all native English speakers in all countries would have trouble saying and understanding the French name, and that's the strongest case against use of it as the article name. On the basis of all information collected by all of us, i'm quite sure that almost all well-edited publications addressed to the general public use the English name in the title and only use the French name as extra info in parentheses. Despite the OED's claim to be a purely descriptive dictionary, it is heavily biased towards literary and educated use and against usage in the spoken, living language and in scientific and other carefully edited texts for the general public.</dd>

<dd>And despite the OED's claim to be a purely descriptive dictionary, your example is not the first i've seen that clearly contradict this noble tradition and claim because the OED would certainly not venture to claim that use of the English name on the reputable US and Canadian sites i found is incorrect or non-existent. (I will start to Google UK university sites now.) I will contact the OED; last time, i received an answer within a few days, so this discussion can hopefully be extended until i get an answer. The OED seems to be the only reputable publication addressed to the general public (well, based on what i wrote about its biases, it is mostly addressed to a fairly small sector of the population) that prefers the French name; all other reputable sources addressed to the general public seem to use the English name alone or first. Newspaper articles or other texts addressed to insiders and highly educated people seem to <b>also</b> but not exclusively or even predominantly use the French name, but i'm quite sure that at least the New York Ties and Washington Post would use the English name in a major article and in a heading and especially in an article title or major headline addressed to most readers, even if they try to sound really cool and in the know by flaunting their French in relevant articles addressed to intellectuals.</dd>

WP policy says very specifically <i><b>use the most commonly used English version of the name</b> for the article, <b>as you would find it in other encyclopedias and reference works</b></i>. It does not say "never use the English version of the name unless it is more common than the foreign name. In addition, Encarta says: <b>French Academy, usual designation (in English) of the Académie Française, the oldest of the five learned societies that make up the Institut de France.</b></dd>

<dd>Espoo, I'm sorry to say this, but I think your response is an example of making things more emotional than they need to be. Accusing editors of preferring the French title as a way of showing off cultural literacy isn't conducive to a productive discussion. The allegation that editors want to prove the superiority of a regional variety of English is also unhelpful. (I also don't understand the claim, since <i>The Economist</i> and <i>The New York Times</i> and the University of Texas represent different varieties of English.) Saying the Catholic Encyclopedia is an example of "how only the English name is used when editors stop to think a bit" seems to imply that I'm not thinking, which I do not appreciate.</dd>

I specifically noted that the <i>OED</i> does <b>not</b> have an entry for "Academie Francaise"; whatever one's opinion about the editorial practice and social register of the <i>OED</i> may be, it isn't particularly relevant here. That entry is from the <i>Oxford Dictionary of English</i>. Moreover, many reference works from Oxford, searchable through <a href="http://oxfordreference.com" class="external text" title="http://oxfordreference.com" rel="nofollow">oxfordreference.com</a>, use "Académie française". These works are professionally edited and addressed to the general public. They include <i>The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary</i>, <i>The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</i>, <i>World Encyclopedia</i>, <i>The Oxford Companion to English Literature</i>, and many more. Those results indicate that the policy of the Oxford University Press is to use "Académie française" in its reference works.</dd>

<dd>Your comment begins by alleging that I haven't shown that "Academie Francaise" is more common in English. But the burden of proof falls on the nominator: you need to show that "French Academy" is the most common form. You've attempted to do so through google searches and through citations of reference works such as Encarta, the Columbia Encyclopedia, etc. The Google searches are problematic because searches for "French Academy" turn up many results that aren't the Academie Francaise, including a private school in Decatur, Illinois. On the other hand, you've illustrated that some reference works use "French Academy"; but reference works from Oxford use "Academie Francaise", and so does the Economist, the New York Times, and several university presses in the U.S. In other words, there are more reference sources and publishers that support "Academie Francaise".</dd>

<dd>I am not at all convinced that "French Academy" is the most common way to refer to the Academie Francaise in English. In fact, I think the evidence I've given suggests that many "carefully edited publications" use "Academie Francaise", and that they do so more often than they use "French Academy." This includes the New York Times, the Economist, and the publications of the Oxford University Press, the Harvard University Press, and the University of Chicago Press.

I would guess that 90% of the US population is incapable of reading the current article title out loud, let alone pronounce it correctly. Although that percentage is perhaps lower in the UK due to the proximity of France and a more widespread habit of showing off knowledge of French in public than in the US, i'm pretty sure even British schoolbooks would not use the French name in a title, alone, or even at first mention. --<a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspoo_d646.html" title="User:Espoo">Espoo</a> 05:04, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is an error to think that a translation of a proper noun is itself a proper noun. In English, "French Academy" could be a shortened form of all sorts of organisations, from <i>l'Académie des Inscriptions et des Belles-Lettres</i>, <i>l'Académie des Sciences</i>, <i>l'Académie des Beaux-Arts</i> and <i>l'Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques</i> to the Governor French Academy and the Mary W. French Academy. Only one of these is covered by the explicit "l'Académie française". Furthermore, how unsympathetic it would be to the academy in question to insist on giving it an English title, when it puts so much effort into fighting against pervasive global anglicisation! Yes, we have to write in English, but we could be a little more magnanimous about its dominance. I am also disappointed by your efforts to belittle sources which contradict your opinion. To assume that a single editor must be wrong is simply false, and the thought that "the stress of the daily newspaper routine" makes a source unusable is risible. Wikipedia has thousand of newspaper citations, and there's nothing wrong with them, even if they are produced on a daily basis. The stress of the daily newspaper routine is no reason to think less of the material it produces. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStemonitis_ca3d.html" title="User:Stemonitis">Stemonitis</a> 17:09, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, now we're finally getting to the crux of the matter. Because the French Academy is engaged in an unscientific, quixotic, and senseless campaign (that has been fruitless for centuries) to make people speak <i>French</i> differently than they are, we are now being asked/obliged to also start speaking <i>English</i> the way they want, at least in some rare cases. (There is nothing unscientific or quixotic about creating viable alternatives for imported foreign words, but by trying to enforce use of its often bad coinages by old-fashioned, unscientific, and counterproductive prescriptive comments instead of leaving the choice and even the coinage to the population, the French Academy is actually helping to make its cause look ridiculous and alienating the French against this worthy cause. In Finland, for example, there was on the contrary a national contest to find an alternative to "CD-ROM", and the result was much better than what a bunch of old fuddy-duddies could come up with and was instantly adopted by the population.)</dd>

<dd>The French Academy should not be a sacred cow that can make us violate basic principles of WP such as writing for the general public and <b>using the English version of foreign names except when they are very rare and not used in other reference works too</b>. And in this case, the English name is even more common in reputable sources meant for the general public (i.e. not necessarily university publications). I'm pretty sure that only very few even educated speakers say "Académie française" in a normal English sentence when speaking to normal members of the population. And these pseudo-intellectuals interested in flaunting their knowledge and uninterested in communicating constitute less than a very small percentage of the total population in <b>all</b> English-speaking countries. If most US and Canadian university sites and most English-language encyclopedias use "French Academy" more often than the French name, then the fact that the name is sometimes used sloppily i.e. incorrectly by newspaper editors to mean a different academy is no reason to not use it on WP.</dd>

Your opinion and that of the university presses of Oxford and apparently also Harvard and Yale are fighting windmills and are in contradiction to usage in most encyclopedias and by the vast majority of the population. Even most other university sites use "French Academy" and for only one institution. Its use for other institutions requires mention of the longer, full names first; otherwise it just shows sloppiness or ignorance. --<a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspoo_d646.html" title="User:Espoo">Espoo</a> 17:49, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your statement nicely summarises the illogical reasoning of the opponents of the move. According to this reasoning, normal English speakers without any knowledge of French should adopt the naming conventions used by <b>some</b> university publishers <b>in publications meant for intellectuals</b> and should as a result stop talking and reading about these issues. According to this reasoning, we should also stop saying the "French government" and should instead write "Yesterday the gouvernement français decided to send troops to...". And according to the ridiculous argument added by an anonymous user above, this should of course be further "improved" to "Yesterday le gouvernement français decided to send troops to...". So if <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise.html" title="Académie française">Académie française</a> is not moved to <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Academy_0a38.html" title="French Academy">French Academy</a> as in most other encyclopedias, <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_France_4306.html" title="Government of France">Government of France</a> should obviously be moved to Gouvernement français.</dd>

<dd>This proves that this whole discussion is a joke and a clear case of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_in_popular_culture.html#Wikiality" title="Wikipedia in popular culture">Wikiality</a>. If other encyclopedias, other reputable sources, and even university sites use "French Academy", the term is well established and there is no reason to use a French name that is unusable by normal encyclopedia users. Just because editors of this page can speak French doesn't mean that a French name is acceptable. Only in cases such as Institut de France, where there is no well-established English equivalent, is a French article name not in violation of basic WP policies and sane practices in all other encyclopedia. People arguing against these decisions made by large numbers of professional editors in other encyclopedias only show their incompetence and amateurism. I hope the admin deciding this case doesn't count votes as such and ignores those votes that ignore basic WP policies. --<a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspoo_d646.html" title="User:Espoo">Espoo</a> 02:07, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What's the rationale for ignoring the usage of the Economist, New York Times, and <i>Oxford Dictionary of English</i>? Is it that these publications are unprofessional, or simply that you feel they're too snooty? What about the <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>? Is this publication aimed at "intellectuals", whatever that means? Or how about that bastion of snobbery, <i><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Ftech%2Fworld%2F2003-07-18-french-email_x.htm&amp;ei=411uRdKyBL_maMHtiYAE&amp;usg=__VrtKclsoOW5sDF8idYlHX6C03ZE=&amp;sig2=bRXMRQXxH0saPRaEAo6-zA" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Ftech%2Fworld%2F2003-07-18-french-email_x.htm&amp;ei=411uRdKyBL_maMHtiYAE&amp;usg=__VrtKclsoOW5sDF8idYlHX6C03ZE=&amp;sig2=bRXMRQXxH0saPRaEAo6-zA" rel="nofollow">USA Today</a></i>? This publication (which has the largest circulation figures of any newspaper in the US), obviously doesn't care about the sensitivities of the reader who can't deal with those funny-looking French words. (USA Today uses "French Academy" once, as far as I can see, but it's the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2003-01-01-balthus_x.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2003-01-01-balthus_x.htm" rel="nofollow">French Academy in Rome</a>.)</dd>

<dd>On the other hand, when you're citing the usage of edu sites, why aren't you taking into account the searches of yale.edu and osu.edu? (Try searching uchicago.edu, utexas.edu, and washington.edu if you think Ohio State is too elitist.) And again, please note that <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/law/news/2004/030204_markesinis.html" class="external text" title="http://www.utexas.edu/law/news/2004/030204_markesinis.html" rel="nofollow">this press release</a> from the University of Texas School of Law uses "French Academy" to refer to the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, and similar instances of "French Academy" meaning something other than the Académie are scattered throughout .edu sites. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 04:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The whole point is that according to WP naming policy we should use the English name if it is widely used in reputable sources. Just because the French name is used by other reputable sources, does not affect the correct decision according to WP policy. And yes, a lot more time and by a lot more people and by people more competent in writing an encyclopedia is spent in deciding what to call the entry in all the encyclopedias i quoted than in the newspapers and magazines you happen to find.</dd>

<dd>And yes, i'm convinced they're using the French name to sound more refined, or snooty, or informed, or cool or whatever it is they're trying to be. I'm sure almost none of those same editors would use the French name in talking to a normal reader who doesn't speak any French, so it's a bad editorial decision to use it as the headword (instead of as an addition) in writing.</dd>

<dd><b>According to WP naming policy, which is also observed in other encyclopedia, we should use the English name if it is widely known and used in reputable sources.</b> The WP policy specifically advises to follow usage in other encyclopedias. Oxford Dictionary of English is a bad example because they're <b>explaining</b> the French name, not using it as an article. I guess they don't have "French Academy" because it's more or less self-explanatory, which is exactly why WP should use it as the title like other encyclopedias do. The situation would be the same even if all newspapers and magazines and all university Internet pages and some encyclopedias used the French name. As long as a substantial number of reputable sources use the English one, it's the best one for an encyclopedia for the general public. As it is, the English term is widely used in many newspapers and magazines, many if not most university sites, and most if not all encyclopedias. And in well-edited sources, e.g. all encyclopedias, "French Academy" is <b>never</b> used to refer to other academies with longer names. That kind of sloppiness is typical of the media and should not affect editorial decisions in an encyclopedia.</dd>
