<p>Do you have any sources that explicatly state Italy as a great/major power. I have searched in vain, but its rather obvious that Italy is a major power. Thanks. 12.220.94.199 01:53, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On my talk page, could you please list a number of reputable neutral sources that describe Italy as a major/great power.

<dd>The main sources are italian books available at www.internetbookshop.it, feltrinelli.itor even anglo-saxon libraries, you can search books on ebay, sometimes appears some in this theme.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The book How to Make War, has some references to Italy, specially for its navy, which the book puts in 6th place in the world,3th in Europe, being Germany the 4th but well bellow Italy. One major writter of Italian geopolitics and military is former Defence Minister Mr.Lelio Lagorio. In www.astronautix.com you can check Italy missile projects, then inthe early 80's Italy tried again to have a nuclear deterrent, something she was searching since the 60's and it had the capacity to make it since it sold this technology to other countries, and I read this many times, one of the biggest earnersof these sellingwas Fiat division-Fiat Aviazione, BPD and IRI-Finmeccanica-Ansaldo. If you think its obvious Italy is a Major Power you could help me convince others, specially NobleEagle who thinks its not and thinks its owner of all Geopolitical thruth.Thanks. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EACamposPinho_5414.html" title="User:ACamposPinho">User:ACamposPinho</a> 2:42 , 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi again Campos, I hope you didn't get the wrong message on my talk page, but I've already explained this to Hadrian on his <a href="../../../h/a/d/User_talk%7EHadrian1_9b46.html" title="User talk:Hadrian1">talk page</a>. I'm simply inviting people to discussion, not trying to build up an army to oppose Italy. You see: 2 to 1 is not consensus, especially when the two votes come from the two people that have proposed the nation in the first place. So I'm hoping that European Wikipedians would be able to help a bit more. I have put up a message on the Italian's Noticeboard. <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred"><font size="0.5">(Talk)</font></font></a> 00:42, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I was the one who proposed Italy for this status in the first place.Hadrian1 came after.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I didn't proposed for my personnal amusement, I proposed it because besides knowing of Geopolitics and lnow a lot about Italy and I think the right thing to do is includ it as a Great/Major Power. Its for a question of fairness when compared with other similar countries already included. I'm not even italian as more than one called and about Hadrian1 I don't know. About europe, here, whe are more open to other countries of other continents when coming about knowing what happens there. I was in Brazil and I noticed that. Countries in other continents and with big geographical extension have tendence to look more to themselves, for many reasons. One is that they have many problems that must be worked out first for the sake of the nation and of its innhabitants. Brazil, India, Nigeria,.... are in this category of coutries.But the USA is like that too, its a country looking more to itself. The reason for europe, is that we are in contact with other cultures, civilizations, peoples and countries for centuries and we developed the colonial and latter colonial empire notion, like this fact or not. But it was our ancestors, not the present generation. In EU, today there is also a tendency to be more closed, and I think this is wrong, because its not the better way of overcoming our economic and demographic stagnation or decline. EU should be more open, being closed could be good for other continets, but not for europe, as history demonstrate. I don't mean importing more and more merchandises as USA does and exporting less and less. What I mean is learn with others, trade in a fair competition way, open tothe world, it was that fact that has given europe its wealth and proeminance inthe world for centuries. And some countries most be more open to the rest of the world than others, the same medicine is not usefull and appropriatte for al european countries. As for european wikipedians I don't know. If you know many, invite them to debate. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EACamposPinho_5414.html" title="User:ACamposPinho">ACamposPinho</a> 3:22, 5 June 2006</p>

<p>Sorry I've been so long in getting back to you. I thought it might be useful for you to understand where I'm coming from in respect of the Italy debate.</p>
<p>I don't know how long you have been involved with these international power articles; I have been here since the beginning of the year. I spent a lot of time editing the <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_power.html" title="Major power">Major power</a> page, a page which covered the status of nations like Russia, UK, France etc - nations on the second tier, not superpowers but important powers with G8, Security Council membership etc. We had quite a nice article developed, reasonably NPOV, lots of discussion of military/economic/political factors, but no real sources. The page was nominated for deletion as Original Research. As we were to learn, the concept of 'Major powers' does not exist in political science.</p>
<p>The page was wiped and redirected to Great Powers. This annoyed me very much; nothing on that page was false, the statistics were verified, in terms of realpolitik we were right. The problem was that the concept we were addressing didn't exist. There was no academic basis to the judgements we were making to include some countries and exclude others.</p>
<p>The last thing that I want to see is the same to happen to the Great powers page. As I have said to Nobleeagle:</p>
<p><i>So the difficulty is that without an academic basis it becomes difficult to crefuse Italy. We have the top group, those that we have consistently acknowledged as Major/Great/whatever powers - where or what is the dividing line between them and a modern, prosperous (albeit one without any international clout) nation like Italy? If Italy is added then why not Spain? Why not our old friend Brazil? Without a <b>clear boundary</b> then there is no justification for refusal other than the fact that 'we know it to be so'; in terms of realpolitik we are possibly right but we've seen the results of that approach in the Major powers article.</i></p>
<p>We do not have any sourced criteria with which to judge Italy (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>). Whether we, as article editors, acknowledge Italy as a Great/Major power is entirely down to our own judgement and group consensus. That is the problem, it's our judgement and our consensus - there is no source to guide us, the key wikipedia principle of verifiability is breached. A simple Afd nomination on grounds of Original Research and all the work and effort is wasted.</p>
<p>That is my major objection. Italy has a decent case to be ranked up with the other countries, although my feeling is that it lacks international clout - that is my honestly held view; but my view doesn't matter - what we need is verifiable criteria with which to make this judgement, something which we simply do not have.</p>
<p>Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/d/a/User%7EXdamr_c318.html" title="User:Xdamr">Xdamr</a> 01:18, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What international clout does Italy really lacks?</dd>
<dd>Its part of G8, it has a huge economy and huge potential, major industrial regions, major cultural and touristic country, great military, its well above India in military spendings and only a little below Germany. It has so far defeated the g4 Group intentions, it is inthe Iran talks, not in the EU-3 , in my view its only better. It hasn't the power of the EU-3 combined,but by the other side it has the capability to go alone and not to be closed in the group views only,Italy can deal with Iran directly,thru partnershipswith USA,with Russia or another partner,has independence of opinion, its a little like UK inthe UEM-it maitained the British Pound and doing so can have its own financial independence, its own interest rates, budget deficit, without nobody saying to UK how to behave economically and financially.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, this has nothing to do with Italy. The Great Power page was reformulated, inthat process the Modern Powers section lost a country in europe-PORTUGAL.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So Portugal was never a Great Power, butbefore reformulation it had been. But even before the dates where wrong.They puted the end of Portugal as a Great Power in 1580 when it was made part of the Habsburg Empire,not of Spain.Idon't agree. After regaining independence-1640-Portugal was a Great Power again, even greater than before, because before it was discovering "new worlds" and after it was consolidating its power with its zenith in the 18th century. The date of its end as a Great Power was after the Napoleonic invasion and with consequent Barzil independence-1822.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You are absolutely right, Italy is part of the G8, its economy is a strong one - no argument from me on that point. I'm also not going to deny that Italy has notable cultural attractions. However I really must stand by my point that Italy does not wield tremendous political influence on international affairs.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I see there as being two elements which make up international influence - military power and diplomatic power. Italy lacks a seat on the UN security council, it is not one of the core EU countries (EU3), its military is smaller than that of the UK, France etc (Is Italy playing a part in the Iran issue? I was under the impression that recent meetings consisted of the UN Permanent members + Germany.). Italy is part of NATO and its military is a good one, but doesn't seem to do much outwith Italy (for instance, the British army is deployed in 80 countries throughout the world, as well as playing a key role in Iraq and Afghanistan).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>India is a special case, given that it is rapidly developing and appears to be rising in much the way China has.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, all this aside, we don't have any source which defines what a Great power actually is, so deciding which countries are Great powers is premature. We badly need a source for this article, one which validates 'Great power' as a proper part of Political Science and defines its scope. Without it, the article turns into <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a> and someone <b>will</b> come along and delete it.</dd>

<li>About sources reed this:</li>
</ul>
<p>"Great power From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search This article or section does not cite its references or sources. You can help Wikipedia by introducing appropriate citations." In that matter all the article needs sources. The recent meatings were between UNSC Permanent Members and Germany, because as I already said Germany whants to enter this "club" and wants it very hard. But Italy was invited tomediate, by Iran, Russia and USA at least. EU-3 is only a temporary group, why do you say Italy doesn't cont on EU, its a founding menber, thing UK isn't. Its the EU 3rd main contributer, UK is 4th and is the ECB 3rd shareholder, above France, because altough UK doesn't have the Euro it has a share inthe ECB. In EU there was a Franco-German axis, then surged a Italian-UK axis. The first was more in favour of a more federal EU, the second more of a EU of nation-states. Why do you think they choose to president of EU Comission a portuguese politician of bad politicall quality, a "yes man", who is aliberal when talks to a liberal, a social-democratic when talking to one and so on?(I know this but I read a commentary on Barroso in Financial Times and they also said that about him)- The answer is because the Franco-German axis wanted one federalistc,the Italian-UK axis wanted a more liberal and less integrationist one, this man, Barroso was a compromise man. And even the toughts of each axis doesn't mean the people of these countries think like their politicians.Just look of the No at the Constitutional Treaty in France, when France politics was one of the main advocates of federalism. Now the UK-Italian axis is frozen, because italian premiership/government has changed to another political spectrum and also because thing in Italy are not well defined yet, it will be a referendum, only after that, the political scene could be more stable and define its lines. -Italy is also in Irak, Afghanistan and in many other UN missions. What about India, China, Japan, Germany, Brazil, where are their military deployed? The first war Germany was allowed to enter was only 7 years ago. India is a special case. We go again to the quantity vs quality debate.If India is important is only because of its size, if size was the only thing, so UK would be the same as Italy, thing you think its wrong. -When India wants new car technologies, does it have the kno-how to make them.Only with japanese help, which is the case of Maruti, even the mostindependent Indian Auto enterprise TATA is only stong in trucks amd pick-ups,who is its major partner, a foreign group again and which one? FIAT from Italy, so my friend, Italy has the know-how, that India lacks. India will sell or destroy the Viraat, its old aircraft carrier and who is the major prospect in the table to substitute it? Buying the Giuseppe Garibaldi from Italy or make a new one equal to the new Italian Aircraft Carrier- the Cavour. Normally people says they don't know how "rich" in raw materials countries, like Brazil, african countries can be so underdeveloped. Do you know why? What makes a country and its people rich is scientific, economic and technical knowledge. Saudi Arabia is full of petroleum (and now is well because of its high price) but when it wants aircraft, luxury cars, products of high-technology, watches, have they the know-how to make them? No, they bought them from Germany, UK, USA, France, Italy, Switzerland,... And this was only an example.</p>

<li>Hi. He did that? And he is now an admnistrator,he should be more carefull and impartial.</li>
</ul>
<p>He said there are admnistrators with 13-14 years. So if there are admnistrators with that age,many members probably are youger not to speak about people unregistered who edit pages. It says a lot about wikipedia. Do you think a 13 year old kid is able to have a true opinion on what we posted for eg.? I don't think so, a few could but only a few.</p>
<p>Start an article I don't know very well, but if one thing is already mentioned but have no article you can edit and create an article for it. But that you should know. Translate I think its editing the page to other languages but I really don't know for sure.</p>

<p>Well we lost. I would like to thank you for your support and conviction. As a consolation they decided to mention Italy in the Great Power page as an unknown or undetermined entity. I really don't know what we could have done. I personally spent hours researching articles and though I surprised myself of Italy's involvement in world affairs, it just wasn't enough for them. I guess being fourth in Europe or third if you include the shadow economy isn't enough. I really didn't expect to win anyone over but I did expect someone to join in that was in the pro camp. We fought a good battle and should the vote be open again maybe next we'll win. Maybe we'll have to wait for Italy to get a UNSC seat.

<li>Maybe the UNSC isn't so impossible as people think or at least the semi-permanent seats, which would be a vitory to Italian Diplomacy.I will contact an entity I know to be what is being done.</li>

I think that even if Italy was comparable to USA, they would have doubts. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EACamposPinho_5414.html" title="User:ACamposPinho">ACamposPinho</a>2: ,28 June 2006</p>

<dd>Didn't you have requested to be an admnistrator? And I toughtyou were sucessfull in your request, since people were congratulating you. And as I said a person of 13 years old can know much and be an excellent admnistrator, but you have to agree that it's a minority, specially today, when kids doesn't care of anything besides games and consumer society. Of course there are kids different and many more if they are from ouside USA. People in other countries and continents are different and so are kids.I didn't post this in your page in order to not overcrowd it.</dd>

<p>Yes, indeed. Quite frankly I think that advocates of the EU are somewhat blinded by their EU enthusiasm. They seem to cite the influence of 'European' culture and EU military power etc. I very much dispute the existence of any unified European culture; when people in Malaysia think of the footballer David Beckham, do they think of him as British or as European? Like it or not, in terms of cultural influence, there is one overwhelmingly dominant culture today - through a combination of the British Empire and 20th century American power, it is Anglo-Saxon ideas which influence the world the most. Others, like France or China, don't really have anything to compare. As far as military power goes, through personal experience I can tell you that the British armed forces (surely a dominant component of any EU military power) are far, far more integrated with the US military than with any of the EU countries (setting aside their common NATO membership).</p>
<p>As for China and India, with 1 billion+ people, they have the opportunity to do something quite special. As far as Russia goes though, I'm not convinced at all. I've been a student of Russian affairs for quite some time now, I simply do not recognise the view that some people seem to have of Russia as a resurgent superpower. Russia's present economic growth is based on one thing and one thing alone, oil and gas prices. The higher they go, the more revenue the Russians get - but if they fall, what will Russia have? Very little indeed - Russia's industial base and infrastructure remain highly underdeveloped compared with the West. Demographically, Russia is facing a severe drop in population over the next 50 years; some predict that it fall from 150 million today, to 80 million by 2050. Corruption is endemic in both public and private spheres. The Russian military is in an appaling state. Given the demographic crisis, some actually question whether Russia will survive in it's current form; perhaps mineral rich Siberia could be lost to China?</p>
<p>Incidentally, the whole oil prices issue raises interesting questions about Russia's attitude towards the Iran crisis. Oil prices have risen as a result of the sabre-rattling, Russia likes high oil prices, therefore Russia tries to drag the issue out as long as possible by not supporting the Western nations. Far fetched? Possibly, but Russian politics are so byzantine that anything is possible.</p>

<p>Well for me the whole Russian support seems to be two fold. One, yes they want high oil prices. Two, Russia for some reason always opposes the "West" and its policies. I understand that different countries have different interests, but really the Cold war is over. Why create this animosity. I don't think the West really wants to see the Russian state dissolved. Actually, Europe wants to include them in the EU or some sort of partnership but Russians demanded that they not be included in any discussions even though they need help. The Russian enigma continues.</p>

<dd>I think that it's very much a hangover from the dissolution of the USSR. Rather like Germans in the aftermath of WW1, Russians cannot see or accept why the USSR had to collapse. Then, in the 90s, the attitude and policies of the Western nations towards Russia was resented. The rush to capitalism caused much hardship amongst the populace; the common people saw it all as a plot to oppress them - at the same time as they were losing their jobs and security others were making billions in corrupt deals for state assets. Now, as Russia is resurgent (however shaky the foundations) many see it as the time to reassert Russia's place in the world - no longer to be junior to the US, rather to be a counterweight (even to the extent of linking up with China - see the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation_e367.html" title="Shanghai Cooperation Organisation">Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The 'Coloured' Revolutions in places such as Ukraine and Georgia are broadly seen as an attempt by the US to hem Russia in. The ejection of the US from their Central Asian air bases was seen as a great triumph. You might be surprised to see the hostility that NATO attracts today amongst Russians; did you hear about the recent aborted US-Ukranian naval exercise?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ultimately, Russia is still attempting to get back it's past status. Above all it resents Western interference in what it sees as its area of influence. Personally I don't think that the 'there must be democracy at all costs' approach of the US helps at all. So much of this nationalism seems to be stoked up for political purposes, but it finds a receptive audience.</dd>

<li>As for Russia demographics I don't think it's population will shrink so much. If economy growns people will come.Putin is bringing back many russians living in ex-Soviet republics and we cannot really forecast what will happen in 45 years.Year ago UN sai Spain population would be in 2050 28-30 Million, while Spanish Statistical Institute said it would be aroud 33-35 Million. Now with all the immigrants and growth of natality it is estimated will be 45-50 Million.The same goes to Italy,UN forecasted for 2050 42-45 Million people,Italian Statistical Institute said 49-52,now this same institute is saying 55-60 Million. And for Russia I always saw 100 Million not 80. As for Russia military it will be more powefull in future but with fewer equipment. Less equipment than in Soviet era but state of the art equipment- Quality vs quantity again.</li>

<dd>Well there are a host of formidable problems to face if the demographic crisis is to be overcome. The low birth rate is one thing that the government are trying to address at the moment (around 160 deaths to 100 births). But what about the fact that approximately 50% of rural Russians are alcaholics? The poor infrastructure and general poverty means that there is little general access to healthcare. Combined with the unhealthy lifestyles of a great proportion of Russians, it's no wonder that life expectancy has decreased to 57 for men (in 1987 it was 65 - interestingly it's 72 for women). Add the spread of AIDS to this (Russia has one of the highest rates in the developed world) and you have a grim scenario.</dd>

And if there is a person who cares about Russia and has given it a little more(at least) self-respect and respect in the world is Putin.In Yeltsin times things where much worst, it was inthe verge of anarchy,self-destruction and bankrupcy.

<li>This Brendel besides having the mind of a kid, is a fervent defender of EU as a Superpower. Read what he and other guy, writted in Brendel discussion page about EU. He said I did something-I suppose including EU in a section as a country it would be,the other say that they will delete but says him to writte again. No comments. And NobleEagle gives these people talk. NobleEagle said he wanted more europeans to contribute to my view on Italy's position. So he asked a German guy residing in California. When one is distant,normally feels more patriotic-more German in this case, but is not so in contact with its continent reallity,so doesn't know so much about it.Why didn't he invited Italians? Was afraid of patriotism, first Italians are not like Frenchs, second if one knows of something is one who is involved init,in this case living in Italy. And as a true Hindu he should be more consistent with history. Anglo-Saxons invaded his country and rulled it has a simplecolony-a special one but neverthless a colony. At least Mussolini talked with Ghandi and had plans for India different from that of Britain. Of course in Mussolini's and Italy's interest but with more self-governance to India, like a protectorate. A sort of the politics of Britain in Egipt. UK no, UK wanted India to be always the Crown Jewell.</li>

<dd>However, all that aside, presumably Nobleeagle didn't know any users who had explicitly identified themselves as Italian? All contributors to the English wikipedia speak English to one degree or another, unless they explicitly identify themselves as being of a particular nationality then it can be hard to know. Personally, I've always taken the view that identifying yourself by nationality/race/politics/sexual orientation etc is potentially divisive; I choose not to make any reference to my nationality etc on my user page (although people could probably make an educated guess as to what it is). Try and judge people only by their contributions, that's my policy - I might not succeed all the time, but I still try!</dd>

<li>Mussolini was more pro-Ghandi, but latter his margin of mannover was much more limited, because of the fall of Italy and he had to agree with Hitler and his choices.Before 1943 was a little different and before 1938-40 very, but much very different. Before 1938 Germany wasn't well equiped enough.Just look at the assassination of Austrian Chanceller Dolfuss, Mussolini went made and wanted to invade Germany in retaliation.He didn't do it because of France and UK opposition and because he still thinked Hitler was a potential partner,because both wanted to reshape world order.</li>

<dd>Well history goes to the winners, that's a fact that can't be denied. The winners write the history books, the Romans told us about the barbaric Gauls and Germanic tribes.

While we overlook Hiroshima and other catastrophes that must have weakened the Axis powers greatly. <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred"><font size="0.5">(Talk)</font></font></a> 23:45, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>With this comment you give me reason why Italy is always bad regarded. Germany is different, because Anglo-Saxons are from Germanic origin and speciallysince reunification and Japan because of it's enourmous economical growth and total dominance of electronic and photo industries since the 60's.</li>
</ul>
<p>Italy didn't really came on the losing side, it camed on a limbo semi-losing, semi-belligerant with the Allies, probably one more reason of Italy bad politic governance after the war,only since the 80's the political situation has stabilized and Italy has regained more proud. France was in a situation simillar to Itally, the only difference was De Gaulle, exilled in UK and entering France like a liberator when was the UK, USA who really liberated France, altough some French too, but it was French in exile plus the partisans, Italy liberated in the same way, but more from inside. But in the end France and China without many fighting alone were considered winners and were regarded UNSC Permanent Seats, while Poland, Brazil, Canada, Australia and India(altough this a colony at the time-but fighted fiercely) were "only winners" or co-belligerants like Italy. Two ways of being for the same behaviour.</p>

<p>Okay, first Italy and Germany are allies. The second world war was 60 years ago and a lot has changed since then, especially in Germany. Germany is more powerful than Italy, its a great power. Why, becuase it is quite a bit larger than Italy. The United State is more powerful than any other industrialized country on earth. Why? Because it is the largest industrialized country on earth. Power is not a measurement of how advanced a country is, otherswise Norway and Luxemburg would lead the world. Stating that Germany is far more powerful than Italy does not mean that Germany is better than Italy. Nobody's better than anybody. Also, "Who beat you up." Such phrases are unecessary. Besdies I'm half American, when did Italy beat up the US? Let's not forget that we are all allied today.

<li>As matter of fact in "soccer" Italy "beated" USA in this World Cup since USA goal was an auto-goal.OK,it wasn't intended to offend you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luxembourg is a country only on name, should be divided between Germany and France or Belgium too, but I think Belgium should be divided too-majority of people want it. But not as two independent countries, no, Wallonia would go to France and Flanders would go toNetherlnads. This hasn't hapened yet because of Brussels. They wouldn't know in which country the city should stay and since it's the capital and largest city of Belgium, besides being a bilingual city shouldn't stay on the border and if it stood in France for eg. it would always be a problem. If it stood in Netherlands would be the same. As for Germany being more powerfull than Italy,it his economically and the difference it's not so huge. USA GDP for egg.is four times that of Germany, german one is circa 1,5 that of Italy.Politically speaking if it has more power is because of UE and Germany central position on it-in all aspects and because since reunification has regained a national pride that is seen therefore in politics,but in world stage Italy is more involved than Germany besides the G-4 affair, that is unresolved yet,much due to Italy efforts. You must notice that both Germany and Italy are economic giants with little political power comparing to their economic power. Germany is slowly taking steps to reverse this, Italy is more slowly doing that, for many reasons. The main one it's their politicall division, they are more united than 15-20 years ago but aren't united enough, there are many left-right divisions and many allegiances to the political spectrum that overlap the allegiance to the nation. And of course Germany is a Great Power, but if this is the case Italy is also a Great Power, not on the size of Germany but still a Great Power. Look at the characteristics of a Great Power-Italy meets them, the ones Italy doesn't have-like UNSC Permanent Seat and Nuclear Forces, Germany doesn't have either. Italy has things in military and geopolitical field that Germany doesn't have,as a matter of fact. When you talk of Italy you think you are talking of Poland or even Spain. Read more about this matter. Of course anglo-saxonic press is very anti-italian.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your congratulations on our victory in the World Cup. The french gave us a good fight but we won anyway. We had a huge party over here. Streets were closed everywhere.</p>
<p>By the way I was rooting for Portugal over Germany. Sorry you lost but I thought they played well, but Germany needed to get something since they hosted the Cup. On to Euro2008.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, I read what Brendel wrote. Ask him if knows what happened in the Aventine hills outside of Rome in '44. If he doesn't, he should check on the internet to educate himself on the treatment of "allies" by the Germans. Then perhaps 60 years won't seem so long ago.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Portugal made a few mistakes like not putting Nuno Gomes and Figo on the beggining of the second part at least. But the host country would get the 3rd place anyway, since they didn't get through to the final thanks to your overwhelming victory over Germany.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Portugal was winning or there were no goals the referee wouldmake something in order that Germany would win. But the most favored team, as always was French team. But even with luck and favours ITALY beated them. Brendel says is half american, by the way he writtes in english I don't know from wich part of Amaerica he is.He pretends to be from USA but then wrote things like "becuase" and others. I think is 100% german. In terms of world history 60 years were yesterday.When you mean Aventine you are talking of the "Massacre delle Fosse Ardeatine"?</p>
<p>Other thing, I would like you to sign, because I want to show you something here in wikipedia and I don't know who you are.</p>

Sorry I forgot to sign. I thought you would have known it was me. And yes I was talking about the "Fosse Ardeatine". I think Brendel is German but lives in the States. Then again, who knows where he's from. We don't have to prove our nationality here.

<p>What you are misunderstanding is that a global power is not equal to a great power. My understanding from the article was that a global power is someone who projects itself globablly. Arguably India has little global influence. A good example to compare them to is Israel. A strong economy, and military but lack cultural influence, due to Muslim nations, and many other countries that wish to curb its strength. Saudi Arabia on the other hand has strong influence in North and East Africa, Central and Western Asia, and increasing influence in Europe. A lot of this influence comes from oil, and the rest from missionary work. Personally, I dislike the article. Its full of weasel words, poorly defined, and the image is confusing. (According to it, Saudi Arabia would be included by the way). My point is not that S.A. should be included but that clearly the U.S. and <b>maybe</b> a few others exert enough influence to call them "global powers". 74.137.230.39 17:27, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I live in a european country and the influence of Saudi Arabia here is almost zero. When one talks of Saudi Arabia here only cames to mind petroleum and it isn't our greatest supplier,which is Algeria. So Algeria should also be included? And what about Angola..., Lybia, Venezuela?<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Saudi Arabia could have influence has I said in Muslim World but in Europe it's only about their petroleum. One has to measure the cultural , economical, military and power of projection. Besides SABIC what is the other great company of Saudi Arabia? Saudi Aramco? Doesn't even enter in Fortune Global 500. You call that influence. S.A. have natural resources, things that are almost always together with poor countries. If S.A. GDP per capita isn's lower is because of the quantity of oil lords/sheiks and the richness it produces. But what makes a country wealthy and influent it's knowledge and tecnhical Know-how. When a sheik wants to buy a great car or watch, does S.A. produce them? No, he cames to Germany, UK or Italy in the car case or to Switzerland in the watch case for eg. And even in military S.A. spends a lot but doesn't produce almost anything. Even Israel has it's own defence companies. S.A. has Tornados that it bought from UK, and Tornado is a project of UK,Germany and Italy. Now will buy EuroFighter Typhoons from UK too and this is a project that besides the above countries include Spain too. Spain for eg. has much more influence in the world. If the G8 expanded you think S.Arabia could enter, Spain could, S.A. only if it expanded to the G30 or even more. And the UN Security Council, if a muslim member enters you think will be Saudi Arabia, could be but Egypt has much more chances, it has more influence and makes a bridge between Arab/Muslim World and Africa. Since when S.A. projects itself globally? Only inthe Middle East region and not onthe whole Arab World. It only projects itself globally in religious matters becuase of Mecca and Medina. But if that's the case there are more christians and the real catholic power is Vatican. Of course not all christians are catholics, but catholics are the majority and Vatican has a real voice in the world. But we are talking of a state of 700 inhabitants. It isn't a nation even, it's a sovereign state, but makes part of the Italian nation, like Monaco it's soveriegn but makes part of France interms of nationality,not citizenship(are different concepts).</p>

<ul>
<li>Once again I'm trying to point out that their arent very many global powers. Only the U.S. and maybe Japan have overwhelming influence. And Japan only has that influence economically. S.A. has a growing cultural influence through religion in Europe. Once again I think the article is confusing global power with great power. The Vatican has a lot of religious influence, but Italy does not compare. However, the Vatican unlike the Saudis lack everthing else as you've mentioned, and despite sig. influence its not nearly as strong as the Saudis do to the many theocracies in the Muslim world. Their is a narrowing amount of difference between the religious influence of the Saudis and the Vatican in Europe. 74.137.230.39 21:24, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hello again Campos, Hitler corrupted a lot of things, including a legitimate name of a language family...the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryan_3705.html" title="Indo-Aryan">Indo-Aryan</a> group. Therefore it is not necessarily racist unless one says such things with malicious intentions. Aryan is a common first name in India, Arya is a common surname in India. There is some action thriller movie called Aryan being made in India, all have nothing to do with Hitler and the names are of greater antiquity than Nazi Germany for sure.

<p>You haven't been on the article lately, thought you might like to know that it is GA and that Italy has it's nice section all well sourced. If you could add a paragraph about modern Italy being a great power it would be nice because our best sources contained little about modern Italy. <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">[TALK]</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nobleeagle_dfb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">&#160;[C]</font></a></sup> 23:14, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes I haven't been on the article lately, but when looking at some sources I think they aren't so right. For egg., in the page is claimed that in military terms Italy is more a middle power and then there are links to articles that classifies Italy as a middle power. But in at least one of those articles Germany and Japan are considered middle powers two. So to be fair the link should say "note the classification of Italy, Germany and Japan" within this group and not only Italy.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>And in the definition when is Italy is classified as a middle power in military power why isn't Germany, Japan or India considered to be middle too?<br /></p>
<p>As far as I know Italy has a greater and better navy than all these countries, its air force its not so big as the others but is well equiped and its army is well equiped too. And even if it looses to Germany in army and air force, in navy it gains for a wide margin. So its military is comparable to that of Germany for eg.</p>
<p>And in international conflicts Italy is more involved than any of these countries. It is the third contributor to peacekeeping after USA and UK.</p>
<p>So I think is not fair to consider Italy Great only in economy, militarly it is too and politically it is being more any year. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EACamposPinho_5414.html" title="User:ACamposPinho">ACamposPinho</a> 23:30, 24 January 2007</p>
