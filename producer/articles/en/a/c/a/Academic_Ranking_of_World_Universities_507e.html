<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities_507e.html" title="Edit section: Shanghai Jiao Tong University Ranking">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shanghai Jiao Tong University Ranking</span></h2>
<p>One of the most widely cited but widely criticised rankings, the <b><a href="http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/ranking.htm" class="external text" title="http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/ranking.htm" rel="nofollow">Academic Ranking of World Universities</a></b> is compiled by researchers from <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai_Jiao_Tong_University_c8d0.html" title="Shanghai Jiao Tong University">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> and includes major institutes of higher education ranked according to a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula.html" title="Formula">formula</a> that took into account alumni winning <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_c061.html" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prizes</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fields_Medal_f3ac.html" title="Fields Medal">Fields Medals</a> (10 percent), staff winning Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals (20 percent), "highly-cited researchers in 21 broad subject categories" (20 percent), articles published in <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_%28journal%29.html" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_%28journal%29.html" title="Science (journal)">Science</a></i> (20 percent), the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_Citation_Index_e8b6.html" title="Science Citation Index">Science Citation Index</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Sciences_Citation_Index_0ad9.html" title="Social Sciences Citation Index">Social Sciences Citation Index</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts_and_Humanities_Citation_Index_4f77.html" title="Arts and Humanities Citation Index">Arts and Humanities Citation Index</a> (20 percent) and the size of the institution (10 percent). The results have been cited by <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Economist_bbe2.html" title="The Economist">The Economist</a></i> magazine in ranking universities of the world <a href="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4339960" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4339960" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>and <a href="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4339960" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4339960" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. However, the Shanghai rankings have also been criticized for placing too much emphasis on the Nobel prizewinners, as opposed to the broader impact of a university's scientific output. Arguably, this also has the effect of biasing the results towards the sciences for which a Nobel prize is awarded. There are three Nobel prizes for the sciences (chemistry, physics and medicine), one for the social sciences (economics), one for the arts (literature) and the Peace Prize. Universities with staff or alumni holding <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fields_Medal_f3ac.html" title="Fields Medal">Fields medals</a> for mathematics are also rewarded, but similar awards for achievement in the arts are not taken into account.</p>
<p>Because of its methodology the list ranks almost exclusively <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research_university.html" title="Research university">research universities</a> and not <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal-arts_college.html" title="Liberal-arts college">liberal-arts colleges</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities_507e.html" title="Edit section: The Times Higher Education Supplement World University Ranking">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i> World University Ranking</span></h2>
<p><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_Higher_Education_Supplement_6440.html" title="The Times Higher Education Supplement">The Times Higher Education Supplement</a></i> (<i>THES</i>) also publishes an annual report about world rankings. The ranking weights are: 60% research quality, 10% graduate employability, 10% "international outlook", and 20% student/faculty ratio. The methodology is explained <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/university_rankings/article/archive/2006/september//article/thes_qs_world_university_rankings_methodology/758/" class="external text" title="http://www.topuniversities.com/university_rankings/article/archive/2006/september//article/thes_qs_world_university_rankings_methodology/758/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Times report has also been critical of the Shanghai rankings. In its 2004 report, <i>THES</i> questioned why the Shanghai rankings count only Nobel prizes; why the universities where prizewinners studied, some at the turn of the century before last, were credited and why universities where winners carried out their research, often at least 20 years previously, were credited rather than the institution that now benefits from their presence.1 The report went on to further criticize the rankings for their emphasis on the sciences.</p>
<p>However, it is to be noted that THES ranking also faces criticism due to the more subjective nature of its assessment criteria, which are largely based on a 'peer review' system of 1000 academics in various fields. An Australian researcher castigates the THES-QS ranking because it arbitrarily put his very own Australian university way higher than it deserves<a href="http://www.archsoc.com/kcas/bestunis.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archsoc.com/kcas/bestunis.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities_507e.html" title="Edit section: Webometrics ranking">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Webometrics ranking</span></h2>
<p>The Webometrics Ranking is produced by the Cybermetrics Lab (CINDOC), a unit of the National Research Council (CSIC), the main public research body in Spain. The Lab acts as an Observatory of the Science and Technology on the Web.</p>
<p>It is available at: <b><a href="http://www.webometrics.info/" class="external text" title="http://www.webometrics.info/" rel="nofollow">Webometrics Ranking of World Universities</a></b>.</p>
<p>The Webometrics Ranking is built from a database of over 11,000 universities and more than 5,000 research centers. The Top 3,000 universities are shown in the main rank, but even more are covered in the regional lists. Institutions from developing countries benefit from this policy as they obtain knowledge of their current position even if they are not World-Class Universities.</p>
<p>The ranking started in 2004 and is based on a combined indicator that takes into account both the volume of the Web contents and the visibility and impact of this web publications according to the number of external inlinks they received. The ranking is updated every January and July, providing Web indicators for universities and research centres worldwide. This approach takes into account the wide range of scientific activities represented in the academic websites, frequently overlooked by the bibliometric indicators.</p>
<p>Webometric indicators are provided to show the commitment of the institutions to Web publication. Thus, Universities of high academic quality may be ranked lower than expected due to a restrained web publication policy.</p>
<p>The Webometrics approach is the <b><a href="http://www.universitymetrics.com/g-factor" class="external text" title="http://www.universitymetrics.com/g-factor" rel="nofollow">G-Factor</a></b> methodology, which counts the number of links only from other university websites. The G-Factor is an indicator of the popularity or importance of each university's website from the combined perspectives of the creators of many other university websites. It is therefore a kind of extensive and objective peer review of a university through its website - in social network theory terminology, the G-Factor measures the '<b>nodality'</b> of each university's website in the '<b>network'</b> of university websites.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities_507e.html" title="Edit section: European Commission Ranking">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">European Commission Ranking</span></h2>
<p>The European Commission also weighed in on the issue, when it compiled a list of the 22 European universities which have the highest scientific impact (measured in terms of the impact factor of their scientific output). The list is available at: <a href="ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/indicators/docs/3rd_report_snaps10.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/indicators/docs/3rd_report_snaps10.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (see page 2). This ranking was compiled as part of the Third European Report on Science &amp; Technology Indicators, prepared by the Directorate General for Science and Research of the European Commission in 2003 (updated 2004).</p>
<p>Being an official document of the European Union (office of the EU commissioner for science and technology), which took several years of specialist effort to compile, it can be regarded as a highly reliable source (the full report, containing almost 500 pages of statistics is available for download free from the EU website at: <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/indicators/third_report.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://cordis.europa.eu/indicators/third_report.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). Unlike the other rankings, it only explicitely considers the top European institutions, but ample comparison statistics with the rest of the world are provided in the full report. The report first identifies the top university in each country, in terms of three criteria: number of publications, citations, and impact factor. Second, a ranking is provided of the top 22 European universities in terms of citation impact factor of their scientific publications. University College London is ranked first in terms of the number of publications and number of citations, but only 13th in terms of publication impact. In terms of citation impact (the criterium considered for the pan-European ranking), Oxford and Cambridge lead, while smaller technical universities, such as TU Eindhoven (Netherlands) and TU Munich (Germany) are ranked third. The report does not provide a direct comparison between European and US/world universities - although it does compute a scientific impact score, measured against the world average.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities_507e.html" title="Edit section: Slovenian ranking">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Slovenian ranking</span></h2>
<p>This study, conducted by the Jozef Stefan Institute in Slovenia, also provides a ranking for all world universities and can be accessed at: <a href="http://ai.ijs.si/mezi/iassatena/shanghai-relative.html" class="external text" title="http://ai.ijs.si/mezi/iassatena/shanghai-relative.html" rel="nofollow">University Ranking by Institute Jozef Stefan, Slovenia</a>. Unlike the Shanghai Jiao Tong study, the main criteria used includes the ratio between SCI and Scopus listed publication per ratio of staff. The report provides, however, downloadable Excel files, through which the user can select different criteria (such as the total number of publications, number of SCI publications only or the corresponding performance ratios).</p>

<p><i><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i> magazine also conducted a ranking of <b><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14321230/site/newsweek/" class="external text" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14321230/site/newsweek/" rel="nofollow">The Top 100 Global Universities</a></b> for 2006. They evaluated universities on some of the measures used by <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai_Jiaotong_University_ff62.html" title="Shanghai Jiaotong University">Shanghai Jiaotong University</a> and the <a href="../../../t/h/e/THES_b237.html" title="THES">Times Higher Education Survey</a>. Fifty percent of the score came from equal parts of three measures used by Shanghai Jiatong: the number of highly-cited researchers in various academic fields, the number of articles published in Nature and Science, and the number of articles listed in the ISI Social Sciences and Arts &amp; Humanities indices. Another 40 percent of the score came from equal parts of four measures used by the Times: the percentage of international faculty, the percentage of international students, citations per faculty member (using ISI data), and the ratio of faculty to students. The final 10 percent came from library holdings (number of volumes). (Taken from MSNBC's website).</p>
