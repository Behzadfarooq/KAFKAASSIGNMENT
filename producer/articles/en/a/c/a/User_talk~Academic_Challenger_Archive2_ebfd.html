<p>Dear Academic Challenger,</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer in my discussion page.</p>
<p>1. If Latebird is not admin, Hallelujah! that's justice. I hope he will not become one if he continues to threaten people to suppress other people's voice and cover up facts in favor of his relative's reputation. Please tell me how Latebird's name appeared in wikipedia welcome page for user Sansar <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESansar_8219.html" title="User talk:Sansar">User_talk:Sansar</a>. Because of this page, I thought he got the adminship although I didn't find in the English wikipedia admin list although I didn't check in German wikipedia admin list.</p>
<p>2. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Nambaryn_Enkhbayar_30f1.html" title="Nambaryn Enkhbayar">Nambaryn Enkhbayar</a> is the correct name. Not Engbayer. I will edit it back because it was not a thought, it is a fact. I saw you also deleted Latebird's comments from the discussion page of Nambaryn Enkhbayar article.</p>
<p>You said "Strange as it may seem, there is probably a large section of the Mongolian population which still supports Engbayer, Enkhbold and the MPRP." I agree with that for Enkhbayar and MPRP case only, but not Enkhbold's case. Last news I read about Mongolia in Mongolian newspaper channel is Enkhbold's leading MPRP sent police against civil demonstrations, strikes and picketing which demand his government's resignation at Sukhbaatar square. Police has been smashing protestors' dwelling to picket. <a href="http://www.mongolia-web.com/content/view/373/2/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mongolia-web.com/content/view/373/2/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://english.pravda.ru/news/world/11-04-2006/79011-Mongolia-0" class="external autonumber" title="http://english.pravda.ru/news/world/11-04-2006/79011-Mongolia-0" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> MPRP also organized con-demonstrators against civil demonstrations. Con-demonstrated demonstrated only 1 hour and who admitted being paid $4 per hour to demonstrate on behalf of MPRP against civil demonstrations. <a href="http://www.mongolia-web.com/content/view/363/2/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mongolia-web.com/content/view/363/2/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>3. Yes, I admitted using soc-puppet which is DokDok because I couldn't have accessed to edit Nambaryn Enkhbayar article in the internet, so, I quickly created a Dokdok username to edit qucikly, because I was in a hurry. It is not purposefully used against something. I realize that you felt cheated, but that's not the case. I am an honest person, therefore, I admitted to use another account to Latebird. Otherwise, I should have written "no no no" as unmoraled selfish, many faced, corrupted MPRP people.</p>
<p>I agree with you about reputation. I believe in God, and I have guts and morale. I haven't done anything illegal, or I haven't written anything violating wikipedia rules such as vandalism. Therefore, there is no reason for wikipedia to block my edition as Latebird claimed.</p>
<p>4. My findings in internet search is user Latebird is a son of <a href="../../../m/i/y/Miyeegombo_Enkhbold_c176.html" title="Miyeegombo Enkhbold">Miyeegombo Enkhbold</a>, Mongolia's corrupted Prime Minister of non-military junta government. User Latebird studies in Canberra, Australia with Australian scholarship which he acquired through his father's connections. He attended some studies in Germany before.</p>
<p>Also, Latebird created and edited <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsakhiagiyn_Elbegdorj_05b6.html" title="Tsakhiagiyn Elbegdorj">Tsakhiagiyn Elbegdorj</a>'s article in German wikipedia<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsachiagiin_Elbegdordsch" class="external autonumber" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsachiagiin_Elbegdordsch" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which looks like containing false information by the date, I can tell, to negate <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsakhiagiyn_Elbegdorj_05b6.html" title="Tsakhiagiyn Elbegdorj">Tsakhiagiyn Elbegdorj</a> and to uprise <a href="../../../m/i/y/Miyeegombo_Enkhbold_c176.html" title="Miyeegombo Enkhbold">Miyeegombo Enkhbold</a>. He also wrote false positive article about <a href="../../../m/i/y/Miyeegombo_Enkhbold_c176.html" title="Miyeegombo Enkhbold">Miyeegombo Enkhbold</a> <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijeegombyn_Enchbold" class="external autonumber" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijeegombyn_Enchbold" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> in German wikipedia as he got Master's degree in 1987 in communist Mongolia where Master's degree was not issued until after 1995.</p>
<p>5. I always try to argue about content. However, out of nowhere, Latebird, suddenly began to threaten to block my edition in wikipedia without connecting to any edition of my article. Therefore, for that purpose I submitted request.</p>
<p>Thanks. <a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemonhead_a5b0.html" title="User:Lemonhead">Lemonhead</a> 21:49, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello Academic Challenger,</p>
<p>I know internet coding, and computer for a while and I made a profound search and that's true <a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">User:Latebird</a> is Miyeegombo Enkhbold's son and he is in Australia. Of course, his real name is not Latebird, since there is no such real name in Mongolia. (I've been to Mongolia many times in last few years because of my father's Kalmyk Mongolian origin and we love Mongolia.)</p>
<p>I wish you could read Mongolian newspapers in Mongolian. The information I provided are facts and I put the links. Why don't you edit what you consider NPOV instead of deleting the whole thing? <a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemonhead_a5b0.html" title="User:Lemonhead">Lemonhead</a> 18:36, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Happy Easter! Academic Challenger,</p>
<p>"Strange as it may seem, there is probably a large section of the Mongolian population which still supports Engbayer, Enkhbold and the MPRP." you wrote 2 days ago on my discussion page. That is an interesting point.</p>
<p>I don't know whom you support politically, as a New Yorker, I didn't vote for Bush in the elections and I never ever met anyone who voted for Bush in New York, however, he still won in the elections. Everybody I know doesn't support war in Iraq, but it is still going on administered by our government. It doesn't mean that who doesn't support Bush doesn't have unreliable and unverified information. Now everybody knows that even the reason of the war itself was not reasonable or true. It means that winning party is not always right or not always verifiable.</p>
<p>I think people never learn certain things, that's why history repeats itself one way or another all the time because people never change. You see Julius Caesar's time, Jesus time, Bonaparte time, everytime there were betrayers, bad people who did harm and public who couldn't have prevented bad things happening or realize the reality after long time after it happened. So, why do we continue to contribute history to repeat itself. Why can't we contribute to advance it, to create shortcut as public to see the point at the same time when it is happening?</p>
<p>Back to the point, from my observation of travelling in Mongolia and reading about it, ex-communist MPRP era lasted in Mongolia too long a whole generation and it almost became a religion over there. That's why most old people support MPRP because they didn't have religion which was prohibited by the communist system and in their mindset, they filled the gap of a superior protector by MPRP as a result of former-communist party's brainwashing propaganda. Now after democracy came to the country 17 years ago, the old people who lived in MPRP era most of their lifetime can't get rid of their "religion" MPRP so easily. It is also a same thing that people can't stop drinking coffee or it is very hard for smokers to stop smoking no matter we all know they are bad for health.</p>
<p>Former MPRP of cold war time was different that it had a goal for communism. Present MPRP doesn't have that goal, it is simply playing Mongolian public's attached or addicted mind to "MPRP" name. Even the leaders of the MPRP of old time and present time are different. Now it is a bunch of corrupted people surrounded by wealthy bussinessmen who use "MPRP" power for their business gains. Marginal public confuse with the same name of "MPRP", therefore, large portion of Mongolians still think MPRP is valuable although it hasn't done anything useful to the society during its power in democratic time of Mongolia. It is same thing that if Starbucks begins to sell bad quality coffee and said that it has a new goal for coffee, majority of the people who used to drinking Starbucks coffee will still be going there because of the Starbucks name for a while until the addiction is gone or until totally persuaded that the coffee is no good anymore. It takes simply time and the timing for a whole society or country, it takes longer.</p>
<p>In addition, in the last few elections MPRP was reported to be giving $4-5 to old people before elections day, elections fraud for vote counting as well as moving large amount of voters from one province to another by bus, and false attractive promises.</p>
<p>Also there are the children of MPRP leaders who are taking the advantage of their parents to study abroad without competition in public. Some old MPRP members are still loyal to the name of MPRP no matter how much its goal has changed. MPRP name, elections irregularities, and gainers from MPRP and loyal followers give support for MPRP. That's what I understand from the situation. <a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemonhead_a5b0.html" title="User:Lemonhead">Lemonhead</a> 19:52, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Academic Challenger,</p>
<p>Thank you. I just saw your edit. You did a wonderful job for editing as NPOV for the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Nambaryn_Enkhbayar_30f1.html" title="Nambaryn Enkhbayar">Nambaryn Enkhbayar</a> article. I think you are one of the best editors in English wikipedia.</p>
<p>Similar events of demonstrations are happening both in Nepal and in Mongolia demanding the resignation of Nepalese king and Mongolia's president &amp; government, however, international news is covering only Nepal. When some more developments come up in English news about Mongolia and the object, may be we continue to extend the article. I agree with you over that.</p>
<p>About phrasing the expression of others I also agree with you.</p>
<p>About Latebird, on February 24 he kept posting false elevated paragraphs about Miyeegombo Enkhbold and kept deleting negative facts about him. I reverted that several times in <a href="../../../m/i/y/Miyeegombo_Enkhbold_c176.html" title="Miyeegombo Enkhbold">Miyeegombo Enkhbold</a> article. You went in and changed the article into NPOV, I think. From that I try to begin to see the logic of Latebird's these actions. Perhaps he meant well, but it was not logical to keep posting not logical data about Miyeegombo Enkhbold as he got Master's degree in 1987 when the timing and place was impossible, and conflicting dates and tons of different positions which he kept changing in the article for Enkhbold's early careers etc. About his location, I found it from my search. In general, I don't care whoever Latebird is. Only thing is I want wikipedia not to contain false info, therefore, I began to contribute for accuracy of articles about things that I found conflicting comparing to other sources.

<p>Hello. Will you please go to every religon's article page where they define what "spirit" means to that particular religion and insert this line which you inserted into the thetan article, please? "There is no scientific evidence that indicates the existence of an individual as a spirit or, after death, as a ghost."

<p>Dear Academic Challenger, I also try to edit article for facts. Why do you think I am making personal attacks? The first person who is claiming and talking badly about Lemonhead is Latebird. If Academic Challenger, you think you are a good editor, why are you siding with Latebird talking we? You are POV youSya rself. So you can't be good editor. Why Latebird is covering up negative facts of Miyeegombo Enkhbold in favor of Miyeegombo Enkhbold and try to defame Democratic Party people including <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mendsaikhan_Enkhsaikhan_e7f7.html" title="Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan">Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan</a> by reportedly editing the text to look him bad/ <a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemonhead_a5b0.html" title="User:Lemonhead">Lemonhead</a> 14:27, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> is attacking me now. I suggested Latebird can be either Miyeegombo Enkhbold is 1/ Latebird's idol or 2/ his relative or whoever bribed him and gained illegal financial gain. But common sense is nobody idolize someone who is lower than the person. So, I assume Latebird belong to the second category, and according to wikipedia policy it is prohibited to contribute an article by the relative. <a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemonhead_a5b0.html" title="User:Lemonhead">Lemonhead</a> 14:47, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Academic Challenger,</p>
<p>I researched on your edits and found out that you like positions of people in politics. There is smaller commonality between you and user Latebird that you both like positions. I observed from your edits that you both focus mostly on positions, titles of people such as deputy president, prime minister, chairman of department so on. I focus on the outcomes of people's work and deed to society to other people rather than their position. I guess our difference begins from here. Therefore, we are arguing a lot.</p>
<p>Academic Challenger, you first created article in wikipedia on <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsakhiagiyn_Elbegdorj_05b6.html" title="Tsakhiagiyn Elbegdorj">Tsakhiagiyn Elbegdorj</a> after he became prime minister and there are hundreds of edits by people since that time. But your own created article about Elbegdorj, he "made revolution by standing on chair" doesn't sound realistic. I don't think revolution is so tiny or easy as simply done by talking from standing on chair. You didn't cite that and your POV begins from there. But it looks like that text long been changed since. If you see revolution history, you will see what I mean.</p>
<p>About your suggestion that I am a relative or employee of Elbegdorj, Hallalouya!! I wish I were but unfortunately not. I want to become an apprentice of Elbegdorj if it is possiible and to learn from him doing lots of great works to society in the shortest period of time especially his speed. If he or his office ever reads this, or anyone who knows how to approach him please advise me for how to apply. I consider <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsakhiagiyn_Elbegdorj_05b6.html" title="Tsakhiagiyn Elbegdorj">Tsakhiagiyn Elbegdorj</a> is a living legend and since nobody today has a chance to be a student from other legends such as Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, and Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
<p>For <a href="../../../m/i/y/Miyeegombo_Enkhbold_c176.html" title="Miyeegombo Enkhbold">Miyeegombo Enkhbold</a>'s case, his work has lots of controversies towards society from land related corruption to illegally overthrowing Elbegdorj's government and took the prime minister's position. However, Academic Challenger and Latebird it looks like you both love the position of him rather than what he did to people as forcing poor families to leave their land with arrogance using his position only. Therefore, whoever, keeps deleting the facts no matter whether it is negative or positive, that person should have a reason.</p>
<p>That is what I meant. <a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemonhead_a5b0.html" title="User:Lemonhead">Lemonhead</a> 16:29, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello! I see that you've also kindly volunteered to help with Admin Coaching. I'm not sure if you had any particular ideas in mind for what to do (if so feel free to go ahead!). Knowledge Seeker asked me what I wanted, and I replied saying any general feedback on how I'm doing would be good. See <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html#Admin_Coaching" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">here</a>. I suggested there that I set up a subpage in my userspace to keep all this stuff together, as there are three of us involved it would probably might life simpler rather than spreading things out over all our talk pages.

<dd>I don't want to rush it, but I keep coming across situations were admin tools would be rather handy. For example I've been doing quite a lot of work on <a href="../../../r/f/i/WP%7ERFI_2cc3.html" title="WP:RFI">WP:RFI</a> recently, and whilst there is quite a lot I can do there it would be nice to have that final resort of 'block'; as well as all the other fancy anti-vandalism stuff that comes with the mop. So what I'm basically saying is would you mind taking another look at my <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_AC_87a0.html" title="User:Petros471/AC">AC</a> page to add any further feedback, and maybe an indication as to when to go for RfA (after sorting out any other suggestions you come up with first of course!).

<p>When you told me that my article was nonsense, I was at first offended. Then, two things crossed ny mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>You had to have been on the Charles Edward Cheese article to have insulted it.</li>
<li>You treated it as nonsense because it was harsh on Chuck E. Cheese.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing this info, I have come to the conclusion that you <b>are</b> Chuck E. Cheese. Deleting my article that put you in a bad light was only part one of your evil plan to take over the universe! You don't want any internet sites from stopping you in your universal conquest. hanks to people like me, the whole world will not have to learn to speak Cheesish. 1028 22:47, 29 March 2006.</p>

<p>By the way, the Wikipedia definition for nonsense is</p>
<ul>
<li>Total nonsense - i.e. text or random characters that have no assignable meaning at all. This includes things like "1`- 5bl[9 1vn]304 0=10am[0v9a1 7", where random keys of the keyboard have been pressed.</li>
<li>Content that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to make any sense of it whatsoever.</li>
</ul>
<p>My IQ is 162 and I was able to understand the main idea of the CEC article&#160;: Chuck E. Cheese is very insane. So next time you accuse something of being nonsense, think first. -1028</p>

<p>Hi. You deleted the article Geirut, which was a redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversion_to_Judaism_06dd.html" title="Conversion to Judaism">Conversion to Judaism</a>. It's a common spelling and it seems that if someone enters that, that's the only thing they're loking for. Is there a problem with creating such a wikipedia page? Since this seems like important Wikipedia information can you please post your reply on my talk page?

<p>First of all, thanks for telling me that it's proper to add new posts to the bottom. Secondly, I made <a href="../../../g/e/i/Geirut.html" title="Geirut">Geirut</a> is that better? I guess I just had a brain far or something if I forgot to enter redirect. Thanks for catching it. By the way, I see a lot of stuff in the deletion log that looks interesting. Is there a way to see archived copies of deleted articles. Not even so I can recreate them or anything but for example if I want to get a good look at a vanity page.

<p>Greetings. I recently added an external link to the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcata%2C_California_d029.html" title="Arcata, California">Arcata,_California</a> page and it appears you reverted it practically instantaneously. I'm wondering why... The link was to a local (to Arcata) non-profit group - <a href="http://theplacebo.net/" class="external text" title="http://theplacebo.net/" rel="nofollow">The Placebo</a> - that I saw had been mentioned in the article. There is no Wikipedia article on the group, which is fine, but since someone mentioned it, I thought it would be helpful to have a link for more information. Directly after I made the change, I edited the "Talk" page to explain what I was doing, but you don't seem to have responded to me there. So, is there a problem with my edit? And if so, may I ask what it is? Thanks _dao (member of The Placebo which now has a Wikipedia account) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheplacebo_df1c.html" title="User:Theplacebo">the placebo</a> 03:52, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please forgive me for the rude edits I have made recently. I have just read the vandalism article, and I want to help maintian the site's integrity. Please allow the recreation of the new "Ben Foster" page. Ben Foster is a campus politician who opposes an organization called The Machine. If you still do not believe Ben Foster is a relevant Wikipedia topic, I strongly encourage you to read the Wikipedia article entitled "The Machine," and perhaps then you will have a better understanding of the cause.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is another article I have not yet read. What criteria determines whether or not something deserves a Wikipedia Page? I certainly think the topics on the Ben Foster page would serve the greater good far more than a Wikipedia page such as "Shock Sites." If you still do not think this to be a noteworthy cause, I again encourage you to read the article entitled "The Machine."</p>

<p>It seems to me that it would serve the greater good to begin compiling the information on a person as they rise in prominence. While Ben may not pass all of those tests, I think there would be merit in allowing the creation of the page.</p>
<p><a name="Just_a_few_more_thoughts..." id="Just_a_few_more_thoughts..."></a></p>

<p>Again, I may have misunderstood, but I think one criterion that would merit a page is whether or not someone would want information on the person 100 years from now. I know I am currently studying the politicians who lost their respective races for governor of Alabama. One can lose a prominent race for governor and still be relevant 100 years later. It seems to me one can learn as much from losing campaigns as from winning them. I use this as an example to suggest the relevance of individuals today. If John Doe pledges to run for governor in twenty years, his rise to prominence (and the worthiness of his wikipedia page) is defensible. While I understand the importance of having Watchdogs for Wikipedia, I am fearful that current edits by your colleagues could result in the hampering of free speech. As the Wikipedia guidelines suggest, the judging of a person's notoriety is "contentious." I personally feel that any accurate information should not be hindered from being put on Wikipedia. The facts I had posted about Ben before you cleaned the page and accused me of vandalism could have been checked on the University of Alabama website.</p>
<p><a name="You.27re_right..." id="You.27re_right..."></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/User_talk%7EAcademic_Challenger_Archive2_ebfd.html" title="Edit section: You're right...">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">You're right...</span></h2>
<p>You're right. Wikipedia can not allow a page for every person with a bright future. It would create far too many pages for you and your colleagues to review. However, how can one limit free speech by setting standards to contribute accurate information to a "free" commnuity of learning? Setting crieria for a person to have a page makes Wikipedia like a country club. In essence, it is elitist in nature. And elitism is one of the reasons why The Machine has a choke hold on the University of Alabama and the state's politics.</p>
<p><a name="Perhaps..." id="Perhaps..."></a></p>

<p>Perhaps then one day our society will advance to the point where we do have access to online encycolpedias that are both completely open to the public while still remaining dedicated to the truth. I know encyclopedias are elitist in nature, and I know that Wikipedia is much less elitist than the Brittannicas of the world. However, Wikipedia could be even less elitist if those of you so highly dedicated to the project were firmly dedicated to broadening its scope. I know it will do nothing to garner a page for Ben, but I still think documentation of eeven the simplest of a person's accomplishments could serve the greater good more than an article on "Monsterism" which educates people on the satirical religion of spaghetti monsterism. As far as free spech goes, while the United States is one of the few nations that guarantees it, I feel that it is an inherent right. It is true, in parts of our world, people are not able to excersice this right. However, I firmly believe the Internet should not be a place that denies that right.</p>

If you feel like editing and writing more articles, that's great, but if you feel like policy discussion, reverting vandalism, or speedy deletions and new pages patrol, (those last two are my own favorite tasks which need some more admins to help out) that is also great. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Academic Challenger</a> 22:05, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Don't worry about it- if I was desperate for the extra support I could have messaged you (think I might have got away with that as you were nominator). I thought you hadn't, either because you didn't realise that you could vote as well as nominate (seems a bit strange in a way that you do, I mean if you've nominated it's petty obvious you support!), or because of what you said. I haven't been able to do much so far, what with Wikipedia servers being down so much, followed by my internet going down. Now just to make sure I don't flip and go on a deletion rampage...

<p>Yes, I know I am rephrasing... but it's only because I totally agree with the person who said it before me: Please have a little consideration - how about asking whether something that has existed about 30 seconds is under development before you delete it? I'm not experimenting, the Sally edit is for educational purposes, I'd be really thankful if you don't delete what on your own personal criteria is non-sense, have consideration please, we're not trying to affect anyone here.</p>

<p>Of course it's about real people, why on earth would i make fictional characters, i have more important things to do... Are they famous? Obviously not to you or in your context, but they are notable for something, just have in mind that i cannot edit that much work in a few minutes, you should know it's really not that easy, i have school to get done with, i have construction work, as in archit. construction site, and many other responsibilities to dedicate 2,3,4 hours of my day to finish a whole article. Please have a little consideration, i know you can understand.</p>

<p>you know what i think... you don't respect freedom of speech and you for some reason believe you're great... i bet there are a thousand more people thinking you're a total jerk. You like having power on the internet... sorry... a very very very small portion of the internet, very very small, petite... well that is the only place where you can have power, in the real world... well who cares about you? Thanks for letting me know what the deal is here in the wikipedia, i honestly don't mind if i don't get that article, but i do like to speak my mind... well, there it is then. au revoir, govno jedno. ask a serbian what that last means.</p>

<p>I have a question about editing article, because My editings have been reverted. In yesterday, I added the definition of Suggestion on article <i>Suggestion</i>, but It was deleted today. I think that other wikipedian considers vandalism. Even I didn't put nonsense information on that. So, Does article have to be good information? Is definition of Suggestion necessary for good article on <i>Suggestion</i>? or not? I think that it would be good for making article better. I hope that other wikipedian accept my edition. So, Please Send me message. Ok? cheers. Have a great day. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel5127_dec3.html" title="User:Daniel5127">DANIEL89</a> 05:42, 24 April 2006(UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks AC. Thanks a lot for your good natured patience and understanding.</p>
<p>The club is actually just starting out and having spent only a few minutes browsing around WikipediA, I am starting to realize that it is an encyclopedia and as such would unlikely create whole pages about clubs themselves.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most appropriate (if that) would be a single entry in the Outside links section of <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikola_Tesla_c53c.html" title="Nikola Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a> page that would take the reader to a privately hosted www.mediawiki.com</p>
<p>While one of the purposes of the club will be how to get patents and how to commercialize their inventions, the club will be creating pages (somewhere) with valuable original content as well as "executive summaries" laced with useful WikipediA pages and or outside links.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Thanks again, Frank</p>

<p>I note that you deleted these redirects and then recreated them.

<li>I restored the redirects I had created and found that (as I remembered), the number signs were there. I also tested the redirects after I created them to ensure they worked properly. I'm not sure what you were looking at. Just a note: if you find a problem with an article, it is never a good idea to delete it and recreate it. First, Wikipedia has some fairly stringent rules about deleting anything, and second, deleting an article also deletes its history, which is a Very Bad Thing. Not to worry, though - in this case, no harm was done (except for the loss of the history of these, which is no big loss to me). <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 00:06, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As you might recall from a couple weeks aago , we had made a truce It stated "*4. Don't delete Kaleb Marshall's article or the Le Crap article" Yet, when I went to the discussion page for deleting the Le Crap article, I saw this written on it "If Wikipedia existed in the early twentieth century and you posted an article about Picaso before he became famous, or if anyone else did, it should have been deleted because it is impossible tl tell for sure who will be a famous artist or musician. Someone would eventually notice this article, and only good articles should be in Wikipedia. Academic Challenger 21:53, 1 April 2006 (UTC)". Not only did you complain about the LE Crap Article, but it was deleted. Unless you can prove to me that the deleter was not you, I am not doing my share of the truce. 1028 00:47, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
