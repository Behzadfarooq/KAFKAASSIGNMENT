The name of the ancient city (derived from the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acanthus_%28genus%29.html" title="Acanthus (genus)">acanthus</a> bush) is due to the thorny nature of the area or to the thorny nature of the town's foundation.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Acanthus_%28city%29.html" title="Edit section: Foundation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Foundation</span></h3>
<p>It was founded by <a href="../../../7/t/h/7th_century_BCE_7159.html" title="7th century BCE">7th century BCE</a> (the archaeology suggests <a href="../../../6/5/5/655_BCE_885f.html" title="655 BCE">655 BCE</a>) by <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_colony.html" title="Greek colony">colonists</a> from <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andros.html" title="Andros">Andros</a>. <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutarch.html" title="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, on the other hand, refered to it as a mixed colony of Andrians and local Halkideans, which was founded on the "Coast of Drakontos", in place of a preexisting civilization. He tells the following story of the foundation, that settlers from Andros and Halkida arrived on the shore at the same time. The natives of Acanthus, seeing the crowed of settlers, became frightened and left the city. The settlers sent an explorer each to see what had happened and, as they approached the city and realized it was empty, ran to be the first to take over the land for their fellow countryman. The Halkidian was the fastest but the Andrian, seeing he was losing, stopped and threw his spear on the walls gate, before his opponent arrived. A court case followed, which was won by the Andrians, because as they protested, they had just about taken over the city first.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Acanthus_%28city%29.html" title="Edit section: Growth">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Growth</span></h3>
<p>Its growth during the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaic_period_in_Greece_f7ad.html" title="Archaic period in Greece">Archaic period</a> is reflected by the wide circulation of its currency, first minted around <a href="../../../5/3/0/530_BCE_5a4d.html" title="530 BCE">530 BCE</a> with the distinctive emblem of a lion killing a bull – an allusion to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herodotus.html" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>’s account (vii. 125) that on the march of Xerxes from Acanthus to Therme, lions seized the camels which carried the provisions - at least 92 different types of coins have been found. Its economic resources emanated from the mining and wood from the nearby forests, but also through agricultural and vegetable goods that were transported through the sizable harbour.</p>
<p>The first historical reference, in <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thuycidides.html" title="Thuycidides">Thuycidides</a>, from mid-6th century BC, connects the city with the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Wars_76fa.html" title="Persian Wars">Persian Wars</a>, during which the townsfolk officially welcomed the Persians and willingly helped with the digging of the canal for <a href="../../../x/e/r/Xerxes.html" title="Xerxes">Xerxes</a>, <a href="../../../4/8/0/480_BCE_6a51.html" title="480 BCE">480 BCE</a>, for which Xerxes richly rewarded them. They declared one of his relatives who died in the area, named Artahei, a hero, and willingly took part in the expedition against Greece. After the Persian wars Acanthus became a member of the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athenian_Empire_b197.html" title="Athenian Empire">Athenian Alliance</a>. In <a href="../../../4/2/4/424_BCE_a364.html" title="424 BCE">424 BCE</a>, after a short siege by <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brasidas.html" title="Brasidas">Brasidas</a> and a threat to destroy their profitable vineyards, Acanthus joined the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Spartans</a>. The name of the ancient city (derived from the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acanthus_%28genus%29.html" title="Acanthus (genus)">acanthus</a> bush) is due to the thorny nature of the area or to the thorny nature of the town's foundation.</p>

<p>During the establishment of the Halkidiki Alliance, the townsfolk refused to join it, in part due to the old quarrel with the Halkidians. Under threat from the Halkidians, Acanthus called in Sparta's help, which came in <a href="../../../3/8/2/382_BCE_30e1.html" title="382 BCE">382 BCE</a> when the Spartans and Acanthians captured and destroyed <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olynthos.html" title="Olynthos">Olynthos</a> and the alliance, at least temporarily. Acanthus's staying-out of the alliance meant that in <a href="../../../3/4/8/348_BCE_4eaa.html" title="348 BCE">348 BCE</a>, when it was conquered by the Macedonians, it was not destroyed. Later it was incorporated to the region of Ouranoupolis, a new city that was founded by Alexarhos (<a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassander.html" title="Cassander">Cassander</a>'s brother), in the isthmus, between the Strimonic and the Siggitiko gulfs.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livy.html" title="Livy">Livy</a>, Acanthus was attacked by a Roman-Pergamene fleet in <a href="../../../1/9/9/199_BCE_20e3.html" title="199 BCE">199 BCE</a> during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Macedonian_War_2d52.html" title="Second Macedonian War">Second Macedonian War</a> and then besieged, captured and sacked by Rome in <a href="../../../1/6/8/168_BCE_48ce.html" title="168 BCE">168 BCE</a>. A little later, it was reestablished as a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_colony.html" title="Roman colony">Roman colony</a> of legionary veterans.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Acanthus_%28city%29.html" title="Edit section: Roman period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Roman period</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> later exploited all the natural sources of wealth and its harbour, and the town continued through the Roman and <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> period. Around the start of the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_century.html" title="1st century">1st century</a>, Acanthus's renaming began, with its name translated into the Latin <i>Ericius</i>, from which was derived its Byzantine and modern name of Ierissos or Erissos.</p>
<p><a name="As_Ierissos" id="As_Ierissos"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Acanthus_%28city%29.html" title="Edit section: As Ierissos">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">As Ierissos</span></h3>
<p>During the Byzantine era Erissos was the seat of a <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishopric.html" title="Bishopric">bishopric</a>, evidenced from <a href="../../../8/8/3/883.html" title="883">883</a>. From the <a href="../../../1/0/t/10th_century.html" title="10th century">10th century</a> onwards, the town's history is indissolubly linked with that of Mount Athos. In <a href="../../../9/4/2/942.html" title="942">942</a> there were disputes between Ierissos and the monks of Mount Athos over the borders between Ierissos and the monastic community's lands and, <a href="../../../9/4/3/943.html" title="943">the following year</a>, the differences were settled in person by a large commission of major politicians and church officials.</p>
<p>In the summer of <a href="../../../1/4/2/1425.html" title="1425">1425</a> Ierissos came into the hands of the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Turks</a>. During that time the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venetians</a>, starting from <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassandreia.html" title="Cassandreia">Cassandreia</a>, landed on the coastline of Ierissos, burnt down Ierissos (by then only a large village) and its surroundings and (on departure) set alight the castle and five towers. In <a href="../../../1/8/2/1821.html" title="1821">1821</a> Ierissos took part in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_War_of_Independence_9b18.html" title="Greek War of Independence">Greek War of Independence</a> and during the repression the village was burnt down by the Turks and a large number of residents killed.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> the village was destroyed by a powerful <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthquake.html" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a>, with 121 people were killed and approximately 500 injured. After the earthquake the new Ierisso was built in its current position, a little north west of the ancient city.</p>

<p>The ancient city extended along a sheer hillside, about 0.6km south-east of modern Ierissos. Remains of walls, an impressive citadel, and Hellenistic buildings survive, along with a deserted Byzantine church and two post Byzantine churches.</p>
<p><a name="Necropolis" id="Necropolis"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Acanthus_%28city%29.html" title="Edit section: Necropolis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Necropolis</span></h3>
<p>The city itself has not been excavated, but the <a href="../../../n/e/c/Necropolis.html" title="Necropolis">necropolis</a> (graveyard) has, starting in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, since when more than 600 graves have been discovered. Particularly extensive is the sight of the cemetery along the seaside of Ierissos.</p>
<p>The graveyard seems to have been used for a long period, starting from the Archaic period (or perhaps even the 17th century BCE) right up to Roman times and later, perhaps with certain intervals in between each period of time. The graves occur in at least two or three layers, either shallow in the earth, or deeper in the sand, usually parallel with the line of the seashore. The orientation of the dead (that is, skulls of the dead - and the tops of jugs) is, in most cases, southeast.</p>
<p>In Acanthus both adults and children were buried in the same area according to ancient burial customs.Various grave types have been discovered - some are simple dirt holes, others coated with clay or undecorated or painted clay urns, yet others are shaped like boxes, covered in clay or jug-shaped (jug-shaped most probabaly constituted the majority of infant or child burials). The grave goods, usually placed in the graves next to or above the dead, are varied and sometimes in earthen containers. Often they were personal or related to their occupation (such as jewels, pins, buckles, mirrors, weapons - though these are rare - , needles, hooks, bill-hooks, knives or - very often in female and child graves - clay figurines representing various animals, foodstuffs, or human forms, such as actors). Some of the goods are locally made whilst some are from other commercial centres and workshops of the ancient world. Burial customs, and similar types of graves which have been discovered, resemble many other cemeteries in other ancient cities of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrace.html" title="Thrace">Thrace</a>, revealing the connection through trade to so much of the Greek-speaking East as well as to other well-known centres of the Peloponnessus (especially <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evia.html" title="Evia">Evia</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corinth.html" title="Corinth">Corinth</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/o/Viotia.html" title="Viotia">Viotia</a>).</p>
