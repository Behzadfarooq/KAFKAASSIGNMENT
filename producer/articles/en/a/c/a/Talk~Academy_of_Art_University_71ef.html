<dd>A replacement article for a copyvio text should be written on a temp page. Anyway, what is there now is still copyvio from <a href="http://www.academyart.edu/aboutus/mission.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.academyart.edu/aboutus/mission.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. There is nothing in the old article that can be used, as it is all copied from the webpage of the university, and it all has to be rewritten in the temp page. Please restore the copyvio message now. I'll put the template here for the time being. It can then be moved to the temp page. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 29 June 2005 06:28 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes. Sorry. I have not done institutions before, just people. I tried to use the content from my old alma mater, <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute_4b45.html" title="Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute">RPI</a> as a model. I will try harder. I did do some work: I have visit the Academy and took their campus tour and stuff, so I am trying hard to get up to speed on it. I really have to wonder if the Academy has a motto. I will contact the Admissions dept. and find out... <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmorrow_1f6d.html" title="User:Amorrow">Amorrow</a> 29 June 2005 23:16 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I was unclear before. When there is a copyvio, one is supposed to restart the article at a temporary page, like this: Academy of Art University/temp. Later, when the copyvio version is deleted, the new article will be moved into place at the proper title. That way one avoids having copyrighted text in the beginning of the history of the article. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 1 July 2005 03:53 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a frankly bizarre list of issues - almost non of which are true. This school, like any other, has it's weaknesses, but 'reputation' and 'placement rate' really are not amongst them. The standard of teaching is quite phenominal, and facilities second to only a few (far more expensive) private art schools in the US.</p>
<p>Some of this sounds like Academy of Art marketing material. They actually have a terrible reputation (a terrible repuation with who?) . The claim: "the Academy of Art University boasts a high job placement rating upon graduation, with 80% of graduates finding employment in fields related to their majors" needs a cite, preferably from some source other than Academy of Art.</p>
<p>The + 80% placement rate is a figure audited every year for their accreditation. If you would like a site - I'm sure Academy of Art University would be happy to provide one.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I went ahead and deleted that section. I considered changing it to read "the Academy <i>claims</i> a high job placement rating" but couldn't find an obvious source for that, even. If anybody would like to add it back, feel free but please provide a source for the 80% figure, which seems fairly dubious for any art school. -- <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThither_4e00.html" title="User:Thither">thither</a> 09:56, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite their claim to be a "university", Academy of Art is accredited more like a trade school. Compare [<a href="http://www.academyart.edu/majors/accreditation.html" class="external text" title="http://www.academyart.edu/majors/accreditation.html" rel="nofollow">their accrediation list</a>] with [<a href="http://www.back2college.com/library/accreditfaq.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.back2college.com/library/accreditfaq.htm" rel="nofollow">this list of major accreditation agencies</a>].</p>
<p>The Academy of Art University is a for-profit college (like a trade school, but they are accredited). This means, among other things, that students are not protected under Educational Law, but only under Consumer Law. Potential students should consider this carefully.</p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/01/31/60minutes/main670479.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/01/31/60minutes/main670479.shtml" rel="nofollow">A CBS story about a for-profit university</a>] Again, bizarre posting - this school has nothing to do with Academy of Art University.</p>

<p>The age and content of these links leads me to believe you really have it in for this school Larrybob (an ex student who didn't pass their figure drawing class maybe?) [unsigned comment above left by Rebington.]</p>

<p>Not the original author, but decided to clean up and revise content of article to "neutralize" the some of negative bias (in the External links section, most of the links referred to news stories and editorials about same event rather than new information about the school, so I used some of those as references and removed others that duplicate what has been already cited). I've also added sections for some of the content to improve readability (can't find anything on the page if it's a "sea of gray," making the page hard to read) added citations for much of the information mentioned in the article's article original version, and added notes where citations are needed, especially. if I could not find information to substantiate those claims. Finally, I added a Trivia section, and moved one of the links from the External links section to that area. The article should now reflect a bit more balance between information about the school's good and bad points. Hopefully, this article is and will remain in good form for the most part and that its current format is acceptable to everyone. lwalt 23:53, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>FOLLOW-UP....</p>
<p>Did a few more things to correct some things in the article (e.g., correct formats of citations, remove duplicate reference), clarify areas (distinguished accredited programs), and so on. Also, corrected the name of the organization that Rushdie was affiliated with from "PEN Faulkner Association" to "PEN American Center" (source: <a href="http://penusa.org/go/news/comments/campaign-for-reader-privacy-voice-of-america-press-conference" class="external free" title="http://penusa.org/go/news/comments/campaign-for-reader-privacy-voice-of-america-press-conference" rel="nofollow">http://penusa.org/go/news/comments/campaign-for-reader-privacy-voice-of-america-press-conference</a>). Thanks to the previous editor who helped improve the article! lwalt 17:29, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Article content was heavily redacted during Illustrator12's edits between 19-21 March 2007. Specifically, ALL negative information was pared away, and what was left sounded as if it was written by a PR firm or marketing department. Illustrator12's only contributions to Wikipedia have been those edits of this page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Without accusing AAU of being responsible for the suspicious edit, I will say that using a Wikipedia page as a brochure or erasing someone else's work in order to bring one's Wikipedia page more into line with one's marketing strategy is dishonest and reproachful. I have reverted the page to lwalt's last edit and sent Illustrator12 a warning on deleting material. <a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynaflow_c9f6.html" title="User:Dynaflow">Dynaflow</a> 06:38, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
