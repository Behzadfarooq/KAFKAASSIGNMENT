<p>Whos time have I taken up? If anyone has time invested it is me. So if you have problems with editing than let someone else do it. I thought a spammer was a cheater or a fake, trying to get something for free by wrong means. Not me, I am the victim check out <a href="http://www.copyscape.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.copyscape.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.copyscape.com/</a> and see for yourself that over 77% of the content is stolen off of my website. It would be higher if I add the cities that I put on the article but that is indeed enough copied content to damage and destroy my website. Please just make it easy on everyone by adding my link or rewriting the article. That is all I ask. I am trying to work this out in a civilized manner and giving you all the chances in the world to make this right. This is costing me hundreds of dollars daily not including my business hours and being logged.

<p>As posted by this user on their respective talk page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm sure it would be immensely helpful to you for me to give you that information. However, I'd like you to prove that I inserted any false information into Wiki at all. Give me proof that I have done such a thing and then I will consider your request legitimized. Here's the thing about that: You can't prove it. You can't prove it because IPs shift so rapidly that tracing anyone to any one IP is about as effective as matching a suspect to the clothes he was wearing six months ago. Here's the second thing about that: I'd estimate twenty to fifty percent of the information contained in the Wiki to be at least inaccurate, and ten to thirty to be completely false. Why is this the case, you ask? Because of people like you. When you edit a page from Wiki, where are you getting this information? From TLC, Discovery or the History Channel? From a professor your were lectured by last week? Your cache of personal opinions? Your imagination? <b>Wikipedia is simply an aggregiously over-organized version of "I read it on the Internet."</b> It is IMHO one of the most criminal sources of information on the web, simply because it is touted as being strictly policed and fanatically patrolled by it's "user base". It is widely accepted by the common folk as a source of accurate information and is advertised as so by most media outlets. Simply because the cops in my town are just your average joe doesn't make it any more secure than the next town. In fact, this is how the mafia gets started, politicians become corrupt, and governments oppress their populations. Wikipedia is the precursor to Orwellian History.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that there are no admissions to vandalism in any of my edits or contributions, as I could very well be lying. After all, if I <b>am</b> that type of "scum" who would dare do such a thing, how can you trust any of my words?

<p>Dear Sir, I approach you upon the advice of another editor<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Rumpelstiltskin223#Please_stop..." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Rumpelstiltskin223#Please_stop..." rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<dd>First of all I've made more than "one good edit", so you are making deceptive comments. I poked fun at a user on the chat page, and I apologized for that. You are turning this into a vendetta and wikistalking me. All my subsequent edits have been valid and done "in good faith". I am not blanking Human penis size, I am making what I think are valid edits! I asked you many times to go to the TALK page, but you simply roll back my edits as you have done on multiple other pages without even seeing what they were. Of course I scolded you when you kept reverting edits; as did others. I say again you are turning this into something personal and are indeed wikistalking me now. Just go away. FYI, I didn't use another ip address "to work around it". My IP is dynamic, so when I turn off my computer it resets. Maybe you should turn off your computer sometimes too.....

<p>I am a former alumni of Pretoria Boys High School and noticed you put Eugene Ashton back into the list of "Notable Alumni"... He does not deserve the credit that so many other Old Boys deserve, to say the least. I attended the school at the same time he did and he certainly does not warrant such distinction. I could name a few other very notable alumni who deserve to be up there so much more than Eugene Ashton. He was not even a prefect at that school.</p>

<p>Note that he is a "convicted pederast"... does that tell you something? Anyone can go and create their own profile on wikipedia and make themselves "famous". I have nothing against having his name on the Pretoria Boys High School wiki, but if he is a "notable alumni", then I could go ahead and create wikis for a hundred more Old Boys that have accomplished so much more than he has. Do a search on "Eugene Ashton" on Google. Where do I see his poetry? How does this make him a "notable alumni" of having only one poem apparently published in a "journal" in 1998? The only notable thing I know of him doing right now is helping out with the Old Boys Association. If you want more reference, take a look at this website: <a href="http://www.10yearson.co.za/Messages.aspx" class="external free" title="http://www.10yearson.co.za/Messages.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.10yearson.co.za/Messages.aspx</a>, scroll down to the bottom and click page "2", scroll down a little and take a look at his profile. A bloated, beer drinking "notable alumni" - I think not. Reconsider. I think notable alumni should be reserved strictly for notable alumni. Let's not degrade that title.</p>

<p>Hey Academic Challenger, long time no talk. You've locked pages for me in the past before and I was wondering if you could look at the article <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. We get a huge amount of link-spam and other forms of vandalism on a daily basis. The <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVancouver_14fe.html" title="WP:Vancouver">WikiProject Vancouver</a> members have done a fantasic job at reverting these edits, but it would be nice if the article could be semi-protected. Let me know if this is something you can do. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 23:23, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks! If the spamming comes back, is there a chance the article will be able to get a long-term semi protection? <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 23:41, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am going to make you a deal. You let me add Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker on the 24 page (he will be on the show), and I will stop changing all the other pages. But if you don't let me post my information on the 24 pages, I will call all of my friends and tell them to just click random page and vandalize every page. I know that they will be very hard to catch. I know you probably don't negotiate with people like me, but think about it. It will save you trouble. I will be monitoring the page so do not change it back.

<p>I wrote an article entitled Paginationalism, which you labelled nonsense and deleted. According to a Wikipedia article, nonsense is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(Nonsense) falls into two categories: 1. Total nonsense - i.e. text or random characters that have no assignable meaning at all. This includes things like "903a84as42(usar(&amp;^a", where random keys of the keyboard have been pressed. 2. Content that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to make any sense of it whatsoever."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Patent_nonsense" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Patent_nonsense" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't see how my article was completely and irredemably confused, or how no one could make sense of it. And, even if it is a joke, as you claim, what makes your idea of a joke correct? I'm hardly advocating the correctness of the philosophy, so could I say that the article on Jesus is a "joke" because there isn't hard, documented evidence of his existence? Sorry, I don't want to seem a nuisance, I would just like to know why an article that I spent quite a lot of time researching and writing up was immediately removed. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenladen_6377.html" title="User:Benladen">Benladen</a> 04:45, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>First off, I fail to see how a joke article is the same as a nonsense one. That's hardly important though, as my article is, in my opinion (seeing as humor is entirely subjective, and there are a lot of interpretations of what constitutes a joke) not a joke. It contains an element of lightheartedness, to be sure, but the entire thing I assure you is quite real, if almost unknown. My research consisted mostly of confidential interviews, which were very difficult to set up; mostly with pawn brokers and self-proclaimed paginationalists, the few that there are. I didn't get to read anything because I lacked the funds to purchase the one copy (supposedly, at least) I found at a used bookstore, which was stashed away in the back because no one knew of it, and those who did would be more than willing to ask (and, incidentally, pay an exorbitant amount of money).</p>
<p>Would you like me to clean up my article? Shall I take out the humor I attempted to inject into it, would that make you take it more seriously?</p>

<p>So I'll just assume that you have no basis for instantaneously deleting my research, and move on with my life then? I really don't like to sound like such an asshole, I'm sure you can imagine what it would be like if something you took very seriously and spent a lot of time on was just blatantly disregarded by (and I can't believe I'm about to use this term) the powers that be. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenladen_6377.html" title="User:Benladen">Benladen</a> 00:51, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
