The academic boycotts were part of a larger international campaign of "isolation" that eventually included political, economic, cultural and sports boycotts. The academic boycotts ended in 1990 when its stated goal of ending apartheid was achieved. <sup id="_ref-LancasterHaricombe_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LancasterHaricombe" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>During apartheid era, the academic boycotts were debated within anti-apartheid circles as to whether they were ethically justified and and appropriate.<sup id="_ref-LancasterHaricombe_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LancasterHaricombe" title="">[1]</a></sup> Other critics of the boycott were various conservative groups worldwide who "disliked such anti-apartheid initiatives", and campus libertarians who "perceived a loss of academic freedom".<sup id="_ref-BeckettGuardian_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BeckettGuardian" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Subsequent research in the post-apartheid area has claimed that the academic boycotts were more a "symbolic gesture of support" for anti-apartheid efforts rather than a direct influencer of the situation.<sup id="_ref-LancasterHaricombe_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LancasterHaricombe" title="">[1]</a></sup> Additionally, the academic boycott was perceived by the targets of the boycott, South Africa scholars, as unjust and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discriminatory</a>.<sup id="_ref-LancasterHaricombe_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LancasterHaricombe" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="../../../d/e/s/Desmond_Tutu_a927.html" title="Desmond Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a>, a prominent leader within the anti-apartheid, described his clear support for the academic boycott of South Africa. He wrote that it needed to be maintained for institutions which had a bad record in opposing apartheid, but could be lifted for others as the political situation eased. The boycott had "certainly made a number of people sit up and take notice, especially the so-called liberal universities." <sup id="_ref-Tutu_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tutu" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<dd>"They thought that just as a matter of right they would find acceptance because they were allowing blacks into their establishments. I mustn't belittle them too much, I think that they did stand up for academic freedom and so forth, but I don't think myself actually that they were sufficiently vigorous and the boycott helped to knock sense into their heads, to realise that they did have a role in seeking to undermine that vicious system [of apartheid]."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"I would, I think, now still say that we maintain [the academic boycott] insofar as, if for instance academics from here want to go to South Africa then you want to look at who is inviting them.

But I would say that as things begin to ease up, this ought perhaps to be one of the first of the constraints that goes to give some of these people the reward."</dd>

<p>Opponents from within anti-Apartheid circles "argued that ideas and knowledge should be treated differently than tangible commodities, that obstacles to information access could actually hurt the victims of apartheid (for example, retard medical research and, ultimately, reduce the quality of health care), and that an academic boycott (in contrast to economic, trade, or political boycott) would not even be noticed by the South African government. Change is much more likely to occur by providing information than by withholding it." <sup id="_ref-LancasterHaricombe_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LancasterHaricombe" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>"Such a boycott would cut a university off from its life blood, the nurturing flow of ideas....

<p>Solomon Benatar, a critic, wrote that "Academic boycott has been justified as an appropriate political strategy in the struggle against the oppression of apartheid.

This alternative proposal was criticized because of both "the practical problems of implementation" and that "it implicitly endorsed the idea that political views are valid determinants of who should attend scholarly meetings, whose work should be published, and so on."<sup id="_ref-LancasterHaricombe_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LancasterHaricombe" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The academic boycott of South Africa is frequently invoked as a model for more recent efforts to organize academic boycotts of Israel.<sup id="_ref-BeckettGuardian_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BeckettGuardian" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some invoke the comparison to claim that an academic boycott of Israel should not be controversial based a misconception that the academic boycott of South Africa was uncontroversial and straightforward. The reality, at the time, was very different. The effort was the subject of significant criticism and contentious debate from diverse segments. Andrew Beckett writes, in the Guardian, on this frequent mistaken comparison:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In truth, boycotts are blunt weapons. Even the most apparently straightforward and justified ones, on closer inspection, have their controversies and injustices."<sup id="_ref-BeckettGuardian_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BeckettGuardian" title="">[2]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Other, such as Hillary and Stephen Rose in <i>Nature</i>, make the comparison and argue for an academic boycott of Israel based on a belief that the academic boycott of South Africa was effective in ending apartheid. George Fink responds to this claim in a letter to <i>Nature</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The assertion [...] that the boycott of South Africa by the world's academic communities 'was instrumental in ending apartheid in South Africa' is a deception.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Apartheid was actually terminated by two pivotal and interrelated political events. First, the United States Congress, on 29 September 1986, overrode President Reagan's veto and imposed strict economic sanctions on South Africa. Second, F. W. de Klerk was elected president of South Africa on 14 September 1989. Two months later (16 November 1989), de Klerk announced the scrapping of the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separate_Amenities_Act_3025.html" title="Separate Amenities Act">Separate Amenities Act</a>, then, on 11 February 1990, freed Nelson Mandela from prison. The rest is historical detail."</dd>
