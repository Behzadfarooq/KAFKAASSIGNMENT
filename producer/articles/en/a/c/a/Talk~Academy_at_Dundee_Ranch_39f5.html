<p>The following content was completely unreferenced, so I did not restore it. If a reference is available, this material could be cleaned up and re-added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some detainees arrived tricked by their families but parents are advised to use a teen escort company. Because passport is necessary, parents were advised to use an escort service due to the paperwork. Level system The program consisted of six levels. New detainees started at level 1, which has no privileges of any kind. They were followed round the clock by a junior staff member (A detainne on level 4 to 6). They had to show good behaviour and attend a number of seminars in order to be voted up to the next level by their fellow detainees and therapists. They were given a full physical examination and a school assessment, and they were given an individual educational program, which they began working on immediately. At first, no phone calls were allowed, but parents and detainees may write letters to each other. Children were put into small groups, and each parent had an assigned time to speak with the group leader once a week for a half hour to discuss their child's progress.<br />
<br />
Once Level 3 was achieved, a detainee was given phone privileges home as well as more privileges at the school, on and off the campus. Levels 4 through 6 built on the foundations of the first three levels, adding new responsibilities and role reversal situations, with detainees working closely with kids coming in new to the program. Their education as a staff member was based solely on their own experiences in the program.<br />
<br />
Consequences<br />
<br />
Negative behaviour was addressed at once. Because there were only staff employed which talked spanish any talk in english outside group therapy were regarded as negative behaviour. Detainees, which had not spoken one word in spanish before they arrived were punished until they learned the language.<br />
<br />
Punishment consist of being restrained, guide to a room where they forced to lie down on a cement floor on their stomach for hours. Detainees, which continued to resist the program, could be transferred to a more harsh facility like High Impact (where detainees were kept in dog cages and forced to eat their vomit, if they had problems with food) or Tranquility Bay.</p>

<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O.P. was shorthand for a punishment called "observational placement." Day after day, while other students went to classes and watched educational videos, Joel was ordered to the observational placement room - a small, former bathhouse with a hard tile floor. There, he was forced to stand with his nose an inch from the wall, hour after hour, with only short breaks. At other times, Joel was made to kneel, nose-to-the-wall, hands behind his back, as if he were under arrest. The kneeling bruised his knees. More noticeable than the bruises, though, was the weight Joel was losing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the many forms Joel's parents had signed before sending him to Costa Rica had given the academy staff permission to restrain Joel in extreme circumstances, for example, if he endangered himself or someone else. In the observational placement room, Joel learned what was meant by "restrain." Joel was seized by male staff members more than a dozen times - once for striking a guard and the rest for minor offenses such as talking. Each time, Joel lay on his stomach while a guard pressed a knee into his back and wrenched his arms back toward his head. "You'd scream," Joel said. "Everybody screamed." He fought the urge. As he felt his arms jerked behind him, Joel would tell himself: Don't let your enemy hear you scream. Before you know it, it will be over. Garner said that as she studied in the classroom, she could hear the shrieks of fellow students coming from the observational placement room some 50 yards away. In her view, the practice "was like torturing people into being good." Students were restrained only as a last resort, said Ken Kay, president of the association to which Dundee Ranch belonged. But Knight, the academy's former director, disagreed, saying that restraint "was commonly used as an intimidation technique, not as a last resort."</p>
