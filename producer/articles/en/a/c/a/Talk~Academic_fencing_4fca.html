<p>the origin of the Burschenschaften (B!) was not only comradeship, but it had a real politcal background: in 1813 it was a revolutionary movement for the union of Germany (against feudalism and the many many tiny states that disenabled a strong german policy). the students - being protagonists of the elite of the society, were fighting in these groups for freedom of thought and political influence of the citizens.</p>
<p>over the years the political directions got adapted to the changes of history - f.e. the B! in the eastern regions of the empire (Silesia etc.) got more important when those regions were in danger, many B! of our time have names that remind of those lost territories. During Third Reich they got technically eliminated and had to surrender fully to German Students Union. Of course many continued their work in the shade. The B! had many losses of lives during their history and monuments remind of those times (Eisenach, Jena etc.)</p>
<p>note that even Theodor Herzl (the founder of Israel) and Viktor Adler (and others) were members of very extreme nationalistic B! . but of course many famous non-jews were in B! as well. this I mention because in today's Germany/Austria the socialists try to emerge a certain nazism out of the B! in general (by "genetical reasons" one could almost say...), but these people don't know about those famous jewish-members (or they don't want to know).</p>
<p>as there are many B! in Austria and Germany, they have a wide political horizon (but always being conservative) - some are christian (Kartellverband), some are rather supporting the nobels (Corps-Studenten) others are truly German-national, which is getting important in Austria before (and after) WW I, when the torso of the Habsburg empire was without orientation and many of the german-ethnical citizens wanted to unite with Wilhemine empire.</p>
<p>those with the Mensur (duells) are the German-national orientated ("Schlagende Verbindungen"). they see the Mensur as a ritual/test for manhood, bravery and discipline. to become a "Bursche" one has to run through several, strictly defined states/positions, each student has to do several Mensuren, which are as well strictly regulated.</p>
<p>besides that the B! support the students during their period at the university, the houses (they all have very nice old houses, where the boys can stay for less money) are meeting points for communications of all kinds. the seniors (Altherren) help along as much as they can, as well with jobs etc.</p>
<p>they wear their ribbon and their kepi, each B! has it’s own traditional colours. Many ribbons are black-red-gold, to manifest their support of the great-german solution (Großdeutsche Lösung) in opposition to those wearing the black-white-red ribbon – but this would lead too far into german historical details.</p>
<p>all of these things are private, no public is allowed, women are only present during public-days, feasts, balls etc. there are also girls-groups (Mädelschaft), but these are rather groups for communication etc.</p>
<p>all in all the B! are one last bastion of "good old Germany", they are of course very conservative and they try to offer the youngsters something beyond Mc-Fat and Coca Cola…</p>
<p>needless to say that the socialists tried to turn that down several times and the so called anti-fascistic-groups try to disturb conferences organised by the B! (ILSA, 16.4.06)</p>

<p>what is the difference between Austrian and German B!? the Austrians are known to be tougher: each Mensur is strictly regulated, the duellants have their "servants" etc. (I think one has 3 or 4 adjutants (taking care of the gauntlet, the protective clothes/coat of mail, the wounds etc. ), a doctor must be present etc. and each one has his judge, who takes care of the duell and the health of his "paukant" (=the duelling guy). the Austrian judges are known to go to the very end, whereas the germans often break up in the middle, before it's getting too hard.</p>
<p>needles to say that the scars are worn with pride - and the opponent is fully respected.(ILSA, 16.4.06)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No idea where you get your information from but all those rules and regulations appply to the Mensur in Germany as well. Have you even seen a Mensur in Germany? As to being tougher: I've heard wild claims about Austrian fraternity students duelling with sabres and guns but as far as I can see, those are urban legends. A schmiss just shows that either the other guy was better or you made a stupid mistake.

<p>Otto Skorzeny's Schmiss is a very famous one, but could someone add some mensur-pics on here? there are plenty in the net (don't know how to do that). (ILSA, 16.4.06)</p>

<p>It's also praticed in the Baltic countries an Poland again I think.</p>
<p>I am not happy with the following part:</p>
<p>"The scar resulting from a hit is called a Schmiss (German for a "smite"), or Renommierschmiss (bragging scar), and is regarded as a badge of honor: a form of ritual scarification Wounds are typically sewn up rather crudely, in order to provoke scarring."</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Otto Skorzeny</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A Schmiss is still some form of honor badge but they aren't collected anymore as it was usual in earlier times, most students will accept them but aren't keen on getting one. Fighting has become more defensive. Also nowadays the wounds are treated with more care and exessive scarring isn't usually provoked (that would be in fact most unusual).</p>

<dd>Hi, I am Rabe!, the German main author of the German "mensur" article, now represented in the English Wikipedia as well. This Otto Skorzeny has to be taken out of the article. His biography says that he was heavily injured during the war by an artillery shell destroying his face. These scars visible in the image look like a war injury and absolutely not like a "Schmiss" from Mensur fencing. It is a good tradition among German left-wing activists to show pictures of men in Nazi uniform with scars in their faces claiming that these are scars from Mensur fencing. We had several of these in the German Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERabe%21_0ec8.html" title="User:Rabe!">Rabe!</a> 15:59, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The Nazis put him in a concentration camp for a certain period of time. After the war he became a politician. His highest position was prime minister of the State of Lower Saxony. In his right cheek, he has got some visible Mensur scars.

<dd>From the German point of view I believe that translating this excellent article into English would be to special. The article comes close to a thesis on the issue and is that much detailed, also in a very high and special level of language, that I believe a translation would have to fail. I suggest that you ask the German author and user [Rabe!] whether he is able to provide a resumee of the article with the key points and have that translated.--<a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKresspahl_b8e2.html" title="User:Kresspahl">Kresspahl</a> 20:16, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. However, certain terms would have to be left untranslated (I would prefer if the article was at <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensur.html" title="Mensur">Mensur</a>), and it would need some additional context, as many supporting articles, linked from the German version, have no real counterpart in the english Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 21:55, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Uppland, thats actually the point, in the de:wiki there are some very active writers who as historians and coming from the scene really go deep into German academic culture (<a href="../../../../de/s/t/u/Portal%7EStudentenverbindung_c272.html" class="extiw" title="de:Portal:Studentenverbindung">de:Portal:Studentenverbindung</a>). Therefore there are many articles and subarticles linked to each other, which are necessary to understand this cultural complexity. And who in the world cares, which student from which corps provoked the decision by the German Criminal Supreme Court. The article then really goes into the principles of German criminal law and not only into the basics...who cares for that outside the German community of fencing law students? Perhaps you, certainly me, being one of them, but... it is right now impossible to produce their wiki:reader in English language. We had some discussions on English articles on German academic culture in the en:wiki and the first problem always was to find a proper translation for terms out of the very special German student language. A way of approach could be to produce proper stubs of nearly every article in the German Category in English language and then go for the translation of central articles like academic fencing or <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensur.html" title="Mensur">Mensur</a>.--<a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKresspahl_b8e2.html" title="User:Kresspahl">Kresspahl</a> 23:30, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

On the German Wikipedia, it has been nominated as <i>Exzellente Artikel</i> - the equivalent of a Featured Article. If they think that, it's worth translating.

<p>To motivate my suggestion to move this to <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensur.html" title="Mensur">mensur</a> (now a redirect): I think it is important to use culture-specific terms for culture-specific phenomena. We should avoid using overly general terms for specific phenomena or culture-specific terms for more general phenomena. "Academic fencing" in a wider sense has existed elsewhere, but without borrowing or developing the specific traits of the German tradition. Anyone against a move? "<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_fencing.html" title="Academic fencing">Academic fencing</a>" can remain a redirect until someone writes a more general article. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 10:13, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensur.html" title="Mensur">Mensur</a> has two meanings: in general it is the agreed distance between fencers, this applies to fencing in general, the special one refers to what we are discussing here. For this reason the de:article is not under de:Mensur but de:Mensur (Studentenverbindungen). But I agree with you, that Mensur is the specific term and academic fencing the general.--<a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKresspahl_b8e2.html" title="User:Kresspahl">Kresspahl</a> 10:42, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article describes the schlager as a "large heavy <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabre.html" title="Sabre">sabre</a>". I'm not sure that is strictly true. A sabre, as defined in the wiki article is a curved backsword (although the (curve can be fairly vestigial). The Schlager is entirely straight and double edged (am I correct on the double edge). I've seen it described as a "cutting rapier" (a bit of an oxymoron, I know) or a broadsword (which seems morphologically correct, even though the blade is narrow). I'm not sure what is the correct term here, so I won't put in an ill informed edit, but I'm fairly sure that sabre is wrong. Epeeist smudge 19:27, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That belongs to the problem discussed above: translation of technical terms. Two kinds of weapons are used for mensur fencing today: The "Korbschläger" (for images see German article <a href="../../../../de/k/o/r/Korbschl%C3%A4ger.html" class="extiw" title="de:Korbschläger">de:Korbschläger</a>) and the "Glockenschläger" (for images see German article <a href="../../../../de/g/l/o/Glockenschl%C3%A4ger.html" class="extiw" title="de:Glockenschläger">de:Glockenschläger</a>). The main difference is the hilt. The first has a hilt shaped like a basket (German "Korb") and the latter has a hilt shaped like bell (German "Glocke"). Their use depends on geography. The Glockenschläger is used in Eastern parts of Germany only such as <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leipzig.html" title="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greifswald.html" title="Greifswald">Greifswald</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfurt_Oder_cfdb.html" title="Frankfurt/Oder">Frankfurt/Oder</a> etc. Between WWII and German reunification in 1990 the Glockenschläger was restricted to West-Berlin. The Academic sabre was used from early 19th century until roughly 1935 for serious duels only. But this takes much longer to explain. --<a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERabe%21_0ec8.html" title="User:Rabe!">Rabe!</a> 17:25, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I knew nothing about this subject before reading this article, but one thing that does strike me as absent from it: what is the attitude of the German public towards academic fencing? Is it like <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxing</a>, where some people want it banned but others think it "makes a man" out of its practitioners? Does the fact that academic fencing was banned under the Nazis have a bearing on public opinion today? Do some people think it old-fashioned, like duelling itself? Is it considered unacceptably dangerous that one must aim for the head? Is the "Schmiss" seen by some people as a mark of stupidity rather than stoicism? Etc etc etc. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 20:37, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As with Studentenverbindungen in general, many people are sceptical of academic fencing. So far I haven't met anyone who was interested in doing it, just as most students aren't members of Studentenverbindungen in the first place. I guess it's generally considered a pointless risk or some kind of outlandish initiation ceremony.</dd>
<dd>On a side note: while it is true that most Studentenverbindungen aren't nazis, the general complaint is that those who are not generally tolerate those who are or allow members to express their nazi views (thus apparently reflecting on the Verbindung itself). According to numbers a local Burschenschaft gave in a debate about the correlation between nazism and Burschenschaften, in the meta-organisation of German Burschenschaften about 33% are what they would consider nazis, 33% are conservative/right-winged and 33% are "liberal" -- the Burschenschaft didn't offer any basis for these numbers, but they considered their own group rather liberal. Regardless, the meta-organisation has published and tolerated overtly nazist leaflets in the past decades, reflecting rather badly on them in a day and age when anything even slightly related to nazi ideology is considered a faux pas in politics.</dd>
<dd>Of course Burschenschaften are only a fraction of the whole of all Studentenverbindungen, but most "outsiders" can hardly tell them apart. The gender separation inherent in both and their strong coherence (union for life and all that) makes both seem equally doubtful to the average student, though. Left-wingers are especially offended by their lack of political self-censorship (i.e. tolerance for nazi ideologists).</dd>
<dd>Academic fencing being practically non-existent outside these groups, it shares all the prejudices/criticism Studentenverbindungen endure in general. Personally, I'm as critical of these groups as I'm critical of institutional religions, though I don't support the generalisations either. — <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshmodai_83ab.html" title="User talk:Ashmodai">talk</a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ashmodai_a208.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ashmodai">contribs</a>)</sup> 02:33, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
