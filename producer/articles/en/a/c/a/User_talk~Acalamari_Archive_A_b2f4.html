<p>You know, there is much more to Wikipedia than user and user talk pages. I recommend checking out the encyclopedia part. Curious: Why the interest in others' userboxes/political leanings?

<p>I removed the information about AJ dating one of the Jonas Brothers, as it is gossip and not fit to be on an encyclopedia page. However, the info you added about her ethnicity is uncited and has to be cited from another source or it will be removed -<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosepuff12_4a24.html" title="User:Rosepuff12">Rosepuff12</a> 19:53, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When enough posts are added to a talk page, a contents panel is created automatically. Articles with a lot of sections also have a contents panel so you can get to a certain section faster by clicking on it. -<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosepuff12_4a24.html" title="User:Rosepuff12">Rosepuff12</a> 16:29, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Umm... there is absolutely zero to no question that "Jewish" is an ethnicity, be it Ashkenazi, Sephardic, etc. If this was an IMDB message board I suppose you could debate me, but we're at Wikipedia, where this is accepted fact and stated at every single article we have about the subject, so.... <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 17:54, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, I mean what I say. A webpage cannot harm you. The only possibility I can think of where they might be a problem is if there are any links to harmful file downloads elsewhere on the Internet, but they are not part of the page itself, and there is no way you can get infected just by visiting the page. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 19:41, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I still don't think there should be a problem, but as a precaution, I've uploaded new copies of both of the images you mentioned over the top of the existing images. If you clear your cache, the possibly-infected images should go away. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 20:04, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I did both "Dirrty" and "Stripped". Not everyone has the same program as you, so anyone who has looked at that page recently will need to manually refresh their cache. I made a new copy of the image by viewing the image page, pressing print screen and saving the new image. This means that only the bitmap data is kept, and the rest of the image is lost. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 20:19, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes it was right that you removed it, as the information was unconfirmed.

<dd>This is the response I left on Rolande's Talk Page: When you leave comments on Talk Pages, please use proper grammar and spelling. I corrected your mistakes. For your information, I am not obsessed with Aly &amp; AJ. I happen to have their pages in my Watchlist. Also, I am not a Christian, or of any religion for that matter. In Wikipedia, I avoid as many discussions about religion as I can. Plus, why are you asking me about this anyway? <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 18:12, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I recieved your message regarding Aly and AJ, but I have question: Do they play their own instruments? The All-women bands is for bands with women who play their own instruments, and the Girl groups category is for groups of female singers who do not play their own intruments. I didn't see any mention of them doing anything other than singing, which is why I made the category edit. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsarelah_4a68.html" title="User:Asarelah">Asarelah</a> 00:39, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks for the heads up about the vandal. Anyway, I just looked up Aly and AJ on Google and you were right about the playing their own instruments. I'll leave them in the all-women bands cat. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsarelah_4a68.html" title="User:Asarelah">Asarelah</a> 01:45, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you for removing my trolling on the talk page; I thought I got carried away. I will repost my comment in a more polite and formal manner. And since you're so keen on cleaning up Wikipedia, why don't you go remove the rest of the trolling on that talk page? =)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Edited my trolling to a suggestion. And of course it is relevant. This is an encyclopedia, a collective body of facts. My opinion is that you are taking such aggressive action towards me, because you're a fan. This is very objective of you. If something like a movie, band, etc, is largely disliked or critisised, it is noted. Besides my contibution wasn't hateful at all, everything I wrote was fact. And leave my profile alone, I'll do whatever I want with it. I am no vandal, I have been editing wikipedia before you hit your teens. If you keep taking such objective action I will report you to an administrator for deleting text and fact without proper reason; aka, vandalism.--<a href="../../../m/u/d/User%7EMudel_bec3.html" title="User:Mudel">Mudel</a> 18:46, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Google Alerts is a service they've set up; you can set it up to send you email when Google finds new results for given search terms. That can be useful to watch topics you're interested in (or in my case, to find out what random people happen to say about me). See <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/alerts" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<p>Hi, thanks for your comment on my talk page! I've found another similarity: we're both fans of Aly &amp; AJ and have made edits to their article before.

<dd><b>Somehow?</b> Well, you're obviously nicer than I am. I think they're all the same. Still, the people and the company are worthy enough of an article, if a brief one, that it doesn't have to be pure crap, so I appreciate your taking time with them. One of her/their biggest arguments is that other articles on Wikipedia are equally crummy. The day I get paid for producing something equally as crummy as something else, I know I've found my slacker dream job.

<dd>Yeah, but <i>technically</i> "piece of crap" isn't a proper basis for deletion. It should be tagged and brought up to standards. I do realize that some articles, such as these, are so difficult to read that one sometimes assumes they written as a prank, but, you know, assume good faith. I've never heard of the bulk of small theater groups around the country, but most have at least enough local press, and credible background information for their members to merit a page--although a much better page than these, and I do feel like I'm doing their publicity work without pay, which is somewhat clouding my normally sweet-as-honey demeanor. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:04, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

I'm also tired of listening to every one of them speak poorly of another editor, Mr. Darcy, and ganging up on him just because there are other article on Wikipedia that need work--thanks for seconding this particularly point on the one page, that all articles with poor work should be properly tagged. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 20:39, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I get really irritated by users like this, and have to keep my temper in check, and, most important, we all have to weigh the value of the articles to Wikipedia first. The articles, at least some of them, do belong. I'm sure they'll turn on me and you soon enough, you first I'm guessing. Can we get a pool going? It would be nice if <i>someone</i> made some money on this. Leah reverted my changes to Chelsea Opera Company, leaving my text, at her level of organization. I reverted, but suggested she should do the deletions she added. Check my current revision when you get a moment. The introductory paragraph should give all the general background information, rather than being chopped up just because the producers are also performers. See what you think. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 21:11, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The introduction should give general information, and that's what this does, but it's more specific because it's such a short article. This is the fundamental information about a small theater group, its artistic director, founding members, location, main performers. I don't know what check user does. However, since they are write exactly alike (none of my siblings and I do), it seems likely, and I think since they used these sock puppets to stack the vote they <i>should</i> all be banned, in my opinion. I hate the extra work that stuff like this makes for Wikipedia. I swear this encyclopedia would be done already if not for the constant vigilence needed to deal with stuff like this. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 22:51, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, I could have been nicer about it, too, and should have been once I started getting attacked--but that last bit about posting the imperatives for charitable donations then denying the intent and blaming it on an unasked question was just a bit much. It was a lot of work, too, to get crapped on like I did--and I probably won't do it again. Still, the Wikipedia article end result is more important, and people should be more careful when they're trying to represent others on a venue as public as Wikipedia. I wouldn't want any of the small theater groups I work with to be represented in public by people so contentious. You did good edit work, though, and were very tolerant of the situation, considering. It has been nice meeting you, and I look forward to editing with you again on something interesting in a different way. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 04:19, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, I was not referring to your talkpage when I mentioned Kp's <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brachyura.html" title="Brachyura">Brachyuraness</a>. I hadn't seen your page until just now. I was referring to his/her comments on Mr Darcy's page, where those editor's spelling and writing style was disparaged. And for the record, I am aware of the ANI discussions, the Afds and the userchecks relating to the editors and articles they work on. I don;t want to address the votestacking issue, but I will say I think they are editing in good faith, and as such, deserve to be treated with politeness, even if they try the patience of a saint. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 23:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, no one ever accused me of being a saint. The articles were unreadable, which is how they came to anyone's notice in the first place. With the type of arguments <i>they</i> offered, the multiple accounts, the vote stacking and the editor shopping they could have taken one minute to read what they wrote instead. And, if instead of seeking to take down everyone <i>they</i> disagreed with in the least, they worked on improving the article, none of this would have come up to begin with. I was the one, by the way, who urged everyone else who was being treated rudely by these editors to consider that the articles did belong in Wikipedia and focus on improving them. One editor with some horrid grammar and spelling errors, no big deal, but this type of attacking editors who improve the article, do the research, and make it readable was a bit too much for me. I'll think I'll go on to just voting to delete when I see this next time. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nobody said you were treating anybody with disrespect, Acalamari. Please don't read anything into my message I did not say. And since I know KPBotany will be reading this, too, crabbiness seems an extremely minor transgression in my book. Sorry if my characterization offended you. You admitted above that you were feeling it, I am merely suggesting that you let a bit show. I already said that these particular editors could try the patience of a saint, so it's not surprising.

<dd>Well, I was hoping it would work better for you than for me or for Acalamari or for Mr. Darwin, but realistically he created 8 sock puppets and attacked people who made the article readable, denied everything he did, then reverted every change that anyone made, even after agreeing the change was necessary and the article was better with that change.

And I expect that if a whale could figure out how to batter-fry a giant squid, it would do so. As it is, it has to settle for the "sushi" version. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 19:57, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for your message. I became aware of him when he emailed unblock-en-l@lists.wikimedia.org asking us to unblock him. It's all rather curious. Don't feel bad about what's happened...none of it is your fault or anything. And don't let it put you off welcoming new editors. Keep up the good work.&#160;:) <b>Sarah</b> 22:00, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Acalamari, sorry for the delay replying. I don't really understand why you are wondering about negative consequences and whether other editors will hold your involvement in the User:Dr. Stephen J. Krune III incident against you. I, and most of the admins involved, went to the page because Krune emailed the Wikipedia Unblock mailing list asking to be unblocked...that had nothing to do with you, so I don't understand why you're worried people will blame you for bringing it to our attention. Dr Krune was the one who brought it to our attention. Anyway, I looked at your edit count and you're currently on 1429, with only 530 to the mainspace and 148 to Wikipedia-space. Most people who get through RfAs these days have upwards of around 5,000 edits. I don't imagine you'd be considering a request for adminship in the immediate future and so I really wouldn't worry about what happened the other day. If you had an RfA sometime down the track, I doubt anyone would remember it, let alone want to bring it up in an RfA. However, I would really recommend, in future, if an admin asks you to stop replying to a troll, that you stop. Continuing to reply to trolls doesn't do anything but feed them, as it did in that case. <b>Sarah</b> 14:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, well, the talk page of that account has been deleted now so all your edits have been deleted as well. The only way someone could check what you said on that page would be if the page was undeleted (very unlikely) or an admin reviewed the deleted contents (also very unlikely). Even if it was undeleted, I don't recall seeing you do anything that would be an impediment to adminship, so I really wouldn't give it another thought if I were you. Hope that helps answer your questions. <b>Sarah</b> 16:16, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
