	    <p><b>Academic publishing</b> describes the subfield of <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publishing.html" title="Publishing">publishing</a> which distributes <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academia.html" title="Academia">academic</a> <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research.html" title="Research">research</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarship.html" title="Scholarship">scholarship</a>. Most academic work is published in <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_journal.html" title="Academic journal">journal</a> article or <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html" title="Book">book</a> form. Much, though not all, academic publishing relies on some form of <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> or editorial refereeing to qualify texts for publication.</p>
<p>Most established <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_discipline.html" title="Academic discipline">academic disciplines</a> have their own journals and other outlets for publication, though many academic journals are somewhat <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interdisciplinarity.html" title="Interdisciplinarity">interdisciplinary</a>, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields, as do review and publication processes.</p>
<p>Academic publishing is undergoing major changes, emerging from the transition from the print to the electronic format. Business models are different in the electronic environment. Since the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common. Currently, a major trend, particularly with respect to scholarly journals, is <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_access.html" title="Open access">open access</a>. There are two main forms of open access: <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_access_publishing.html" title="Open access publishing">open access publishing</a>, in which the articles or the whole journal is freely available from the time of publication; and <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-archiving.html" title="Self-archiving">self-archiving</a>, where the author makes a copy of their own work freely available on the web.</p>
<p><b>STM publishing</b> is a frequently-used abbreviation for academic publications in science, technology, and medicine.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_publishing.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Among the earliest <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research_journal.html" title="Research journal">research journals</a> was the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society_c0c6.html" title="Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</a> in the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a>. At that time, the act of publishing academic inquiry was controversial, and widely ridiculed. It was not at all unusual for a new discovery to be announced as an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anagram.html" title="Anagram">anagram</a>, reserving priority for the discoverer, but indecipherable for anyone not in on the secret: both <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leibniz.html" title="Leibniz">Leibniz</a> used this approach. However, this method did not work well. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_K._Merton_a0cc.html" title="Robert K. Merton">Robert K. Merton</a>, a sociologist, found that 92% of cases of simultaneous discovery in the 17th century ended in dispute. The number of disputes dropped to 72% in the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>, 59% by the latter half of the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>, and 33% by the first half of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>. The decline in contested claims for priority in research discoveries can be credited to the increasing acceptance of the publication of papers in modern academic journals.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Society_0bd4.html" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> was steadfast in its not yet popular belief that science could only move forward through a transparent and open exchange of ideas backed by experimental evidence.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_publishing.html" title="Edit section: Scholarly paper">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scholarly paper</span></h2>
<p>In academic publishing, a <b>paper</b> is an academic work that is usually published in an <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_journal.html" title="Academic journal">academic journal</a>. It contains original <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research.html" title="Research">research</a> results or reviews existing results. Such a paper, also called an article, will only be considered valid if it undergoes a process of <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> by one or more <i>referees</i> (who are academics in the same field) in order to check that the content of the paper is suitable for <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publication.html" title="Publication">publication</a> in the journal. A paper may undergo a series of reviews, edits and re-submissions before finally being accepted or rejected for publication. This process typically takes several months. Next there is often a delay of many months (or in some subjects, over a year) before publication, particularly for the most popular journals where the number of acceptable articles outnumbers the space for printing. Due to this, many <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic.html" title="Academic">academics</a> offer a '<a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-print.html" title="Pre-print">pre-print</a>' copy of their paper for free download from their personal or institutional <a href="../../../w/e/b/Website.html" title="Website">website</a>.</p>
<p>Some journals, particularly newer ones, are now published in electronic form only. Paper journals are now generally made available in electronic form as well, both to individual subscribers, and to <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libraries.html" title="Libraries">libraries</a>. Almost always these electronic versions are available to subscribers immediately upon publication of the paper version, or even before; sometimes they are also made available to non-subscribers after an <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embargo_%28academic_publishing%29.html" title="Embargo (academic publishing)">embargo</a> of two to twenty-four months, in order to protect against loss of subscriptions. Journals having this delayed availability are generally called <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delayed_open_access_journal.html" title="Delayed open access journal">delayed open access journals</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_publishing.html" title="Edit section: Peer review">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Peer review</span></h2>
<p><i>Main article:</i> <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">Peer review</a></p>
<p>Peer review is a central concept for most academic publishing; other scholars in a field must find a work sufficiently high in quality for it to merit publication. The process also guards against <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a>. Failures in peer review, while they are probably common, are sometimes scandalous (the <a href="../../../s/o/k/Sokal_Affair_75f6.html" title="Sokal Affair">Sokal Affair</a> is arguably one example, though this controversy also involved many other issues).</p>
<p><a name="Publishing_process" id="Publishing_process"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_publishing.html" title="Edit section: Publishing process">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Publishing process</span></h2>
<p>The process of academic publishing is divided into two distinct phases. The process of peer review, is organized by the journal editor and is complete when the content of the article, together with any associated images or figures, are accepted for publication. The peer review process is increasingly managed online, through the use of proprietary systems, or commercial software packages such as ScholarOne <a href="http://www.scholarone.com/products_manuscriptcentral.html" class="external text" title="http://www.scholarone.com/products_manuscriptcentral.html" rel="nofollow">ManuscriptCentral</a>, Aries <a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.editorialmanager.com/" rel="nofollow">Editorial Manager</a>, or <a href="http://www.ejournalpress.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ejournalpress.com/" rel="nofollow">EJournalPress</a>.</p>
<p>Once peer review has been completed, the original author(s) of the article will modify their submission in line with the reviewers' comments, and this is repeated until the editor is satisfied.</p>
<p>The production process, controlled by a production editor or publisher, then takes an article through <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copy_editing.html" title="Copy editing">copy editing</a>, <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typesetting.html" title="Typesetting">typesetting</a>, inclusion in a specific issue of a journal, and then printing and online publication. Copy editing seeks to ensure that an article conforms to the journal's <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_style.html" title="House style">house style</a>, that all of the referencing and labelling is correct, and that there are no spelling or grammatical errors. Typesetting deals with the appearance of the article — layouts, fonts, headings etc., both for print and online publication. Historically, these activities were all carried out in-house in a publisher, but increasingly are subject to <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outsourcing.html" title="Outsourcing">outsourcing</a>. The majority of typesetting is probably now done in India and China, and copy editing is frequently done by local freelancers, or by staff at the typesetters in India or China. Even printing and distribution are now tending to move overseas to lower-cost areas of the world, such as Singapore.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In previous years, such articles were photographed for printing into proceedings and journals, and this stage were known as "camera-ready" copy. Due to the modern day use of digital submission in formats such as <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_Document_Format_95a8.html" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</a>, this photographing step is no longer necessary, though the term is still sometimes used.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/u/t/Author.html" title="Author">author</a> will review and correct proofs at one or more stages in the production process. The proof correction cycle has historically been labour-intensive as handwritten comments by authors and editors are manually transcribed by a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proofreading.html" title="Proofreading">proof reader</a> onto a clean version of the proof. In recent years, this process has been streamlined by the introduction of e-annotations in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_word.html" title="Microsoft word">Microsoft word</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adobe_Acrobat_b3ee.html" title="Adobe Acrobat">Adobe Acrobat</a>, and other program, but it still remains a time-consuming and error-prone process.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_publishing.html" title="Edit section: Social sciences">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Social sciences</span></h3>
<p>Publishing in the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_science.html" title="Social science">social sciences</a> is very different in different fields.

Some social science fields, such as <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_health.html" title="Public health">public health</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics.html" title="Demographics">demographics</a>, have significant shared interests with professions like <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, and scholars in these fields often also publish in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_magazines.html" title="Professional magazines">professional magazines</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Humanities" id="Humanities"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_publishing.html" title="Edit section: Humanities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Humanities</span></h3>
<p>Publishing in the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanities.html" title="Humanities">humanities</a> is in principle similar to publishing elsewhere in the academy; a range of journals, from general to extremely specialized, are available, and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_press.html" title="University press">university presses</a> print many new humanities books every year.</p>
<p>Scholarly publishing requirements in the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanities.html" title="Humanities">humanities</a> (as well as some <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_sciences.html" title="Social sciences">social sciences</a>) are currently a subject of significant controversy within the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy.html" title="Academy">academy</a>. The following describes the situation in the United States. In many fields, such as <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literature.html" title="Literature">literature</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>, several published articles are typically required for a first <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenure-track.html" title="Tenure-track">tenure-track</a> job, and a published or forthcoming <i>book</i> is now often required before <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenure.html" title="Tenure">tenure</a>. Some critics complain that this <i>de facto</i> system has emerged without thought to its consequences; they claim that the predictable result is the publication of much shoddy work, as well as unreasonable demands on the already limited research time of young scholars. To make matters worse, the circulation of many humanities journals in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> declined to almost untenable levels, as many libraries cancelled subscriptions, leaving fewer and fewer peer-reviewed outlets for publication; and many humanities professors' first books sell only a few hundred copies, which often does not pay for the cost of their printing. Some scholars have called for a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publication_subvention.html" title="Publication subvention">publication subvention</a> of a few thousand dollars to be associated with each <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graduate_student.html" title="Graduate student">graduate student</a> <a href="../../../f/e/l/Fellowship.html" title="Fellowship">fellowship</a> or new <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenure-track.html" title="Tenure-track">tenure-track</a> hire, in order to alleviate the financial pressure on journals.</p>

<p>Research journals have been so successful that the number of journals and of papers has proliferated over the past few decades, and the credo of the modern academic has become "publish or perish". Except for generalist journals like <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_%28journal%29.html" title="Science (journal)">Science</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_%28journal%29.html" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a></i>, the topics covered in any single journal have tended to narrow, and readership and citation have declined. A variety of methods reviewing submissions exist. The most common involves initial approval by the journal, <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> by two or three researchers working in similar or closely related subjects who recommend approval or rejection as well as request error correction, clarification or additions before publishing. Controversial topics may receive additional levels of review. Journals have developed a hierarchy, partly based on reputation but also on the strictness of the review policy. More prestigious journals are more likely to receive and publish more important work. Submitters try to submit their work to the most prestigious journal likely to publish it to bolster their reputation and <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curriculum_vitae.html" title="Curriculum vitae">curriculum vitae</a>. A quantitative (and not uncontroversial) measure of the prestige or importance of a journal is its <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impact_Factor_7462.html" title="Impact Factor">impact factor</a>, which is increasingly used as a criterion for promotion and in the awarding of tenure.</p>
<p>Some journals now include an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> element; i.e. the authors are allowed to post unreviewed material and designated reviewers or the reader community freely comments on the material and thus provide an alternative method of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quality_control.html" title="Quality control">quality control</a>. Such journals can be open access, such as PLoS One, or <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psycoloquy.html" title="Psycoloquy">Psycoloquy</a>, or subscription, such as <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_Anthropology_cb83.html" title="Current Anthropology">Current Anthropology</a>.</p>
<p>The mathematician <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Odlyzko_d0a7.html" title="Andrew Odlyzko">Andrew Odlyzko</a> has argued that research journals will evolve into something akin to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> forums over the coming decade, by extending the interactivity of current Internet <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preprint.html" title="Preprint">preprints</a>. This change may open them up to a wider range of ideas, some more developed than others. Whether this will be a positive evolution remains to be seen. Some claim that forums, like markets, tend to thrive or fail based on their ability to attract talent, perhaps just the same as with conventional journals. Some believe that highly restrictive and tightly monitored forums may be the least likely to thrive, and some think the exact opposite. <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantic_publishing.html" title="Semantic publishing">Semantic publishing</a> is changing the face of scientific publishing. In particular, <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/HCLS/ScientificPublishingTaskForce" class="external text" title="http://esw.w3.org/topic/HCLS/ScientificPublishingTaskForce" rel="nofollow">self-publishing of experiments</a> on the web could potentially make all the experiment data available as semantic data objects that can be searched, shared and integrated by anyone at any time. This simple but radical idea is being explored by W3C now (<a href="http://web2express.org/demo" class="external text" title="http://web2express.org/demo" rel="nofollow">demo</a>).</p>

<p>It was a fact of pre-technology life that, no matter how dedicated, one person can only give a limited number of lectures to the small groups of students who can travel to hear them; and, if articles are to be written and distributed, only a small number of copies can be hand-written or typed. The development of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Printing_press.html" title="Printing press">the printing press</a> therefore represented a revolution for communicating the latest hypotheses and research results to the academic community and supplemented what a scholar could do personally. Ironically, this improvement in the efficiency of communication created a challenge for libraries which have had to accommodate the weight and volume of literature. To understand the scale of the problem: about two centuries ago, the number of scientific papers published annually was doubling approximately every fifteen years. Today, the number of published papers doubles about every ten years.</p>
<p>But the new reality of internet technology is that it is far cheaper to send out electronic versions of a paper than to have it printed in a journal. Unlike their medieval counterparts, modern academics can now run electronic journals and distribute academic materials without the need for publishers. Not surprisingly, publishers perceive this emancipation as a serious threat to their business model. In reality, the interests of scholars and publishers have long been in conflict. The purpose of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> is to protect the capital invested in the "work" by the publisher, while the wish of the scholar is to have the work as widely distributed as possible.</p>
<p>Publishing academic journals and books is a large part of an international industry. The shares of the major publishing companies are listed on national <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_exchange.html" title="Stock exchange">stock exchanges</a> and management policies must satisfy the dividend expectations of international shareholders. Although some specialist academic publishers used to take a less commercial view of their business, the industry has been consolidating and, as smaller units are absorbed into the larger, standardised accounting and profit-oriented policies have dominated the industry. Critics have claimed that these policies now constrain more altruistic leanings of academic publishing.</p>

<p>The rival to this subscription model is the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_access.html" title="Open access">open access</a> journal model. (This is also known as "author-pays" or "paid on behalf of the author." ) where a publication charge is paid by the author, his university, or the agency which provides his research grant. The online distribution of individual articles and academic journals then takes place without charge to readers and libraries. Committing to the open access community means dispensing with the financial, technical, and legal barriers that have been designed to limit access to academic materials to paying customers. The <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Library_of_Science_a32a.html" title="Public Library of Science">Public Library of Science</a> and Biomed Central are prominent and successful examples of this model.</p>
<p>Corporate interests often criticize the principle of open access on quality grounds, as the desire to obtain publishing fees would cause the journal to relax the standard of peer review. It is often criticized on financial grounds as well, because the necessary publication fees have proven to be higher than originally estimated. Open access advocates generally reply that because open access is as much based on peer reviewing as traditional publishing, the quality should be the same (recognizing that both traditional and open access journals have a range of quality). It has been argued that good science done by academic institutions who cannot afford to pay for open access might not get published at all, but most open access journals permit the waiver of the fee for financial hardship or authors in <a href="../../../d/e/v/Developing_country.html" title="Developing country">underdeveloped countries</a>. By October 2006, it has become clear that open access journals are feasible in at least some situations, and some can be financially viable without outside funding. It remains unclear whether this is applicable to all--or even most-- journals.</p>
<p>A variant of this model, <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid_open_access_journal.html" title="Hybrid open access journal">Hybrid open access publishing</a> has developed since 2004. In this system, those articles that have a fee paid are made available open access immediately; the others are either made available after a delay, or remain available only by subscription. During 2004, many of the traditional publishers (including <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackwell.html" title="Blackwell">Blackwell</a> Publishing, <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_Press_e785.html" title="Oxford University Press">Oxford University Press</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springer_Science%2BBusiness_Media_fe54.html" title="Springer Science+Business Media">Springer Science+Business Media</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wharton_School_Publishing_3a63.html" title="Wharton School Publishing">Wharton School Publishing</a>) introduced such models, and the move is continuing to spread. Proponents of open access suggest that such moves by corporate publishers illustrate that open access, or a mix of open access and traditional publishing can be financially viable, and there is beginning to be some evidence to that effect. It remains unclear whether this is practical in fields outside the sciences, where there is much less availability of outside funding. In 2006, several funding agencies, including the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellcome_Trust_4ffb.html" title="Wellcome Trust">Wellcome Trust</a> in the UK and several divisions of the Research Councils UK (UKRC) announced the availability of extra funding to their grantees for such publication fees.</p>
