This subsequently led to several new categories. In recent years the academy has awarded it almost exclusively to celebrate a lifetime of achievement.</p>
<p>Unlike the annual competitive Academy Awards, on which the academy membership as a whole votes, the selectors of the honorary award are the academy's <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_Governors_2e41.html" title="Board of Governors">Board of Governors</a>. The award trophy, however, is the same gold "Oscar" statuette as is given for other awards.</p>
