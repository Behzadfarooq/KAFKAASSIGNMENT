<dl>
<dd>Limelight was produced in the 1950's but was banned in the USA until 1971. Therefor it didn't open in Los Angelas until then, and was not eligable for an Oscar until that year (the rule was subsequently changed to prevent any more old films from winning oscars). The film played in Europe and Canada in the 1950's, but not in the USA. hope that clears in up <a href="../../../d/o/w/User%7EDowew_71ec.html" title="User:Dowew">Dowew</a> 20:31, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>EDIT...most prominent film awards in the world or United States ==</p>
<p>Edit "...The Oscars, are the most prominent film awards in the world", originally stated "...in the United States." It is one of the few areas in the film world that is universally considered beyond reproach. Can you imagine or argue a more prestigious film award? I can not. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingoftheDogs_542e.html" title="User:KingoftheDogs">King of the Dogs</a> 04-13-2005</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am afraid Academy awards is not the most prominent film awards. <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannes_Film_Festival_715f.html" title="Cannes Film Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> is the most prominent. Films made around the world compete in Cannes Film festival. <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Palm_e5ff.html" title="Golden Palm">Golden Palm</a> award is the most highly recognized award for a movie. It is also alleged to be less politically motivated than Academy Awards. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolmallu_0568.html" title="User:Coolmallu">coolmallu</a> 20:17, 2005 July 17 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He's right. Not only is the Palm d'Or considered to be the single most important (and yes, most prominent) award in cinema, many others such as Berlin's Golden Bear and Venice's Golden Lion could be argued to be of greater significance than the Oscar. --Qwayfe 16:19, 27 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, I am not a fan of hyperbolic language in general (saying anything is the most prominant anything is usually a mistake) but I still must disagree here. Just because the Cannes festival sees more international films doesn't make it more prominant on the world stage. Also keep in mind that only a handful of films are in competition at Cannes each year, as opposed to the hundreds that are theoretically up for the Oscars (including every single foreign film screened in America that year); also remember that the Palm d'Or is voted on by a small jury of film personalities as opposed to the thousands of members of the Academy. But rather than argue, perhaps someone could find empirical data or a scholarly source of some kind to argue which is "more prominant"?
<dl>
<dd>I certainly see the points made about other film awards, particularly Cannes, but I would still argue that the "Oscars" are beyond reproach when considering 'prominence' (or in other words 'famous' or 'recognized') in film awards. Again, this is not to say the merit of such award decisions are not arguable - or for that matter can art or opinion ever be universally agreed upon - it is referring to the event itself. Nevertheless, it stands as fairly strong fact that it garners the most press and media coverage of any film awards show - of course only a single factor in determining 'prominence', but a good starting point. I agree with the above suggestion, referenced research would be helpful in this case. I will see if I can find some more media coverage statistics on such events.
<dl>
<dd>Here's one Awards press release indicating large international coverage: "<a href="http://oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2005/05.01.25.html" class="external text" title="http://oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2005/05.01.25.html" rel="nofollow">news conference attended by over 400 international media</a>." It is from the Academy's own institution, but I doubt the media would disagree.
<dl>
<dd>How about keeping it to "arguably the most prominent" until someone find a good source. Still, I think if prominence means 'famous' which means more number of people know about it, then it would be extremely biased to countries with relatively more population like in China or India, and I think it will not be the Oscars. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.81.120.217_91a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.81.120.217">58.81.120.217</a> (talk) 15:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>I think the fact that the Oscars are televised all over the world make them the most famous of the two. The Cannes ceremony as far as I know has never been shown outsied of a few cable networks. 201.128.153.47
<dl>
<dd>the cannes festival is more well regarded but the oscars are unquestionably more prominent and known. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinnspirit_edbc.html" title="User:Jinnspirit">Jinnspirit</a> 02:05, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I deleted all the "Academy Award for Best" before each category because if was redundant. I don't mind having just the "Best" before the categories, but now some categories have it and some don't.</p>
<p>That's a minor problem, but the bigger one is that Best Orignial Musical is deleted from the list of categories. It's a category just like all the others, it just wasn't activated this year. Also, the category is "Original Score" not "Original Music Score" (what other kind of score is there?). The Sound categories were changed a couple of years ago. They are now named Sound Mixing and Sound Editing. The acting categories were also renamed recently to "Actor/Actress in a Leading Role" and "Actor/Actress in a Supporting Role."</p>
<p>The Scientific and Technical Award should be placed in the Honorary Awards section because they are not awarded to an individual film, like all the other categories, but rather to honor those that have invented something to help filmmakers. Most of them that are handed out aren't even Oscar statuettes.</p>
<p>Comedy Direction isn't really a retired category, the Best Director category was just split into Drama/Comedy. It seems as though there was a category honoring any type of direction (including comedy), and then one just for comdedy. Also, my description of how the Best Original Score category used to be split into Drama/Comedy categories was deleted too. 68.14.23.152 02:04, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first two sentences of "Criticism" seem to be a defence of award shows, with their claim that "[i]t is simply not possible" to please everyone. It is entirely possible; the Academy just has several built-in biases that could be eliminated with some reorganization. This article has no right to claim that it is not possible when the simple fact is that noone ever seems to try. <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvenscout742_266b.html" title="User:Elvenscout742">elvenscout742</a> 00:02, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well as the initial author of the article, I'll defend myself. The thing is its not right to type out that the Academy was wrong because it gave so-and-so the award instead of something else. It sounds childish and churlish. The rest of my article actually does stress out the basic points for which people have gripes with the Oscars. Many best Picture awards do not age very well. How many remember Dances With Wolves over Goodfellas, or Shakespeare In Love over Saving Private Ryan, or for that matter Ordinary People which won over Raging Bull. ----Artihcus.</dd>

<dd>The name of the ceremony is <b>Academy Awards</b>. Understand that AMPAS (aka "The <i><b>Academy</b></i> of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences") has run with the term <i>Oscars</i> as a pointer in their print literature, website, and broadcast graphics because the term is a highly recognizable symbol and brand name, which most people are aware of worldwide. However, the ceremony's <i>official</i> name is <b>Academy Awards®</b> (note the register mark). This is not an opinion, but a fact. Simply go to Oscar.com and look at the title bar for the official name of the ceremony. Note also that Oscar® carries a register mark, as the AMPAS controls both names.

<dd>Seems that a lot of what you've said is strictly 100% POV or fan trivia, and one person's "snub" or "error" or "mistake" is another person's hard vote and there are probably many people who would argue that none of the things you've listed are worthy of re-consideration. An encyclopedia article on the Academy Awards is not a place for debate about the things which have won or not won. There are fan pages and other websites for that kind of subjective discussion. Note that I do not 100% disagree with your citations but they are not really relevant to the article and they really are 100% subjective POV.</dd>

<p>The blanket removal of an entire section that's been part of the article for probably a year or more is simply vandalism, and smells suspicious to me. At the most, the section needs to be hit with <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags and action taken to source the material. Unless you know absolutely nothing about these awards and the movie business in general, all this information is common knowledge and would not be that difficult to source. Removing the entire section is not a solution and this is not what happens on Wikipedia, generally speaking. What does happen here all too often is people taking matters into their own hands under the badge of "policy". Armed with policy interpretations, they force their personal will onto a given article. I believe this is what is going on here. In the meantime, this section needs to remain as is. Instead of being lazy and simply removing content, participate in the research, if necessary, and stop vandalising the page. The "Criticism" section has weathered countless edits, by editors more experienced than either of us. If there was this grave policy issue as you represent, it seems these senior editors would have discovered it by now and taken action.

<dd>I would caution you first to assume good faith and not accuse me of vandalising the page because I am removing text that blatantly violates wikipedia policy. That it is "common knowledge" is not good enough, and not every user has the sort of familiarity with the "movie business" that you cite. The onus is on the user who wishes to add unsourced material. Furthermore, rather than calling me lazy, perhaps consider that putting up content that smacks of personal opinion without references is also a quite lazy course of action. I would also like to know where all this previous controversy can be found on the discussion page - as far as I know this is the first mention of it. I'll put up a request for comment or some such thing on one of the boards frequented by "more experienced" editors and we can see where the discussion leads, but in the meantime please refrain from taking such apparent offense to my edits.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 20:45, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm responding to Dmz5's request for <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Media%2C_art_and_literature_a0ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Media, art and literature">third party comment</a>, although I'm not at all sure I'm more experienced than either of you: First, I hope everybody would tone down the language and have a care for the other side's sensibilities. I get just as offended in my disputes as you two have, and I do know how hard it is to restrain one's language (and I wish I'd done a better job of it myself in the past), but it's still a very good idea to be more restrained. I think both sides have acted in good faith here, and I wish you would both acknowledge that. On the issue, it seems to me that both sides agree that sourced material is better than unsourced. It might actually be less difficult (and certainly less emotionally draining) for both of you to agree to take a whack at a search engine for "Academy Awards" and "criticism" — and I'll tell you what, if you both agree to help, I'll help too. I have to agree with Dmz5 that unsourced sections are intolerable, but I have to agree with Cleaningdepartment that <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags are a better solution. I mean, there's a reason why those tags exist, right? If we can't easily find some things on the Web to back up these statements, then certainly it will come around by Academy Awards night, right? Rather than delete now, I suggest waiting until at least a couple of weeks after that night. If the statements in that section can't be found by then, after someone tries searching for them, then it's unlikely we'll ever find them. Anyone with books on the subject could really help out the effort, too. Sound reasonable?

<p>The question I have is, after a film gets enough votes to be a nominee, do they stop counting that film's votes immediately, and just count the second choice on further ballots selecting that film as their first choice? If that is the way they do it it would be odd because the <i>order in which the votes are counted</i> could make the difference in who the nominees are. --Citefixer1965 15:12, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A notable missing category is that of stunt players, who in some action films spend more time on the screen than the actors they represent. This is a reflection on the greater industry's desire to uphold box office draw by maintaining the illusion of cinema and the skills of the actors.

<dd>Actually, I have to disagree on this point. Judy Dench is, in fact, <i>the</i> classic case. From what I understand, her performance (at about 8 minutes of screen time) is the shortest-ever Oscar winning performance. (Dench runs neck and neck with Anthony Hopkin's 17 minutes of screen time in Silence of the Lambs for which he won Best Actor.) It is widely believed that Dench's winning the Oscar for a mere 8 minutes of screen time is, in fact, testament to her prior body of work at large, as opposed to the actual specific winning performance.

<dd>Re: shortest Oscar-winning performance. I stand corrected; it was <i>not</i> Judy Dench's 8 minutes. Rather, as per this article: The shortest performance ever to win an acting Oscar was Beatrice Straight's performance, which lasted 5 minutes and 40 seconds, in <i>Network</i> (1976). Straight was awarded Best Supporting Actress for her role. (JosephASpadaro 13:59, 17 March 2007 (UTC))</dd>

<p>Wondering if the criticism that I hear annually about hearing the Academy clap during the dead people montage (and thus hearing loud cheers for the more famous people, but often times silence during some of the less famous people) would merit inclusion in this section?

<p>Do we really need all that information in the Trivia section? I think that information that can easily be found in Academy Awards statistics pages should be omitted.</p>

<p>I could also see a point in keeping the info about the actors who have appeared in 3 or more Best Picture winners, but there is now a statistics page devoted to that, and there are way more actors than what is listed here.</p>

<p>The trivia just needs to be at least factual. There was a statement about the movie with the most nominations without being nominated for best picture (They Shoot Horses, Don't They? with 9 nominations). Listed right underneath this item of trivia was a statement claiming Dreamgirls held that dubious honor with its 8 nominations. I erased that completely; it doesn't make sense!!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was stumped for a moment, too, and (at first blush), it doesn't seem to make any sense. But actually, it DOES, in fact, make sense. See the section entitled "Suggested Adding 'Dreamgirls' Trivia" (below). In the year 1969, one film (Anne of the Thousand Days) was nominated for 10 awards, including Best Picture. And another film (They Shoot Horses) was nominated for 9 awards, NOT including Best Picture. In the year 2006, Dreamgirls was nominated for 8 awards, NOT including Best Picture. The catch is this: Dreamgirls had the most nominations of the year 2006 (albeit "only" 8). They Shoot Horses (at 9 nom's) did NOT have the most nominations of the year 1969, as it was bested by Anne of the Thousand Days (at 10 nom's). So, even though Horses had a higher number of total nominations than Dreamgirls (9 versus 8), Horses was NOT the most nominated film of 1969 (since it was beaten by Anne of the Thousand Days) (10 versus 9) -- yet, Dreamgirls WAS the most nominated film in 2006. In other words: in "absolute" number of nominations, Horses was the film that received the most nominations (9) that did not include Best Picture. But, in "relative" number of nominations (relative to other films of the same year), Dreamgirls was the most nominated film of 2006 (at 8) that did not include Best Picture. Even though Dreamgirls had only 8 nom's, it was still the highest number of nominations relative to all other films in 2006. While Horses had more than 8 absolute nominations (at 9), it was NOT the most-nominated film of 1969, due to Anne of the Thousand Days (10 nom's). I hope this clears it up. Does this make sense now?

<dd>Thanks for the clarification on where you were coming from with the Dreamgirls trivia. I understand your point, but the trivia does not reflect this information. All it says it that They Shoot Horses had the most nominations without best picture . . . which it did in that year. Even though Anne of the 1000 Days had 10 nominations, one of those was for best picture, therefore it can not be part of the category "most nominations without best picture." It is out of the running simply by being nominated for best picture! The film with the most nominations without a best picture nomination can only belong to a picture not nominated for best picture. This title belongs to They Shoot Horses. If the trivia were combined to state the the picture in a single Oscar year that both received the most nominations AND did not receive the best picture nomination, Dreamgirls would be it. Otherwise, the language as it is points to They Shoot Horses.</dd>

<dd>You're welcome. I believe that you and I are saying the same thing. The TRIVIA Section (as it now reads) states: <i>The film with the most nominations without a Best Picture nomination is: They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969) with 9 nominations.</i> The TRIVIA Section also states: <i>Dreamgirls (2006) was nominated for 8 awards, but not Best Picture. Thus, it was the first film ever to receive the most nominations in a given year, without being nominated for Best Picture.</i> All that being said -- do you still see an error? Or does the wording seem correct to you? Please let me know. Thanks a lot. (JosephASpadaro 08:27, 9 March 2007 (UTC))</dd>

<p>"The longest standing ovation was given to Charlie Chaplin in 1972 after receiving his award." Can this be verified?</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't know how, although I do recall that he was given a huge ovation. He had been essentially blacklisted and had left America with an embittered attitude. When he finally came back, with many years having mellowed the situation, and got that ovation, he told the audience, "You are all sweet people, and I thank you," or words to that effect. I recall the big ovation and the "sweet people" phrase, anyway. But unless someone has bothered to time the ovations over 80 years, it would be hard to prove that assertion. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 09:56, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>A couple of things that might be worth adding to the trivia section. I'm not 100% sure I'm correct about these or I'd add them myself. I believe <i>The Color Purple</i> (1985) holds the record for the most nominations without winning any. I've also heard that <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> (1991) was the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture (if so, is it still the only one?).</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are partially correct here. In 1977, The Turning Point received 11 nominations, with zero wins. And in 1985, The Color Purple matched that record (11 nominations, zero wins). By the way, next in line was 2002's Gangs of New York (10 nominations, zero wins). As far as Beauty and the Beast (1991), what you say sounds correct. I believe it was the first AND the only. In fact, it is likely -- also -- to be the last. I thought that I heard, somewhere along the way, that there was an added category of Best Animated Film (subsequent to 1991). With this new category added, it is not likely that an animated film will unseat Beauty and the Beast's claim to fame (as the first and only animated Best Picture nominee).

<p>Finally, the practice of releasing a film in December so it is still in its run as a current film (or at least a very recent one) at the time of the voting and the awards ceremony is probably worth mentioning somewhere in the article, possibly in the Criticism section. It has been speculated, for instance, that <i>Titanic</i> might not have won as many Oscars as it did if it hadn't still been at the height of its theatrical run. --<a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalimu59_7f54.html" title="User:Mwalimu59">Mwalimu59</a> 02:01, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I came to the article to check if this very dubious figure was actually in our article, and I'm really surprised that it has gone by without being scrutinized properly. No way in <i>Hell</i> does 1/6th of the world's population watch the Oscars every year. Along with Roy's pointers above, the fact that the award show is on in the wee hours of the morning in all of Europe and Africa and isn't exactly taking up prime time in most of Asia is reason enough to reject the statement as obvious corporate propaganda.</dd>

I would know because I live in another country before. Nielsen said that at least 78 million Americans watch the show partly. So maybe they are basing their argument there plus of course in other countries. It is quite popular in India and China, that alone could rake up at least 300 million people combined. So it is very possible to have a 1 billion viewers watched the show PARTLY. You underestimated the Hollywood influence around the world. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.101.41.32 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.101.41.32.html" title="User talk:67.101.41.32">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.101.41.32_bf76.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.101.41.32">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>I live in Sweden, a country that is extremely Americanized and very US-oriented, and I can assure that I've never seen the award show itself cited as being especially popular in terms of ratings. That it would be hugely popular in China and India seems very unlikely and the idea that the Oscars are watched by about as many people as the FIFA World Cup Finals is just silly. If the Academy can't produce reliable figures for those figures, they shouldn't be taken seriously. The fact that they have every interest in inflating the figures is reason enough to be skeptical.</dd>

<dd>Again you are assuming it is watched by people simultaneously like the world cup finals. 1 billion is possible bec. many, if not some, countries showed it twice (one live, one recorded for primetime) some other counries even shows the show many days after. The 1 billion also only includes people who watch just PARTS of the show. Nielsen said, In US 40 million people watch the show from beginning to end. When they consider people who watch it at least 6 minutes it will balloon to 78 million. Make it at least one minute then you will have an estimated almost 90 million watch the show. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.101.41.32 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.101.41.32.html" title="User talk:67.101.41.32">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.101.41.32_bf76.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.101.41.32">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>What's the point of this warping and bending of figures? If we included all the people who watched just one minute of the World Cup Finals, live or not, we could probably be in the billions, which makes the comparison completely pointless. Either we find some credible ratings to account for those 900 million non-American viewers, based on the same standard of what a "viewer" actually means, or draw the conclusion that the Academy is bloating its own popularity. The Oscars are ridiculously Anglo-centric and if you think people outside of North America really care that much about the likes of Billy Crystal, I'd advise you to travel abroad more often. The awards are well-known by many, but that doesn't mean people watch the award show.</dd>
<dd>Just to illustrate how little interest there is for the award show in a country like Sweden, there have been years when the show hasn't aired even on regular cable channels, either live or recorded. And their ratings hardly ever exceed 500,000 (except for major sports events), which is little over 5% of the population.</dd>

<dd>You are having the impression that I am trying to make a competition between the Oscars and World Cup, which I am not. More people watches the world cup finals than the Oscars, thats a given. All i am saying that the 1 billion or near that which they claim is not impossible. Because they include everything. It is not really all about the "Awards" or "Billy Crystal" many factors come into play. Like the glamour, the stars and the "movies" itself. That is why many people are interested in it. Like what I said it reflects on how American Movies fare in the worldwide market. If you look at Box Office Mojo you would noctice that majority of the top films there made most of their money overseas.

<dd>I'm not irked about any "competition" between the Oscars and the World Cup Finals, but that one needs to stretch the definition of "viewer" beyond any usefulness to accommodate that seemingly bloated figure figure.</dd>
<dd>Sweden is one of <i>the</i> most US-oriented countries in Europe. Only the Dutch rival the Swedes when it comes to second language English skills and a considerable percentage of all programming and entertainment comes from the US. And <i>still</i> the Oscars aren't popular enough to be shown on any of the major channels. There's interest in the awards and the gossip surrounding it, but not really that much about the award show itself. And Sweden is about 9 million people strong, which is more than enough to serve as a rough measurement, if not outright proof, of how popular American culture is outside of North America. I can assure you that Swedes know a lot more about American culture than Americans will ever know about Swedish culture.</dd>
<dd>And are you really surprised that a lot of Hollywood films make more money <i>in the rest of the world</i> than in the US (and Canada)? We're talking a well-off middle class that is on the order of twice the entire US population.</dd>
<dd>But this discussion is mostly just rhetoric, because the burden of proof still lies with those claiming that the Academy is a reliable source for ratings of its own show, not those criticizing it. If someone wants to keep the current wording, they should provide citations of ratings that confirm a whopping 900 million viewers outside of the US.</dd>

<p>Isn't UK the most "Americanized" European country? UK and US are pretty much sister countries. But still Sweden is too small to even be considered as a barometer. Whether your claim about sweden is true or not it does not matter because there is a huge world out there that It is hard to even comprehend. It does not matter whether the show is popular in one country or it is only being shown in cable TV, the fact is it is shown in as many as 150 countries around the world. The accumulation that it will get is more than enough to satisfy the claimed viewers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Yes the discussion is just mostly rhetoric as both of us can not provide an outside source whether our claim is true or not. I can not provide that there are 900 Million more people around the world watches the Oscars, you can not proved as well your claim that they don't. We are just both speculating at this point. But "Officially" the Academy of Motion Pictures of Arts and Sciences stated that it is shown in as many as 150 countries in the world and being viewed by 1 billion people. That is the only source we can take right now since no one really other than the Academy measures the Award shows. The only thing we can do right now is to write to AMPAS and ask for the following supporting evidences on their claim. Which I am pretty sure many people (press or its kind) have done so before. Which that is why it is universally believed that indeed roughly 1 billion people watches the show every year. As every host reiterate it every year on the show. I am pretty sure this has been scrutinized well before, as they have been saying this "much publicized" figures for years now.</p>

<dd>Anon, note the us of "one of the" concerning how Americanized Sweden is. And it's interesting that you brought the UK up, because it'd be interesting to see their ratings for the Oscars.</dd>
<dd>But Roy is right. We don't need to prove that there appears to be no reliable ratings concerning the non-American world. If I'm not mistaken, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a> is quite applicable here: AMPAS can't reasonably be considered a reliable source about their own ratings since they're obviously partial and, above all, not in the business of measuring ratings.</dd>

<p>That is the best we can do here. Cite AMPAS, since no one really does the measuring but them. The right wordings would be "The Academy of Motion Pictures of Arts and Sciences "CLAIMS" that 1 billion people in more than 100 countries around the world watch the show every year". You can not simply ignore what they say or the information simply because you do not beleive them. That is being bias and not very encyclopedic or journalistic. Bec, the information is coming from a very high profile organization, although dubious to some, it is important to note this. But it was not meant to suggest to the readers that they have to believe it or this is the abosolute truth, we are just presenting information the best we can do. Of course if we can find a "very credible" outside source that can proved AMPAS is lying then that should also be presented.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Dubious to some"? Patent nonsense. I'm rewording the section to say that the Academy claims that its own ratings are sky high, but with a rather harsh qualifier. Any organization that is obviously trying to inflate its own importance is not to be considered a reliable source unless they're supported by independent sources.</dd>

<p>I propose eliminating this section. At first, I removed the section (citing my reasons), but the original poster added it back in (citing his/her reasons). So, I figured it would be best to discuss it here on this page, rather than to have the original poster and I go back and forth with repeatedly adding/subtracting the section. Here are my arguments. There is no need to have a separate Record Holders Section, since that "type" of information is already covered in the Trivia Section. Every single fact in this Record Holders Section is already contained in the current Trivia Section. Thus, this Record Holders Section is, in essence, redundant. It is redundant both generally (to the <i>type</i> of information it contains) and specifically (to the <i>actual</i> information it contains). More importantly, there is no official way to gauge what is the Most Successful Film in Oscar History. We can cite the most-nominated film, or the film with the most awards, etc. (which is all covered in the Trivia Section). But who is to say that a film (such as <i>Titanic</i>) with an 11 for 14 record is the "most successful"? One can easily argue that <i>Lord of the Rings: Return of the King</i> is <i>more</i> successful, since it won 11 for 11 (100% of its nominations). <i>Titanic</i> won "only" 79% (11 for 14) of its nominations. My point is: who is to say which is "more successful" -- a film with less nominations but more awards? or a film with a greater batting average of nominations to awards? In this case, <i>Titanic</i> and <i>LOTR</i> have <i>equal</i> awards; <i>Titanic</i> from more nominations, and <i>LOTR</i> from less nominations. So, it can be easily argued that the <i>LOTR</i> higher batting average is "more successful" than the <i>Titanic</i> batting average. In the end, there is NO formula for -- and no one can rightly deem -- which film is the "most successful" in Oscar history. Furthermore, the original poster claims (in his/her edit summary) that "I clarrified with wikipedia first whether I could add this section legitamely." I would question: did the Wikipedia editor look at the <i>specific content</i> of the proposed addition, in light of the <i>entire</i> article? Or did the Wikipedia editor simply make a general statement along the lines of "yes, that is the type of information that can be added to an article in Wikipedia"? Also, the original poster claims (in the article itself) that "when asked, the AMPAS President Sid Ganis clarrified this and said that nominations should count towards a films considered sucsess at the Oscars." Yes, <i>of course,</i> a film's nominations should count as part of its "success" at the Oscars. By <i>definition</i>, a film with 14 nominations would be considered more succesful at the Oscars than a film with 11 nominations. But, the original poster is comparing apples and oranges (i.e., total number of wins; total number of nominations; batting averages). It is a FAR LEAP to jump to the conclusion that <i>Titanic</i> is the "most successful" film in Oscar history, from Sid Ganis' statement that "nominations should count towards a films considered sucsess at the Oscars." If the President of AMPAS (Sid Ganis) makes the statement that "<i>Titanic</i> is the most successful film in Oscar history," then I am comfortable adding it (sourced and referenced) into the article. Otherwise, I am not. In my opinion, the original poster cannot unilaterally make the broad and sweeping claim that <i>Titanic</i> is the "most successful" film in Oscar history. Does anyone have any thoughts about this topic? Any feedback or input will be appreciated. Thanks! (JosephASpadaro 14:54, 17 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>My take on this is a sort of comprimise. I think the record section should be kept, and all records in the trivia section moved there, it helps reduce the size of the trivia section and make things a bit more orderly. As for the "most successful" garbage, I added a citation needed tag to it and think if it cannot be sourced it should be removed entirely and simply the records listed. The record information shoul just be presented in a factual manner and the reader can decide what they think is most "successful". And if the Sid Ganis quote can be cited, it can be added as a quote by him as it is relevent to the record and made by someone who is relevent. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusseasby_ef8a.html" title="User:Russeasby">Russeasby</a> 17:19, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the input. You bring up a good point, and I would like to clarify my original posting. As far as the "most successful film" debate, my opinion is clearly stated in my original posting above. As far as retaining the Record Holders Section, I don't have a problem with that. But, it would probably have to be <i>in lieu of</i> -- not <i>in addition to</i> -- the current Trivia Section. Otherwise, to have both is redundant. Essentially, every single item in the Trivia Section is a "record holder" in some form or another. I counted 20 out of the 21 current Trivia Section items that can be re-phrased as "the film that holds the record for ..." or "the actor who holds the record for ...", etc. In essence, the current Trivia Section <i>is</i> itself a section about Record Holders. Thus, the real question is one of semantics: do we want the heading label to read "Trivia" or "Record Holders"? In practicality, they are one and the same. (The only item from the current list of 21 Trivia items that <i>arguably</i> cannot be considered a "Record Holder" is the one about the ceremony being postponed a day due to President Reagan's assassination attempt. And even <i>that</i> statement can probably be craftily re-worded to indicate a record holder.) That was why I suggested in my original posting that the proposed Record Holders Section is redundant both generally (in nature) and specifically (in content), in light of the current Trivia Section. Any other feedback or input from others is welcome. (JosephASpadaro 19:19, 17 March 2007 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>Okay, I didnt bother counting the current items in the trivia section for how many were record holders, indeed with the points you make here, I support getting rid of the record holder section and agree its redundant. I would just delete the whole section for now, since the Sid Ganis quote is uncited anyways and all the titantic stats (wins and nominations) are already listed in trivia. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusseasby_ef8a.html" title="User:Russeasby">Russeasby</a> 20:35, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Joseph on this one. It is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> to state which film has been most successful because the guidelines of "successful" have not been outline by the Academy or any other notable source. Additionally, the much-followed guideline (though not policy) <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">WP:TRIVIA</a> suggests the removal of most trivia sections, instead incorporating the information into the article using more encyclopedic ways. Regardless, it is not up to us to say what film is most successful.

<dd>Hello I seem to be the person who has offended everyone by added this section, In 2006 Sid Ganis was asked how would you judge a films sucsess at the Oscars, he of course said that being nominated was sucsess when asked what was more important wins or nominations he said that they both are important. Titanic is the only film to hold jointly both records ie: Nominations and Wins, therefore I would say that the film is currently the most sucsessful film at the Academy Awards. I also think it is important to expand the section to include record holders, such as Meryl Streep (Most Nominations by an Actor/Actress), Most Wins in the Leading Catagory = Katherine Hepburn, etc etc. I think this would be more clear for users rather than small items of triva, in regards to the sid ganis comment I am trying to find a record of it on the internet --Duncanbruce 17:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>DuncanBruce -- Believe me, I do not think that anyone is offended. At least, not by your contribution to the article. (If anything, offense would be taken by your arguably inappropriate behavior: over and over, you simply keep re-inserting the same material that others deem inapproriate for the article. More appropriate behavior -- and less offensive to others on Wikipedia -- would consist of joining in on the discussion and the debate. Which, I am glad to see, that you now have done. And, which is why Wikipedia even has these talk/discussion pages.) We all need to be open-minded. Have you read the above comments and postings? They are quite intricate and detailed and they lay out exactly why at least three individuals feel that your contribution is inappropritae for this article. No one is offended. More likely, we are all people who have some inherent interest in the Academy Awards topic, and want to see the best article possible about that topic. If you have any questions or want these points clarified, please ask. But, for the moment, I will reply to your post as follows. Sid Ganis may have said that "both wins and nominations are indicators of a film's success at the Oscars; both are important." I doubt very much that anyone would dispute or argue with that assertion. <i>Of course</i>, wins and nominations are indicators of a film's Oscar success. That's obvious. The problem (in my view) is that you are taking Ganis' factually true statement and twisting it around to say "Therefore, <i>Titanic</i> is the most successful film in Oscar history." We can ALL agree on how many nominations <i>Titanic</i> (or any other film) has. We can ALL agree on how many wins <i>Titanic</i> (or any other film) has. But, we cannot ALL agree that (due to your formula) -- which is yours alone and no one else's -- <i>Titanic</i> is the "most successful film at the Oscars." That is a subjective belief or opinion. Everyone has different opinions on what would constitute the "most successful film" in Oscar history. I can see that Sid Ganis might state: "both wins and nominations are indicators of a film's success." I can see that Sid Ganis would make the factual statement that "the film <i>Titanic</i> has 14 nominations and 11 wins." But, I doubt very much that -- aside from personal, subjective opinion -- Sid Ganis would take the <i>official</i> AMPAS position that "the most successful film in Oscar history is <i>Titanic.</i>" Now, IF he were to do that, fine -- just source it and include it. But, let's NOT make the broad amd sweeping leap from his first statement ("both nominations and wins are indicators of a film's Oscar success") to the statemnet that "the film <i>Titanic</i> is the most successful film in Oscar history." It's simply untrue and it's simply faulty logic. As far as Record Holders, I am all for that type of information being included -- and much of it already is -- in the Trivia Section. Again, please read the above comments for further details, but the Trivia Section essentially IS a Record Holders Section as it now stands. Please feel free to add more Record Holders information if you have any. I believe that the Katharine Hepburn (most wins) is already there, and I will add the Meryl Streep (most nominations) in a moment. Thanks. Please fell free to join in the discussion and ask questions or for clarification, if you'd like. We are all here to make the Academy Awards article a good one -- and a factually accurate one, free from personal bias and opinion. Thanks! (JosephASpadaro 18:34, 18 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Since the number of categories has not remained constant over the years, then you should also consider the nomination and win percentages relative to the total possible rather than just comparing the actual numbers and batting averages. For example, by rough estimation, <i>Gone With the Wind</i> won 10 awards in 1939, 50% of the total available. <i>Titanic</i>, however, won only 11 of the 24 available, or less than 46%. Mmmmm . . . just how do you determine the best? Plus, I dislike <i>Trivia</i> sections.</dd>

<dd>Well perhaps it would be good to create the records section and state that there is no clear way of establishing what film was most sucsessful at the academy awards, say that Titanic could be considered to be, however then quote and list other theorys which would change the status of that, Lord of the Rings with 100% wins, Gone with the wind with the higher percentage--Duncanbruce 18:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I sincerely do not think it has any encyclopedic value to state that "Some people think that Film A is the most successful, but other people think that Film B is." Let's remember that this <i>is</i> an encyclopedia. What would be the value of adding a lot of hypothetical scenarios which may (or may not) formulate what some people do (or do not) agree constitutes the most successful film (an assessment, by definition, with which some will agree with and others will not)? What value is that? By the way, your strong persistence in naming <i>Titanic</i> as the "most successful film ever" leads me to believe that you have some agenda or ulterior motive -- and that you are less interested in providing encyclopedic information to Wikipedia readers. For some (unknown and unexplained) reason, you <i>really</i> want to get this information in there, huh? Examine your bias(es) and ask yourself why are you trying so hard to get non-encyclopedic information published in this encyclopedia? (JosephASpadaro 19:02, 18 March 2007 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>Isn't the record-holder issue already handled by the <i>Statistics</i> section? This leaves interpretation of who's best to the reader and avoids the whole <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> issue for contributors. In looking at the stats lists I can easily see which films and people did the best vis-a-vis noms and wins and assess the "best" in my own way. Maybe those lists could have their presentation reformatted to facilitate this.</dd>
