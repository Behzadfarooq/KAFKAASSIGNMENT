<p>Officially opened in March <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the Academy of Light is a state-of-the-art training facility located in 220 <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acres.html" title="Acres">acres</a> of land (60 acres dedicated to football) in <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitburn%2C_South_Tyneside_9c07.html" title="Whitburn, South Tyneside">Whitburn, South Tyneside</a> - just north of <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunderland.html" title="Sunderland">Sunderland</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_of_Light_a0c0.html" title="Edit section: Academy Status">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Academy Status</span></h2>
<p>To gain Academy status, a club must meet a set of minimum requirements as laid out by the FA. These requirements are wide-reaching, and include indoor and outdoor training facilities, education provisions, and dedicated youth training areas.</p>
<p>Academy status means that the club can take part in the FA Premier Youth Leagues and play against other academy teams. This ensures youngsters are playing against the best players in the country in their age group. Academy teams also take part in the <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Youth_Cup_c157.html" title="FA Youth Cup">FA Youth Cup</a>. Sunderland have won the FA Youth Cup twice, although the last time was in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Academy_of_Light_Proposal" id="Academy_of_Light_Proposal"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_of_Light_a0c0.html" title="Edit section: Academy of Light Proposal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Academy of Light Proposal</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> Sunderland A.F.C. underwent a rebirth. In that year the club moved to a new home (the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stadium_of_Light_9657.html" title="Stadium of Light">Stadium of Light</a>) and club owner <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Murray_e95a.html" title="Bob Murray">Bob Murray</a> and chairman John Fickling put forward proposals for a new world-class academy that would hopefully secure Sunderland's long-term future.</p>
<p>The Academy was to be built on acquired land opposite Sunderland's current training ground, on disused <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmland.html" title="Farmland">farmland</a>. From the outset, the proposals were beset with problems. Sunderland's training ground was on the green belt between Sunderland and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Shields_2748.html" title="South Shields">South Shields</a>. <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planning_permission.html" title="Planning permission">Planning permission</a> for building on the green belt is only granted in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>Sunderland's original plans were ambitious - amongst them, the club planned to build an indoor training centre and <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hostel.html" title="Hostel">hostel</a>. Local opposition was fierce, claiming that an area of rural <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildlife.html" title="Wildlife">wildlife</a> would be destroyed and the green belt would be weakened, causing a merging of Sunderland and South Tyneside. Sunderland were forced to withdrawn the submission and investigate alternative sites in the region.</p>
<p><a name="Revised_Plans" id="Revised_Plans"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_of_Light_a0c0.html" title="Edit section: Revised Plans">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Revised Plans</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> the club resubmitted a proposal, for the same site as the previous plan, but in which the height of the new developments would not be built any higher than the existing agricultural buildings. New lighting technology would reduce the effect of <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floodlight.html" title="Floodlight">floodlights</a> on the local area, and extensive re-seeding would benefit wildlife on the site. In total, the Academy would have a 12% smaller 'footprint' than the original farm buildings. Despite being recommended for acceptance by planning inspectors, the Local Planning Authority rejected the proposal on the grounds that it encroached on the green belt and risked causing a merging of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connurbation.html" title="Connurbation">connurbations</a> of <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Sunderland_001e.html" title="City of Sunderland">City of Sunderland</a> and South Tyneside.<br />
Sunderland appealed, and following a public inquiry in September <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Environment%2C_Transport_and_the_Regions_2576.html" title="Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions">Secretary of State for the Environment</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> overturned the ruling, stating that the benefits the Academy would bring to the community and region justified building on the green-belt. He was convinced that Sunderland had rigorously investigated alternative sites, and he went on to say that the green-belt would not be in danger, as the site had a smaller footprint than the previous site layout. Following the ruling, the Green Belt Action Group (GBAG) continued to protest against the plans. They felt the landscaping plans would ruin the 'rural' appearance of the area, and the fencing and mounding would create a 'visual barrier' <a href="http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2000/8/10/194488.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2000/8/10/194488.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. One of their biggest criticisms was that Sunderland were 'moving the goalposts', as their building plans were significantly different to those originally submitted in 1999.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, detailed building plans were rejected by South Tyneside Metropolitan Borough Council's planning committee, again on grounds on green belt encroachment <a href="http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2001/6/14/168346.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2001/6/14/168346.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Sunderland appealed, and a month later planning permission was given <a href="http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2001/7/21/164930.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2001/7/21/164930.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Work eventually began on the following facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indoor training areas</li>
<li>Medical, Physical and Hydrotherapy areas</li>
<li>Administration, support and changing areas</li>
<li>Educational facilities</li>
<li>Canteen facilities</li>
<li>Floodlit main practice pitch</li>
<li>Three full-size pitches</li>
<li>one full-size artificial pitch</li>
<li>Two artificial practice areas</li>
<li>Goalkeeper training area</li>
<li>Junior practice area</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_of_Light_a0c0.html" title="Edit section: Further Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Further Controversy</span></h3>
<p>Work began on the Academy in November <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> by Gateshead-based building firm Tolent Construction. However only a month later in December, Sunderland enraged the site protesters by resubmitted plans for further amendments to the site <a href="http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2001/12/21/150948.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2001/12/21/150948.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The addition of an indoor training <i>barn</i> and an on-site hostel were seen by Sunderland to be essential requirements to keeping the site at Academy status. Sunderland claimed that in 1999 these elements were desired but unrealistic, but in 2001 they had been added to the list of essential Academy elements by the FA, and therefore to retain Academy status, Sunderland were obliged to include them in the plans. Sunderland submitted the application in May <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, and in August the plans were reject by South Tyneside council, who said: <i>We felt they were inappropriate for the green belt</i><a href="http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2002/8/12/124913.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2002/8/12/124913.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.<br />
Again Sunderland appealed, and a public inquiry was launched in April <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.<br />
In November of that year, the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_%28United_Kingdom%29_533c.html" title="Secretary of State (United Kingdom)">Secretary of State</a> rejected Sunderland's revised plans <a href="http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2003/11/11/71119.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2003/11/11/71119.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> claiming the new elements would <i>"cause significant harm to the openness and visual amenity of this sensitive part of the green belt."</i>. This ruling came despite Sunderland's argument that similar green belt developments at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_0c9f.html" title="Manchester United">Manchester United</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal_F.C._0a5a.html" title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough_F.C._284c.html" title="Middlesbrough F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> had been accepted.<br />
By this point, the initial phase of the academy had been built, with area set aside for the proposed indoor barn and hostel. The ruling meant that in order to retain Academy status, Sunderland would have to find alternative sites for those elements of the academy, or abandon and relocate the entire centre.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_of_Light_a0c0.html" title="Edit section: Ice rink rescue">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ice rink rescue</span></h3>
<p>In January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> Sunderland City Council came to the rescue of Sunderland by offering the disused <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_rink.html" title="Ice rink">ice rink</a> at the Crowtree <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leisure_centre.html" title="Leisure centre">Leisure Centre</a> as a site for the indoor training area. The rink, in the centre of the city, was leased to Sunderland AFC for two-years. The offer effectively saved the club's Academy status.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_of_Light_a0c0.html" title="Edit section: Environmental Development">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Environmental Development</span></h2>
<p>During construction, Sunderland enlisted the help of famous <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecologist.html" title="Ecologist">Ecologist</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bellamy_05fc.html" title="David Bellamy">David Bellamy</a> to advise in the development of the area surrounding the academy.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/e/t/Wetland.html" title="Wetland">Wetland</a> was introduced, and water used to wet the pitches at the academy is recycled back into these wetlands. A large area of <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodland.html" title="Woodland">woodland</a> was also planted, using a variety of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Tree.html" title="Tree">tree</a> types. The academy area only accounts for 60 acres of the 220 acre site. The remainder is a wildlife preserve.</p>
