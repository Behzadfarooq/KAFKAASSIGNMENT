<p>Info needs to be added about wearing of tassels. In all the graduation ceremonies I've been in, we were told to wear the tassel on one side before we got our diplomas, then move it over to the other either after we had individually received them, or as a group. ---emb021</p>
<dl>
<dd>That tradition depends on the institution. Generally, if you are receiving a bachelor's degree from a place where hoods are not worn with bachelor's degrees, then you do the tassel thing. However, in most places if you are receiving a graduate degree, then you always wear the tassel on the left, even if the degree hasn't been formally conferred yet. Of course, there are variations, but this is the general norm. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmadrid_e3d7.html" title="User:Pmadrid">Pmadrid</a> 16:59, 30 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, this thing about the tassel being moved over to the other side is a relatively recent (early-mid 20th century) US tradition and doesn't generally happen elsewhere from what I understand. Indeed, the tassels on US mortarboards different to those in UK universities - with the former, the tassel is situated at the end of a single cord which is attached to the button at the centre of the square, while with the latter, the tassel itself emanates from the central button, which makes the tassel-switching thing rather more difficult to do. - <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholas_Jackson_5378.html" title="User:Nicholas Jackson">Nicholas Jackson</a> 08:50, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I see that you have reverted my edit to the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_dress.html" title="Academic dress">Academic dress</a> page. I had redirected it to " <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_regalia.html" title="Academic regalia">Academic regalia</a> " since this term is more explicit. It is also the more commonly used term to describe the subject, at least here in the United States. We should attempt to clarify this together since, as it now stands, there are two identical articles with differing titles. Please feel free to comment on my talk page. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroitet_2326.html" title="User:Droitet">Droitet</a> 16:00, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The difference is one of regional usage, but I would have thought that Academic dress is more generic than Academic regalia - in England the word regalia signifies the ensigns and attire of a monarch, e.g. his crown, sceptre, robe, etc. See the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regalia.html" title="Regalia">regalia</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have edited <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_regalia.html" title="Academic regalia">Academic regalia</a> to redirect to Academic dress for the time being and added the phrase "Academic regalia" to the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_dress.html" title="Academic dress">Academic dress</a> article. I assume the term Academic dress is not confusing to Americans? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 16:06, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the United States, "dress" usually refers to the feminine garment. "Attire" or "costume" is usually used in its stead in such a context. Hence "Evening attire" is used to describe formalwear (another Americanism) for either gender, while "Evening dress" would refer only to a woman's outfit. What you might term a "fancy dress party" is called a "costume party" in the US, since "fancy dress" would again imply elegant gowns or dresses. Similarly, "Academic dress" could be confused for the academic gown itself as opposed to the entire ensemble. It is with this logic that I made the initial change to "Academic regalia." Is this term obsolete in British English? Perhaps we should bring in more perspectives. I will leave your edit as it is for the moment, though I do not find it entirely satisfactory. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroitet_2326.html" title="User:Droitet">Droitet</a> 16:28, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While "academic regalia" is more common in the US, "academic dress" does not appear to be unknown: see e.g. <a href="http://www.commencement.neu.edu/dress.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.commencement.neu.edu/dress.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. However, if the basic issue is one of US/UK English difference, then the default position would surely be to leave the page at its original location but provide redirects? There are also six or seven sub-pages dealing with the academic dress of British universities. A more neutral term may be acceptable, but "academic regalia" is too American. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 11:08, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just added a couple of notes to clarify the American use of colors in hoods; they are really double. The velvet facing of all U.S. hoods shows the degree earned - not the "discipline" as stated above the color table. Thus, a Ph.D. in any subject from astronomy to English to zoology gets a blue facing, while a doctorate in public health (D.P.H.) gets salmon pink and a doctorate in medicine (M.D.) green, theology (S.T.D.) red and so forth. Most bachelors' degrees in the U.S. are granted by liberal arts schools so their facings are white. The silk lining, which is visible from the back, is in the school colors (for any degree) as well as the option of the doctoral gown being in the school colors. So if you know the color codes, you can look at an academic procession and figure out where everybody in it went to school and what degree they earned. (I'm associate Faculty Marshal, in charge of regalia - we do call it that - at a small American liberal arts college.)</p>

<p>BTW, "stuff" is standard British usage for cloth or fabric (OED traces it to 1462). It's completely unknown in this meaning in the US outside of students of textiles, costume, etc., so I haven't reverted the change as it makes the entry clearer. - <a href="../../../p/k/m/User%7EPKM_d3e6.html" title="User:PKM">PKM</a> 17:55, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
