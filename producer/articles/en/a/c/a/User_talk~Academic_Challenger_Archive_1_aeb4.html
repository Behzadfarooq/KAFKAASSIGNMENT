--- Hi, I've noticed that you're adding indents to your edits? Please don't do this; it mucks up the formatting (The formatter assumes any line starting with a space is to be monospaced).</p>

Hi. Please see the changes I made to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Johnson_3e8b.html" title="Tim Johnson">Tim Johnson</a>. There are already-existing articles with the names that I've linked to the links you keep creating. The articles you're creating are great, but please use standard editing formats. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> 05:14, 12 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello. I notice you're creating articles about politicians without following the highlighting convention. Conventionally the title word or title phrase is highlighted at its first appearance, like <b>this</b>. See my editing of a few of your articles for examples of what I mean. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 00:53, 13 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, Academic Challenger. Great job adding all those U.S. politicians. As you proceed, I would recommend taking a look at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28biographies%29_010f.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)</a> for tips on how to format the articles. Specifially, the name of the person should be in bold (using three single-quotes: ''') and the person's date of birth should go in parentheses right after the name. Keep up the great work! --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinesweeper_5696.html" title="User:Minesweeper">Minesweeper</a> 04:47, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/c/a/User_talk%7EAcademic_Challenger_Archive_1_aeb4.html" title="Edit section: Adminship">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Adminship</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I saw your request for adminship. After looking at your edit history, I realized that your edit count is low largely because so many of your edits are starting new pages instead of making small changes to existing articles. In fact, you're doing great work as a contributor - I noticed that we didn't have an article on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_L._Ehrlich_96a5.html" title="Robert L. Ehrlich">my state's governor</a> until you wrote one. I think you've been around long enough to be trusted not to intentionally abuse adminship.</p>
<p>However, I'm not sure why you want adminship. I suspect that you're applying because you're under the imression that adminship is some sort of "senior editor" position. That's not really true. Admin powers are used for Wikipedia housekeeping - things like fighting vandals, maintaining the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a> page, and stopping edit wars. You're doing good work as a contributor, but you haven't shown any interest at all in housekeeping. Unless you're going to start doing those things now, you won't get any advantage from being an admin. Also, I'm a little worried that if you did start using your power, you wouldn't know how to use them properly since you haven't been involved in admin-type work before. I suggest just continuing the good work you're doing.</p>
<p>If you are still interested in adminship after reading the above, let me know why on my <a href="../../../i/s/o/User_talk%7EIsomorphic_d99a.html" title="User talk:Isomorphic">talk page</a> and I'll consider supporting your nomination. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 10:07, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand. We all put a lot of time and effort into this site, and it's nice to have people recognize your efforts. Don't feel like you have to become an admin to be recognized, or start doing housekeeping duties. Keep writing good material, and people notice. We need people who actually write content as well as people who maintain the site.

<p>Hi, I've <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html#Free_the_Rambot_Articles_project" title="User:Rambot">started a drive</a> to get users to <a href="../../../m/u/l/Wikipedia%7EMulti-licensing_5622.html" title="Wikipedia:Multi-licensing">multi-license</a> all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> Attribution-Share Alike (<i>CC-by-sa</i>) v1.0 and v2.0 <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_License_4fc5.html" title="Creative Commons License">Licenses</a> or into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> if they prefer.

<li>Salve, Academic Challenger!<br />
I signed up for it some time ago because I'm interested in goverment and have a b.a. in poli sci. I did create a number of articles on politicians that interested me--see <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_Articles_04f7.html#Government.2C_Political_Science" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking/Articles">User:PedanticallySpeaking/Articles#Government.2C_Political_Science</a> for some of my work. I've not been as active as I had been but certainly the project is a good one. Another user you might contact is <a href="../../../a/c/s/User%7EAcsenray_d459.html" title="User:Acsenray">User:Acsenray</a>, who has done much work on Ohio's politicians.<br />
As you can see, Ohio has been my emphasis. Let me know some Ohioans who need articles and I'll see what I can do. Ave! <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_fbd8.html" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking">PedanticallySpeaking</a> 14:20, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks, it would be wonderful to have you write some articles. If you want to write about press coverage and/or requests for adminship, that would be great. For the time being, I think I'll handle arbitration case updates myself, as that's a subject I particularly focus on, although if I get personally involved in the process itself then I'll definitely let someone else take over.</p>
<p>If you write something about the results of the speedy deletion poll, one thing that would be interesting to know is whether it's caused any real change in how people handle speedy deletions. Also, if you encounter any other subjects in your Wikipedia activity that you think would be newsworthy for the community in general, you're welcome to write about those or pass the information along to me.</p>
<p>If you can let me know what you've been working on by sometime this weekend, I'll look it over and add it to the next issue. Thanks for volunteering to help. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 18:18, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The other reporters and I have been putting things on our user subpages; just let me know which subpages those are, and once everything's ready (after any last-minute edits and such), I'll move them into the Wikipedia namespace for publication, so to speak. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 02:26, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An idea for the article about press coverage: It appears that the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> has announced a "Taiwan Encyclopedia" that is going to be edited somewhat like Wikipedia (here's <a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/Arts_and_Culture/2005/01/19/1106100387.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.etaiwannews.com/Arts_and_Culture/2005/01/19/1106100387.htm" rel="nofollow">the article</a>). While the story only mentions Wikipedia once, since they're explicitly adopting us as a model, it could be an interesting story to talk about, such as what they plan to imitate and what they plan to do that's different. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 06:28, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, I probably won't get around to editing them for another 24 hours or so, but I'll let you know when I've finished that. I'm probably going to break up the press coverage piece just a little; I think we can do a separate article on Jimbo's nomination for the Wired Rave Awards. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 01:28, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My edits are all finished and the articles were included in the third issue. I mixed the RfA article into a combined "News and notes" column that also covered new featured articles and pictures.</dd>
<dd>If you see any problems with the articles, feel free to fix them even after publication, of course. Also, thanks very much for your contributions.

I did use the move button, I thought correctly, but somewhere along the way the history has been lost. And the discussion, but that is no problem, since I was the only one who had written there. The odd thing is that in my contributions list the move is indicated twice. No idea what I've done - obviously boobed. Or the programme glitched at the moment I did it.

i'm sorry I had to delete your entire talk page to say this, but I find it a matter of utmost importancy and of dire priority, but unfortunately Wikipedia wouldn't let be an ass and delete your entire talk page</p>

<p>You deleted my article, chastised me, threatened me on my Talkpage, all before I had time to form a response and figure out where to post it. I'm not that fast with this medium yet.</p>
<p>It was not a subjective list that I was creating. It is an existing list put out by Q Magazine in 2002, that I was recreating. It is widely referred to in the music world. It is referrenced in the numerous existing WikiP articles about many of the bands on the list. When someone reads the article about the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a>, for example, and sees that it was on the list, the reader naturally wants to know what other WikiP pages exist on bands that were named on the list, and there are several. The page I was creating would direct them to the other existing WikiP articles about bands on the list.</p>
<p>Other pages already exist like the one I was creating. For example <a href="../../../1/0/0/100_Greatest_Kids%27_TV_shows_90d2.html" title="100 Greatest Kids' TV shows">100 Greatest Kids' TV shows</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_movies_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="List of movies that have been considered the greatest ever">List of movies that have been considered the greatest ever</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_movies_that_have_been_considered_among_the_worst_ever.html" title="List of movies that have been considered among the worst ever">List of movies that have been considered among the worst ever</a>. I hope you don't delete those pages too. They appear quite helpful on their topics, as mine would have been.</p>
<p>The page I was making was in crude form at the time you deleted it, so I can understand your confusion about what I was doing. But, the purpose of my article was not nonsense, and I don't really appreciate you calling it that. I hope you don't treat all of the newbies here like this. It is not particularly inspiring, fair, or nice.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions or tips for how to go about creating a page without creating this problem or confusion in the future, I be happy to listen. Thanks. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanKoppelman_6e3c.html" title="User:RyanKoppelman">RyanKoppelman</a> 03:49, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hello, Academic Challenger. One way to avoid this problem – which many of us runs across while we're still learning the ropes – is to flesh out the details of the article as best you can before submitting its initial form.

<p>Hello, Academic Challenger. Yes, I did block him. You may have noticed that I left him a nice note thanking him for his help in reverting vandalism. Within minutes, my post was pasted onto the PWOT boards along with a note that he was "gaining our trust". I would have ignored this, but the facts that he referred to me as "Cockwork" and that my post coincided with vandalisms of my user page suggested that his intentions were not entirely honorable. Given the situation that was occuring at that <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Pointless_Waste_of_Time_d5f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Pointless Waste of Time">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Pointless Waste of Time</a>, I'm sure you could understand my reactions...

<p>Hello Academic Challenger, I’m an historian working at the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University (<a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/" class="external free" title="http://chnm.gmu.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://chnm.gmu.edu/</a>) and we are very interested in digital historical works, including the writing of history on Wikipedia. We’d like to talk to people about their experiences working on articles in Wikipedia, in connection with a larger project on the history of the free and open source software movement. Would you be willing to talk with us about your involvement, either by phone, a/v chat, IM, or email? This could be as lengthy or brief a conversation as you wish.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

As a general rule, we don't include the <i>apellido matrimonial</i>, the mother's family name, in article names for Spanish and Portuguese people.

<p>Hi there. <a href="../../../f/w/d/User%7EFwdixon_2050.html" title="User:Fwdixon">Fwdixon</a> may well be a good guy and not be aware of it (his newbie mistakes make that seem likely), but his behavior does indeed amount to link spamming (in my opinion, anyway). In several instances he called "vandalism" what I would have done had I come across these articles earlier. I didn't check nearly all articles, but it's pretty obvious that the anonymous accusers have a point. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 15:26, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a>. The links go back to a page with big red "buy it now" links. While there is some detailed information at the top of that page, it is not exactly neutral, either, and the links on the articles here on the wiki don't even point to that part of the page: they aim directly at the "buy it now" section. I don't know that <a href="../../../f/w/d/User%7EFwdixon_2050.html" title="User:Fwdixon">Fwdixon</a> is actually intending to spam, but so many links pointing to the same page looks like spamming to me. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_Stovall_1ade.html" title="User:Joy Stovall">Joyous</a> <a href="../../../j/o/y/User_talk%7EJoy_Stovall_f76f.html" title="User talk:Joy Stovall">(talk)</a> 17:45, August 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Despite this, the links keep being put back and the pages are protected in a fruitless attempt to ensure they remain. There is a lot of talk about concensus but agreement that this is obvious link spamming for commercial purposes hasn't changed a thing and the plagiarism issue which is easily verified is ignored. The detailed information that the shameless plagiarist refers to below is book format info etc that he copied directly from copyrighted books.</p>

<dd><i>the links on the articles here on the wiki don't even point to that part of the page: they aim directly at the "buy it now" section</i>. If you are refering to the links from the various title pages, they point to detailed information on the title in question. If you go deeper into my site (by clicking on the title), you find even more information on the publishing history of the title. So I have some commercial links, so what? The hosting fees have to be paid. Wikipedia links to thousands of pages with commercial content, annoying Google AdSense ads and other annoying banner ads. And as far as having a NPOV, why should I? After all it's called the Hardy Boys Unofficial Home Page, not the NPOV Home Page!--<a href="../../../f/w/d/User%7EFwdixon_2050.html" title="User:Fwdixon">FWDixon</a> 21:26, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether the links are legitimate or not, the anonymous user's current behavior is totally unacceptable. He's running roughshod over the community and he doesn't give a hoot about consensus. Based on the comments he left at <a href="../../../s/t/r/Talk%7EStratemeyer_Syndicate_03af.html" title="Talk:Stratemeyer Syndicate">Talk:Stratemeyer Syndicate</a>, I'm not certain he can even be reasoned with on this issue. I've tried talking to him; I think it will soon be time to temporarily block the IP addresses he's operating from. A few days should be enough to give us time to revert his "spammer and plagiarist" edits.<br />

<dd>I initially spent alot of time reverting edits which removed the links, but stopped when it simply descended into an edit war. Continous multiple anonymous edits aimed at one source really get my goat up and I believe it should be stopped. The user changes IP addresses to carry on his work, and when he doesn't have the decency to create an account and stand by his changes it is against the spirit of Wikipedia. <b>However</b> if I had come across the links, I too would have removed them. They are too wide spread. One link to from the main <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardy_Boys_693d.html" title="Hardy Boys">Hardy Boys</a> page is fine, but one from every book title, which doesn't <i>initially</i> link to detailed information about the book is link spamming IMHO. The <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardy_Boys_693d.html" title="Hardy Boys">Hardy Boys</a> itself article has <b>two</b> links to bobfinnan.com. I won't be reverting the link removal in the future - but I think the IP addresses in question should also be blocked. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilipO_a77c.html" title="User:PhilipO">PhilipO</a> 17:10, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>These are the arguments posted on the page of "Moldovan language".</p>
<p>For these <b>facts</b> many users have been blocked and more forced to accept an unilateral point of view of the Administrator Mikkalai and 16 years old Kid [[Node _ue]]. <b>He does not bring arguments as we do</b>, instead he uses his power <b>to block many times</b> (for one week or 24 h). Like for yourself, he warned you and mock on you saying that you don't have the right to say something.</p>
<p>I agree with you when you say to redirect to "Romanian language". Anyway "Romanian" was once recognized in the constitution as official language of the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldova.html" title="Moldova">Moldova</a> between 1991-1994 and many attempts to remake this were done.</p>
<p>"Moldovan language" is <b>in fact</b> <b>indentical</b> with <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_language.html" title="Romanian language">Romanian language</a>, renamed as a "language" for political reasons by the government. Although similar theories have been fielded for other languages, this proposal is now believed to have been made to serve political purposes only, and nobody has provided any evidence so-far towards the idea that Moldovan and Romanian are not from common linguistic stock.</p>
<p>The term "Moldovan" is also a <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">soviet</a> <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invention.html" title="Invention">invention</a> (see Dept. of State &amp; <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a>). A separate language based on these was declared and promoted for political reasons, in order to further advance a Moldovan identity separate from that of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a>.</p>
<p>The soviet Russians called people of Moldavia Republic: "Moldovan" because they wanted to create a new nation different from Moldavians/Romanians.</p>
<p>There is also in Romania a region called Moldova.</p>
<pre>
Russians manipulated people of Republic of Moldova and washed their brains to create a new person, the soviet "Moldovan". The real name in English is Moldavian, in Romanian is Moldovean and in Russian is Molidavanin. So "Moldovan" belongs to no language!

<p>"The name 'Moldovan language' (in Russian, МОЛДaВCKИЙ ЯЗБIK 'moldavskii iazyk'); in Romanian, limbă moldovenească, or, in Cyrillic characters, ЛИMбЗ MOЛДОBeНЯCKЗ was applied in the Soviet Union, as during earlier periods of Russian occupation of the area in question, to the * Romance language used in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (corresponding more or less to the formerly Romanian territory of Bessarabia, annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940). In reality, 'Moldavian' is nothing else than the *Romanian language as spoken in Moldavia, i.e. both east of the river Prut in Bessarabia (now the Republic of Moldova) and west of the Prut in that part of the former province that remains as part of Romania. Claims made in the post-Second World War period by the Soviet linguists that 'Moldavian' should be recognized as a distinct Romance language were not taken into seriously by western scholars. Under Soviet domination, the *Cyrillic alphabet was in the use in the Moldavian SSR until the passing of a law on 31 August 1989 (i.e. before the break-up of the Soviet Union) proclaiming Moldavian as the official language of the Republic and the use of Latin script. Apart from a few lexical differences (mainly technical terms borrowed from Russian rather than, as in standard Romanian, from western languages), the written language was thenceforth indistinguishable from that in use in Romania and moves are afoot to harmonize the technical terminology of Moldova with that adopted in Romanian specialized dictionaries. After the Republic of Moldova declared its independence of the Soviet Union in 1991, its Constitution (1994) declared that the official language was limba moldoveneasca 'the Moldavian language'. At the time of writing, moves to have this amended to 'limba română' the Romanian language have not yet succeeded.</p>

Evolution from <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian.html" title="Romanian">Romanian</a> to so called <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldavian.html" title="Moldavian">Moldavian</a></span></h2>
<p>Lately were discovered some facts that prove that the theory of the both languages <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian.html" title="Romanian">romanian</a> and "moldovan" - was prefab since the 1812-1918. Some important aspects of the problematics: functioning of the romanian language in the sphere of the laic education system from Bessarabia of the year 1812-1918, the attempts to codyfing the romanian language in conditions of a linguistic situations, causes that determined to degradation of the language compared with spoken romanian on the right side of the river Prut, taking out the name "romanian" and introducing the term "limba moldoveneasca", the intention of the tsarist government "to create a dialect neared to the slavic language".</p>
<p>In the first years of russian occupation (after 1812), because 95% of the population being romanians which they knew only their mother tongue, romanian was admitted as an official language in the institutions of <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bessarabia.html" title="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a>, used along with <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian.html" title="Russian">russian</a>. Gradually the russian language win importance. According to the dates offered by the Dept. for ruling the Bessarabia from <a href="../../../1/8/2/1828.html" title="1828">1828</a>, the papers from bureau were held only in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian.html" title="Russian">russian</a>, and around 1835 it is established a term of 7 years time in which the state institutions will still accept acts in romanian language. As concerning the education, romanian was admitted as language of teaching only until <a href="../../../1/8/4/1842.html" title="1842">1842</a>, after that being taught as a separate object. Thus, at the theological Seminar of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u.html" title="Chişinău">Chişinău</a>, romanian language is found on the list of compulsory subjects, with 10 hours weekly, until 1863, when the department of romanian is closed for good. At the highschool no. 1 from <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u.html" title="Chişinău">Chişinău</a> the pupils had the right to choose between romanian and german or between romanian and greek until 9th of Feb. <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>, when the state counselor of the russian government interdicts teaching of the romanian language because the pupils "know this language in the practical mode, and its teaching follows other goals". Around <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a>, the tsar published an ucaz "On the suspension of teaching the romanian language in the schools from Besserabia", because "In russian Empire are not taught local speeches".</p>

<p>The example below demonstrates that a formal text in Romanian and Moldovan may be completely identical, the only difference being the spelling of the î vowel in the word vântul. The colloquial languages show more difference, which varies over the area.</p>

<p>You just sent me a message asking me to stop posting nonsense in wikipedia...</p>
<p>Well, sorry, but to be honest my point was to illustrate to someone the reasoning behind why Wikipedia is nonesensical in nature, regardless of what benefits it does have.</p>
<p>If it were truly possible I would love to see wikipedia subject to more stringent academic and editorial controls.</p>
<p>Just FYI, I have also personally edited multiple pages in wikipedia because the information was so subtley fallacious. (see: <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perry_Farrell_57b3.html" title="Perry Farrell">Perry Farrell</a> ... who was previously listed as being born Simon Bernstein, which is such obvious misinformation that it has been known as fallacious in knowledgable circles for YEARS... and yes, maybe I illustrate the minor strength of wikipedia in having edited it, but the question is, how many articles are there that remain unperused, and unedited... how much misinformation is too much? )</p>

<p>"Please stop posting the "wikimonger" article. And if you have any connection with DJMooney, who is posting a similar article, please tell him to stop as well. This is not just because it is hostile to Wikipedia. The main problem that is that it is a made-up word and Wikipedia is not the place or made-up words that are only used by a few people.

<p>First of all, I'd like to know how "wikimongerer" is at all hostile to wikipedia. The term merely refers to a certain behavioral pattern exhibited by some wikipedians. It's like saying that the page on serial killer is hostile towards human beings. Or towards earth.

<p>I got messages from him about asking him to revert his user page, and he said that he did not want to. So, what I did is I blanked the page and I left a paragraph in the invisible notes explaining about the blanking and the authorization I got from him to blank it. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Smack Back)</a></sup> 09:59, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your work in welcoming new users, such as <a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmo12456_f091.html" title="User:Elmo12456">User:Elmo12456</a>. When you use a template such as {{welcome}} please include the <b>subst:</b> command, so that the text reads {{subst:welcome}}. By doing this you will insert the text of the template rather than just a link to the template that has to be reloaded every time the page is refreshed. This will reduce the load on the Wikipedia servers and conserve resources. This should be done when using the {{test}}, {{test1}}, {{test2}} etc templates as well.

<p>I must tell you, I was thinking the same thing! However, there are two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The group doesn't have a name yet. Have you got any ideas?</li>
<li>I don't know how I would be able to tell users about the group. One person (who was not in any way involved) has had the nerve to claim that I am spammming. I doubt that he will understand my point of view, which of-course poses the problem of me getting banned.</li>

<p>Hi there! I'm kinda baffled at somehing that just happened, and maybe you can help me understand. I just tagged an article for speedy, which you promptly deleted; I see you also warned the user who posted it originally at his talk page.

In the VFD on Peter Fossett you supported my position to preserve the article, which was on a candidate for Congress in Ohio.

<dd>No, I think the issue here is that "wikimongerer" a word that was coined by you and used only by you and your friends. In other words, it isn't in common usage, whereas "fancruft" is and thus has its own entry. When it gets cited by someone notable (besides you and your friends) and gets a lot more than two google hits, it will be in Wikipedia somewhere.

<p>Hi again Esperanzians! Well, since our last frolic in the realms of news, the Advisory Council has met twice more (see <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM2_d652.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM2">WP:ESP/ACM2</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM3_e83b.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM3">WP:ESP/ACM3</a></b>). As a result, <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_CHA_cf77.html" title="WP:ESP/CHA">the charter</a> has been ammended</b> twice (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=39263854&amp;oldid=33097525" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=39263854&amp;oldid=33097525" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details) and all of the shortcuts have been standardised (see the <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM2_d652.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM2">summary</a> for more details). Also of note is the <b>Valentines ball</b> that will take place in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-esperanza" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-esperanza" rel="nofollow">the Esperanza IRC channel</a> on the 14th of February (tomorrow). It will start at 6pm UTC and go on until everyone's had enough! I hope to see you all there! Also, <b>the spamlist has been dissolved</b> - all Esperanzians will now recieve this update "newsletter".</p>
<p>The other major notice I need to tell you about is the upcoming <b>Esperanza Advisory Council Elections</b>.

Anyone currently listed on the memberlist can vote. In a change since last time, <i>if you have already been a member of the leadership, you may run again</i>. Due to the neutrality precident, I will not vote for anyone.</p>

<p>It was an archive for Licinius's conversations. I did it as User Licinius experienced trouble doing it. It is in accordance with Wikipedian policy to archive past discussions. Please undelete it.</p>

<p>I was puttering around the RC and I noticed this new article Can guzelis. It looks like the newbie who created it removed your proposed tag. It looks like it might be an actual person worthy of an article (I've never heard of him, but that's no deletion criterion), but if the article is to stay, it needs a substantial rewrite and verification. I'm putting cleanup and stub tags on it for now. Cheers. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGershwinrb_747e.html" title="User:Gershwinrb">Gershwinrb</a> 11:04, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
