<p>Is there anything wrong with autograph pages? I really don't think so. I KNOW so. But the main problem with this is the huge "sign my book" on users' signatures, and the spamming of talk pages. <b>THAT</b> is the <b>REAL</b> problem, right? If it is, then just make a rule on the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">Wikipedia:Signatures</a> page that no one can include disruptive links to their signature pages, if they have any. Would that solve the problem? Please respond, and please do not delete the autograph pages themselves. Many, many users have worked hard on them, especially <a href="../../../a/x/g/User%7EAxG_1706.html" title="User:AxG">AxG</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EANNAfoxlover_150b.html" title="User:ANNAfoxlover"><span style="background:lightblue"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="color:black">A•N•N•A</font></font></span>foxlov</a><a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EANNAfoxlover_MSE_b966.html" title="User:ANNAfoxlover/MSE"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EANNAfoxlover_5212.html" title="User talk:ANNAfoxlover"><big>r</big></a> 00:17, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I personally don't think the autograph pages are appropriate for Wikipedia; but I only speak for one user: myself. If I was administrator, I would not delete any of the autograph pages, including yours. There are two reasons why I wouldn't delete them: 1: I would be seriously questioned for such an action; and two: I'm not going to root through millions of users just to find autograph pages. Anyway, from what I've seen, you have nothing to worry about with your autograph page: the MFD will likely close as no consensus or allow; meaning that your signatures, and everyone else's, will remain intact. I agree with you about removing the "sign my book" link on some users' signatures if the books remain; we can do without links to user subpages in signatures. By the way, I also wish to apologize if I've been hostile to you in any way over this entire incident. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 00:27, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not really. But I would like you to post what we've discussed on the MfD entry. I would also like to know if we can make the main point of the discussion on NOT PUTTING A DISRUPTIVE LINK TO YOUR AUTOGRAPH PAGE ON YOUR SIGNATURE. Can we do that? And should I ask the users who have these disruptive links on their signatures to remove them from their signatures? Please respond.

<dd>The content of my user talk page does not belong on the MfD. If other users want to see what we've discussed, they can come here. As for changing the main point of the MfD; that cannot be done. The main point of the MfD is to discuss whether the autograph books should be deleted or not; it isn't about actual signatures. As for users who have the links in their signatures; you don't have to tell them anything: they will be informed if a new policy comes along that says that users cannot have links to their subpages in their signatures.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 01:02, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then, what do we do, when hundreds of autograph pages are in danger right now? We need to do something. Should someone ask some users to engage in this discussion? What should we do? I want to save the autograph pages, get rid of the spamming, and no more disruptive links in the signatures? What can we do NOW? <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EANNAfoxlover_150b.html" title="User:ANNAfoxlover"><span style="background:lightblue"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="color:black">A•N•N•A</font></font></span>foxlov</a><a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EANNAfoxlover_MSE_b966.html" title="User:ANNAfoxlover/MSE"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EANNAfoxlover_5212.html" title="User talk:ANNAfoxlover"><big>r</big></a> 01:07, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Asking users to engage in the MFD discussion would be considered spamming. You say you want to get rid of spamming, but if you or I went to the talk pages of all the users with autograph books asking them to participate, that would be spamming. As for saving the autograph books, you can do that if you want; but remember: Wikipedia is not just about autograph pages. I learned early on that Wikipedia isn't just about user and user talk pages; we're here to improve the encyclopedia, not to make lots of autograph pages. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 02:45, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But how do I save the pages, get rid of the spamming, and ban the disruptive signatures? <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EANNAfoxlover_150b.html" title="User:ANNAfoxlover"><span style="background:lightblue"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="color:black">A•N•N•A</font></font></span>foxlov</a><a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EANNAfoxlover_MSE_b966.html" title="User:ANNAfoxlover/MSE"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EANNAfoxlover_5212.html" title="User talk:ANNAfoxlover"><big>r</big></a> 15:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What do you mean by "save the pages"? The fate of the page is being decided at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Autograph_books_d78a.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Autograph books">Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Autograph books</a>. As for spamming, as far as I know, you're the only user to ask well over a hundred user to sign a signature book. As for the signatures...a new policy would have to be <i>suggested</i> to eliminate the fancy spamming signatures. I could suggest the policy myself, but I am busy with suggesting another policy at the moment. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 20:11, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've quit spamming talk pages. Don't worry. Anyway, I guess I'll try to presuade people not to delete the pages, if I can. Thanks for the advice you have given me.

<dd>You're welcome. As for my own RfA, that probably won't happen for another month or two, depending on what happens. I've got about 3900 edits at the moment, and I won't attempt adminship until I'm at a figure of <i>at least</i> 5000 edits. Also, I want to get more mainspace edits (I have about 1650 I think), and more experience on Wikipedia-pages. As for RFC, I'll be there; I just won't be reporting as many user names as I used to, but I'll still give input for other users who report names there. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 21:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hey, Acalamari, I saw your name next to a quote that she had on her user page.. "Don't put anything on Jimbo's talk page. Acalamari" And, I looked on the talk page, and you NEVER said that, you merely said to only use Mr. Wales' talk page in only some occasions.. I wanted to bring this to you first, and you can choose to bring it up to Anna if you wish.. By the way, your actual quote: "It's best to only use Mr. Jimbo Wales' talk page in special circumstances. The first time I posted to his talk page was close to a month ago when I asked about a reporter. I thought the situation required his attention, as it was to do with the press; Mr. Wales quickly and calmly resolved the situation for me. You see, his talk page should really only be used for very unusual, or immensely large events. Acalamari 00:53, 10 March 2007 (UTC)" If you need to reach me, please reply on my talk page&#160;:) .

<dd>Oh, oops, no, I did not see that.. I did read it just now though..

<p>If we're looking at things from a technical standpoint, then yes, I believe they could -- admins can unblock themselves. <i>But</i>, from a policy standpoint, doing so is widely frowned upon and can lead to an instant desysopping depending on circumstances. x.x – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 02:58, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yea, i felt like my response could have been a little harsh. In general, we are all suppose dto <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume Good Faith</a>. By stating that something is not bad faith (which most of us assume or should be assuming it is not), most of us start looking around wondering who did assume bad faith? (Just the way it was stated seemed accusatory (which I know it is not)). I think that stating it is not in bad faith is a bit reduntant though (in my personal opinion). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 19:18, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If the names were "probably acceptable", why would you have sent them to RFCN in the first place? {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameConcern_47f1.html" title="Template:UsernameConcern">UsernameConcern</a>}} simply suggests to the user that "some users" may find their username objectionable, and they can avoid this going any further by voluntarily changing their name. This does happen, as most people are happy to follow guidelines once they are made aware of them. If they are sure they want that username, and/or believe it would be acceptable (ie, they disagree that the username would be objectionable), <i>then</i> it goes to RFCN. for further comment and input from the community. That's what an RFC is - a more formal way of assessing and resolving a potential issue when simple discussion has not been able to resolve it. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Neil</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../n/e/i/User_talk%7ENeil_9072.html" title="User talk:Neil"><span style="text-decoration:none"><small>(not Proto ►)</small></span></a> 22:46, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>That's easy!&#160;:) It you wanted to link to Cicero, just type in [[Cicero]]. Bear in mind some pages have disambiguation links, so something like "Fergie" would have to be [[Fergie]], if you wanted the disambigatuon links, or [[Fergie (singer)]], if you wanted the singer.

<dd>Just came across it, thought I'd toss in a link at the very bottom to a compromise solution, a separate /Warnings subpage where stuff could be moved off the talkpage if one wanted the talkpage kept clean.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not that it should really be <i>necessary</i>, because as long as the warner left a good edit summary, even just the name of the warning template, anyone can go through the talkpage history, spot the warning entries, and bring up the original postings with all details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But for those who really don't want to make things harder for anyone, archiving them on a subpage is a nice way to show: "Hey, I'm not hiding anything, I just want my talkpage kept for actual <b>talk</b>, warnings are all kept over there."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Or if you need to keep clear and easily found records on a real troublemaker, a protected /Warnings subpage would preserve the warnings from deletion, while letting the user chat (or rant) on the talkpage to his heart's content -- something you can't do if the talkpage has to serve <b>both</b> purposes at the same time.</dd>

<p>Somebody, who thinks he is smarter than what he is in reality, has removed from the Cicero article the sections in "Early life" about Cicero's philosophical studies in his youth. What he/she/they do not realize is that Cicero's importance at present has much to do with his philosophical works. (I am going later to write about Cicero's own philosophical works, - if I ever get over all these reverts after reverts!?) My text about Cicero's studies in philosophy in his youth you can find in "Revision as of 10:01, 21 March 2007".Can you tell me how to add this text into the present article??

<p>Thank you for your sympathetic answer, - I will ask somebody else! Do not worry, I will manage. --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETellervo_c709.html" title="User:Tellervo">Tellervo</a> 17:08, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I'm glad to see that you aren't discouraged by my comments, or by the comments of those who aren't supporting your RfA. I hope that my comments have been helpful, or at least considerate, and I'm glad to see that you are treating this RfA as a learning experience, no matter how it turns out.

<dd>I should probably point out that humour in edit summaries doesn't always come through, as I've told another person recently. I'm not singling you out, but how effective humour is depends on a lot of factors, including how awake the reader is.</dd>

<dd>Since I'm here, I also want to say that it's a sign of maturity on your part to treat your RfA as a large scale editor review of sorts. If this RfA doesn't end up succeeding, please address the various concerns and consider running again in the future. --<a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_4c40.html" title="User:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#8652B9"><i>Kyok</i></font></a><a href="../../../t/a/c/User_talk%7ETachikoma_1ad2.html" title="User talk:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#BA55D3"><i>o</i></font></a>

<dd>Indeed; it's best to use neutral edit summaries. As for the issues on my RfA; instead of waiting until the RfA ends to begin addressing them; I'm working on them now. I think it's best to deal with them the moment they are brought up on the RfA as opposed to waiting until the end. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 19:27, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found quite a bit of vandalism, but I can't find the warning templates to put on the vandals' talk pages.
