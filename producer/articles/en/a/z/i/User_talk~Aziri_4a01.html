<p>Hi, welcome to Wikipedia. I notice you put an <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> header on the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber.html" title="Berber">Berber</a> article. Have you discussed on the article's Talk page what it is that made you do that? We really don't like having those headers on articles unless the person who put it there explains why they feel it's needed. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 18:40, Jul 1, 2004 (UTC)</b></p>
<p>as i understand you good, you speak about the neutrality of the article <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber.html" title="Berber">Berber</a>. as that is so, i will tell that the article is not neutral. you can see that the article is about the origin of the berber not about the berber. according to the source of mustapha may be the berber komed from evry where but not from nord africa. that is one, secondly may mustapha as enemy that article not writen, he saied that berber are small majority in morocco (because andere basset did say it) but according to the moroccan gouvernement there are -+46 in morocco. the article shouwed the berber as foreinges and that is nor sure...</p>
<p>i don't understand why you didn't do it self, because musptapha is an arab. and our problem is with the arab. our names are prohibited by the arabs, our history is maked as taboo by the arabs, the arbs saied that the berber are old arabs. they saied that the berber are bribed by france the berber languages are just a dialct in the arab gouvernement such as in morocco and lybie ...</p>
<p>why did you not saied that the neutrality of the article <i><a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber.html" title="Berber">Berber</a> is disputed and you know that mustapha is an arab&#160;?</i> was this not nonsens to say that the berber are nomadic en the life in saodie arabie&#160;? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Berber&amp;oldid=47781" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Berber&amp;oldid=47781" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and tell me where was you when this was writen&#160;?: ...Various Middle Eastern governments have attempted to settle Berbers in various communities, with only some degree of success .... (i saied always who not know don't have to write, weel learen) and what is this <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedouin.html" title="Bedouin">bedouin</a> (who don't know don't have to be keeper. why was this article not removed , but you are surely busy if i say that the imazighen is the rijgt namen, to say that is not good for the user. who told you that the name may be transled&#160;?) and tell me where was you when any body did writed that the berber are moslim just moslim&#160;? i'm not moslim and the berber of israel are not moslim and berber of the canary island are not moslim . where was you to say that this article is not neutral&#160;?</p>
<p>(...They descend primarily from Middle Eastern migrants who entered the region thousands of years ago and also from the native black African population which inhabited the central Sahara prior to its desiccation...) is this neutral according to you&#160;?</p>
<p>there was also that the arabs brought the civilation to north africa . (i don't find it more).</p>
<p>this are the reason why all the neutrality of articles about the berber are disputed .i hoop that wil geven sensible answers&#160;!<a href="../../../a/z/i/User%7EAziri_7e0a.html" title="User:Aziri">Aziri</a> 14:16, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're asking from me. I have had no involvement in either of those pages, so why are you asking me to do something? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 19:32, Jul 2, 2004 (UTC)</b></p>
<p><br />
firstly i'm sorry for my illegible English, answer&#160;: becuase you did Imazighen remove to berber. but you did can do such as this&#160;: <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber" class="external free" title="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber" rel="nofollow">http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber</a> . and i see also that you have the intersting in the berber, and your question was a proofs. and because Moor and ibn khladun are berber. i tought that you have also the interisting for that. i see also mustapha on your page to remove tamazight languages to berber languages. (i don't know why he may (as arab) write about the berber, that is against the neurtality). if you want also tamazight to remove to berber then is that not very wrong. but if any one will clai that the user of wikipedia won't find the name berber ,then is that also wrong ,because you can make a page such as this&#160;: <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber" class="external free" title="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber" rel="nofollow">http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber</a> . i think that you can say that mustapha don't may writen about the berber , of you tell me to who i have to say that. thanks .</p>
<p>i thought that you are responsible about the neutrality of the articles. <a href="../../../a/z/i/User%7EAziri_7e0a.html" title="User:Aziri">Aziri</a> 13:10, 4 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I should explain that no single person is responsible for writing articles, checking their accuracy or for keeping them neutral. We all do that together. Anyone can write an article on any topic and anyone else can change it. Articles are not removed because a person disagrees with them, we discuss the problems and rewrite them better. Articles are placed at the title which is the most common name in English language usage and "redirects" are set up so that if someone types in a different name, they are automatically sent to the actual article. Does that help? <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 14:43, Jul 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(thanks for the explanation). answer on the question&#160;:"does that help&#160;?" .: yes ,that realy help. but in theorical. the writers don't know very much about some articles , and therefor they cannot know of one article is neutral or not. if you see the first articles on the berber ,you will know they life in other world than where about they write. like there is saied the truth have more than one face . the legend of plato was very important to know how the truth is , the exacte truth of today maybe the nonsens of tomorow. but before it became a truth there must be fighted . take Gualili as example&#160;: when all body thinks the earth not rond is ,it was a truth, but when saied gualili the earth is rond , became he a enemy of the truth . that is example of the inhabited of the cave ,by plato. the church was in the cave, they belived that they live in the real world, but when they other opinion knowed ,they will not belive that. and when deskant saied the truth have may faces was he absolutly righ. the truth of you is not that of my, because there is no exacte truth. the exactly truth has never been . by another it is clear&#160;: the red flower is not nice because it is nice, but we find it nice. and other think the white flower is most nice. and because there is noone who write without emotions and without any aims ,there is also no neutral writer especialy if the writer have many deffirences dots with his subject where about he write. without sencure on the articles the article became a novel dependent of the producer. (the answer is inderict). because my english realy is too bad? i have a first learn the language. <a href="../../../a/z/i/User%7EAziri_7e0a.html" title="User:Aziri">Aziri</a> 11:23, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think you have to learn the language much better than you do now, just put more effort into wirting correctly and consistent, and don't try to do everything at once.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You could start by using capital letters in the beginning of sentences, use a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spell_checker.html" title="Spell checker">spell checker</a> or look words up on f. ex. <a href="http://www.hyperdictionary.com" class="external free" title="http://www.hyperdictionary.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hyperdictionary.com</a>. Then you can start changing small uncontroversial things on f. ex. the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber_languages.html" title="Berber languages">Berber languages</a> article, if your change is reverted then try to explain the change as thouroughly and understandably as you can on the talk page. But take it slowly, put effort into the language, and understand that other people have to understand your POVs (point of views) to consider them, and you also need to understand their POVs. It is also wise to use <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link.html" title="Link">links</a>, document your changes in the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary">edit summary</a>.<a href="../../../d/i/t/User%7EDittaeva_4664.html" title="User:Dittaeva">Dittaeva</a> 07:07, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since you don't speak good English you might understand my French? It is an important language in most north African countries Donc, tu dis que les berberes n'ont pas eu le droit de parler leur langue a l'ecole ou seulement apprendre? En France y a beaucoup de berbers comme les kabyles qui ont quittes leur pays pour la France. Je sais que les francais ont pris le cote des berberes.. J'entend d'une policie d'arabisation en les pays maghrebien.. C'est-ce qui tu parles de..Non? Je pense aussi que c'est important d'utiliser ton langue parce que c'est une langue qui etait parler la-bas avant l'arabe..C'est difficile de combattre la langue arabe parce que c'est la langue de Dieu dans le Koran.. Il faut avoir un etat Amazigh! Peut-etre autonome ou independant..les division qui ont ete mis sont les divisions qui les europeans ont mis. ok in English So, you're saying that Berbers don't have the right to speak or just learn Amazigh at school? In France there are many Berbers who left their countries (esp.Kabyles) after independence due to French siding with Berbers. Are the current policies in Morocco of continuing Arabisation? That's what you're talking about ye? I understand that it's important to use your language as it was the original language of the Maghreb. I also understand that Arabic, being the language of the Koran(of God), is so important in the Maghreb..so how exactly can you stand against this since it is your religion? There should be a Berber nation or autonomous state! The divisions held between the Maghreb nations were put by Europeans(French mainly) by the way I'm an Australian of Mauritian heritage so I speak English first then French and then Creole..<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomsta333_cd6b.html" title="User:Domsta333">Domsta333</a> 13:30, 24 January 2007 (UTC) Oh, I am sorry that I put Islam as your religion..didn't read above!! What I meant to say was that the vast majority of Berbers are muslim and therefore Arabic being the holy language..people would look down on Tamazight..Oh and the link between the Guanche and Berbers is tenuous but I would think probable..ethnic Guanche surnames and the whistle-talk are all that remains of Guanche in the Canaries..is there a relation to any form of whistle talk in Morocco?<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomsta333_cd6b.html" title="User:Domsta333">Domsta333</a> 15:00, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
