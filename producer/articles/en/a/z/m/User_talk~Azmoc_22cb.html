<dd>Trolling seemed rather approriate given your removal of your warning on the edit just prior. All the Anti-barnstar thing'd do would be to inflame an otherwise over story. Why are you hesitant to not reveal your history of editing on Wikipedia? Such tendencies are better known to be associated with folks who have something to hide (say like a record of previous disruptions/blocks). JzG and I just dealt with someone who'd been jumping from sock to sock over a long period of time for these very reasons. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 19:45, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well first off I'm probably not the best guy to be asking for an opinion from on this case as I was somewhat involved but I see Socafan as being on a bit of a mission to "dopify" everyone that has tinges of allegations of doping. Since the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a> folks who are in the know have been rather quick to side on the error of caution relative to editing and libel here on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a>'s actions in this light relative to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html#Reverting_potentially_libellous_material" title="WP:3RR">this section of WP:3RR</a> were right. All along the way JzG documented what was ocurring on ANI and unfortunately there wasn't much response to calls for outside views. Additionally, he did make attempts to engage <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocafan_ad96.html" title="User:Socafan">User:Socafan</a> on the article's talk page and met with resistance in that Socafan kept reverting to his version with some poorly sourced negative details about doping allegations and "guilt by association" text. Doing that is very wrong particularly in light of policies/guidelines relative to doing that. Also Socafan was deleting text of a counseling type nature that was left on his talk page both by myself and JzG... all of this adding up to a bit of disruption. Optimally another admin would have responded to JzG's calls for an outside view sooner and most of this would likely have been averted. I think the lack of a response is partially due to the fact that WP:BLP and that section of WP:3RR are relatively new concepts and admins don't have a whole lot of experience in those regards and as such are in a bit of a tough spot to respond. Under these circumstances I think JzG did the best he could to prevent what he percieved to be unbalanced and in some cases poorly sourced negative information from entering into the Lance Armstrong article. There were at least 5 others who took a look at the situation and indicated support for what JzG did... that's a bit unusual if an admin is truly in the wrong. I'm not sure if you've noticed but JzG's never been blocked for any offense here on Wikipedia. That's a pretty respectable accomplishment for anyone who's been around for awhile on the project. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 23:06, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thersa and JzG are being totally ridiculous. I've had problems with her before, she's a horrible Admin and its easy to see that JzG is as well. If you guys want to bring up an other RfC, I'm right behind you.--<a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakefencer_18b5.html" title="User:Wakefencer">Wakefencer</a> 21:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is covered by <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> because you added to that report in a way that was very tangential and was essentially disruptive of the report.

<dd>It might have disrupted what I said. Nothing else. So I didn't disrupt anyone else's work. I would understand if I was blocked for violating WP:POINT if I was inserting vulagrities into someone else's contris, but not like that. Anyway, screw that. Bye. Azmoc 00:08, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It was disruptive as your addition drew attention away for the valid report that individual made. You were trying to make a "POINT" that vulgarities are allowed. This is true but only inasmuch as context allows for.

My comment on ANI was meant seriously (I mean, that Theresa Knott stated that there is no policy against vulgarities) and the inserted vulgarities couldn't have disrupted wikipedia. You are a little too empfindlich about "disrupting wikipedia", I haven't created a nonsense article because an article I consider nonsense was not deleted, I didn't file in a demonstrative RfArb or something, I just inserted random vulgarities into my comment. That's no disruption. Moreover, I would like to reply to the user who left a note on my talk page. Azmoc 23:57, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The blocking admin started mocking my efforts on WP everywhere I posted something, right after he/she blocked me, which was at 19:12 here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AMiscellany_for_deletion%2FWikipedia%3AJimbo_makes_mistakes&amp;diff=65257926&amp;oldid=65224846" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AMiscellany_for_deletion%2FWikipedia%3AJimbo_makes_mistakes&amp;diff=65257926&amp;oldid=65224846" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which is 19:52, and here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AI%27clast&amp;diff=65258620&amp;oldid=65252081" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AI%27clast&amp;diff=65258620&amp;oldid=65252081" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, which is 19.57, constantly mocking my work on wikipedia etc, although at 19.20 he/she was already convinced that Azmoc=Ackoz <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=65253113&amp;oldid=65252628" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=65253113&amp;oldid=65252628" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, moreover, I clearly stated that <b>Azmoc=Ackoz (3 months registered, ~700 edits, ~300 in mainspace)</b> also by email to him/her, but I don't know the exact time (I don't want to use that nick for personal reasons anymore). Calling me <b>POV warrior with only 1 edit in mainspace</b> is clearly a manipulation, if not personal attack given that he/she knows what my previous nickname was. This is clearly a personal conflict, plus the admin discredited my vote at the MfD with an accusation that he/she knew was false, and prevented my reaction to those allegiations with the use of a block. I see no reason why an admin should abuse his/her powers in personal conflicts / MfD votes. If an admin blocks me then starts pursuing my posts and mocking them with false accusations, the block is clearly unrightful. Azmoc 16:05, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree with the unblock denial. This is a clearly punitive block. Like this, policies only apply when the admins chose so, then it is called <i>policy enforcement</i>. If they chose not to follow the policies and do what they want with the admin tools, and somebody points out that they shouldnt, its called <i>wikilawyering</i>. I will start a RfC against Zoe as soon as the block is over. Greetings. Azmoc 14:47, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

It is only 38 hours. Just wait it out. You can say you have no history of vandalism, but I'm sure the admins are tired of you. You have recieved many blocks in the past.

<dd>Disagree. I have received <i><b>1</b></i> block in the past. How does that qualify as "many blocks"? Again this is an exammple of admin arrogance and ignorance - sorry, no offence intended, but thats why I am <i>tired of the admins</i>. I suggest you check the block log before you post something defacing on my talkpage. Azmoc 20:25, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>According to WP blocking policy, blocks are preventive, not punitive. You may accuse me of wikilawyering (as admins always do when they don't follow the policies), but this is true, I haven't vandalized, and I state I didn't mean that post as a threat that I will. There is actually no reason for the block. Azmoc 20:28, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ah, Azmoc, herein lies a lesson for you. If only you hadn't been uncivil to half the admin corps already, you might be able to find someone who would be sympathetic to your plight. You had a point in your post on my talk page, and I was going to apologize for misinterpreting the situation. Until, that is, I read down to the part where you chose to use hateful anti-gay slurs on the talk page of a gay admin. At that point, I stopped reading and started deleting. Honestly, it seems like you want to keep pressing buttons, and if you keep pressing buttons long enough, people are going to keep blocking you. At some point, someone will get ticked off enough to block you indefinitely and nobody will lift a finger to lift it. Using phrases like "admin arrogance and ignorance" is exactly what I'm talking about. On one hand, you're requesting that admins review your block, and on the other hand saying they're arrogant and ignorant. Do you really think that's going to convince anyone to unblock you? <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 21:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I said he was <i>arrogant and ignorant</i> because he said I was blocked <i>many times</i>. Seen that? I was blocked once. Accusing me of being blocked many times and using it as a justification for not unblocking is clearly both ignorant (as the statement is made without checking the facts) and arrogant (as I cannot reply to this accusation). Using an example of what you call "anti-gay" slurs on your talkpage was only to illustrate the point that what I did before was not a personal attack. I chose exactly this example because of you, it illustrated my point better providing a striking difference between what would be a PA and what was just a POINT violation. I also stated that I didn't intend no offense and why I used this example. And the third thing: Even when dealing with normal issues, POV/content disputes etc, admins are only sparsely civil towards the other editors. I see no reason to be civil towards them.

<dd>It is like this: This time it was ZOE who started the argument - check above, it was him/her who came to my talkpage questioning "why are you here", although he/she presumably knew that I am Ackoz. I responded on his/her talkpage and the dialogue between us lead to me being blocked and him/her following my posts and mocking me. That's why I don't want to contribute to the articles anymore - you spend a lot of time and then someone just blocks you because he doesn't like you. Admins frequently issue <i>punitive</i> blocks, and that goes against the policy. The non-punitive policy has a reason, a block makes the user angry, if someone gets too heated in the debate, you should just ignore him, not block him. Azmoc 08:48, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I dispute your analysis. Blocking is both normal and reasonable when an editor becomes heated: it enforces a cooling-off period. Blaming others does not help, it takes two to make an argument - you seem to be in an argument with just about everybody you come across, which indicates to me that the problem is with you. You are, it seems, an argument waiting to happen. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 10:33, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, if I post a however-dumb proposal at the village pump, saying that it would be better if admins were more forced to be civil etc., and some Zoe comes and leaves a comment like "Yaya, blbablabla... Yawn", it makes me kinda heated. A block might be justified if the cooling-period is needed, but me and zoe were not in a strong dispute, and moreover, you can't really expect me to cool off if I se that Zoe pursued my posts and added "don't listen to him, he only has 1 edit and has already been blocked (by me)" to them, knowing that I am Ackoz with more than 1 edit. That approach will only make me more angry, and I think you could see why if you wanted to.</dd>
<dd>That was for your arguments towards me, now back for the blocking policy: If editors, who actually write articles (like I used to do) are sent to a cooling-off period, they might become offended. That's why the policy clearly states that the blocks should be <i>rather preventive than punitive</i>. I know that the common practice is to "punish" editors with blocks, and the "disruption" or personal attacks policies are also commonly misused. The NPA clearly states, that a person should only be blocked for making PA <b>in extreme cases</b>, and such behavior is better handled with ignoring, walking away etc. Can you see the reason (don't mock or offend anyone here even by blocks) or not? All I am saying that the common practice of blocking for "disruption" or "personal attacks" is not in accordance with WP policies. Azmoc 11:24, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>This is a summary written by users who dispute this sysop's conduct. Users who edit or endorse this summary should not edit the other summaries.</i><br />
<br />
Zoe blocked me and the block was rather punitive, not preventive. He/she has previously posted questions regarding my activity on wikipedia at my talk. I replied (to Zoe) by e-mail, stating that Azmoc <i>was</i> a sock puppet of Ackoz, but I didn't want to use Ackoz (which has ~700 edits, of that ~300 in mainspace in like 3 months) again, as it is too associated with me in my real life. Still, the questioning of the legitimity of my existence on wikipedia continued. The username Ackoz is not blocked, so I see no reason for not creating another nickname (I am not Azmoc to evade a block), as well as I see no reason for my efforts being mocked all the time by someone who is rude and justifies it like "I deal with rude people all the time". Surely being an admin on wikipedia OR having 2000+ edits doesn't make you a more valuable person. Wikipedia might be a good project, but it doesn't save the world nor it ever will.

<p>Oh yes, the admins obviously break the rules here. According to the rules, they shouldn't indefblock me for something like that. But once someone else than admin mentions "the rules", it's called wikilawyering. Quite nice. Azmoc 06:36, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Blanked .. there are policies and rules and there is admin consensus about everything. The latter is what matters + talking about policies is a crime called "wikilawyering". Azmoc 07:22, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Correct. Wikilawyering is where you trawl through the policies to find loopholes to pretend you are allowed to engage in disruption. You aren't. In the end the no. 1 rule on Wikipedia is "use common sense", and if it hides under bridges and eats passing billy-goats gruff, the chances are it's probably a troll. You have a past history of productive edits up to your block as Ackoz. Why not return to that pattern of editing? <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 08:44, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because it's unrewarding. Admins just block too much for too little things. And now I am indefblocked, wherever I would edit, I could become a part of a content dispute, which would lead to another "sockpuppet evading a block" block. So how can I get back to that? I would like to though. Azmoc 22:49, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You were blocked <i>once</i>, briefly, as Ackoz. At which point you changed account, and since then you have done pretty much nothing to benefit the project. Can you really not see that? <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:49, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can see that. But the thing I am repeating over and over is that I don't think that I should have been blocked (the first time). I really did feel offended. That's why I think the admins should interpret the policies (in the sense block only as prevention or in extreme cases) more strictly and don't just block as they don't like something. Azmoc 13:23, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok, you admitted you are being detrimental to the project. Do you mean your first, original block as Ackoz? Because, and I say this with all seriousness, RELAX! It's no great shame to be blocked, the block is long expired, forget about it. But as you're <i>now</i> here to disrupt things to prove your <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, I don't see how we can unblock you.
