<p>In the "Political Career" section the (online?) magazine israelinsider is quoted as a source. I've never heard of this magazine. This doesn't necessarily mean that it is not a popular and reliable magazine, but i'd like to be presented with some circulation statistics, or evidence that this magazine is quoted in better known magazines, in order to accept it as a reliable source. Alternatively, i'd like these links to be replaced by links to articles published by Yediot Aharonot, Ma'ariv, Haaretz or the Jerusalem Post, or by a notable non-Israeli newspaper/magazine. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItayb_5c09.html" title="User:Itayb">Itayb</a> 20:54, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not a magazine but a Zionist blog aimed at American Jewry. Despite calling itself "Israel's daily news magazine, it contains no Hebrew.

<dd>I just have time to spend a moment on this, but a couple of observations. 1. English (along with Hebrew and Arabic) is one of the three official languages of Israel. Abu Ali's suggestion that the fact that it contains no Hebrew is reason for exclusion is therefore not one that I find to be especially compelling. And that is just the easier point -- no doubt there are Russian Israeli papers that could be worthy of inclusion as well. 2. A google search of its name yields over 200,000 hits ... see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-US&amp;q=israelinsider+&amp;btnG=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-US&amp;q=israelinsider+&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-US&amp;q=israelinsider+&amp;btnG=Search</a> . 3. It appears to have articles, not just be a blog, as has been suggested. 4. It has information as to who stands behind it ... see its reference to Koret Communications Ltd., and the magazine's history. 5. Am not sure that today the fact that it is an internet publication is reason for it to be ignored -- there is of course no paper version of Wikipedia either, for example. --<a href="../../../e/p/e/User%7EEpeefleche_3404.html" title="User:Epeefleche">Epeefleche</a> 22:37, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It calls on readers to show their "support of Israel" by giving donations (3) The search I did was using the Israeli version of google requesting references from Israeli sites. I only got 4 references which suggests that it is off the radar as far as most Israelis are concerned. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 23:25, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know whether the user identifying himself as Reuven Koren is genuine. If so, i find it quite exciting that a person of his calibre took the time to comment in this talk page; yesterday morning i couldn't have easily imagine circumstances under which i would be engaged in a professional debate with Mr. Koret. It just goes to show how influencial Wikipedia is conceived to be. In any case it doesn't really matter whether this user is genuine or not, because one doesn't have to put one's trust on a stranger's word when one can easily verify the relevant information by oneself. I've done some research on Koren publishing and israelinsider, and here's what i've come up with:</p>
<p>"Reuven Koret is CEO of Tel Aviv-based Koret Communications Ltd. (koret.com ) and Content Markets in the US. After creating, with Harvard University partners, Africana.com as the premier cultural and educational portal for African-descent populations, and selling it to AOL Time Warner, Koret Communications has focused on creating a network of content and community sites for Jewish and Israeli organizations and publishers, including Israel Insider , Jewsweek, ISRAEL21c, birthright israel, Avi Chai Foundation, Jewish Content, and soon-to-be-launched sites for The Jerusalem Post and The Jerusalem Report." -<a href="http://www.minervaisrael.org.il//s144.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.minervaisrael.org.il//s144.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>This short bio is taken from a page which seems to be describing the members constituting a working group set up by the European non-for-profit organization Minerva. It is consistent with the Koret Communications company's portfolio found on their website <a href="http://www.koret.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.koret.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.koret.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Koret Communications is behind the French edition of the Jerusalem Post. Take the following steps to verify this matter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Browse to the Jerusalem Post's main page: <a href="http://www.jpost.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jpost.com/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Scroll down to the bottom of the page. To the right of the heading "JPost Sites" you'll see a link to "JPost Français". Follow this link.</li>
<li>It's fair to say we're now at the official main page of the French edition of the Jerusalem Post. Scroll down to the bottom of that page. Click the link "Crédits". The first paragraph of this passage reads in translation: "The Jerusalem Post French Edition was conceived, developed [sic] by Koret Communications LTD which is also responsible for its maintenance. Every question or comment is to be addressed at producer@koret.com. In any technical problem contact: webmaster@koret.com"</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Koret Communications' portfolio presented in their site, israelinsider is one of their projects. This is supported by the israelinsider site:</p>
<ol>
<li>Browse to israelinsider's main page: <a href="http://www.israelinsider.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.israelinsider.com/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and scroll down to the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>The bottom line displays a copyright notice, reserving all rights to Koret Communications.</li>
<li>Clicking the "about" link brings you <a href="http://web.israelinsider.com/bin/en.jsp?enPage=EmptyPage&amp;enDisplay=view&amp;enInfolet=about.jsp&amp;enDispWhat=Zone&amp;enZone=Donations&amp;" class="external text" title="http://web.israelinsider.com/bin/en.jsp?enPage=EmptyPage&amp;enDisplay=view&amp;enInfolet=about.jsp&amp;enDispWhat=Zone&amp;enZone=Donations&amp;" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where you can read: "About Israel Insider [...] Israel Insider is published by Koret Communications Ltd., an Internet design and development company based in Tel Aviv, Israel."</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also indications that Koret Communications is closely associated with the Avi Chai Foundation, which is responsible for the current Israeli "Tsav Pius" campaign and is strongly involved in the production of the current prime-time TV series "Merhak Negi'a".</p>
<p>Reviewing the projects in Koret Communications' portfolio, they do seem to be taking Jewish-Religious, a-priori-pro-Israel attitude. To illustrate the second point, the Israel Insider is described in the KC porfolio thus: "israelinsider [...] is committed to communicating balanced and accurate information about Israel, relating to her conflicts, and celebrating the successes, innovations and contributions of her people." Even ignoring the "celebrating the successes" etc. part of the sentence, the fact that Israel is referred to in English as "her" may be indicative of bias. However, even if Israel Insider has biased interpretation of the facts, it doesn't mean that its reporters don't get the facts rights in the first place (those they do choose to report about), and therefore their articles may be considered reliable sources of information.</p>
<p>To sum up. Israel Insider is produced by Koret Communications LTD, which is a notable firm that has managed significant projects, such as the development of the Africana.com site (in the past) and the production of the French edition of the Jerusalem Post (presently). Israel Insider seems to be tending to the Jewish-religious, and to be taking an a-priori sympathetic approach to Israel.</p>
<p>Does the fact that Israel Insider is produced by a big player such as Koret Communications mean that it's a popular and reliable source of information? I suggest to take this matter to some larger forum of Wikipedians in order to establish consensus. I suggest taking this to the members of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Israel_7ad7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Israel">Wikipedia:WikiProject Israel</a>. In fact, i'd like to request that they compile a (not exhaustive, and not binding) list of newspapers, magazines and organizations, whose publications can be used as reliable sources of information in Israel-related articles. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItayb_5c09.html" title="User:Itayb">Itayb</a> 12:40, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good research. If you want to verify that it is indeed Mr. Koret responding, why don't you email him? By emailing the publication's editory ... you can send an email by going to "contact" on the publication's site?</dd>
</dl>
<p>As to Abu Ali's questions, 1) I'm not sure their street address is relevant unless he is going to visit -- if it is to verify who the sender is, he can also email the publication; 2) I don't see the relevance of the number of staff working on the website for inclusion in Wikipedia, and 3) do we require information as to how readership numbers are "audited" of any other source we cite in Wikipedia? I would guess not. I do think that these questions are starting to stray a little. --<a href="../../../e/p/e/User%7EEpeefleche_3404.html" title="User:Epeefleche">Epeefleche</a> 13:35, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

I acquired Israelipedia.com for this reason, as well as Jewswiki.com, which is intended to be the user-content complement to another wholly owned site: Jewsweek.com.</dd>

<p>Itay's research is partial but mostly correct. I should add that in addition to celebrating Israel's success we also vocally criticize her follies. As for calling Israel "her" -- I guess I think of the country more as a lady.... although I suppose that was just a momentary gloss.</p>

<p>The map of a-Ram, which i gave a reference to, might well be challenged as politically biased. It appears on the site of the Israeli activist organization "B'Tselem", and depicts the Separation Barrier around a-Ram. My only excuse for linking to it is this: i could not find an alternative map of a-Ram anywhere else, neither online nor in the very detailed hard-copy maps of Israel i have at home.

<p>1. I would suggest that proper usage is for all footnotes to precede commas and periods (though they should follow semicolons).</p>
<p>2. The phrase "According to" is used repeatedly, and no doubt if citations are supplied for the rest of the article would be used even more. Query whether this is necessary or appropriate, where the reference is footnoted -- especially when there is no evidence of a different view as to the fact in question. No doubt, otherwise, we could start every sentence in this article, and others, with that lead-in, which might not add to ease of reading. --<a href="../../../e/p/e/User%7EEpeefleche_3404.html" title="User:Epeefleche">Epeefleche</a> 22:26, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>In my opinion there is no need to put citation to state where did u get the arabic/hebrew name of mr. bishara nor where did u get the arabic name of A-Ram... The spelling of these names is right, why put a citation? just a thought.</li>
<li>Why did u write that he lives in Nazareth as of February 2007? in all his biographies that i could find its stated that he lives in Nazareth.. although I know he used to live in Nazareth-Illit in 2000 (and i've passed near his house a couple of times) and i'm pretty much sure that he baught a house in Haifa in Hagefen street in 2002. nevertheless his biography at the knesset site states that he lives in Nazareth so i guess this is the "official address".</li>
<li>Most sources doesn't mention the communist past of bishara but its a well known fact that he was a member in Maki (israel's communist party) till the late 80s. he could study in Eastern Germany becoz he was sent there by maki (many arabs from israel studies in communist states like that) etc...</li>
<li>Bishara wasn't the first arab knesset member to go to syria Abd alwahab Darawshi <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/heb/mk.asp?mk_individual_id_t=40" class="external text" title="http://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/heb/mk.asp?mk_individual_id_t=40" rel="nofollow">his biograpgy at knesset site</a> went first and the mid 90s and was not persecuted... Bishara went to syria several times since the late 90s to the 2000s and not just in 2006.</li>

<p>This is not true the original title is الحاجز: شظايا رواية</p>
<p>In overall you did a good job and all the facts in the article has a source</p>
<p>Histolo2 12:58, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>p.s. many of the facts i wrote here aren't documented in online sources, i think the only source you'll find is old arabic newspaper in israel which u won't find online. Histolo2 13:04, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Histolo2, i'll reply to the points you've raised in order.
<ul>
<li><i>The spelling of these names is right, why put a citation?</i> How can a reader, who's never read about Bishara before, know that the spelling is correct? And indeed what does it mean for a spelling of a name to be "right" or "correct"? The best we can do is refer the reader to reliable sources that spell out Bishara's name. Also bear in mind, that since this is a free encyclopedia that everyone can edit, spelling mistakes may not be uncommon. It is reasonable to assume that the readers of the English Wikipedia can notice non-standard spelling of common English words and personal names, but when it comes to foreign words and personal names this assumption is no longer reasonable.</li>
<li><i>Why did u write that he lives in Nazareth as of February 2007? in all his biographies that i could find its stated that he lives in Nazareth..</i> It is not incorrect to make the qualifaction "as of February 2007". Possibly a stronger claim can be made, such as: "Bishara owns a residence in Nazareth, where he has lived for the past XX years." But this claim should be documented in a reliable source, like all other claims in Wikipedia. I guess one could hint at the stronger claim even without an explicit source, by giving (say in the footnotes) a list of sources dated from significantly different times, all claiming he lives in Nazareth. But, in my opinion, we can't "connect the dots" ourselves and write, say, "he's been living in Nazareth for XX years", because that would be original research, which <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">should be avoided</a>. However, this is a subtle matter, and could be brought to a larger forum (say in <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia_talk%7ENo_original_research_2c3e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:No original research">Wikipedia talk:No original research</a>) for further discussion.</li>
<li><i>Most sources doesn't mention the communist past of bishara but its a well known fact that</i>... Wikipedia has a strict policy of <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7Everifiability_9db2.html" title="WP:verifiability">verifiability</a>. If a fact is not documented in a reliable source, it should not be in an article.</li>
<li><i>Bishara wasn't the first arab knesset member to go to syria</i> It's not written that he was. However i'm not sure how relevant it is to mention other people's visits to Syria. If many people think that Bishara was persecuted, in your words, this view should probably be mentioned in the article for the sake of a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, but note that it is not a point <i>you</i> should try and prove by bringing examples of previous cases that were treated pronouncly differently. All you can do in Wikipedia is quote claims already raised by other, reliable sources. So if you find such a source that says something like "Many people in Israel think that MK Bishara was persecuted in this case, and bring as evidence the case of MK Darawshi, who visited Syria during the '80 and was never prosecuted for it." However, even if you do bring such a source, it could still be challenged as biased due to the use of the very strong word "persecuted", which should be supported by likewise very strong arguments.</li>
<li><i>Bishara went to syria several times since the late 90s to the 2000s and not just in 2006.</i> I agree with you, this section is particularly incomplete, and you are welcome to add any missing detail.</li>
<li><i>This is not true the original title is الحاجز: شظايا رواية</i> As indicated, this title is taken from the catalog of the Jewish National and University Library (see <a href="http://aleph500.huji.ac.il/F/CE2S7RPNXKLFDJLKUDKMI5PTU8C8LIUK1BEQ2N15TUSNI6NUM3-01969?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=040701&amp;set_entry=000002&amp;format=999" class="external autonumber" title="http://aleph500.huji.ac.il/F/CE2S7RPNXKLFDJLKUDKMI5PTU8C8LIUK1BEQ2N15TUSNI6NUM3-01969?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=040701&amp;set_entry=000002&amp;format=999" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>). If you think this information is false, please support your claim with evidence.</li>
<li><i>many of the facts i wrote here aren't documented in online sources</i> They don't have to be documented online, as long as they are documented in <i>some</i> reliable source (although i strongly favor online sources, as i explained in <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenwbrum_0eb8.html#the_dialects_of_Akkadian_-_please_state_your_source" title="User talk:Benwbrum">my message to Benwbrum</a> of 08:35, 14 February 2007). Old Israeli newspapers in Arabic would do just fine (although maybe not quite <i>any</i> such newspaper), as long as they are archived by a public institution, like a library. Just give enough details so that they could theoretically be verified. Better yet, also replicate the exact quote. Best, provide a translation to English as well.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, can you verify, or refute, the claim given in the article, that Bishara's bought a house in a-Ram? <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItayb_5c09.html" title="User:Itayb">Itayb</a> 14:42, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK certain points i wrote here were just to give you points of thinking and i know you need evidence to write things in wikipedia... i didn't write some of the "facts" i mentioned in arabic wikipedia becoz of that. Now:</p>
<ul>
<li>House in A-Ram: i remember reading about it in some newspaper will try to look for a reliable source... i think he does own a house there.</li>
<li>the novel: i didn't check the citation for the original title, however both of us are right. according to <a href="http://www.diwanalarab.com/spip.php?article1186" class="external text" title="http://www.diwanalarab.com/spip.php?article1186" rel="nofollow">this article</a> The title is الحاجز: شظايا رواية الجزء الأول وجد في بلاد الحواجز. I think u can manage arabic... Anyhow the arabic version is salled under the name of الحاجز just check the links in my messege in arabic wikipedia.</li>
<li>THe residence: when i edited his page in arabic this was a bit frusterated for me. I knew that he lived in Nazareth-Illit coz i remember driving next to his home ~ year 2000 and i remember seeing security guards (it was the same week when his house was attacked) and then i know many peaople saying (and very sure about it) that he lives now in Haifa. However, in the lack of documentauion of this and due to the fact that all the biographies i could find stated he lives in Nazareth i didn't change that fact. the arabs in israel are a small community (thats the feeling at least) and everybody knows everyone so i'm pretty sure of the fact that he lives in haifa but there is no evidence so it doesn't count.</li>
<li>MK Darawshi: you misinterpretted this, I just wanted to say that this section lacks a lots of facts , especially that it starts in 2006. i mentioned MK Darawshi just by the way. But if u wanna know some other perspective about his visits there where claims raised that he was a messenger between Israel and Syria <a href="http://www.assennara.net/article.asp?id=489" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.assennara.net/article.asp?id=489" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:7Vqf4sNo5IAJ:www.assennara.net/mlfat.asp%3Fid%3D225+site:assennara.net+%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%85%D9%8A+%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:7Vqf4sNo5IAJ:www.assennara.net/mlfat.asp%3Fid%3D225+site:assennara.net+%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%85%D9%8A+%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://www.sotaliraq.com/articles-iraq/nieuws.php?id=13178" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sotaliraq.com/articles-iraq/nieuws.php?id=13178" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> the first is an interview with khaddam and in the latter article there is a mention of interviews (with dates) in which both bishara and yatom approved these claims, you can try and verify them. BTW i'm not sure if assenara is a very reliable source.</li>
<li>BTW He had a kidney transplant, this is mentioned in hebrew wikipedia and in some knesset protocols just google for it in hebrew...</li>
<li>The sources: A biography about Bishara has not yet been written. The only source of information we have is articles/news/interviews about him and some biographies that mainly lacks much information. I think if we had access to archive of local arabic newspaper we will have much more info.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyhow you're doing a great job meanwhile, writing a good article takes much time and effort but so far so good.</p>
<p>Histolo2 22:16, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the complement.&#160;:) Now back to business...
<ul>
<li>It is my understanding that وجد في بلاد الحواجز is either the first book of a trilogy named الحاجز..... شظايا رواية, or it's the other way around. Yet another possiblity is that one of these fragments is the main title and the other the secondary title. Can you please tell me if any of these possibilities is supported in the link you've supplied? Bishara's apparently already published the second book of the trilogy, <i>Love in the Shadow Zone</i>, in 2005. Can you verify this, please?</li>
<li>The article mentions a book Bishara has supposedly written: <i>The Palestinian Intifada and Its Reflections in the Israeli Public Opinion</i>. This piece of information was entered by an anonymous user (85.250.10.17) in the revision of 09:20, 18 October 2005. I tried looking up this title in Yahoo, but i only checked the first couple of pages, which turned up nothing useful. Then i tried cross-searching the Muwatin database (in Arabic) for Azmi, Bishara and Intifada. It turned up a single entry: <a href="http://muwatin.noursoft.net/arabic/searchresultfinal.aspx?MotherForm=Advanced&amp;LibNo=1&amp;RecNo=14334&amp;Content=%20%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a8%d8%ad%d8%ab%20%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%aa%d9%82%d8%af%d9%85%20&amp;RecGridNo=1&amp;RecGridCount=3&amp;FirstTime=True" class="external text" title="http://muwatin.noursoft.net/arabic/searchresultfinal.aspx?MotherForm=Advanced&amp;LibNo=1&amp;RecNo=14334&amp;Content=%20%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a8%d8%ad%d8%ab%20%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%aa%d9%82%d8%af%d9%85%20&amp;RecGridNo=1&amp;RecGridCount=3&amp;FirstTime=True" rel="nofollow">The Intifada and the Israeli Society</a>. I wonder whether this is the title which the anonymous user had in mind. Bishara wrote or contributed to many books, which are not yet mentioned in the article. The only reason i obssess on this particular book is the notion that it might be available in English (or German or Hebrew). Do you know anything about it?</li>
<li>Why is <i>assenara</i> not a reliable source? (It may be obvious to you, but i know nearly nothing about the Arab media.)</li>
<li>Regarding Bishara's kidney translplant: it's mentioned in the Miscellaneous section. Perhaps it should be relocated to a more prominent position. Any suggestions? <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItayb_5c09.html" title="User:Itayb">Itayb</a> 14:53, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The Novel: I didn't buy or read the book but according to the article<a href="http://www.diwanalarab.com/spip.php?article1186" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.diwanalarab.com/spip.php?article1186" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, its a trilogy named الحاجز شظايا رواية and the first book is وجد في بلاد الحواجز. so i think the best thing is to keep the title in arabic just fix the typing error its حواجز and not حواجر. (i know that this mistake is from the library website)</li>
<li>maybe the book is الإنتفاضة والمجتمع الإسرائيلي: تحليل في خضم الأحداث <a href="http://www.adabwafan.com/display/product.asp?id=47891" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adabwafan.com/display/product.asp?id=47891" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> BTW other than Muwatin publications he has published also a few books BTW you can check them through these 2 arabic online bookshops <a href="http://www.neelwafurat.com/locate.aspx?mode=1&amp;search=author1&amp;entry=%DA%D2%E3%ED%20%C8%D4%C7%D1%C9" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.neelwafurat.com/locate.aspx?mode=1&amp;search=author1&amp;entry=%DA%D2%E3%ED%20%C8%D4%C7%D1%C9" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://www.adabwafan.com/browse/entity.asp?id=4916" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adabwafan.com/browse/entity.asp?id=4916" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></li>
<li>Assennara is a bit yellowish newspaper and the late editor in chief at the time wasn't in good relations with Bishara. Bishara himself had a column there in the 90s (before he went to politics). If you ask me I think that most of the things there are true but maybe a bit exaggerated. |ANyhow most of the stuff there aren't relavent for wikipedia except for the interview with khaddam, if i was in your place i would look for other verifications (of bishara's role in messeges between syria and israel) in hebrew media and would mention the interview with khaddam (some people -especially from balad- said that lotfi mashu'r (assennara editor in chief)isn't reliable but assennara renounced these claims)<a href="http://www.balad.org/index.php?id=349" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.balad.org/index.php?id=349" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></li>
<li>I will leave you to decide whats best for the kidney transplant. BTW bishara and anar maor aer trying to make a law that will make organ donations easier <a href="http://youngknesset.org.il/cgi-bin/knesset/2005/article.pl?Id=64" class="external autonumber" title="http://youngknesset.org.il/cgi-bin/knesset/2005/article.pl?Id=64" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/library/heb/docs/sif032.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.knesset.gov.il/library/heb/docs/sif032.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. I once found a protocol of a discussion in the knesset website where someone says that Bishara himself had a transplant etc... didn't find it now but google for it if you are interested.</li>
<li>A question: Do you know arabic? i assumed you did so i gave you lots of arabic resources but when i took a look at your page here i saw you aer level 0 in arabic... but from the other hand most of the articles you wrote are connected to arabic culture etc... so this makes me wonder.</li>

<dd>Thanks for all the info. It's all very helpful.&#160;:) As for my knowledge of Arabic, i guess 0.5 would be more appropriate than 0... I know enough to be able to understand an article's title (with the help of a dictionary), but not enought to be able to plow though the article itself.
