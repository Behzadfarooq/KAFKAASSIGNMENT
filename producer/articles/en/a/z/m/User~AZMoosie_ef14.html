	    <p><b>Dear 'New' Arizona Diamondback Ownership Group,</b></p>
<p>This season started with great promise, yet no one seriously expected a second World Series run. Rather, we expected to see a team play good baseball, a team that had fun playing together, and a team that deserved to be better than just a .500 ball club - we didn't get it. Yes, I know a lot transpired; the Grimsley thing really took a toll, and we probably don't know the half of it. One only had to watch the team after that to see the impact, it was palpable. There were also the usual bumps and bruises, the highs and lows, and the slumps - that's baseball.</p>
<p>But you let us down in other ways that you more directly control. You didn't invest in viable pitching. Brandon Webb can't carry the team regardless how hard he tries or how well he pitches; there are four other guys that have to pull their weight in the starting role and quite frankly, you didn't help the team or the fans in that regard. Then we have the bullpen, a very accurate name in our case. Jose was great, for a short while, but then he hit several big bumps. So what did you do about a serious closer? Please don't say Julio. And where is a lefty to keep other teams honest? You made no real effort to bolster our pitching, period.</p>
<p>Leadership. Much is said on this subject, yet little is done. By all appearances you have let Gonzo swing in the breeze, a fate he surely does not deserve given his contribution to the team over the years. Sure, he may not be the player he once was but are any of us? He is still a contributor on the field and in the clubhouse. Do us all a big favor and work out an honorable, respectful agreement for next year. The other end of the leadership discussion is management, or lack thereof. Bob Melvin may be a really nice guy, he may bow respectfully to the management group, and he may even be liked by many of the players - none of which makes him a great major league baseball manager. In my humble opinion [that is what this note is all about anyway, you are thinking], Bob does not possess a winner's instinct. He has not demonstrated decisiveness, he has not projected a serious winning attitude, and he does not seem to grasp the concept that every game is important. Just watch him on the dugout steps as he wrestles with pitching change decisions; watch his post game press sessions as he eloquently describes how the other team outplayed us today. You rewarded mediocrity by extending his contract without regard to true performance. Have you ever watched Joe Torre during a game when Yankee pitching is faltering? He doesn't ever wait for the third straight walk to yank his guys, he doesn't even wait for two - and he doesn't make it personal. It is about playing the game well and about the desire to win. The pitching staff knows that if they perform poorly, they are out. That is a concept that would be useful in Arizona. I can go on to explore the role of a hitting coach or the role of the coaches and the manager in general when it comes to making clear what is expected from everyone, up and down the line, but I won't make this longer than necessary. The young players have been fun to watch, but they too have fallen into the rut of frustration, which is evident in their batting stats and facial expressions the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Last year my wife and I, along with several friends, started the 'Beat LA' chant from field level near the visitors on-deck circle. After a few LA games it started to catch on, slowly. When we arrived here from NYC in 2000, I have to tell you we were stunned to discover AZ fans were so stonily quiet during games that they needed constant audio/video queuing to react. Of course, 2001 was a bit different - it seemed to be magical. The BOB rocked that fall despite our national tragedy. I want to win, and I certainly want to beat LA, SF, SD, and others. This should have been our home stand to shine. Friday's [08/25/06] extra-inning victory was a great start. Saturday evening we attended the disappointing 4 - 3 loss. I must say that I have been impressed with your willingness this season to whip up the crowd with the visual 'BEAT LA' scoreboard prompts. As the crowd got into the 'BEAT LA' swing last evening, we decided to ratchet things up and started our own 'SWEEP LA' chant - it seemed like an uplifting course of action [down 3 -1] and for a time it appeared to work. I chanted without the prompts, I chanted as the LA pitchers went into their set, and I KNOW they heard me; when Tomko left the game he shot me daggers, but by the top of the 9th we were finally tied up. Others around us had begun to chant 'SWEEP LA' along with us, although my wife had to explain to a few that I really did understand that there was still one more game to play today. Even Nomar's dad had to smile [ I believe he was sitting just to my right across the aisle]. Well, we lost thanks to the skill of Jeff Kent and perhaps a manager's poor choice from the bullpen. Yes, one can always second guess. If you were there, and I did see a few of you, you could feel the life drain from the team as well as from the fans when Kent hit that ball. Right then, everyone knew.</p>
<p>That Sunday's game simply reinforced the general sense of disappointment and frustration, in my case, evidenced by this letter. The total pitching collapse was again obvious in the double-header loss to the Washington Nationals [of all teams] on 09/02/06 - an absolute disgrace. You have let us, the fans, down; you have eroded the enjoyment, the enthusiasm, and the pure fun of attending major league baseball games. It may be too late to recover in 2006 , but you can still make a big difference by the things you do. Look at the faces of your players, young and old, then look inside yourselves to gage your own performance. Are you pleased with what you see, or could you do better?</p>
<p>Respectfully from, Carefree, AZ</p>
