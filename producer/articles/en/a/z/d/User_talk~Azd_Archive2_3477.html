<p>It appears so far, that the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choi_Kwang-Do_9217.html" title="Choi Kwang-Do">Choi Kwang-Do</a> Martial Arts International people do not like the fact that there's outsiders doing things that have evolved from their system. It's only natural and in human nature for someone to take some idea, concept or thing, and try to make it better, go faster, be bigger, smaller, etc. <a href="../../../t/a/e/Taekwondo.html" title="Taekwondo">Taekwondo</a> mentions that there are a few versions of the same thing, in a non-biased way.</p>
<p>I read the NPOV, and the bits about the Abortion debate, Saddam Hussein and Adolf Hitler, and they make perfect sense in this concept of the martial arts.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choi_Kwang-Do_9217.html" title="Choi Kwang-Do">Choi Kwang-Do</a> under Hybrid Styles, the CKDMAI people seem hell-bent on bringing them back to the rank that they think they should have in their system, which is in effect, completely irrelevant to their new "hybrid" styles, which have no current relevance to CKDMAI, except that they evolved from that system, and should be noted as same.</p>
<p>In Jung Sin Yuk-Do, the same user continualy adds the CKD ranking information back in. It's a new style, and doesn't even mention "Choi Kwang-Do" in the article, yet this user seems absolutely obsessed with keeping it about Choi kwang-Do and what they believe, for some reason. This is not neutral.</p>
<p>Hi. My name is Rod Cook, and I have just read reams of information about me, my martial art school and style, with MUCH interest. It appears, after doing a GOOGLE search, that I have been continually editing articles about myself, about my style "Jung Sin Yuk-Do" and about Choi Kwang-Do. This is simply not true. It's hilarious that people have attributed comments and things to me. I see, after looking that there's a history and discussion, and people have been adding and deleting information about me, my style and my school, with much fervour and energy. The funny thing is that they're all wasting their time. Don't they have anything better to do? If anyone wants any factual information about me, my style of Martial Art: Jung Sin Yuk-Do, Choi Professionals, IACP, ISKA, or anything else I am involved with, they can email me direct at info@choikwangdo.com.au and I will respond accordingly.

<p>Hi Adz. Thanks for the offer. Without admin capabilities, you won't be able to block anyone, however if you're keeping an eye on things, feel free to let the admins know of any vandalism we may miss. Non-admins can revert though and that's part of the cleaning up process as much as blocking is. Feel free to tag any user pages of the vandal accounts with sockpuppet notices so we can keep track of the accounts used to wreck havoc. He's quite prolific, and best stopped before being allowed to make too much of a mess. Team up, do what you can, as you can. It's all for the good of the place, and good deeds don't go unnoticed. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 12:30, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sure. Seems there are a lot of overly-sensitive and snipey editors about at the moment (along with a few large-ish rows), so it's best to tread carefully. I've retreated back to my WikiProject Adelaide work. I'll have a look and get back to you.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 06:43, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've made some suggestions at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBrisbane_0674.html" title="Talk:Brisbane">Talk:Brisbane</a>.

<dd>I had fully intended to take up your suggestions about what to do about Brisbane, but circumstances have prevented my being able to do anything about it as yet. I am sorry that I was not obviously quick enough to satisfy you, and you mistakenly assumed that nobody was interested.</dd>

<dd>As far as the photo on the Toowong page is concerned, your comment on the discussion page for Toowong was tantamount to an invitation to other people to criticse and pan the photo, in order to be able to force the photo off the page. That was why I said that it was at your insistence - since you had originally deleted the pictture, and then virtually instructed me to remove the picture from the page, and also invited criticism of the picture from others. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 10:24, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with respect to how things happened with regard to the photo was a consequence of bitter past experience with other Wikipedia users. It would have been better to have discussed the matter quietly and tactfully in private, rather than posting to a more public forum. It was your placing the comments in the public forum which caused the problem.</dd>

<p>Thanks about the map and Arrgh! cant believe I messed up the states, it should be alright now. I really liked the way you expanded the article, I made a pretty crappy start - couldnt find any official info on the regions. It looks alot better now.

<dd>Thanks for the barnstar! that was a nice suprise&#160;:) I put the cities you asked for on the map, hope I got Mt Isa and Toowoomba right - they were on the edge of the regions, wasnt exactly sure which one they were in. The talk page link you can add to your signature in preferences - tick raw signatures and add the signature you want to the nickname field. For instance mine I added this: [[User:Astrokey44|Astrokey44]]&lt;small&gt;|[[User talk:Astrokey44|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; Hope that helps -- <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey44</a><small>|<a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAstrokey44_2cf4.html" title="User talk:Astrokey44">talk</a></small> 14:10, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not clear to me either. Perhaps if you would answer these questions:
<ol>
<li>Is <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Western_Australia_6b20.html" title="Parliament of Western Australia">Parliament of Western Australia</a> a parliament, a house of parliament or a legislature?</li>
<li>Is <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Australian_Legislative_Assembly_c11a.html" title="Western Australian Legislative Assembly">Western Australian Legislative Assembly</a> a parliament, a house of parliament or a legislature?</li>
<li>Is <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Australian_Legislative_Council_0b81.html" title="Western Australian Legislative Council">Western Australian Legislative Council</a> a parliament, a house of parliament or a legislature?</li>
<li>Is <a href="../../../m/e/m/Members_of_the_Western_Australian_Legislative_Assembly%2C_2005-2009_8b2e.html" title="Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, 2005-2009">Members_of_the_Western_Australian_Legislative_Assembly,_2005-2009</a> a parliament, a house of parliament, or a legislature?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>My best guess is that 1 is a parliament and I suppose it might be a legislature too; 2 is a house of parliament and a legislature; 3 is a house of parliament, but I don't know if it is a legislature or not considering it is a house of review rather than an initiator of legislation; and 4 is a parliament, but in a very different sense to 1. As you can see, the current state of my understanding doesn't really lead to a solution.

<p>Thanks for the replies.

<p>Adam Adz and Ambi,</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/e/m/Category%7EMembers_of_the_Australian_Senate_99fb.html" title="Category:Members of the Australian Senate">Category:Members of the Australian Senate</a> contains article on Senators, but article <a href="../../../m/e/m/Members_of_the_Australian_Senate_5da8.html" title="Members of the Australian Senate">Members of the Australian Senate</a> contains lists of Senators for each Parliament, and is not even a member of the category that shares its name. This is counterintuitive and I don't like it. Once category <a href="../../../m/e/m/Category%7EMembers_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives_0294.html" title="Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives">Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives</a> is populated it will have the same problem. And the problem occurs for <a href="../../../m/e/m/Category%7EMembers_of_the_Western_Australian_Legislative_Assembly_31ed.html" title="Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly">Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly</a> versus article <a href="../../../m/e/m/Members_of_the_Western_Australian_Legislative_Assembly_7e96.html" title="Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly">Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly</a>, and the same for the Legislative Council category and article, and probably also for the other states.</p>
<p>My proposal for fixing this is</p>
<ol>
<li>rename articles Members of the Whatever to List of Members of the Whatever;</li>
<li>rename articles Members of the Whatever, 2000-2005 to List of Members of the Whatever, 2005-2005;</li>
<li>rename <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_parliaments_5194.html" title="Category:Australian parliaments">Category:Australian parliaments</a> to Category:Lists of Members of Australian Parliaments (Adam, there is a proposal to recycle <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_parliaments_5194.html" title="Category:Australian parliaments">Category:Australian parliaments</a> into a category that would hold <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Western_Australia_6b20.html" title="Parliament of Western Australia">Parliament of Western Australia</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Queensland_ba97.html" title="Parliament of Queensland">Parliament of Queensland</a>, etc, under discussion at <a href="../../../a/d/z/User_talk%7EAdz_Parliaments_5466.html" title="User talk:Adz/Parliaments">User talk:Adz/Parliaments</a>)</li>

<p>Hi Adz. I use to walk to work past the tent embassy in the early to mid nineties and I am sure that on a number of occasions in the middle of winter that there was noone on the site early in the morning as all the fires were out and there was very little camping then so it was kind of obvious. Occupation certainly wasn't sporadic but I recall discussion at the time about how the prevaling weather conditions seemed to challenge the resolve of the Aborigines. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarglebutt_ee27.html" title="User:Garglebutt">Garglebutt</a> / <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarglebutt_a0ca.html" title="User talk:Garglebutt">(talk)</a> 21:18, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. Even if I assume good faith, it still leaves the fact that both Titoxd and yourself were admims involved in editing the parts of the article in question which, a) throws up the question of whether either of you should have blocked TydeNet (as opposed to seeking an independent admin), and (b) whether Titoxd's 'warning' constituted an actual warning or a veiled threat. You also haven't responded to my concerns about your removal of user comments concerning your actions from your talk page. Then going on to remove my comments and declaring that you will delete whatever you want constitutes an unwillingness to discuss your actions as an admin and to be accountable for them - whioch I find very concerning. I would have also posted this on your talk page however you have protected it. I will email you when I am able to. Once again, I ask that you exercise your privileges responsibly. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a>|<a href="../../../a/d/z/User_talk%7EAdz_3456.html" title="User talk:Adz">talk</a> 08:24, 23 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Since I've just found out that this entire discussion involves me, here's my opinion. It was just a warning: a stern warning that personal attacks will not be tolerated in Wikipedia, but a warning after all. If you look at the examples at <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, you can see that the attacks on <a href="../../../c/u/i/User%7ECuivienen_fddf.html" title="User:Cuivienen">Cuivienen</a> were so extreme that they could actually become examples for that page. However, while I do have an extremely dim view of uncivil editors, if I had any reason to doubt my impartiality, I would not have blocked him myself, as I just don't block editors who are involved in a dispute with me, even though my involvement in the entire dispute was just asking for a source to satisfy the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy.</dd>
<dd>That said, one aspect of the responsibilities of an Administrator is to attempt to prevent disruption to the Wikipedia site and its users, and I behaved following <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Rainbowwarrior1977_bc96.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Rainbowwarrior1977">past precedents</a> that state that "name calling should be dealt severely with". Personal attacks <i>are</i> disruptive, and they are expressly prohibited because they make Wikipedia a hostile enviroment for editors, as they damage Wikipedia both as an encylopedia (by losing valued contributors) and as a wiki community (by discouraging reasoned discussion and encouraging a "bunker mentality"). Cuivienen has been extremely helpful in articles relating to tropical cyclones, so any damage done there would have been terrible. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_edit_counters_Flcelloguy%27s_Tool_0e9a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters/Flcelloguy's Tool">help us</a>)</sup> 20:46, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Copied from my talk page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I looked, and did find Tydenet's comments to be personal attacks. You are not making a mountain out of a molehill, I was also concerned that NSLE had been involved in the conversation. As far as I could tell, none of Tydenet's comments were directed towards NSLE, so I considered it was (borderline) OK that NSLE had made the block, although I found 31 hours to be surprisingly long for a first offence. I'm not familiar with the usual blocks for <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and didn't look at the timespan of the comments to see if 31 hours was deliberately calculated in some way. I was also surprised the warning was only on the article talk page, as I would have put a warning on the user's talk page before blocking him. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:26, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Adz. I've briefly read over the relevant comments at <a href="../../../c/y/c/Talk%7ECyclone_Larry_2e56.html" title="Talk:Cyclone Larry">Talk:Cyclone Larry</a> and the various user talk pages and considered your concerns. Like Scott above, I don't think you're over-reacting – there was conduct that would raise eyebrows. While TydeNet's were certainly personal attacks, I believe the overall manner on that talk page was un-necessarily confrontational. Without focusing on the specifics of what individuals said, I do think that the users involved did not carefully consider their words nor did they bite their tongues where necessary - ultimately only escalating the conflict. However, considering that the initial attacks were relatively minor I do believe the response was disproportionate - especially considering that <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> really only advocates blocking as a last resort or in severe cases. Clearly, neither applied. Nevertheless, I don't think this could be labeled "admin abuse", which seems a catch-cry these days. I don't think there was malice behind NLSE's response. Nor was it resolutely inappropriate to have performed the block himself. Having been part of the discussion, I expect he wasn't fully impartial, and to that extent it was very unwise, but not being the subject of the attack he was still entitled to moderate - at least technically.</dd>
<dd>What does concern me is his conduct at his own talk page. The above surely warranted an explanation if not a caution to be more prudent. That he didn't acknowledge the concerns, and in fact rolled them back, is poor behavior for an admin – though I understand that he may have felt encircled.</dd>
<dd>This comes down basically to a question of where one draws the line. I think the tendency of late is for admins to be tougher on uncivil editors, and this may just be a manifestation of that. With regards to the blanking of complaints, this also depends on ones opinion of the autonomy of user pages. Generally speaking, they can be edited as the user sees fit. However, Wikipedia does not extend a carte blanche and blanking is frowned-upon, sometimes punishable, practice. In fact, a candidate for adminship would struggle to succeed if they were known to blank or conceal unfavorable messages.</dd>
<dd>How you decide to proceed is up to you. I think this is relatively minor, and somewhat moot given NLSE's wikibreak. But if you are unsatisfied with the response you have received, then <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a> is your best bet.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 16:45, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't blame you for anyone else's actions, and if it seemed that I was tarring you with a broad brush, I must apologize for being unclear.

<p>Thanks for the feedback regarding my edits to the task list. I had hoped I wasn't being too bold. I am not sure about the impression a bunch of red links gives.

I think that most of the time I have been placing red links that have turned into stubs, into the photos wanted or needs improving section.</p>
<p>However your probably right about leaving links for longer so that people can track changes and so that it looks like there is some activity. If you want to remove some red links to the talk page then you should but I like the way it is now because it shows how much work is needed, its organised and up to date. I don't see clutter. Instead I think it shows the project is more comprehensive than the other city WikiProjects. I wonder what others think about the points we have made? - <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShiftchange_488e.html" title="User:Shiftchange">Shiftchange</a> 11:48, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can see now that facilitating <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collaboration.html" title="Collaboration">collaborative</a> editing within this WikiProject is important to you. This is what I would suggest. How about two new sections at the top <b>Priority tasks:</b> and <b>Recent activity:</b> The Priority Tasks could contain no more than 3 to 5 articles listed with a sentence or paragraph following, explaining what and how that part of project should proceed. I imagine these would cycle through in a matter of weeks, not staying in the section for many months. I would suggest these initially be minor, short tasks that result in turning the red links, blue.</dd>
<dd>Recent Activity could be for articles that have been edited with the last 3 months or so. If after this time they have no photo, they casually go in the <b>Photo required:</b> section and if they are still are a stub the either go into the <b>Needs expansion:</b> or a newly created <b>Stub:</b> section. These changes would show what is the focus of priority, near future edits and what has been recently edited at the same times as showing how much work which needs to be done. - <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShiftchange_488e.html" title="User:Shiftchange">Shiftchange</a> 23:55, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to follow up on a few thoughts. As a suggestion if we did a priority tasks on the project or talk page it could start with the following,</dd>

<li><a href="../../../h/o/r/Hornibrook_Bridge_6d39.html" title="Hornibrook Bridge">Hornibrook Bridge</a> - remove info for Houghton Highway Bridge entry</li>
<li>Improve Project webpage - add a few nice photos, condense static smaller sections into single sentence, setup a suburb completed meter similar to those on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Perth_38c5.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Perth">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Perth</a> page.</li>
</ol>
</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't feel confident enough to list priority items without discussion because I don't read keep up with all the projects discussion and know the issues. I don't know all the related knowledge about editing policy, formatting, standards and code either. I prefer to learn as I plod along my own creative path.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While collaboration by defining more important tasks that we should work on together is a good idea, it does not suit everyone. I like to treat each entry as being equally important and am surprised when editors get criticised for editing valid entries on topics which they have been deemed less worthy of contributions. My editing approach is a little different. I don't like to commit to any particular set of articles beyond those listed on my userpage. I use the Wikiproject Brisbane page as a guide to its current scope and to then springboard into areas of interest with red links serving as inspiration. I think too much "We should" leads to political debates that waste time and effort. Maybe priority tasks should be listed on the project only after discussion and agreement on the talk page. Whichever way it happens, its all good, the projects got years of work ahead of it, keep it up!- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShiftchange_488e.html" title="User:Shiftchange">Shiftchange</a> 23:36, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To put this simply, I'd rather not re-visit the situation and cause my wikistress to go back over the roof - it's still quite high. TydeNet's block was warranted, and I believe other admins have agreed about that, although the length of the block may have been disputed. He's since had his block expire, and is contributing well, so I don't see a problem there. I'm not willing to talk about anything else, or I may just find myself back on a wikibreak.

<p>There is already a queensland-geo-stub, so there's no need to create a qld-geo-stub (abbreviations tend to be frowned upon anyway). Would you mind if I moved brisbane-suburb-stub to brisbane-geo-stub?

<dd>No worries about the fuss caused - this sort of thing happens every now and again, and there's very little work to be done since you haven't started using it. I think that - since you as creator of the template agreed to a rename - it's probably speediable, too, but we'd better wait a day or so to make sure there aren't any objections at WP:SFD. As to "what else needs to be done", it'll just be a case of deleting this template and making a new geo-stub template and giving it its own stub category (same as is done for the Melbourne ones).

<p>Being as you're the only wikipedian I have a vague connection to (you gave me my welcome message), I was hoping I could ask you a question. The intro section to <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Trombone_Association_8358.html" title="International Trombone Association">International Trombone Association</a> is copied almost word for word from the ITA's <a href="http://www.trombone.net/about/" class="external text" title="http://www.trombone.net/about/" rel="nofollow">website</a>. Does this constitute a copyright violation, and if so, what should I do about it? I read through a fair few wikipedia pages on the subject of copyvios, but couldn't seem to find a solution to my problem (though perhaps I'm just blind). If you could give me a hand, it would be very helpful. Thankyou. --<a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByron_Vickers_79cd.html" title="User:Byron Vickers">Byron Vickers</a> 11:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! You recently asked me about <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Teneriffe,Queensland1.JPG" class="external free" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Teneriffe,Queensland1.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Teneriffe,Queensland1.JPG</a> and why it was deleted. Like you noticed, the deletion reason was "In category Images with unknown source as of 16 July 2006; not edited for 54 days". I apologize that the category "Images without unknown source..." have a confusing name as these categories include both files without proper source information and files without license information. And it is the latter reason why a bot put the image in the catetgory and why I later deleted it.</p>

<dd>No, annonymous edits aren't wrong until proven right. Anybody can edit wikipedia and there isn't anything wrong with being annonymous. That said, annon IPs are sometimes used to vandalise articlies or make silly and inaccurate edits. In the case of your edit, the IP you used had no previous editing history, the change wasn't referenced or explained, and changing the word 'baseball' to 'Marilyn Monroe' appered a bit odd and could possibly have been done as a joke. Not having seen the film recently, I played it safe and reverted it. You may have noticed that I did say in the edit comment that it may have been a legitimate edit and was worth looking into. Rather than posting a sarcastic message on my talk page, you could have just explained the edit at <a href="../../../w/o/n/Talk%7EWonder_Boys_8ad1.html" title="Talk:Wonder Boys">Talk:Wonder Boys</a>. (btw, I don't think there was a need for all the detail that you subsequently added. Marilyn Monroe would have been fine. It isn't exactly central to the plot). - cheers. - <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a>|<a href="../../../a/d/z/User_talk%7EAdz_3456.html" title="User talk:Adz">talk</a> 08:09, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I figured that <a href="../../../t/r/a/Train_station.html" title="Train station">Train station</a> was the best amoung those avaliable, but I too am begining to reconsider. Train station, in the case that I was linking to meant just that, a small station amoung many others. Of course, a better defenition would be a hub, or storage location in which many trains are serviced/stored. I may have to start a few new entries to finish this project. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammerHeadHuman_8961.html" title="User:HammerHeadHuman">HammerHeadHuman</a> 02:27, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
