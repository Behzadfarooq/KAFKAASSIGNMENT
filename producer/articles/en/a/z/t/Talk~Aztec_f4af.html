<li><b>Create redirects:</b> If the article for the correct state does not yet exist, create a redirect to the nearest existing article (if possible) and place {{WPFC|class=Needed}} on the redirect's talk page.

<dd>My concern with this is that, as we discussed, the Aztecs were just one of the various culture groups, tribes, Nahua folks within central Mexico during this time. To say that they were a "civilization" whereas the other groups were just plain <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixtec.html" title="Mixtec">Mixtecs</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapotec.html" title="Zapotec">Zapotecs</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toltec.html" title="Toltec">Toltecs</a>, Tolteca-Chichimecas, is somewhat misleading. That is, the "civilization" there in central Mexico was to a large extent (from my reading) a broad-based Nahua or Nahuatl Civilization. Maybe we should rename it "Aztec Empire" instead of Aztec Civilization? My 2¢, <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 12:32, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I'm not saying Aztec civilization is the perfect name, I just don't like "Aztec" as a title because it sounds like an adjective instead of a thing. It's like calling the article about the Roman Empire "Roman". "Aztecs" is another option. I've checked a few similar articles:
<ul>
<li>"Mongol" → "Mongols"</li>
<li>"Hun" → "Huns"</li>
<li>"Vandal" → "Vandals"</li>
<li>"Visigoth" → "Visigoth"</li>
<li>"Arab" → "Arab"</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So no consistency. I would prefer "Aztecs" over "Aztec" though.</dd>
<dd>Madman's remark seems reasonable, but would we then have to split everything in "Aztec Empire" for the Aztecs and "_____ civilization" for things concerning all the different groups? What would _____ be then? Meso-America is too wide? Mexica too narrow?</dd>
<dd>Anyway, before voting I think we will need some more discussion, and there will probably be more than two options. Or maybe after discussing there will be no need for a vote. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 13:34, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those other Mesoamerican groups mentioned by Madman above would equally merit a description as civilizations in their own right, <i>viz</i>. Zapotec civilization, Mixtec civilization, etc. That they are presently only titled singularly like Aztec is I think no more than a shorthand. IMO it could be better to rename those as well, and make it easier to split them out into separate articles on the pre-Columbian civilizations and their contemporary descendants, as is done for <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_civilization.html" title="Maya civilization">Maya civilization</a>&lt;-&gt;<a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_peoples.html" title="Maya peoples">Maya peoples</a>. In the present case, I'd be comfortable with a change to either <i>Aztec civilization</i> or <i>Aztec Empire</i>, with a slight preference perhaps for the former.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 14:43, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While one of my favorite books is called "civilizacion Azteca", i think the azteca are in a strict maner, a subset of the Nahua civilization. Speaking of the Aztec civilization, is like speak of the Chichenitza civilization, versus the maya civilization o the athens civilizations vs the greek civilization. I like "the aztecs", "the aztec empire" is also a good title... <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 17:47, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the lines between "civilization" and "culture" are that clearly defined. In general, a culture is smaller than a civilization but civilizations can be subsets of each other. For instance, there is "Mesoamerica civilizations which covers Maya civilization and Central Mexico Valley including both Nahua civilization and non-Nahua Aztecs".</dd>

<dd>I get the distinction that you are drawing between "Nahua civilization" and "Aztec (whatever)" but "Aztec culture" is probably a misleading or confusing title. Also, the concept that you elucidate above is not elucidated in the text of the article. It should be brought out more clearly in the text. Finally, while there is an article titled "Nahua", there is no article titled "Nahua civilization". If we are going to follow your line of thinking, we need to start thinking about whether there should be an article titled "Nahua civilization".</dd>

<dd>Yes it should be (sight!!!). Maybe it should be nahua culture, or nahua civilization, and after refering to the comon elements, refer to the specific peoples. Mexica, Huexotzinga, Xochimilca, Tlaxcalteca, Culhuacan, Tepaneca, Texcoco, etc, Some of then are barely knew know, but they were once great cities. Huexotzing was famous for their poets. Culhuacan was considered the most cultived (the aztec tried to marry with woman from Culhuacan, so the may claim they were their ancestor) etc. The mexica became the dominant, but most of the culturale elements not were their own. Like the section on aztec mithology. Most of the gods were common to mesoamerica, they were not just aztec gods. I am trying to write something about it, but i think a should recruit more people, it seems it more than i can cope. Even in Mexico, most of the people knew little of the other nahua people. I think i have became very ambicious...</dd>
<dd>I think the proper analogy would be greece, it was composed of several city states, each one with their own elements, but all speak greek, share the same gods, and writting, and from time to time, one of the cities became dominant. In the case of the maya, None of the city states became completely dominant, so we called simple Maya &#160;;) <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 18:35, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do the mythology, religion, society, and architecture sections of this article describe Aztecs or Nahua? If most of this information deals with the wider Nahua civilization, we could split this article up. It's a bit unfortunate to have such an enormous change after all the work, but it might be a better solution. Using the templates we can probably show the non-expert where to look for the information that would be removed from this article. The amount of work will be very significant though, we have to be very sure.</dd>

<dd><i>Do the mythology, religion, society, and architecture sections of this article describe Aztecs or Nahua?</i> The answer is basically "<b>yes</b>". For example, as mentioned above, the experts can't decide if many artifacts, like this <a href="../../../a/z/t/Image%7EAztec_mask_050910_170205.jpg_c8f3.html" title="Image:Aztec mask 050910 170205.jpg">Aztec mask</a> or the <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Borgia_de61.html" title="Codex Borgia">Codex Borgia</a> (no article, yet), are Aztec or perhaps Mixtec or neither.

<p>Ugh. What a can of worms we seem to have opened up. I suggest that we review every article in the Aztec template and in the Project Catalogue (should be more or less the same list) with the following consideration in mind... Is the text in this article about the Mexica, the Aztecs or the Nahua? Once we get the answer to that question wrt each article, we will have a better idea how to go forward.</p>
<p>My guess is that we need to expand the Aztec, Mexica and Nahua articles to make clear the relationships described above. Then we need to look at the results of our article review in light of the following...</p>
<p>1) To the extent that there are any Aztec articles that are 80-90% about Nahua civilization, we should rename those articles from "Aztec X" to "Nahua X". If there are any areas where Aztec culture differed significantly from Nahua culture, we should mention that somewhere, maybe in the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> article.</p>
<p>2) To the extent that there are (or should be) any articles specifically about the Mexica rather than about the Aztecs, we should rename those articles from "Aztec X" to "Mexica X". I don't think there are any articles that fall into this category but we should at least ask the question.</p>
<p>Of course, renaming articles isn't enough. We will have to go through each article and make sure that the right name is being used. Hopefully, this will mostly happen in articles like <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_religion.html" title="Aztec religion">Aztec religion</a> and <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_mythology.html" title="Aztec mythology">Aztec mythology</a>.</p>
<p>One final consideration... no matter what happens, we need to have an article like <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> which has "Aztec" in the title and is about what people understand to be the Aztecs. <i>{Agreed <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 22:15, 18 May 2006 (UTC))</i> We can educate the reader along the way but we must not suddenly say "Oh, even though you think Aztec in your head, you're wrong, you should say Mexica or Nahua instead."</p>
<dl>
<dd>I also agree on this... I myself took time to discover the diferences and reevaluate what i have (miss)learned ins school. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 04:04, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thus, the Aztec article should talk about Aztec religion and then say something like "The Aztec religion was pretty much the same as the religion for all Nahuas. main article is Nahua religion". Where it's the same, say it's the same. Where it's different, explain the difference.</p>

<dd>Mainly. the aproach to give the aztecs the duty to maintain the world, the overenphasis on wars and human sacrifice. The transformation of their local (Huitzilopochtli, Coatlicue, Coyolxaucli etc) gods into greater gods similar to the old gods. etc. I have tried to write about this, but i still can find the right aproach. And then.. i have a lot of work this days, so i will be of little help for a couple of weeks.. &#160;:( <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 04:04, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In general, I agree with this approach. In my work on <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_codices.html" title="Aztec codices">Aztec codices</a>, I finally had to break down the ==See also== links into Aztec and non-Aztec, although they all were pretty much the same in terms of outlook, purpose, gods, calendars, glyphs, heroes, culture, etc. That's why I set up a category (the first category I've created, by the way) called <a href="../../../m/e/s/Category%7EMesoamerican_codices_cf05.html" title="Category:Mesoamerican codices">Category:Mesoamerican codices</a>. The term "Mesoamerica" would be a nice candidate in addition to "Aztec" and "Nahua", but for the fact that it includes the Maya as well (something you wondered about early in your Wikipedia career, I believe, Richard). <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 22:15, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes i is really a can of worms... when i started to edit the aztecs article, i was hoping to give just a general impresion, but now with all the work you have done, I thinks it has became an very important source. So i think it will worth the work. I has became a very ambitious work!!!. Now, the best way of diferenciate the groups is by their language. The main languages spoken in Mesoamerica were: Maya (Quiche-tzutujil-cakchiquel), nahuatl, mixteco/zapoteco (originally they were two separate cultures..), Otomi, etc (i am omiting something.. but i don remember the others). Each language contribute to give untity... The problem is when we dont know what language was sopken, like Olemcs , Teotihuacan, or Cuicuilco... ugh...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the case of Mixteca... the problem is something like happened to the phoenicians. Aztecs like so much Mixtec craft, that they imported artisans to Tenochtitlan and request certain styles. The also like the mixtec codex, so some of them were make by Mixteca, In the later days, Aztec woman (of high society) started to use Mixtec clothing, specifically the quexquemetl. It was wored over their traditional "huipil", and much comented by the women who could not afort such imported goods... In the case of the Phoenician, they imported and duplicate art form other people, so archeologis have trouble idientifiyin the prhoenician productions...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Usually archeologis have not problem identifing mixtec and aztec artifacts.. but other were made for "exportation" and that is when the problems start. Alos, the production of craft was an impaortan part of the Mexioca economy, and they also made pieces for "export"... <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 04:04, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've put in what Nanahuatzin wrote but it's fragmentary and doesn't tell the full story. I'm thinking that the section on "Aztec society" should be moved up to the top of the article because, when it's done, it's going to tell an important story about the relationship of the Mixteca, the Aztecs and other Mesoamerican cultures.</dd>

<dd>Here's a question that I still can't get straight in my head: The Mixtecs spoke Mixteca so they are not a Nahua people. Yet, the Aztecs admired them. Are the Mixtecs then non-Nahua members of the Aztec Empire? What other non-Nahua cultures got conquered by the Aztecs and are considered part of the Aztec Empire?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second question: Who are the Nahua-speaking members of the Aztec empire? The Triple Alliance, right? That is, the Mexica( Tenochtitlan), Texcoco and Tlacopán. The Tlaxcala also spoke Nahua, right? Are there any others?</dd>

<dd>I kwnow, and i am starting to fell inadecuate... I have learned all this in fragmentary form, and until now i have never tried to give some cohesion. The Mixtec conquered the zapoteca, and almost absorbed them, so we speack og "mixteco /zapoteca" culture, ( even if zapoteca is a distinct language from mixteca (my grandmother spoked zapoteca, is a beatifull language, i only know a few fragments). Then Ahuízotl, conquered them in 1486, and they had to pay tribute. The Mixtec is between the oldest civilizations of mesoamerica, and the aztec knew it. BUT.... Mixteca is the name the nahua gave them... they called themselves "Nuu Savi" (sounds familiar&#160;?). A lot of names we have are the names given by the nahua to other culture, so this ads to the confusion. The same like many historic names in asia are the names the greek gave to them...</dd>

The huasteco had rituals that included heavy drinking (forbitten in aztec society) and males used to go with exposed genitals (also forbiten by the aztec society...) som of the few erotic nahua tales knonw, involved huastecos.

<dd>A most interesting and fruitful discussion, and quite illustrative of the richness and complexity of Mesoamerican history and cultures. There are well over a hundred distinct archaeological and cultural complexes which have flourished in the region at some point in the last 3500 years or more, and many of these share in a common heritage (by descent or cultural diffusion) to some degree, while also maintaining their distinctive characteristics. Over time, each of them deserve their own representation in wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>This issue of the intermingling of history and tradition found in the region is one of the main prompts behind setting up the proposed <a href="../../../m/e/s/WP%7EMESO_176a.html" title="WP:MESO">WP:MESO</a> Wikiproject (parent to <a href="../../../a/z/t/WP%7EAZTEC_be17.html" title="WP:AZTEC">WP:AZTEC</a> and child of WP:PRECOLUMBIAN), from earlier discussions on <a href="../../../m/a/y/Talk%7EMaya_civilization_7308.html" title="Talk:Maya civilization">talk:Maya civilization</a>. It's still being knocked into shape, but I expect that it will define a need for an overarching series of articles at the Mesoamerican regional level (eg Mesoamerican history, Mesoamerican mythology,Mesoamerican technology, <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesoamerican_calendars.html" title="Mesoamerican calendars">Mesoamerican calendars</a>, etc). These can address the commonalities and differences in an overall way. Underneath this structure, similar series of articles for specific civilizations/cultures can give the detailed "local" view, while maintaining links with other related cultures.</dd>
<dd>Similarly, there is scope for identifying some sort of hierarchy for subsets of Mesoamerica, such as the Central Mexico-Nahua-Mexica-Aztec distinctions, per suggestion of Richard and others. As noted above, a great number of deities (for example) are common to Central Mexico (ie are not exclusively 'Aztec') and also have their counterparts further afield.</dd>
<dd>As to the question at hand (name of this article), there's a case for it to be <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_Empire_6712.html" title="Aztec Empire">Aztec Empire</a>, since the article is mainly concerned with describing the people and accomplishments since the founding of Tenochtitlan. On the other hand, maybe <i>Aztec Empire</i> is best reserved as a synonym for the Triple Alliance (ie description of the state and its apparatus, rather than in general). <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_civilization.html" title="Aztec civilization">Aztec civilization</a> might then be more appropriate.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 05:19, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand the suggestion to move the discussion to the project. The logical place would be Wikipedia:Wikiproject Aztec/Strategy although experience on another project suggests that people like to talk on the Talk pages rather than on the project pages. Let's hear what Nanahuatzin and Madman2001 think</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding other projects (specifically "higher ones"), the problem is that this issue is really about the Central Mexico Valley. The next "higher" project is <a href="../../../m/e/s/WP%7EMESO_176a.html" title="WP:MESO">WP:MESO</a> which is basically all of Mexico (Aztec, Maya, Mixtec, Olmec, etc.). I think this issue is only about Central Mexico Valley cultures, specifically those that were under Aztec domination. If that's true, then <a href="../../../a/z/t/WP%7EAZTEC_be17.html" title="WP:AZTEC">WP:AZTEC</a> is where the discussion should stay. We should welcome comments from other projects but I don't know of a "higher" project that would be more appropriate than <a href="../../../a/z/t/WP%7EAZTEC_be17.html" title="WP:AZTEC">WP:AZTEC</a></dd>

<dd>Thank you for your contribution. I'm not sure why it was deleted and I personally feel that people who delete the contributions of others owe the original editor an explanation. I didn't delete your text but here's my guess as to why it was deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The meaning of the word "Aztec" is explained lower in the article so the position you put it in is the wrong place. Moreover, the explanation provided lower in the article is different from yours and your source answers.com is not a great source since much of the content there comes from Wikipedia and thus Wikipedia could wind up referencing itself. Finally, one of the current editors of this article is a speaker of Nahuatl which is the original language of the Aztecs. We feel that his knowledge of the orginal meaning of Aztec is fairly reliable. If you can provide better documentation to prove that your meaning is superior to his, we can debate it. Otherwise, I suggest that you defer to his expertise.</dd>

<dd>I've been a little busy and probably will be for a while longer. Anyway, I think we're close to GA status, but – apart from the changes Madman still wants to do – I would try to add some in-text references. We probably all have a few sources that can be used, just go through the article, find an unsourced paragraph and see what your source has to say about it. Very likely the source can then be used in the article, if there are no gross inaccuracies in our text. I will try to do a bit by the end of this week. It's not something that adds a lot of value for the average reader, but it's a strict requirement for <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a>.

<dd>Ah, one more thing: the name. I believe there was agreement that it shouldn't remain at <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a>, but rather for example <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_civilization.html" title="Aztec civilization">Aztec civilization</a>. Then the whole Aztec/Nahuatl discussion started, but I think it doesn't mean anything is wrong with this article, rather that we could make it more general by putting some information under Nahuatl articles instead of Aztec articles. So I would propose we change the name anyway and sort the rest out later. Btw, to get featured we will have to sort it out for good, one of the requirements is that the article is stable. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 08:15, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been reviewing <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a>, and determined it to meet the qualifications for GA status. The one the article seems weakest on at the moment is <i>stability</i>, though things seem to have settled down for now.</p>
<p>I had a few suggestions for further improvement, but it seems like the main editors already have them in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>More inline citations. It seems like the article is well referenced, but I wasn't clear what citations refered to what facts. Particularly in some of the History section, there seems to be a vacuum of references. Now, some of the primary sources may deal with this information, but some of the more poignant facts could probably use an inline citation.</li>
<li>Clarification of terminology. After having read the article, I, as someone who has only a basic knowledge of Aztec history, am not entirely clear on when one should use the terms Mexica, Aztec, or Nahua, and I'm not sure if their usage is consistent throughout the article. The Nomenclature section makes an attempt to clear this up, but simple guidelines for usage seem to be lost in complex etymology descriptions. The section could probably be a little more clear to assist reader comprehension.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article is in good shape, and has come a long way recently. I'm comfortable with GA status, and think that, with continued effort and the resolving of core issues (like the name of the article), the article could contend for FA status.

<dd>The fortunate player that could throw the ball in the stone ring, have the right to take the fine blankets of the public, so a point was ussually followed by general laughter and running of the public.

<dd>Betting on the results of the ball game and in the game of patolli was common. People cold bet anything, including his/her liberty. The patolli game seem to had been very adictive and was critisized by the elders.</dd>

<dd>The aztec enjoyed dramatic representations, they were staged representations of their legends, and ussually included singers, dancers, acrobats, clowns and dwarfs. There was two dedicated spaces for this.</dd>

<dd>mmhhh.. it seems is the result of too much cleaning, i don´t remeber what was the original...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While not all historians agree on this , Tlacaelel reformed the aztec state, he create a lot of the institutions, and the order to burn their history books (from Tenochtitlan and provinces under aztec ruling). He claimed (acording aztec sources) that they were full fo lies and because that people had been considered gods, when they were not. After that he had the oportunity to rewrite azte history, so instead of being the most poor and ignorant the the original nahua tribes, they could claimed to be the inheritors of the Toltec culture.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The problem is that we do not know if the legends, that claim they arrived as the last and poor of the "nahuatlaca" tribes are true, since there is no archeological record of it.</dd>

<p>Laurete sejourne, antropologist has written some beatifull books about aztec and mesaomerican spirituality, unfortunatelly, some people has transformed it (without her aptoval) ina religious movement, the most notorious is Antonio Velazco.</p>
<p>Antonio Velasco Piña wrote three books, "Tlacaelel, El Azteca entre los Aztecas", "La mujer dormida debe dara a luz", and "Regina". When mixed with the currents of the Neopaganims, these books resulted in a new rreligious movement called "mexicanista". This movement, called for a return to the aztec spirituality, with this return, Mexico will became the next center of power... I mixes mesaomerican cults, with hindu esoterism. This was very popular in the 90,s. and while i have not hear about then recentrly, i am shure are still here.</p>
<p>This movement takes Tlacaelel as profet, and sya taht "the kundalini snake under the earth, will move to Mexico city, so i will became the next center of power". In his book Regina, trnasform the studentds masacre of 1968 in Mexico in a religious movement, and REgina, a "fake) lider of the movement is called a <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakini.html" title="Dakini">dakini</a>...</p>

<p>—<b>This information is very inaccurate</b>. Velazco and mesoamerican is misspelled, Antonio Velasco Piña has written at least twelve books, he didn't write "La mujer dormida debe dar a luz" (also misspelled), he wasn't trying to create a new religious movement, the link doesn't provide good information, and the "mexicanista movement" is practically non-existen. There has been, however, a lot of interest in aztec spirituallity, in what is called <i>mexicanidad</i>. The text should center in this topic.</p>

<dd>Velazco claims the books "La mujer dormida debe dar a luz" and "Tlacaelel" were given to him by his spiritual guide "Ayocuán". But since nobody have meet Ayocuán, is generally acepted that Velazco is the author. Velazco claims the story of Regina is true, something that has angered many of the people involved in the masacre. In the 90s, I met several members of the "movimiento mexicanista", and personally i things it´s good it is practically non existant today. While there is a modern interest in "aztec spirituallity", there is so little material surviving that i always will be a mix of modern ideas and ideals.</dd>

<p>Let's discuss any wholesale changes to spelling (orthography) beforehand. In particular, the name of the Aztec capital is "Tenochtitlan", which is not only the name of the article in English, but Spanish as well. I have never seen "Tenochtitlān" used by anyone - I will occasionally find "Tenochtitlán" but none of the established sources (e.g. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Coe_8229.html" title="Michael Coe">Michael Coe</a>) use that.</p>
<p>I did open a discussion on orthography on the <a href="../../../n/a/h/Nahuatl.html" title="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> talk page some time ago, but without resolution.</p>
<p>Thanks, <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 17:08, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did suppose that those orthography changes wouldnt be accepted without further notice. However there are reasons for applying them, and I did also not apply them "wholesale". I changed the instances that wreent linkns and where the name was passed of as being a classical nahuatl word, normally indicated by "in nahuatl ..." or by using italics. I didnt try to change words where a nahuatl word was used as an english word or placename and an english style orthography would be expected, I also didnt change titles or hyperlinks.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am of the opinion that when we represent classical nahuatl word we should use a transcription that</p>
<ul>
<li>1. represents all phonemic information about that word when it is known. (That means that it sshould include vowel length and saltillo/glottal stop.)</li>
<li>2. represent the phonological reality of the wordsas consistently. (That is that it uses the same symbols for the same sound every time.)</li>
<li>3. is close to the transcription style used in classical nahuatl documents. (e.g. doesnt use w and k etc but use the classical, spanish style letter combinations)</li>
</ul>
<p>The only orthography that satisfies these conditions is the one developed by Michel Launey based on Horacio Carochis conventions. Carochi indicates vowel length with a macron and glottal stop with a grave accent over medial and initial vowels and a circumflex accent over final vowels (so that the ccent m ark can be seen to be different from the stress mark). This orthography makes it possible to immediately recognize word although you have seen it used in an orthography that doesnt mark vowel length or glottal stop, something that would be more difficult if using completely different letters (e.g. &lt;h&gt; for glottal stop which is also misleading because classical nahuatl had a glottal stop and not an h, or double vowels for lentgh or similar). Carochis transcription is in fact the only historically used transcription that shows both vowel length and glottal stop in a consistent manner.</p>
<p>This means that in my opinion Tenochtitlan could be spelled &lt;Tenochtitlan&gt; when used as an english word (and &lt;Tenochtitlán&gt; when used as a spanish word which is pretty unreasonable on this wiki) but it should be &lt;tenochtitlān&gt; with a long a when used as a nahuatl word because not representing the long vowel would simply be passing of something as nahuatl which isnt. And likewise &lt;tlatoani&gt; should be &lt;tlàtoāni&gt;.</p>
<p>Classical Nahuatl is a dead language and nobody is governing the transcription standard but I think we have a responsability to convey its sounds as faithfully as possibly (even though most modern scholars don't).<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 22:06, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>mhhh.. I have a problem with this. How many people know Michel Launey based conventions?. I think for most of the readers the "ā" does not represent a long vowel, unless we put a section explaining how to pronounce it. For me this is the first time i see it. A least one reader has asked for a guide on how to pronounce nahuatl names. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 23:35, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not many people know his conventions. Most people do not represent vowel length and saltillo at all. But the good thing about it is that even though they don't they can still read it because it doesnt throw in any additional letters in the words (something that the transcription using &lt;h&gt; for saltillo does).

<dd>After having thought about this for a while, my major concern is that I know of no other sources which use this orthography. Portilla, Coe, Nigel Davies all use unaccented vowels, as does Encyclopedia Brittanica and Encarta. A review of the first 150 (non-Wikipedia) Internet hits for <i>tlatoani</i> show nothing but unaccented vowels.</dd>

<dd>This is not to say that the heavily-accented orthography you propose is incorrect, Maunus. In fact, from your remarks, it would seem that it might indeed be preferrable. However, as you noted recently on <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a>'s Talk page, we are consensus driven and should employ the standards that are in use -- and the heavily-accented orthography is too obscure for us to use it as our standard.</dd>

<p>(Coe and Nigel Davies do not know Nahuatl; Leon Portilla is not known for his rigid scientific standards nor his general linguistic mastery [Note from Madman: yes, I agree that Portilla is less than rigourous!&#160;: ) ]. Any source that deals with the Aztec <b>language</b> at an reasonable level does somehow explicitly and motivatedly take a standpoint regarding how and whether to show long vowels and saltillo.

<dd>Interesting topic. Maunus asked for my opinions, fwtw. My major opinion is that everybody should use an orthography that everybody else will like. Since that is impossible...</dd>
<dd>It really comes down to a question of what is being written, for whom, for what purpose(s). If your purposes center around historical documentation and the Classical variant I can see why people would want to keep something close to the traditional orthography. But even then I would see little value in perpetuating some of the oddities that have been perpetrated under that orthography (e.g. o for /w/, i for /y/ and y for /i/, cuh for syllable-final /kʷ/ leading Mexicans to pronounce their sons' name Tecuhtli [teˈkutli] instead of [ˈtekʷtɬi], and so forth.</dd>
<dd>I agree with Maunus' criteria 1 and 2 (represent all the phonemic info, and do it consistently), and am not particularly motivated by criterion 3 (make it look like Classical Nahuatl), partly because that so easily contradicts criteria 1 and 2. Having two different types of accents to mark the saltillo, for instance, or c/qu, hu/uh, cu/uc/uhc/cuh, z/c and so forth, is really unnecessary. Launey's system is not the only one to meet criterion 1 and do pretty well at 2 and 3: Karttunen's in her 1983 <i>Analytical Dictionary</i> or J. Richard Andrews' very similar one in his 1975 <i>Introduction</i> are reasonable and easier, for me at least, to read. (They use the macron for length, h for saltillo, keep cu/uc, hu/uh, c/qu, c/z, etc.) Carochi/Launey's accents for saltillo don't work well typographically with the macron for cases where saltillo and length coincide (they *do* occur.)</dd>
<dd>My background is not in Classical Nahuatl, and I have little emotional attachment to the traditional orthography; my impression is that it is clunky and gets in the way for a lot of things. I'd just as soon use univalent and simple symbols, such as k, s, w, macron and so forth. I even like using such unitary symbols as č, ¢, ƛ, kʷ, for the (unitary) complex phonemes; you can see the CVC syllable structure so much more clearly. But it's not a great big deal to me; one does get used to different systems and to switching among them. In representing data from modern variants my preference is to follow whatever orthography is currently most used for each of them, but I recognize that for some purposes it is far from ideal to have different orthographic systems mixed.</dd>
<dd>In any case one must realize that if data from different variants are represented accurately, you won't always see the same word looking the same. The root 'arrive' was [aʔsi] in Classical (and is [ahsi] in Orizaba); it is [asi] (definitely no saltillo) in Tetelcingo. Length is particularly variable and elusive. Doubled consonants are saltillo-consonant in a number of variants. And so forth. If everything must be written uniformly such differences will not be represented.</dd>
<dd>I don't see any easy answers. If I were the boss I'd probably set up something with w, k, s, h and macrons and shove it down everybody's throats, but (it's probably just as well) I'm not the boss.</dd>

<dd>I agree with Curtis Clark that the reason a "classic style" orthography is necessary is that then words are recognizable both from documents and from the most common everyday uses. However I only propose this orthography for <b>classical</b> nahuatl and for the modern dialects I very much agree with Lavintzins ideas of having a phonemic script. But this sproposal was only for representations of classical nahuatl words, and nahuatl words in historical contexts. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 09:19, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe that we need to use the most familiar spellings in Wikipedia.

Therefore, I believe we need to use the unaccented orthography for Nahuatl words when we use them in Aztec Wikipedia articles.</dd>

<p>Nanahuatzin,</p>
<p>I hope you don't get frustrated by the high standards that we are trying to establish for this article.</p>
<p>After reading the discussion above about primary sources and "No Original Research", I started thinking that even the "discussion of primary sources" section could have "original research" in it. By this I mean, even your opinion about the credibility of the primary sources constitutes "original research". For us to put in a critique of a primary source, we need a citation of a secondary source who makes the criticism of the primary source. (Technically, a citation is not absolutely necessary but it would be a great help.)</p>
<p>Here are some examples of what I'm talking about:</p>
<ol>
<li>The possibility of Spanish influence poses potential problems for those studying the post-conquest codices. - Better to put this comment in the mouth of a historian. "WHO sees Spanish influence as a problem?"</li>
<li>His (Bernal Diaz del Castillo) account is colorful, but his work is considered erratic and exaggerated. - Once again, "WHO considered del Castillo's work "colorful but erratic and exaggerated?"</li>
<li>His (Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl) account of Netzahualcoyotl, an ancestor of Ixtlilxochitl's, has a strong resemblance to the story of King Solomon - "WHO sees the resemblance?"</li>
<li>Some (Diego Muñoz Camargo) parts of his work have a strong Tlaxcala bias. - "WHO says Camargo's work has a strong Tlaxcala bias?"</li>
</ol>
<p>Once again, I recognize that this pickiness is probably a higher standard than is observed at many Wikipedia articles. I don't think these deficiencies would draw heavy criticism but, since Maunus brought up the general topic, I thought I'd point out the need for citations in this section as well.</p>

<dd>FWIW, the comment on Bernal Diaz should not be hard to source: that is a pretty universal verdict on his work. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:42, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>don´t worry, I like this article to have high standars, The first time i saw this article, about two years ago, it was a little more than a resume of the point of view of Prescot. And while my english it is not the best i felt a lot could be do about it. Finally i think it´s a reliable source on the aztec thanks to the help of a lot of people. In the process i have learned a lot, specially when trying to verify sources, i found that a lot of my preconceptions were wrong. My main problem is that i am not a schollar, but an enginner, that means that i am used than an argument is more important, than the people who said it... And while i can remeber a lot of cites and facts, i always forget to put who, and where people say it.</dd>
<dd>Recently I have participate little, because my job requieres now a lot of my time. But fortunatelly there is people who know much more than me, and currently the article requieres a higher level of englosh thatn my. So i prefer to participe now in the talk page.</dd>

<p>In the green and white map, what is the extent of the Aztec empire. Are the Chichimecans, Tarascans and Mixtecs all inisde the Aztec Empire? If not, then the "white areas = independent chiefdoms" is confusing because some white areas are independent AND OUTSIDE the Aztec Empire whereas others are independent and INSIDE the Aztec Empire.</p>

<dd>I am sorry to have confused you but its really not my fault, the aztecs made it that way&#160;;). The white pockets within the green area are citystates and territories that the aztecs failed to conquer. The nature of the aztec empire was not the classical one dominating entire territories with large armies, rather they had lose armies, went and defeated a town and demanded tribute and went home. For this reason sometimes they simply couldnt conquer a city although well within the empires reach and scope, this is the case with the white are of tlaxcala, cholula for example successive aztec emperors fought against the tlaxcalans but couldnt win, so the tlaxcalan state remained independent as a pocket within the area dominated by the aztecs.<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 07:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Specifically, my confusion is whether every white area outside the green area (labelled or not labelled) is within the Aztec Empire but not conquered. Specifically, was the status of the Chichimecans, Tarascans and Mixtecs the same as that of the Tlaxcalans and the Cholulans? I don't think so but my knowledge of the Aztec Empire is not that strong so I seek clarification.</dd>

<dd>One way to dispel the confusion is to add another color such as yellow. If there were only yellow areas inside the green areas and some yellow areas outside the green areas, then the reader could conclude that yellow areas were unconquered cities that were part of the Aztec Empire and that white areas represented areas that were not part of the Aztec Empire at all.</dd>

<dd>The status of the tarascabs chicimeecs mayas etc were the same as the tlaxcallans and cholultecs. They were not part of the aztec empire at all. using a different colour would be misleading. It must be understood that the aztec empire were not a "classic" empire of connected and controlled territory. It may even be an exaggeration to draw the empire as amass of dominated territories because there m ay not even have been an aztec presence at any other time than when they defeated the city in a battle. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 19:03, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So... my understanding based on something that Nanahuatzin wrote a while ago on a Talk Page is that there were Nahuatl-speaking cultures who were left unconquered but who were required to provide victims for human sacrifice. There were also cities that were conquered and paid tribute but who were not eligible to provide victims for human sacrifice (except to the extent that those victims had been captured in battle). What I'm asking is which category includes the Chichimecans, Tarascans and Mixtecs and other peoples living in the white areas outside the green area? These are presumably unconquered peoples that paid no tribute to the Aztecs whereas the green areas are conquered peoples who did pay tribute. The white area in the heart of the green area presumably represents the Triple Alliance. If I have understood this correctly, there are three categories of peoples: Triple Alliance, conquered peoples and unconquered peoples. And thus, there should be three colors on the map, not two.</dd>

<dd>Nanahuatzin is wrong about this, or he explained it in a misunderstandable way. War prisoners were sacrificed no matter from what city they came from. The difference is that the nahuatl speaking polities of Tlaxcala and Huexotzinco and Atlixco were very close to Tenochtitlan and for this reason and because it was growing an ever greater embarrasment to the aztecs not being able to conquer them the aztecs kept a continous state of war against these cities with frequent battles resulting in many victims. The idea of "flowery" wars between tlaxcala and the aztecs as a mutual agreement or a submittance of the tlaxcallans to the aztecs is false but somewhat widespread. Ross Hassig and Nigel Davies pretty much disprove this idea however. The aztcs war against the indenpendent nahua speaking kingdoms was simply a continous state of warfare between two independent states one trying to conquer the other and the other just trying to survive. Green areas are tribute paying areas and as such parts of the "empire". All of the white areas were at war with the aztecs and paid their tribute in soldiers. So saying that tlaxcala was required to pay sacrificial vitims to the aztecs would be like sying that the english were <i>required</i> to pay the lifes of their soldier to Hitler. (UTC)They were but it was not through an agreement but through a state of war.<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 20:13, 22 August 2006</dd>

<dd>Hi, if i remember, my comment was that: the victims for Huitzilopochtli and Tezcatlicpoca were required to be nahuatl speakers since they were considered mesenguers to their gods. (Portilla - Los antiguos Mexicanos pp 97), While the Flowery wars started as a mutual agrement, by the time of the conquest it was a close to be an open war. While the aztec always mantained that they could conquer Tlaxcala if they wished... The tlaxcalteca (acording to Muñoz Camargo) claimed they participate, because they chose to. Proud words from both sides to pretend they had the control and one of the reasons the Tlaxcalteca allied with Cortez.</dd>

<dd>I havent ever read that Portilla should have written that the tlaxcallans were subdued to the aztecs in anyway. And lets remember that the tlaxcallans also sacrificed their captives when they won (something that often happened)(Tizoc for example lost battles with the tlaxcallans and was shamed for it). Any way <i>All</i> maps that I have seen of the axtec empire are drawn with holes in it representing tlaxcalla and the other independent citystates. My map is based on the one in Muriel Porter Weavers "The aztecs, maya and their predecessors" Third edition, 1993, map 8.4 pp 478. If some of you want to make a better map feel free, as long as its based on a serious scholarly map.<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 07:26, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry if i explained it wrong. Portilla wrote that the aztecs claimed they could overrun Tlaxcala when they wished, a claim that Portilla comment with some skepticism &#160;:) . Tlaxcalteca and Azteca, share a lot of things in comon, like most nahuatl people. I comment some time ago that we should speak of the nahua civilization, not the aztec civilization, although probalby this would confuse most readers... <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 05:40, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maunus, I think we can accept at least <i><b>some</b></i> of the news -- for example, that hundreds of individuals' bones were found, and that they had knife (and teeth?) marks, and that they were ritually sacrificed. However, like you, this article makes me a bit uneasy. For instance, how did they know that "The prisoners were kept in cages for months while Aztec priests from what is now Mexico City selected a few each day at dawn". They certainly couldn't have determined that from the archaeological record. The researchers would have had to have non-archaeological evidence (Cortes' letters? Some codex or another?) for much of the "news" such as:</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree a certain amount of skepticism is appropriate here. As Maunus pointed out, some of the details could not have come from archeological findings and had to come from other accounts or just plain erudite supposition. As we already know, accounts written by the Spaniards are suspect because of the potential for bias.</dd>

<dd>I agree that we need to be careful not to "swallow" the whole thing uncritically. Nonetheless, this provides more support for cannibalism and possibly for human sacrifice. I believe some editors (including Nanahuatzin?) have been arguing that the concrete evidence of cannibalism and human sacrifice is scant and that reports of human sacrifice might have been a kind of "black legend" concocted by the Spaniards.</dd>

<p>My point about canibalism and Human sacrifice is that the numbers have been grossly exagerated, not that they have not ocurred. Even those 500 hundred bodies of people and animals pale under the claims of 250,000 victims a year. It is interesting that what happened in the place was so special that it deserved a special name. "Tecuaque" the place where people was eaten. So far we have very little of the post conquest conflicts. A full report is expected at the end of the year, when the archeological zone will be opened, probably it will be worth an entry in the wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 05:27, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could we not split the Aztec article into an article on <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_civilization.html" title="Aztec civilization">Aztec civilization</a> and another on the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_Empire_6712.html" title="Aztec Empire">Aztec Empire</a>? The Aztec empire article should then comprise some of the aztec article and some of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Aztecs_3b1c.html" title="History of the Aztecs">History of the Aztecs</a> article. I think it would be more easy to structure that way. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 13:48, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Um, there is an article called <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_society.html" title="Aztec society">Aztec society</a> which arguably could be renamed to <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_civilization.html" title="Aztec civilization">Aztec civilization</a> (that would be my preference). The <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_society.html" title="Aztec society">Aztec society</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Aztecs_3b1c.html" title="History of the Aztecs">History of the Aztecs</a> articles exist to keep the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> article relatively short.

<p>I just think this article with the less than informative name "Aztec" seems to be a mishmash of: 1. Historical information about the aztec empire and its evolution and fall, 2. Aspects of aztec culture, 3. Etymological musings about the different nomenclatures. 3. Rather irrelevant references to New Age philosophers and their (mis)use of aztec mythology and religion. And to top it it is presented in a completely illogical sequence and with almost no internal coherence. I think it could be partly mended by chucking the different sections out in their own articles. and restructuring the present artcile to function more as a disambiguator to point to the different uses and meanings of the word "Aztec". I don't think that it currently comes even close to deserve GA status.</p>
<p>I would make an article called "Aztec Empire" that would deal with the geopolitical evolution of the aztec empire (it might be done by combining material from <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_Triple_Alliance_b571.html" title="Aztec Triple Alliance">Aztec Triple Alliance</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Aztecs_3b1c.html" title="History of the Aztecs">History of the Aztecs</a>) And I would have another called Aztec culture or Aztec (or maye Nahua)civilization. I may be the only one who thinks so but I do find this article in pretty poor shape right now. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 16:58, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You may be right that the article's organization needs improvement. I wouldn't go so far as to characterize the article as a "mishmash" but maybe your standards are higher than mine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let me explain what I understand to be the rationale for the current structure of the article since I did some heavy reorganizing of the article earlier this year. If you think it is a mess now, it was worse before I started. (Well, I think so anyway)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My sense of it is that there should be a primary article. At the moment, it is called <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> although I could imagine it being called <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_civilization.html" title="Aztec civilization">Aztec civilization</a> instead. There is a subsidiary article called <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_society.html" title="Aztec society">Aztec society</a> although I could imagine it being called Aztec culture. There is another subsidiary article called <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Aztecs_3b1c.html" title="History of the Aztecs">History of the Aztecs</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This sort of structure is common in many articles about countries. I'm not so sure about articles about ancient civilizations. (Quick aside to Nanahuatzin: In the U.S., anything older than 300 years is a candidate for being called "ancient". We have a very strange sense of historical perspective because we are such a young country.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The primary article, currently called <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> should be a comprehensive overview of every Aztec-related topic with references to "main" subsidiary articles that provide additional detail. In other words, the primary article SHOULD be a mishmash of stuff about the Aztecs but the mishmash should be well-organized and the narrative of the article should flow well so that the reader is engaged and never quite reaches the point of boredom. Boring the reader is a task that should be left to the subsidiary articles. &#160;;^)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you are proposing to rename <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Aztecs_3b1c.html" title="History of the Aztecs">History of the Aztecs</a> to <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_Empire_6712.html" title="Aztec Empire">Aztec Empire</a>, I understand your motivation but I think that the average person would think that <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_Empire_6712.html" title="Aztec Empire">Aztec Empire</a> was the primary article about Aztecs, not an article about the geopolitical evolution of the Aztec Empire. So, I worry that your technically reasonable proposal will serve to confuse the average reader to whom Wikipedia should be targeted.</dd>

<p>- Agreed, lets try to achieve this first then.

<p>Some editors keep changing "Tenochtitlan" to "Tenochtitlán". Can someone explain why we use "Tenochtitlan" instead of "Tenochtitlán"? --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 18:04, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We spell it that way because that is the standard spelling for the city. There are some towns in Mexico which are spelled "Tenochtitlán", like <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Lorenzo_Tenochtitl%C3%A1n_cfe2.html" title="San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán">San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán</a>, in which case we use the accent. But the Aztec capital is not spelled that way in neither Spanish (see <a href="../../../../es/m/%C3%A9/x/w%7EM%C3%A9xico-Tenochtitlan_9ee0.html" class="extiw" title="es:w:México-Tenochtitlan">es:w:México-Tenochtitlan</a>) nor in Nahuatl (see <a href="../../../../na/m/%C4%93/x/w%7EM%C4%93xihco_Ten%C5%8Dchtitl%C4%81n_87f0.html" class="extiw" title="na:w:Mēxihco_Tenōchtitlān">na:w:Mēxihco Tenōchtitlān</a>). I believe we need to resist the temptation to spell it with the accent just because it seems right. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 01:59, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the general case, the rationale goes something like this: if a placename comes directly from a Mesoamerican language which does not ordinarily mark accented stress, then there'd be no need to mark it with an accent when using it in english prose (which also does not mark stress this way, other than in some fossilised terms). The accent in such placenames is a requirement/practice of spanish orthographical conventions. On the other hand, in cases where the placename comes from spanish, or from a Mesoamerican language originally but with some 'hispanicised' modification, then (depending to a degree on whether or not the familiarity of the place to english-speakers has led to a spelling convention for it) the placename <i>may</i> be written with the accent if it occurs.</dd>

<dd>Still, this phase of the campaign was arduous and brutal. Spanish foot soldiers helped kill Indians for their allies to "dress out", but also rescued many of the women Cortés planned to brand on the face as slaves. They hid the pretty ones in the bushes, sleeping with them during the night, and setting them free in the morning (or marrying them, now that their husbands had been devoured). Some of the women were ravaged so ruthlessly that they could not speak of the atrocities committed and how their virginity had been taken from them.</dd>

<p>When are thinking, intelligent people going to relegate the false term Aztecs to the recycle bin and return the rightful and historically correct name "Mexica" ( Meh shee ka ) back to the Mexican collective. The "coined " name A*^@#% is not only a fabricated term but even more insidious, is the manner which it is used to rob the modern Mexican of his/her cultural soul and link to an acient time of accomplishment and achievement. Rather, it used in tandem with those childlike crude pictographs, (now determined to be painted on Spano/European parchment ) to bash the Modern Mexican relentlessly to codify the Spanish invasion of a people whose level of human endeavor was the equal of the worlds- thought to be "Great Civilizations". I would agree that the primary responsiblilty lies with their namesake but first things first. We must begin with the first step.The term "Ancient Mexicans" MUST become the norm when speaking of Pre-Euro America. Remember, America, Canada the Mexican Border are historically speaking nascent terms. The ancient Mexican language Nahuatl was at one time used as a common language and second language by Native and Tribal peoples from Central America to the Oregon border and beyond.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.197.134.210 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.197.134.210_6578.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.197.134.210">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I do know that only elderly people who were no longer supposed to contribute to society were allowed to drink. I don't know if there was a specific age and if so what it was exactly. I have also read that there were very differing rules for commoners and nobles. I suggest to leave it as is - it is definitely closer to the truth than the edit of the anonymous user who inserted 20 years as the aztec drinking age. As for the life expectancy 27 isn't that low for a preindustrial society (in fact <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_expectancy.html#Life_expectancy_over_human_history" title="Life expectancy">37 was the life expectancy of a western european around 1900</a>)- and taking into consideration a probably high infant mortality many people would live to more than 70 years of age.<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 17:38, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What the hell does "Aztec" mean?</p>
<p>The first line of the article states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Aztecs is a collective term used for all of the Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican peoples under the control of the Mexica, founders of Tenochtitlan, and their two principal allies ...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>But the Nomenclature section makes it seem like "Aztec" and "Mexica" are synonyms, and the empire was populated by more than just Mexica. It then says that:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In this article, the term "Mexica" is used to refer to the Mexica people up until the time of the formation of the Triple Alliance. After this, the term "Aztecs" is used to refer to the peoples who made up the Triple Alliance.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If that's the case, then why does the article focus so much on the Mexica, not pointing out anywhere that the other two thirds of the Triple Alliance were not Mexica: Texcoco was an Acolhua city and Tlacopan was Tepanec.</p>
<p>Finally, we have this line:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 1810 Alexander von Humboldt originated the modern usage of "Aztec" as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade, custom, religion, and language to the Mexica state and the Triple Alliance.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Which sounds like he probably means Aztec to refer to the <a href="../../../n/a/h/Nahua.html" title="Nahua">Nahuas</a>. (I'm not sure if he would've included the Tlaxcalans though.)</p>
<p>So which is it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Aztec = the inhabitants of the entire empire?</li>
<li>Aztec = the Triple Alliance?</li>
<li>Aztec = Mexica?</li>
<li>Aztec = Tenochca?</li>
<li>Aztec = Nahua?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd almost suggest ditching the term, not because it's "scholarly corrupt" as someone else said, but because it seems too vague to be useful. We really need to get our definitions sorted. --<a href="../../../p/t/c/User%7EPtcamn_50b7.html" title="User:Ptcamn">Ptcamn</a> 18:09, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The term doesn't have one single definition, that doesn't mean the term should be ditched however it just means that its different uses should be mentioned. Etymologically aztec should be used for the tribes from Aztlán, this includes the Tlaxcalteca. However due to the usage where the Triple alliance has been equated with the aztec empire it has also acquired the meaning of denoting the primary members of the alliance. The cities under their control are not usually called aztec although it is often said that they were under aztec control. I think the prevalent usage in modern times is to refer to 1. in history/archeology when referring collectively to the members of the triple alliance 2. in linguistics when referring to the languages of the aztecan branch of uto-aztec (synonymously with Nahua). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/u/User_talk%7EMaunus_db7a.html" title="User talk:Maunus">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maunus_d9fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maunus">contribs</a>) 09:41, 2 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>The sources mention that "crying children" were offered to Tlaloc. The Excavations in the main temple have revealed a dozen of children skeletons in offerings to Tlaloc. A characteristic of those bodies, is that all were sick children, and according to the patologist, they had sicknesses that caused constant crying. But still.. the number of victims that atchologist have found still is several zeroes lower than the numbers claimed.... <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 06:53, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK... but what do you think of the sentence in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_sacrifice.html" title="Child sacrifice">Child sacrifice</a> article? The whole article is poorly written and so it is no surprise that this sentence is also poorly written. The reader is left with the impression that child sacrifice was an important part of Aztec culture. It might be worthwhile to improve the description in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_sacrifice.html" title="Child sacrifice">Child sacrifice</a> article so that it more accurately describes what is known about the practice. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 07:57, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Child sacrifice was a very important part not only of Aztec culture but of many ancient cultures as well: South American, European, African and Asian.

<p>Based on assurances from Maunus, Nanahuatzin and Cesar Tort, I am no longer questioning the truth of the assertion. I am not an expert and would not be so bold as to assert that I knew the truth one way or the other. What I am trying to draw everyone's attention to is the fact that there is a difference between the impression you get from reading the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_sacrifice.html" title="Child sacrifice">Child sacrifice</a> article and the one you get from reading the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sacrifice_in_Aztec_culture_a901.html" title="Human sacrifice in Aztec culture">Human sacrifice in Aztec culture</a> article. Child sacrifice is mentioned only in passing in the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sacrifice_in_Aztec_culture_a901.html" title="Human sacrifice in Aztec culture">Human sacrifice in Aztec culture</a> and the reader is left with the impression that child sacrifice is not a central feature of Human sacrifice in Aztec culture. Contrast this with the assertion in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_sacrifice.html" title="Child sacrifice">Child sacrifice</a> article. I think it behooves us to present a consistent story in both articles.</p>

<p>This is very misleading (“alleged”). Bernal Díaz recounts many instances of human sacrifices even in non Mexica towns. The soldiers actually saw some dead bodies with the chest opened even <i>before</i> they reached Tenochtitlan. “Europeans understood…” is an understatement to say the least. The evidence for human sacrifice before and during the Conquest, and in Colonial times, is overwhelming, especially after the findings of modern archeologists. Not even the most renowned of the Mexican <i>indigenistas</i> (fans of Indian themes) and scholars, such as <a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_Le%C3%B3n-Portilla_ebd4.html" title="Miguel León-Portilla">Miguel León-Portilla</a>, deny this. In fact, since the Maya towns were the last to be conquered by the Spanish they continued the practice. They even captured, tortured and sacrificed a couple of Spanish teenagers in the middle of the 16th century, well after the fall of Tenochtitlan. And if Jacques Soustelle is right, the practice continued underground as late as the 19th century. Even in the 20th century it has been reported that some Indians used the hearts of non-sacrificed, dead people to ask for rains (this is not sacrifice of course, but it says a lot about a millenarian Indian tradition).</p>
<p>One more thing: it has not been demonstrated, as some WP articles state, that the Aztecs practiced human sacrifice to a greater extent than, say, the Mayas or other Mesoamerican cultures. If the Aztecs appear crueler it’s only because the Mexica was the best studied of all Mesoamerican civilizations. After the Maya writing was deciphered and the book <i>The Blood of the Kings</i> published in the middle 1980s, it has become more and more apparent that the Mayas were, at least, as cruel as the Aztecs (more cruel in my view since the Mayans tortured the victims for extended periods before sacrificing them). Also, the practice of skinning the victims goes back as far as Teotihuacán.</p>
<p>Since human sacrifice was widespread not only in Mesoamerica but in South America as well, I would start moving the page from <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sacrifice_in_Aztec_culture_a901.html" title="Human sacrifice in Aztec culture">Human sacrifice in Aztec culture</a> to Human sacrifice in pre-Columbian America. The Incas and other peoples in Peru were notorious for performing sacrifices too.</p>

<dd>I would oppose such a move. While it hasn't been documented that the aztecs practiced human sacrifice on a greater scale than other cultures (although it is the predominant view among scholars), aztec sacrificial practices are much, (MUCH) better documented than for any other precolombian culture. This fact alone makes it relevant to have an article dealing only with aztec human sacrifice. Coupled with the fact that the existence of human sacrifice among the aztecs is much more known to the general public, and much more riddled with pseudo-facts, sensationalism, misunderstandings and mythologization than the religious practices of other precolumbian the need for an article on human sacifice specifically among the aztecs become evident. This does not mean however that we shoudln't have an article about human sacrifice in precolumbian societies in general, nor does it mean that the current article on Human sacrifice in Aztec culture is a good article. It is not and it should be completely rewritten from reliable sources and articles by well respected scholars, that should be extremely carefully selected. (In my opinion <i><a href="../../../a/r/q/Arqueolog%C3%ADa_mexicana.html" title="Arqueología mexicana">Arqueología mexicana</a></i> is not such a source)<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">·Maunus·</a> <a href="../../../m/a/u/User_talk%7EMaunus_db7a.html" title="User talk:Maunus">·ƛ·</a> 20:56, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>because Arqueología Mexicana presents popularisations of archeological and historical topics based on research published in peerreviewed journals. We should use these articles directly. Also Arqueología is a magazine that focuses on what people want to read - this means that it is prone to sensationalism- which is exactly what a topic like human sacrifice doesn't need. In short it is a third hand source and I think that for this topic we should stick with first and second hand sources so that we can reference exactly which sources say what and which scholars have interpreted this in which way.<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">·Maunus·</a> <a href="../../../m/a/u/User_talk%7EMaunus_db7a.html" title="User talk:Maunus">·ƛ·</a> 05:27, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree. <i><a href="../../../a/r/q/Arqueolog%C3%ADa_mexicana.html" title="Arqueología mexicana">Arqueología mexicana</a></i> is a far cry from, say, the popular Mexican magazine <i>Muy Interesante</i>. <i>Arqueología mexicana</i> is not sensationalistic at all. I mentioned <i>Vuelta</i> and <i>Letras Libres</i> because those magazines and <i>Arqueología mexicana</i> were, or have to be sponsored by, cultural institutions. Otherwise nobody would buy them. <i>Arqueología mexicana</i> is similar to <i>National Geographic</i>, but most Mexicans do not read cultural magazines.</p>
<p>And it is untrue that <i>Arqueología mexicana</i> is prone to sensationalism. In fact, the above-mentioned September-October 2003 issue of <i>Arqueología mexicana</i> is the only one I am aware of that devoted the entire issue to the subject of human sacrifice. And the editorial staff did it for one simple reason.</p>
<p>On July 2003 <i>El País Semanal</i>, a Sunday supplement of the Spanish newspaper <i><a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Pa%C3%ADs_0e3b.html" title="El País">El País</a></i>, published an article by Matthias Schulz in which he labeled as “demonic” and “brutal” the Mesoamerican practice of human sacrifice. This caused quite a stir among the Mexican <i>indigenistas</i>. And it was supposed that <i>Arqueología mexicana</i>, the official journal of the INAH which treats pre-Columbian cultures respectfully, would publish a rebuttal.</p>
<p>However, since it is a serious journal, <i>Arqueología mexicana</i> asked only knowledgeable scholars to contribute. For instance, the piece on Mayan human sacrifice in that 2003 issue was written by renowned Mayanist <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Stuart_%28Mayanist%29_3519.html" title="David Stuart (Mayanist)">David Stuart</a>.</p>
<p>Even <a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_Le%C3%B3n-Portilla_ebd4.html" title="Miguel León-Portilla">Miguel León-Portilla</a>, a major <i>indigenista</i> and pre-Hispanic scholar in Mexico who knows náhuatl, wrote the first article of that issue. León-Portilla didn’t deny the historicity of the sacrifices; he only tried to explain them.</p>
<p>Therefore <i>Arqueología mexicana</i> is obviously a reliable source.</p>

<dd>Sahagún reported that the city also had beggars (only crippled people were allowed to beg), thieves and prostitutes.

There seems to have been another kind of women, <i>ahuianis</i>, who had sexual relations with warriors. The Spaniards were surprised because they did not charge for their work.</dd>

<dd>One citation is apparently Book X, p.89 of the Florentine ("..but the bad women, those called harlots, [show] no fine feeling, quite publicly they go about chewing chicle along the roads, in the market place clacking like castanets"; eng. trans. from Dibble &amp; Anderson's edition, as reproduced in Wimmer <a href="http://sites.estvideo.net/malinal/a/nahuatlAHUILT.html#AHUIYANI" class="external autonumber" title="http://sites.estvideo.net/malinal/a/nahuatlAHUILT.html#AHUIYANI" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). The refs to staining their teeth with cochineal and general appearance may be found there also. Don't know however about the distinction of "another kind of women", though- it seems the term <i>āhuiyani</i> served for courtesan, prostitute generally.</dd>

<p>I don't want to wheel war, but unprotecting this doesn't seem to be working out that well (9 instances of vandalism, from separate sources, in 7 hours). As much as not everybody being able to edit is unfortunate, I think the most practical option is for the page to be re-semi protected. What do other people think? <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 23:01, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On second thought, lets leave it for a day and see what happens. If the vandalism is bad on the 30th then I think we'll have to reprotect before April 1. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 23:06, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, with the first instance of vandalism occurring literally within five minutes of the semiprotection being lifted. It's just one of those topics where it's odds-on that on any given day there'll be some class of bored kids out there supposed to be 'researching'. However, the article is reasonably closely monitored by a number of folks and most inappropriate edits are quickly reverted, although it is an ongoing pain. While personally I can see the evident convenience of leaving semiprotection on, it should probably be left in reserve to be applied for brief periods when there's a mini-storm in progress.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 00:32, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although this article is rated as a "good" article, I feel that some citations are needed, particurly in aztec society. Some of the citations are sparse from eachother.

<dl>
<dd>However, there is evidence that this notion of "honour" was really one of fatalistic brainwashing, as victims identified for sacrificial murder were frequently put through many pre-murder rituals in which they were symbolically "murdered" until they "came to terms with" or otherwise accepted their fate (cf. A History of Warfare, by John Keegan).</dd>

<p>Looks like there is an attempt to provide a reference. Doesn't mean that it is a good reference but I think the edit might deserve more attention than just reversion on the basis of being "unreferenced". Maunus, could you explain why you reverted the edit?</p>

<dd>It represents a POV that is already predominant in the article. It doesn't cite what the "evidence" that supports the claim is. It references a non-specialist book and doesn't provide a correct citation. In order for this particular claim to be included it requires that it states</dd>
