<p>I'd like to do a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Aztec_emperors_d0ea.html" title="List of Aztec emperors">List of Aztec emperors</a>, and a sequence template for each emperor (like we have for so many monarchs on Wikipedia – compare the thingy at the bottom of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_II_of_Great_Britain_0274.html" title="George II of Great Britain">George II of Great Britain</a>, for example).

<dd>mmhhh, i think the correct title should be "Tlatoani" or speaker. Emperor or king, suggest an european point of view, with hereditary rights. Although aztec tlatoanis came from a close set of families, they were chosen, and even deposed by they peers. I think it´s position would be more like the old greek Dictators. Eventually they could have became kings, but we would never knew. . <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 07:22, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm wondering, in many picutres of Aztec gods they include funny looking hook things they're juggling. You can check the one I've included as an example at the following link.</p>

<p>Could you point me toward a published source regarding these aztec "speech bubbles"? It would really help me out if you could.</p>
<p>I have no idea of the canonical references. I found this excerpt online: "Perhaps the best-known representation of sensation in Mesoamerican art is the speech scroll. [...] speech scrolls make elite song visible by depicting it as colored spirals curling from opened mouths. And just as Mixtec depictions of elite vision are often specified by marking what kind of vision is being represented, so too are speech scrolls often marked to indicate the type of speech being articulated. This happens a number of times in the Mixtec corpus." Bayann Hamann. "Seeing and the Mixtec Screenfolds." <i>Visible Language.</i> 2004. <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3982/is_200401/ai_n9409654/pg_4" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3982/is_200401/ai_n9409654/pg_4" rel="nofollow">Link</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Statehood of Triple Alliance vs. Nahua Nation</span></h2>
<p>I suggest the following change to more accurately reflect the differences between the statehood of the Triple Alliance and related entities as opposed to the Nahua Nation.</p>
<p><i>In Nahuatl, the native language of the Aztecs, "Aztec" means "someone who comes from Aztlán", a mythical place in northern Mexico. However, the Aztec referred to themselves as Mexica (IPA [meˈʃihkah]) or Tenochca. The modern usage of the name Aztec as a collective term, applied to all the peoples linked by trade, custom, religion, and language to the Mexica state, the Triple Alliance, was suggested by Alexander von Humboldt.</i></p>
<p>should instead read&#160;:</p>
<p><i>In Nahuatl, the lingua franca of what we now call the Aztecs, "Aztec" means "someone who comes from Aztlán", a legendary place located somewhere in northern Mexico or in the southwestern United States. The modern usage of the name Aztec has come to refer to anyone who lived under the Triple Alliance before the arrival of the Spanish as first suggested by Alexander von Humboldt. The Triple Alliance was a state that brought together inhabitants of three city states of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan (modern-day Tacuba) under the political control of the Mexica (IPA [meˈʃihkah]) or Tenochca.</i></p>
<p>The last line in the original version is flawed since all people in Mesoamerica were somehow linked by trade and customs. Religion as it is know in western society did not exist since people saw it as something much more fluid, so once again everyone in the region could be considered to share the same religion. In regards to the language, the Tlaxcalteca also spoke Nahuatl, but to call a Tlaxcaltecatl 500 years ago or today an Aztecatl or a Mexicahtl would be an insult. --<a href="../../../m/e/x/User%7EMexicatl_5188.html" title="User:Mexicatl">mexicatl</a> 23:11, 2005 May 21 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that would be fine <i>except</i> your placement of the phrase about von Humboldt doesn't make it clear <i>what</i> he "suggested". I believe what you want to say is:</p>
<p><i>In Nahuatl, the lingua franca of what we now call the Aztecs, "Aztec" means "someone who comes from Aztlán", a legendary place located somewhere in northern Mexico or in the southwestern United States.

<dd>I'm late to this game but there really is a good reason for this article to be called "Aztec civilization" instead of "Aztec" and that is precisely that the article on the Maya is called "Maya civilization". <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya.html" title="Maya">Maya</a> redirects to <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_civilization.html" title="Maya civilization">Maya civilization</a> but <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_civilization.html" title="Aztec civilization">Aztec civilization</a> redirects to <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a>. Someday, this inconsistency should be resolved. Either we need to convince those who edit <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_civilization.html" title="Maya civilization">Maya civilization</a> to move their article to <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya.html" title="Maya">Maya</a> or we need to move this article to <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_civilization.html" title="Aztec civilization">Aztec civilization</a>. I suspect this was what was behind the original move.</dd>

Perhaps the more pertinent reason that <i>Maya civilization</i> is where it is would be that there we have separate articles for the historical civilization (the latter) and the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_peoples.html" title="Maya peoples">Maya peoples</a> themselves, who both participated in that historical enterprise and have persisted to this day (and are also collectively referred to as "Maya").

<dd>Interesting, i did not know about Orayi.

In Mexico we celebrate 1325 as the foundation of Mexico City, thinking in terms of historic continuity may not completelly correct, but the city did not died and reborn as an european city, it was a slow and painfull process. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 18:43, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Isn't Mexico City still the largest city in population in North America? I think it would be safe to say that it is the oldest continuously inhabited urban region in America. Back in the day, the inhabitants of some of the smaller Hopi towns probably thought of Orayvi as the "big city", but it has only recently had a suburb, so in no sense could it be called an urban region.--<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtis_Clark_2ae7.html" title="User:Curtis Clark">Curtis Clark</a> 01:16, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>argh... i found i am wrong. The oldest living city, at least in north america would be Cholula, (Cholula, Puebla) stablished about 100 BC, it was considered Tollan (city) about 200 AC ( <a href="http://www.inah.gob.mx/zoar/htme/za01801f.html" class="external free" title="http://www.inah.gob.mx/zoar/htme/za01801f.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.inah.gob.mx/zoar/htme/za01801f.html</a> ).

<p>But I still don't see its relevance to this article. It might be relevant to the article <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_02d7.html" title="Native Americans">Native Americans</a>, but it does not even mention the Aztecs as such. If no one can explain in the next 48 hours, I intend to remove it from this article. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:23, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just read <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_H._Prescott_9f13.html" title="William H. Prescott">William H. Prescott</a>'s <i>The History of the Conquest of Mexico</i> in which many references are made to Aztec "picture-writing" which the same author calls "heiroglyphical" and states that documents written in this system are known as "maps". This doesn't seem to be mentioned in the article. I knew the Maya had a writing system, but I would like to learn more about what the Aztecs used. — <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippietrail_ecc5.html" title="User:Hippietrail">Hippietrail</a> 01:32, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>the aztec sistem was a bit more complicated... it was not as advanced as the maya, but it used pictographic, phonetic, rebus and hierogliphyc symbols, also a lot of symbols were not standard and finally it had ocult esoterics meanings. All that, because it was a system meant to be told.. not to be read. The Aztec used paper for everyday use, and more durable materials for sacred text or codex. Tenochtitlan received hundred of thousands of paper sheet as tribute.. Unfortunatlelly, of the thousands of codex form aztec libraries, only survive four... I am working on the subject... there are still several section missing, like religion phylosophy, technology, art etc... <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 06:50, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I dont think the military training of the aztec would qualify as a martial art... Specially as almost nothing of it is known... &#160;:( <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 18:51, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
