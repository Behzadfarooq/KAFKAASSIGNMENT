<dd>Um, that would seem to suggest that Martial Law is when students and bogus twenty year old "grand masters" (twenty years of age, not experience) from so called McDojos take over the rule of a country? No, martial is an adjective which implies some form of military involvement. Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" could just as easily be called "Martial Art" but it isn't in the interest of clarity and avoiding confusion due to the colloquial usage of the term. Though, it would be just as technically correct to be called that. 24.254.163.104 06:04, 13 January 2007 (UTC)Lucy</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">European populations</span></h2>
<p>Where do the (recently changed) populations given for European cities come from? The article now says: Constantinople with about 200,000 inhabitants, Paris with about 250,000, and Venice with about 160,000.</p>
<p>Previously we had some numbers cited from <a href="http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201d.htm" class="external text" title="http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201d.htm" rel="nofollow">Top Ten Cities of the Year 1500</a>, which cites <i>Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth: An Historical Census</i> by Tertius Chandler. 1987, St. David's University Press, which I would expect to be reliable. Chandler gives Constantinople as 200,000, but gives Paris as only 185,000, and if he mentions Venice it would presumably be behind the tenth in his list, Nanjing, China with 147,000.</p>
<p>While Chandler had some idiosyncratic views on pre-600-BCE Ancient Middle East and Greece, I'd expect him to be rock solid on anything since that date. I'd consider Chandler to have been a pretty good citation; can anyone explain why it was removed and where the new numbers come from? -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:29, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tepanec Expansion Age omitted</span></h2>
<p>I was wondering why there is absolutely no mention of the "Tepanec Expansion" under the rule of Tezozomoc, seeing how it was one of the most major events in later <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesoamerican.html" title="Mesoamerican">Mesoamerican</a> history. Historically speaking, it created the first true nation-state since <a href="../../../t/e/o/Teotihuacan.html" title="Teotihuacan">Teotihuacan</a> 600 years before, it propelled the Mexica and <a href="../../../a/c/o/Acolhua.html" title="Acolhua">Acolhua</a> from subservant status to states in there own rights. It also led to the independence of of the state of <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texcoco.html" title="Texcoco">Texcoco</a> by the army led by <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netzahualcoyotl.html" title="Netzahualcoyotl">Netzahualcoyotl</a>, who defeated the forces of <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxtla.html" title="Maxtla">Maxtla</a> in a single battle. Its an interesting period in our history, and very much so one of my favorite due to the amount of involvement by many tribes. It is also the bases for the "Triple Alliance", which is why I thought it was important.</p>
<p>I was wondering if I could put the basic information on the period down and expand on it (as well as the Tepanec people, <a href="../../../t/e/z/Tezozomoc.html" title="Tezozomoc">Tezozomoc</a>, and Netzahualcoyotl, a very interesting figure who comes close to being the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texcoco.html" title="Texcoco">Texcoco</a> version of <a href="../../../h/u/i/Huitzilopochtli.html" title="Huitzilopochtli">Huitzilopochtli</a>).</p>

<dd>In nahuatl Flower and feathers are used as sinonimous of "precious", in spanish "Xochiyoauh" is translated as "guerra florida", so i think the correct in english should be "flowery war".

<dd>While <i>flowery</i> is a more literal translation of the Spanish <i>florida</i>, I believe "flower wars" is the more common term.

<dd>Just question.. What image gives to you "flower war"?. To me, it sounds like a war made with flowers, but i am not shure... . the originalt nahuatl, means a war that produces flowers ( wounds). If Flower war is the more comon term, i think it,s all right. But in the article i need to explain the diference..<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 03:47, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since I've known the term for decades, I couldn't say what was my original impression of the term. I suspect that neither "flower wars" nor "flowery wars" conjures much of an image on its own, other than both suggesting something less than a full-blown war. Anyway, there is a fair chance that I knew <i>guerras floridas</i> in Spanish before I knew "flower wars" in English. Keep in mind that the use of nouns as adjectives is relatively common on English, unlike Spanish: "club member", "book learning", and "television personality", to give just a few very diverse examples.</dd>

<dd>I had guessed that <i>flower war</i> was the more accepted term and still believe it more closely follows the Nahuatl original although <i>flowery wars</i> more closely resembles the Spanish. However, this is not the case in a leading book on the subject. In Inga Clendinnen's <i>Aztecs: An Interpretation,</i> Cambridge University Press, Canto Edition 1995, there are only references to <i>flowery war</i> or <i>flowery wars</i> (according to a Search Inside on Amazon.com) and not a single one to <i>flower war</i>: pp. 34, 97, 122 along with three refernces in the Back Matter. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua">Interlingua</a> 23:29, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Although one could drink pulque, a fermented beverage with an alcoholic content equivalent to beer, getting drunk before the age of 60 was forbidden. While the first time was punished, reincidents could get the penalty of death."</p>
<p>is this for real? in a civilization without modern medicine, how many people would even make it to that age? i've read elsewhere that the life expectancy in classical civilizations was often less than 40, depending on the civ. i cant think what wikipedia article said that, but it didnt have citations either. i suppose the elite of society might live to 60 being pampered, and thus allowed to drink, but why not just make the rule that only the elite can drink?

<dd>It's the <i>average</i> life expectancy at birth that is most often cited.

London, WI: He took this part from the mendocino codex, and is also mentioned in the florentine codex. Maybe i need to expand this. The penalties for getting drung were not equal to all. Comon people who get drunk were only admonished at first and could get a physical punishment and his head was saved, as a public display. It was pillis (nobles) who could get a death peanlty if they get drunk before get to 60. From the aztec point of view, a greter status impied a greater responsability. The mean life of aztecs was 38 years, so those who get to old age, were higly respected. Old men and woomen were pampered, no matter their origin, They were the holders of the Huehuetlatoli.. and enyoy yo give long lecture on every festivy.

<p>Hi, I got here as an extension of a massive restructuring of the Hernan Cortes article.</p>
<p>As part of the restructuring, I moved the discussion of Cortes' campaign against the Aztecs to a new article entitled <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Conquest_of_Mexico_9307.html" title="Spanish Conquest of Mexico">Spanish Conquest of Mexico</a>. There is also a separate article entitled the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Tenochtitlan_5509.html" title="Siege of Tenochtitlan">Siege of Tenochtitlan</a>. This all started because some of the contributors to the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hernan_Cortes_ffbb.html" title="Hernan Cortes">Hernan Cortes</a> article was getting too long.</p>
<p>The Aztec article is even longer than the Cortes article was before I started moving stuff to other articles.</p>
<p>I am now proposing to pull out the text in the Downfall section of the Aztec article and merge it into the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Conquest_of_Mexico_9307.html" title="Spanish Conquest of Mexico">Spanish Conquest of Mexico</a>, leaving behind a brief summary as a stub. I would use the "main article" template to reference the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Conquest_of_Mexico_9307.html" title="Spanish Conquest of Mexico">Spanish Conquest of Mexico</a> article.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article violates NPOV?</span></h2>
<p>Sure seems to me that a great deal of this article VIOLATES Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View Policy. There are facts here and there are opinions here which should be moved elsewhere.</p>
<hr />
<p>The above comment was made by 68.77.6.169. What 68.77.6.169 says may be true but I will point out that it is very difficult to maintain a NPOV on some topics, especially when it is easy to make a judgment based upon deep-rooted prejudices and assumptions.</p>
<p>I have scanned the article quickly and I don't see any blatant NPOV issues although I'm sure I could pick some out if I really tried. Is the problem that the article favors Aztecs over other Mesoamerican cultures or vice versa? Or is it that it favors Aztecs over the Spaniards or vice versa?</p>
<p>It would help if 68.77.6.169 and others would specifically identify the opinions that they think which should be moved elsewhere. I am open to this idea but I need help identifying the specific points which are considered to be opinions. Once we've done that, we can think about where those opinions should go.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't think the NPOV issues are important enough to warrant a separate article but I'm willing to be convinced. Please get down to brass tacks and specify what the issues are so we can discuss them.</p>

<p>I am starting a section with items which I think may be NPOV candidates. Please express your opinion about these items especially regarding a possible decision to move them to a separate article. Also please add any items that you wish to be considered for removal.</p>
<p>Note: Unless a NPOV issue generates enough controversy to warrant a 2-3 paragraph article of its own, I think it would be preferable to identify the issue and characterize the controversy in this article rather than create links to articles that have only one or two sentences.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I know that some part of the article may seem to violate NPOV, but thats because most of the history of mesoamerican cultures has been taken from european sources. It was not until 1940 that important writen material from native writers have been translated and given pubicity. Because of this, I favored this first hand sources (by native sources), and also from archeological findings. Clearly some others points of view are needed, for example i am planing to expand the history as was written by the Tlaxcalteca. Of course this section could be perceived as "anti" aztec... but instead i thing it would provide insight in the complex mesoamerican politics.</dd>

<dd>I think it is very difficult to achieve NPOV. Sometimes, there isn't a single objective truth available to us. We must then provide as many POVs as we think are legitimate.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We should try to provide all the POVs that we know about and maybe indicate where some POVs that we think are possibly mistaken. For example, it is a fact that <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_H._Prescott_9f13.html" title="William H. Prescott">William H. Prescott</a> thought that there was a "right to conquest" and that therefore Cortes did nothing wrong. <a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=PreConq.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=46&amp;division=div2" class="external autonumber" title="http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=PreConq.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=46&amp;division=div2" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> That's his POV.

<p>"Although cities under Aztec rule seem to have paid heavy tributes, excavations in the Aztec-ruled provinces show a steady increase in the welfare of common people after they were conquered."</p>
<p><br />
Issue: Could indicate a pro-Aztec POV. Recommendation: Reword to indicate that "some scholars believe..." and provide reference to the scholarly works.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not some scholars.. Archeological findingsso far show that, it is not a belief... I will provide the cite of the work: <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 19:24, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, please cite the work(s). "Archeological findings" don't show anything. Archeological digs find artifacts. Archeologists, anthropologists and other scientists <b>interpret</b> those artifacts as having certain significance. Thus, these scholars put forth theories based on their POV. If you want the article to have a NPOV, you have to say "Scholar X put forth the theory that there was a steady increase in the welfare of the common people."</p>
<p>I know this can be carried to an extreme. I'm just responding to the criticism that this article violates NPOV and trying to find the places where it might so we can counter the charge. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 20:06, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reading this i found something interesting, but maybe it need to be explained in some form....

Smith et al 2004).</dd>

<dd>The reason the above text about improvements in welfare of the common people could be POV is that there's a tradeoff: welfare of common people vs. loss of freedom especially for the victims of human sacrifice.</dd>

<dd>After towns were conquered, they inhabitants were no longer were candidates to human sacrifice (unless it was voluntary). The main victims for human sacrice had to be captive warriors of nahuatl language (see the section on human sacrifice).

<dd>For example, "purepechas" and "totonacas" , since they did not speak nahuatl, their warriors were not apropiate for sacrifice... (mayas were to far away...), and the Chichimecas were considered too savage. The victims for sacrifice were considered "mesengers", so they had to speak nahuatl. Aztec conquered almost all the Nahuatl speaking territories. So They decided to keep Tlaxcala free.. and "let the god (Huitzilopchtli) decided if he need fresh victims as if they were on a market" (words atributed to Tlacaelel)... It,s not surprising they get so much hate form Tlaxcala. Non nahuatl victims were sometimes used for sacrifice, since some other gods were not so demmanding.. but since they were lesser gods, those sacrifice were not so common.. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 23:23, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Of course, conquered towns were subject to tribute, but most schollars agree that after an initial period (when the infrastucture of roads were build), tributes were not specially taxing. The aztec suport the local goverments, and some of the began to considere aztec themselves. Of course, this do not means they were subject to a central goverment, like the Roman empire, but the proces was analogous. Probalby the only records that speak against the aztec, are from the Tlaxcalteca, who called the aztec, Proud and untrustworthy, that is a section i want to add, but I still need to do more research.<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 07:52, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Should a discusion of how the aztec are perceived included?.. I know that there are two extreme perceptions. One is of a bloodthisrty culture.. or other of an "ancient and wise culture, destroyed by barbaric europeans" (there is a "neo pagan" movement that states that... ) Both extremes are equally wrong.</p>

<dd>Yes, exactly. That's what I meant when I said "deep-rooted assumptions". We assume that the other tribes were happy and pleased to see the Aztec empire fall. They may have focused on the heavy tributes demanded by the Aztec empire and not realized the "increase in common welfare" that they were enjoying as the result of being part of the empire. They also were unable to foresee the effect that the Spanish empire would have in wiping out their civilization.</dd>

<dd>As the text reads now, the reader gets the impression that the fall of the Aztec empire caused everybody to break out singing "Ding, dong, the wicked witch is dead."

<dd>Opsss. then i need to rewrite this section. What i as trying to say, is the fall of the aztec empire is usually implied as the fall of all mesoamerica as if the aztec were the only mesoamerican culture.... But in fact at first it did not had a significant impact on the other mesoamerican cultures. The Tlaxcalteca at first were important allies of the spanish, eventually, the spaniard would break the alliance, but that was decades aways. The fall of mesoamerican cultures was a long process, the fall of the aztec empires was just the opening, not the only chapter. It was a combination of circunstances, the most significant was the deadly toll of the epidemics, more than the military power or the politic of spain, a fact that has been slowly by the schollars.</dd>

<dd>Exactly, after the episode of "the noche triste", when Cortez had to run out of Tenochtitlan, the Tlaxcalteca decide to suport tCortez. Tha Aztec send and emisary to convince them of the contrary, but they thought they should protect their guests. Eventually they dediced to be the allies of the spaniards, with come conditions. They would not be subject to any form of tribute, they should receive the city of Cholula i return, and they would had the right to Build a fortress in Tenochtitlan, so they could have control of the city. Initially Cortez tried to suported them, but the spanish authorities were not of the same opinion. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 08:43, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Assessment of Sources</span></h3>
<p>Issue: The "Sources" section passes judgment on the credibility and motivations of various sources. This could be considered POV.</p>
<p>Recommendation: It would be useful to have any judgments about sources backed up by supporting evidence. If you say "Source A exaggerates his numbers" or "Source B was too pro-Spanish", this is POV. On the other hand, if you say "In work X, scholar Y says that source A exaggerates his numbers", this is less POV. You are now stating a fact about what scholar Y said in work X, not passing judgment on source A yourself.</p>

<dd>thanks i will do that, but it will take some time, please be patient. I think i will need o expand the reference section significativally &#160;:) <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 19:30, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>absolutely, patience is always a good thing in a volunteer effort like this. Your contributions have been invaluable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do think that it is not so much the references that need to be expanded but the linkages between the text and the references. Instead of saying "X is true", say "Scholar A says X is true". Or at least say, "it is commonly held belief in scholarly circles that X is true". Once again, doing this too much can make an article unreadable. It's what makes many scholarly articles unreadable. We have to strike a balance between readability and providing supporting evidence.</dd>

<dd>My main problem in this section is how to indicate i am not trying to denounce the sources but to explain the problems that each source have. I found this necesary because not only the indian version and the spanish version of the same incidents differ so much, but because until recently only the european version are widely kwnon.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This of course can be NOPV by itself, so i will need much more help and criticism in this section. An example of this is the case for antropophagia. While there hundred of references. There are only five or six primary sources... and a few arheological findings, but nothing conclusive.</p>
<p>Also i want to make a distintion between primary and secundary sources. After all, what i confess is really NPOV of my part is that i prefer indian sources like Father Sahagun anonimous writters, or even Cortez, and ignore Prescot, since the more extreme opinions over the aztec come from secondary sources. The dividing line is really tenous.... <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 21:22, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, the question should be whether we are after "truth" or documenting how different people and cultures have perceived the truth to be. Your approach looks for "truth". But what has been perceived as truth has changed over time. I'm sure that Prescott was perceived to have been pretty close to the truth by Europeans in the 19th century. Reading him now, his bias is patently obvious. It's not that the "truth" has changed. It is our perception of the truth. This is natural. That doesn't mean we should dismiss Prescott. It means we should describe what he said and explain why parts of what he said are not how we see things today.</dd>

<dd>OTOH, the POV issues in this article are not really that bad and you should spend your time where your interest takes you. If there are other parts of the article or other articles that are more interesting to you, don't feel like the POV criticism was that important. Personally, I think it was more somebody that had an "ax to grind". Worse yet, he/she didn't even tell us what ax he/she was grinding!</dd>

<p>I just expanded the paragraph about Ahuitzotl and the rate of human sacrifice. I assume this text was originally written by Nanahuatin. Does my expansion capture what you were trying to say?</p>
<p>Also, I moved the sentence "In Mesoamerican cultures, faith was an important part of their life and death." to the beginning of the Religion section. In that position, it serves as an introductory summary for the whole section. Put where it was, it seemed to be a bit of an orphan.</p>

<dd>Yes, it deserves an article, i have been postponing it, there still so much to do.. but i will give priority, sincees it,s one of then main sources. It was discover by Fernando Ramírez, while it is credited to Father Tovar, he copied from ana nahuatl source ( the mauscript has two columns, one is empty, and probably he expected to put the original nahuatl there). <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 22:23, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another question about "other cultures"</span></h2>
<p>In the articles about the Aztec empire, we speak often of "cultures" other than the Aztecs. Does this refer to cities like Cholula?</p>
<p>I have to say that I find this use of the word "culture" a little unusual.</p>
<p>I understand what is meant by "European civilization" and "Chinese civilization". I also understand what is meant by "French culture" and "German culture".</p>
<p>What is the meaning of these words when applied to Mesoamerica? I would have expected to see the word "tribe" and yet this word never shows up anywhere in the Mesoamerican articles.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesoamerica.html" title="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a> article, we find the following statement "Mesoamerican metacivilizations included the Olmec, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, Maya, Mixtec, Huastec (also located on Aridoamerica), Pipil, Totonac, Toltec, Tarascan, and the Aztec."</p>
<p>OK, fine. So what are the Tlaxcalatecos? Are they Mexica or non-Mexica Aztecs? What are the Cholulatecos? Are they a non-Aztec culture that was conquered by and paid tribute to the Aztecs?</p>
<p>I ask not just for my own personal learning but also because I don't think these distinctions will be clear to other readers either and I think we should make these distinctions clear in the text.</p>

<dd>The aztec were considered a tribe when they were nomadic, but after they stablished in Tenochtitlan, they created a distintive culture. Mesomerica was formed by city states. Some of them can by grouped into a culture, of example, the Maya, like the greek, they had a comon culture and language, but they never were unified. We could also speak of the nahua culture, that could inlcude Tlaxcala, Tenochtitlan, Atzcapotzalco, Texcoco, Culhuacan etc. But the aztec become so predominat that most of those cities were to be considered part of the Aztec empire and culturally they became the same. Tlaxala was part of the nahua culture, it was a confederacy of several city states, but they keep their own identity, enough to be considered diferent of the aztec culture.. Other mesoamerican cultures were Mixteco/zapoteca, TAjin, Purepechas, Olmeca, Xochicalco, Toltec, Cholula, Cuicuilco etc. Historians clasify those as individual cultures each own with their own language, or at lest their own variant of language. Teotihuacan was a multiethnic, and multicultural city, but it´s achivements were so unique that usually is considered a distinct culture. In the context of the history of mesoamerica, tribe is reserved for nomadic people, like lacandones, Huaves, tarahumaras etc.<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 22:42, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, let me see if I understand this. The Tlaxcalatecos were Nahua and so were eligible to provide victims for human sacrifice even though they were not Aztec. For this reason, they were not conquered.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Cholula were not Nahua and therefore were conquered but were not eligible to provide victims for human sacrifice.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But, if this is true, then the only cultures who would be find the Aztec practice of human sacrifice a problem would be those who were Nahua like Tlaxcala and Texcoco. Those who were not Nahua would not find human sacrifice to be a problem because they were not eligible to be victims of human sacrifice anyway.</dd>

<dd>Almost... The start of the aztec empire was the "triple alliance" formed by Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan (tacuba). The Aztec eventually took over Texcoco, and Tlacopan so they became aztec cities. As a founder member, Texcoco had a lot of priviledges and provide the aztec with their most cultivated citizens. AS the Aztec absorved all nahua cities, that leaved only Tlaxcala (constitued by Tepetícpan, Ocotelolco, Tizatlán y Quiahuiztlan) and Huexotzingo as a source for captives for sacrifice. Cholula originaly was under Huexotzingo, but the aztec absorbed almost all the territory of Huexotzingo, leaving only Talxcala. As you see, there is still so much info to put in the article. And important part, is that the "flowery wars" originally was a treaty decided between the cities of Tezcoco, Tenochtitlan, Tlaxcala and Huexotzingo that was because in 1450, there was a terrible hunger in mesoamerica, and it was believed that sacred wars were needed to end the hunger. By 1455 there was again prosperity in the region, so the sacred wars (xochiyáoyotl) were continued. By the way.. aztec prisioners were also sacrified in Tlaxcala and Huexotzingo... <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 05:59, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> article is rapidly reaching the criteria required to be considered a <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOD_ad34.html" title="WP:GOOD">"good" article</a>. One of the criteria for being considered a "good" article is stability. The content shouldn't be constantly being updated and it shouldn't be subject to edit wars. We're OK on the second point but I want to get your agreement about the first one. Are you more or less happy with the content so that we can stop adding content long enough to qualify as a "good" article? If so, I will nominate it to be that. We probably still need some copy editing but I think the English is adequate throughout most of the article.</p>
<p>The key point here is that we would need to stop adding content and focus on copy editing for a while. If that's OK with you, I would suggest that we go for "good article" status. Even if we don't get GA status, we will get someone to give us pointers on what we need to do to get it.</p>

I want to coment on Aztec writing, aztec medicine, aztec calendary, and maybe more important, the aztec concept of man (wich i have begining to study).

<p>Hi Nanahuatzin,</p>
<p>It is true that the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_conquest_of_Mexico_0d9e.html" title="Spanish conquest of Mexico">Spanish conquest of Mexico</a> article was pulled out of other articles like the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> article and the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Mexico_f035.html" title="History of Mexico">History of Mexico</a> article. I did that and much more as I will explain below.</p>
<p>This is a good time to explain how I got involved in editing these articles. I started by helping my 9 year old son with a homework assignment on <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hernan_Cortes_ffbb.html" title="Hernan Cortes">Hernan Cortes</a>. After doing some Google searches, I discovered that the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hernan_Cortes_ffbb.html" title="Hernan Cortes">Hernan Cortes</a> needed some serious cleanup (in fact, the article had a cleanup tag which has since been removed as a result of my editing work).</p>
<p>Well, as part of the cleanup effort, I discovered that the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hernan_Cortes_ffbb.html" title="Hernan Cortes">Hernan Cortes</a> article had a link to <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Noche_Triste_2871.html" title="La Noche Triste">La Noche Triste</a> which duplicated information from the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Tenochtitlan_5509.html" title="Siege of Tenochtitlan">Siege of Tenochtitlan</a> article. The <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Tenochtitlan_5509.html" title="Siege of Tenochtitlan">Siege of Tenochtitlan</a> article had information which duplicated information in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Mexico_f035.html" title="History of Mexico">History of Mexico</a> article.</p>
<p>So, if I remember correctly, I pulled out most of the information about Cortes, Moctezuma II and Tenochtitlan out of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Mexico_f035.html" title="History of Mexico">History of Mexico</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hernan_Cortes_ffbb.html" title="Hernan Cortes">Hernan Cortes</a> and put it into the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_conquest_of_Mexico_0d9e.html" title="Spanish conquest of Mexico">Spanish conquest of Mexico</a> article. I pulled most of the info about the final battle for Tenochtitlan and put it into the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Tenochtitlan_5509.html" title="Siege of Tenochtitlan">Siege of Tenochtitlan</a> article.</p>
<p>My systematic structure left the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hernan_Cortes_ffbb.html" title="Hernan Cortes">Hernan Cortes</a> article with almost no text about the conquest of Mexico since that information had been moved to the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_conquest_of_Mexico_0d9e.html" title="Spanish conquest of Mexico">Spanish conquest of Mexico</a> article. Similarly, the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_conquest_of_Mexico_0d9e.html" title="Spanish conquest of Mexico">Spanish conquest of Mexico</a> article has almost no information about the final conquest of Tenochtitlan as that information has been moved to the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Tenochtitlan_5509.html" title="Siege of Tenochtitlan">Siege of Tenochtitlan</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, you cannot talk about Cortes and the conquest of Mexico without talking about the Aztecs and Moctezuma II. And now you know how I wound up editing the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> article. All because of a 4th grade homework assignment that was turned in three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Initially, I had only intended to edit the portion of the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> article that was related to the fall of the Aztec empire. If you look higher in this Talk page, you will see a place (section 25) where I proposed moving the "Downfall" section out of this article and merging it with the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_conquest_of_Mexico_0d9e.html" title="Spanish conquest of Mexico">Spanish conquest of Mexico</a> article. That is approximately where I got started editing this article in earnest.</p>
<p>However, I found that the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> article needed a lot of help in a number of sections so I decided to pitch in.</p>
<p>I have tried mightily to put some order to the structure of information in the above-mentioned articles and other related articles. I think I've made some significant improvements although more work is needed.</p>
<p>Please identify the areas that you think need more work and we can discuss them prior to fixing them.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Moved much of the "Religion" section to <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_religion.html" title="Aztec religion">Aztec religion</a> article</span></h2>
<p>As if the problems mentioned by Nanahuatzin above weren't enough, I have now added to the issues to be regularized by moving some of the text from this article to the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_religion.html" title="Aztec religion">Aztec religion</a> article.</p>
<p>Here's my rationale:</p>
<p>Before I resurrected it, the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_religion.html" title="Aztec religion">Aztec religion</a> link used to redirect to the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_mythology.html" title="Aztec mythology">Aztec mythology</a> article. However, this suggests that the most important thing to discuss about Aztec religion is a discussion of their pantheon of gods which is what the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_mythology.html" title="Aztec mythology">Aztec mythology</a> article provides.</p>
<p>When I looked at the history of <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_religion.html" title="Aztec religion">Aztec religion</a>, I found that it used to consist of a long piece of unwikified text that was in dire need of cleanup and reorganization. So I did it. I merged the original <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_religion.html" title="Aztec religion">Aztec religion</a> text with the text from the "Religion" section of the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> article and put it in <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_religion.html" title="Aztec religion">Aztec religion</a> after breaking the redirect.</p>
<p>Now, I know there is also an article entitled <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sacrifice_in_Aztec_culture_a901.html" title="Human sacrifice in Aztec culture">Human sacrifice in Aztec culture</a>. The next step in this cleanup process is to move the "Human sacrifice" section out of the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_religion.html" title="Aztec religion">Aztec religion</a> article and merge it with the text in the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sacrifice_in_Aztec_culture_a901.html" title="Human sacrifice in Aztec culture">Human sacrifice in Aztec culture</a> article.</p>

<p>I think the Human sacrifice section should be a section aparte. While it was an important part of the religion, it was more thant that, It was a social tool and a a political tool. Iw was a speciall phenomna on it,s own. On the other hand i wan to rename the article on Azte religion, to "prehispanic religion", and explian that the aztec religion was just a busubset of the prehisnpanic religion. That is because Tlaloc, Tezcatlipoca, Quetzalcoatl, were not aztec gods. EManwhile Huitzilopoctli, and Coatlique were. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 02:43, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">warnings on aztec religion</span></h2>
<p>In the last decades, and probably due to the New age movement, a lot of groups are trying to revive the azte religion. In the proces they are mixing concepts from european and induh esoteric traditions, thus reinventing the prehispanic religions (you will see them every solstice in the pyramides, dressed in white, while "recharging" their "energy"). While i am trying to revert the aditions of this people, not always i succed. The simptons are, complety deny of the practice of Humman sacrifice and Antropopagy. While this practices do not seems to have the huge numbers of popular accounts, they were real, and can not by denied. Also ther took to extrems some claims by historians. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 02:43, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was going to make the revert that you requested but it appears you have already fixed the problems you were complaining about. The text you deleted was stuff that I found in the old Aztec religion article. I had no way of knowing whether it was correct or not. I was a little suspicious because I had never heard of the "Popol Vuh" before. However, since I am not an expert in this area, I fi~gured I'd let someone who was an expert decide. Is there such a thing as a "Popol Vuh"? If so, what is it?</dd>

<p>Those are diferentet things. The actual number of sacrifices is hotly debated. There is little info about it in the primary sources ,and some of the figures are higly improbable.

<dd>AAAGH!!! My profuse apologies if I contributed to that stuff being in the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> and Human sacrifice in the Aztec culture articles. The only explanation that I can think of is that it might have been in the last version of the Aztec religion article before it was merged into <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_mythology.html" title="Aztec mythology">Aztec mythology</a>. I assumed that the last version would have been the best but the last version apparently included this POV stuff that asserted that human sacrifice never happened.

<dd>shamanism is mainly a method of healing between naturalistic religions, instead the aztec had priest, those dedicated to healing were "ticitl" who had little to do with religion. While Shamans existed in small towns, they were looked with suspiction by the priest.</dd>
<dd>I do not know if the claims of bloodletting and endorfins are right. I would like to found the original source of this before comiting to the article. While bloodleting was used by the aztec, specailly priest, the most common form, was to offer maguey torn tainted in blood, which would involved only small quantities of blood. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 14:29, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please, double check the info before commiting to the main article. There is a lot about the aztec in the wikipedia that i have not cheked in a long time. For example, the info deniying the human sacrifice, was reworded from my own writting.... with soo much movement in the wikipedia, sometimes it,s dificult to cope with new adtitions. I am not a schollar, but an enginner, so i try to understand and double check everything before putting it here, so i move a bit slowlly. I have been adding to this article for almost a year and a half...  :) <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 19:51, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Peoples, I have a question. Why is everyone so intent on making it clear that indians are perfect in every way, shape and form? These people made human sacrifices for crying out loud! Yet your still pressing that its the europeans that are savages. I still can't believe how they portray those angelic native north americans at school. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.36.89.104 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.36.89.104_6503.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.36.89.104">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>In particular, there is this sentence...</p>
<p>"Because of the fall of their social structure, the population had to resort to the Spanish to maintain some order."</p>
<p>Did you (Nanahuatzin) write this? If so, can you explain what you meant? Are you saying that the internal social structure of the Aztecs and related cultures fell apart so that only the Spaniards were left to impose order on the indigenous societies of Mesoamerica? The above text implies that but it is too terse to really get the point across. Can you expand on this point?</p>

<dd>Yes that is what i try to imply. It is deliberately terse.. because</dd>
</dl>
<p>i still looking for info about the process. Of course, it was much more complex than that The great urban centers fell apart, the former autorities were drestroyed and the procces used by the spaniard to concentrate the survivors in a few population centers, destroyed the power of the upper classes. That is how mesaomerican cultures colapsed.. But.. it was not the same for all, and i sill don`t know how voluntary was this process. Certainly the mesoamerican culture were attacacek by the misioners. The educatinal system was torn apart, and instead of providing education for all, at first only those considered noble receievd some education, and then all of them were forbitten of having any education.. Their attack also was resposible of the fall of the social structure. The chichimeca fought for 60 years. And i amd still not certain of the process in the south (mixteca/zapoteca/trarascos). I will prefer to left it like this until i confirm if this was the same for all cultures. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 02:31, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Limited perspective of this entry</span></h2>
<p>I find the Aztec entry very limited in scope, and it would be good to broaden the coverage. Here is what I mean by limited. (1) consideration is limited mostly to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan, with little information on the other 2 million Aztec peoples in central Mexico. For example, city-states were far more important to most Aztec people than was the Triple Alliance empire, but the entry ignores city-states. In this and other topics, the coverage follows what the Mexica said about themselves (often biased, self-serving, and even incorrect), and not what scholars have managed to reconstruct of Aztec society and culture. (2) There is almost no archaeology in the entry, but this is where the major advances are being made in understanding Aztec life, the conditions of elites and commoners, cities and urbanization, agriculture, and a wide range of economic and social aspects. (3) Most of the information is from a small number of texts (the chroniclers), with little consideration of administrative documents or codices.</p>
<p>The net result is an entry that only covers a small part of what we know about the Aztecs, and only a small part of what is interesting and important about this culture. I'd like to contribute more, but just don't have much time right now. I did make some additions to the bibliography, and I'll try to add some material as I have time.</p>

<dd>Yes, as stated in the entry, this articles centers about the Mexica, the other peoples, could no be extrictly called Aztec. This is a limited term, barely used in prehispanic times. What i think we need, and is an article about the nahua in general, Tlaxclateca, Acolcua, Tepaneca, etc..., where the Mexica were just one of them.</dd>
<dd>most of the info i have put, is confirmed on archeological findings, but as you say, there is so much to say, that the article has to be broken in sections. I invite you to visit those parts and put from what your perspective is important. I have centered most about the mexica historical sources, since a lot of this info is unknow to most english speaking readers.</dd>

The society section is pretty much okay, in the people section I've added the "Great emperors" list from one of the articles, maybe we can add all the emperors, maybe others, I'll leave that to you. The template should not get too long. The history section is not good at all, mostly because the articles currently are not organized well. Ideally there should be a page "History of the Aztecs" or "Aztec Empire" (currently redirect), with subpages like "Rise of the Aztec Empire", "Aztec Triple Alliance", "Fall of the Aztec Empire", maybe more, so this section in the template can give an overview of the complete Aztec History. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 12:27, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've added all emperors to the template. Of course in this form it's impossible to add Aztec people who were not emperors to the template, I don't know if this is a problem.

<dd>There is currently no "History" page for either the Inca or Mayan civilizations. I am planning to add "History of the Inca" and "History of the Maya" (note no "s" at the end of these). You could make the title "History of the Aztec" or "Aztecs". The second is more natural sounding for an English speaking. We could use "the Inca" or "the Incas" but it's either "the Maya" or "the Mayans". I only mention this so that we can be consistent across these three major preColumbian civilizations.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The same paragraphs are being crammed into multiple articles</span></h2>
<p>Richard, I see you have added huge blocks of history back into this article, with numerous headers. I think it is not a good thing to have the same verbiage in multiple places. For example, look at the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztecs.html#Great_leaders" title="Aztecs">Great leaders</a> section. Although there's really no information there (in fact, there's mis-information, giving numbers of 20,000 - 80,000 sacrifices), that whole section appears in 2 different articles, plus there's an entire article on each of these folks <i>and</i> there's a list of Aztec rulers in the template at the top or each article.</p>
<p>I also don't see a reason to try to summarize each little bit of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Aztecs_3b1c.html" title="History of the Aztecs">History of the Aztecs</a> article within this <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztecs.html" title="Aztecs">Aztecs</a> article. An overview might be appropriate, but the piecemeal tickie-checkie unconnected-sentences approach makes for a poor article, IMHO.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_religion.html" title="Aztec religion">Aztec religion</a> article is just a paste job from the Aztec mythology and human sacrifice articles (with a bit on the modern neo-Aztecs at the end). The section entitled "Assessment of the practice of human sacrifice" is appearing in <i>three</i> separate articles!!</p>
<p>All these sections appearing in multiple articles makes a frustrating experience for anyone using this encyclopedia, and has ballooned the main article back up to "too large" size -- right now it's larger than the Ancient Egyptian or Ancient China articles and is a back to being an all-over-the-map grab bag.</p>
<p>I would rather see us trying to create an interlocking set of great articles with largely separate content instead of trying to make each article a stand-alone crammed with as much verbiage as it will hold. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 12:53, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. It's not easy really to make these sections under a header pointing to a main article. You need to have an overview of the other article and insight in what is important, which takes quite a bit of knowledge. On the whole it's probably easiest to keep it relatively short, without subsections. For examples we'd best look at other articles such as <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, which has a very long history section (too long imho) and refers to a main article. USA is probably good but not featured; featured country articles are for example <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, which have a shorter history section (but still pretty long). I think the three examples show more or less what we need: an essay mentioning the main points, leaving out the details and putting things in a context. But again, this takes quite a lot of knowledge and it will probably take us some time to get it right. If there is a good example in the Spanish encyclopedia, we could request a translation. For a start I think we better take out the subsections and make it more essay-like.
<ul>
<li>On a side note: the USA article is 76 kilobytes long, much longer than this article before it was split. But otoh the subject probably warrants this – I still think we need to split this and bring both the main article and the side articles to a decent standard. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 13:48, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree as well. I put the slightly condensed History section back because you (Madman2001) had removed the entire History section without leaving a summary or even a reference link. You and Piet have been moving stuff out of articles without leaving a summary behind and that's not a good thing. Articles like <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_civilization.html" title="Maya civilization">Maya civilization</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> are summary articles which should provide a broad-brush overview of all important topics with reference links to subsidiary "main" articles that provide more detail.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I admit that I was daunted at 1AM by the job of writing a really good summary that isn't just a repetition of the text from <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Aztecs_3b1c.html" title="History of the Aztecs">History of the Aztecs</a> article but, then again, that's why Wikipedia is a collaborative effort. IMO, we need to do two things: (1) make the "History" section in the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> article really concise and pithy (i.e. shorten it more) (2) expand the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Aztecs_3b1c.html" title="History of the Aztecs">History of the Aztecs</a> article with even more info so that the reader will feel that it was worth jumping to a separate article because there is enough additional info to make it worth reading over the same material in much greater detail. Task #2 is probably a job for Nanahuatzin. I may take a whack at Task #1 from time to time but I hope that the two of you (Madman2001 and Piet) will help.</dd>

<p>I would also like to suggest that we move the long quotations to another article or even to Wikiquotes. They really don't belong in the main Aztec article, methinks.

<dd>I have thought along those lines since I came to the Aztec article a month ago. I think the problem is that the quotes are unencyclopedic. Problem is: Where do we move them to? I can't conceive of a suitable article title for them. I don't know much about Wikiquotes. Another possibility might be Wikisource.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deficiencies in spelling and grammar</span></h2>
<p>The problem here is that Nanahuatzin is a Mexican whose command of English is obviously not great. He also suffers from the fact that many words that are capitalized in English are not capitalized in Spanish. Madman2001 has complained about this before. Nanahuatzin has promised to try harder but I would guess that there are inherent limits to his ability to keep that promise.</p>
<p>This may be difficult for Piet to understand as an European who obviously has a good command of English. However, it is not as common for Mexicans to have as strong a command of English as it is for Europeans.</p>
<p>One alternative would be for Nanahuatzin to write in Spanish (possibly in the Spanish Wikipedia) and leave it for someone else to translate. I see this as an inferior alternative as the limiting factor is not the copyediting but the flow of information from Nanahuatzin to us. I have tried translating his Spanish before and my ability to translate Spanish is inferior to my ability to copyedit his English.</p>
<p>Another alternative would be to create a sandbox copy of each page (e.g. Aztec/Sandbox and ask Nanahuatzin to put his contributions there. We would then have to edit the sandbox and copy the edited text over to the real page. That creates an extra level of effort that seems unnecessary given the nature of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I'm sure Nanahuatzin is trying as best as he can but, look at it this way, do you see anybody else contributing substantive content? Would you prefer that we just stop here and leave the article content as is without further expansion? If not, perhaps we should be grateful and appreciative of his contributions and contribute ourselves by cleaning up his English.</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but I have to agree with what Madman has said before. Nanahuatzin did not try very hard. If he had used preview or show differences and payed attention, he would have noticed that Nahua and Aztec were not capitalized (remark has been made), that institution was missing an s (in Spanish the s is there as well) and I'm sure he knows gropus is not an English word. That's four mistakes that are hard to explain except by nonchalance. I don't want to propose that he uses a sandbox or puts changes at the talk page first, it would create more work. I notice his mistakes and I correct them, that's fine. But I found it impossible to explain the mistakes by insufficient knowledge, and that is what annoyed me. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 17:15, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article quality</span></h2>
<p>This dialog moved here from my Talk Page so that all can participate.</p>
<p>I've been working on some other subjects, I'm still following the Cortes / Tenochtitlan articles but a bit from a distance. A lot has happened there in the last month, which is very good. I still intend to work on them but other things keep getting in the way. A general remark is that at the moment enormous amounts of text are added, which has led to a few articles that are too large. And we should find some images to illustrate the articles. Usually contemporary paintings are very good for this, as there are no copyrights (you can scan them from a book and use them under the { {PD-art} } license - only goes for pictures of paintings, not pictures of statues etc). Anyway, we're very good on the quantity part but we need some more quality now. But we're moving on, which is great. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 09:07, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with your analysis, <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a>. We need to concentrate on bringing all the present pieces together in a coherent narrative. That would mean removing data/words that are duplicated within articles and, to a lesser extent, between articles. And we need images, too. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 16:55, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I asked a week or two ago if we wanted to push this article towards being a "good article". Nanahuatzin's response is that there was still a lot more that he wanted to put into the article. At that point, I backed off. However, I think there is a building consensus among Piet, Madman and myself that we want to focus on quality.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's what I propose. I'm going to create a page called <a href="../../../a/z/t/Talk%7EAztec_Notes_eeff.html" title="Talk:Aztec/Notes">Talk:Aztec/Notes</a>. I would urge Nanahuatzin to put new additions in that page. The rest of us editors should watch that page and periodically copyedit Nanahuatzin's contributions and move them to the appropriate article. The appropriate location may not be the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> article. It could be a subsidiary page or even a new page if one is deemed appropriate. We should discuss the relationship of the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> page with its subsidiary pages. When moving text, a note should be left behind in <a href="../../../a/z/t/Talk%7EAztec_Notes_eeff.html" title="Talk:Aztec/Notes">Talk:Aztec/Notes</a> indicating where the text was moved and a signature should be left so we know who did it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>I think we have the makings of a great series. This quality problem has been an obstacle and I think the above proposal will allow us to control quality without stifling Nanhuatzin's contributions.</dd>

<dd>Thanks. I think it´s a good idea. All the movements, editing and copyediting of all of you in the last months has given a lot of structure and coherence to the aztec and related articles. I started to edit the aztec article about two years ago, and i have been building it bit by bit, with the aid of a lot of people. If you wonder why i have been strugling with english, instead of adding to the spanish wikipedia, is that this version is seen by a lot more of people, and copied into a lot of places. So I will do whathever is necesary to have quality here. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 23:30, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your own photographs are yours, you can upload them here or at Wikimedia Commons (to make them available for other language wikis) and then link to them. It means however that you have to release them into the public domain. If you need help uploading, let me know.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for scans from books, there is a distinction between 2D and 3D images. A picture of a temple (3D) is copyrighted because there has been a certain choice of angle etc. You can't scan those. A picture of a painting (2D) is seen as a replication and has no copyright. If the painter died a long time ago, the copyright of the original painting has expired and every copy / scan is completely free.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, for temples etc., if you have pictures of buildings / temples that would be great. As for scans, see for example the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Educacion_azteca.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Educacion_azteca.jpg" rel="nofollow">Aztec drawing from this article</a> or this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ghent_Altarpiece_D_-_Adoration_of_the_Lamb_2.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ghent_Altarpiece_D_-_Adoration_of_the_Lamb_2.jpg" rel="nofollow">medieval painting</a>, which has a more correct copyright tag.</dd>

<dd>Let's focus on the question of the "Borgia Codex". Presumably, Nanahuatzin is saying that he has a copy of the "Borgia Codex" and not the actual Codex itself. If he did have the actual Codex, any scans would be OK as long as Nanahuatzin licensed the scan according to Wikipedia policy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, if Nanhuatzin has a copy of the Codex, the problem becomes who owns the copyright on that copy of the "Borgia Codex"? Is the copy in the public domain or does someone assert a copyright on it at this time? I think it's difficult but possible to assert copyright over the image of a public domain document (e.g. a picture of the Declaration of Independence). I think you can't copyright the text but you can copyright the picture. Now, what happens if you scan the picture and crop it so that the document is not evident but just the actual writing on the page? I don't know.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Next, what exactly is Nanahuatzin proposing to scan? The text of the Codex or a picture that was in the Codex? Presumably, no one posesses a copyright to the pictures or the text.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, we need some clarification as to what Nanahuatzin is actually proposing to do.</dd>

<p>No, for a 2D work or for text it doesn't matter if he has the copy or the original codex, because no one can hold any rights over this copy. If I make a copy of a painting in the public domain, and I sell it to you, I do not hold any rights over that copy. The copyright has expired and making a copy does not create any new rights since I'm not adding anything to it. That's how I understood it. A 2D copy of a 2D original can not contain anything that was not in the original, therefore there has been no act of creation and there can be no copyright.</p>
<p>But if I sell you a picture of a 3D work, I have a copyright over the picture because it is considered a new creation. The Borgia Codex was created long enough ago (I suppose) so we don't have to worry about it. It is in the public domain regardless whether it's text or drawings. You can always ask the question at one of the talk pages at Wikimedia Commons if you're not sure. Anyway, we should not discuss it here since we definitely need an expert if we're in doubt. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 22:53, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

The most notable point was that the opening paragraph discussed the origin of the Aztecs and their homeland Aztlan. It would seem to make sense that Aztecs came from Aztlan. However, I changed the use of Mexica and Aztecs so that Mexica came from Aztlan and did not become Aztecs until the Triple Alliance created the Aztec Empire.</p>
<p>This represents my best understanding of how the names should be used. Yes, I know that the term Aztec was invented by Humboldt many years after the fall of Tenochtitlan but unless we're just going to change Aztec to Mexica throughout the article, we need some guideline of how to use the terms?</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<dd>I think is my fault, i have been using more Mexica than Azteca, a least in Mexico, in archeology, few specialist use Azteca and all the museums use Mexica. But i accept taht most of the population uses Azteca. As a compromise, i think you are right and Azteca could be uses as Hundboldt intended. As the people under the Triple Alliance, and kept mexica, for the people of the individual cities of Tlatelolco and Tenochtitlan. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 05:51, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just began to read the aubin codex, acording to this, in Aztlan, the nahua live under the rule of a powerfull elit, called the Azteca Chicomostoca. The seven tribes run out of Aztlan, to seek new lands. The Mexica were the last of them, guided by their priest "Huitzil". His god spoke trough the priest and ordered them to never called themselve Azteca, the name of theyr former masters, so they should be called Mexica instead. I will try to write somehitn about this and put so you can review it. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 05:51, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I noticed that inconsistency in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_conquest_of_Mexico_0d9e.html" title="Spanish conquest of Mexico">Spanish conquest of Mexico</a> article as well, sometimes within the same paragraph. I would agree that the term <i>Mexica</i> could/should be used prior to the Triple Alliance, with <i>Aztec</i> being the term thereafter. During some copy-editing of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_conquest_of_Mexico_0d9e.html" title="Spanish conquest of Mexico">Spanish conquest of Mexico</a>, therefore, I replaced Mexica with Aztec. In addition, per recommendation from <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockero_6950.html" title="User:Rockero">Rockero</a>, I standardized on "Tlaxaclan". I hope that I have not stepped on anyone's toes. Thanks, <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">User:Madman2001</a> 15:18, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I noticed the change to "Tlaxcalan" and was annoyed by it because I thought we had decided to standardize on "Tlaxcalteca" but I couldn't remember for sure and it wasn't top on my list of priorities. Please consult the discussion in <a href="../../../a/z/t/Talk%7EAztec_Usage_9e44.html" title="Talk:Aztec/Usage">Talk:Aztec/Usage</a>. Then let's come to a resolution. There are valid arguments for "Tlaxcalan" and for "Tlaxcalteca" and even for just "Tlaxcala". The best comment in the whole batch was "Generally there are few hard and fast rules for forming Mesoamerican demonyms, although there are some widely-observed conventions"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for Mexica/Aztec during the time of the Spanish conquest, I would like to understand from Nanhuatzin whether there is ever any value in distinguishing the Mexica from the Aztec after the formation of the Triple Alliance. If I correctly understand what he has written, the Mexica are the inhabitants of Tlatelolco and Tenochtitlan and all the Nahuatl-speakers outside those two cities are Aztec but not Mexica. But, is this a distinction worth making in Wikipedia? It may be technically correct but only serve to confuse rather than enlighten the reader.</dd>

<dd>For the time being, there is not necesary to point the diference, but as we have being reminded, the article has not touched anything about the "aztec provinces". But I hope we would be expand later, so to keep this difference in mind. Also, i think it would be interesant to remind that most of the cities under aztec ruling, abandoned the alliance since they did not considered themselves "mexica" although they could be called "azteca". Only the Tlatelolca, who were aslo Mexica, stayed loyal, even if they had a lot of disagrements with the Tenochca, since originally they were independent of them. I want to writte a more about Tlatelolco, the current article says little about their history. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 22:18, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, this is the sort of thing that I suspected was lurking behind the Mexica / Aztec distinction. When time permits, we should put this in the article. I think it's kind of like the Roman Empire vs. the Romans. Just because you were part of the Roman Empire didn't mean you were Roman. Nor did it mean that your allegiance was to Rome. It just meant that the Romans had you subjugated for the time being.--<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 22:43, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly, and another point is that the mexica were just one of the nahuatl groups, a lot of the cultural aspects were common to the other nahuas. A good analogy wold be ancient greece, where several city states had common language, gods, and culture, and from time to time one of the cities would predominate over the others, but each city state could retain some individuality. In this case what i try to remind our readers that the main cultural aspects were not created by the mexicas, but adopted and transformed by them ( mhhh.. i hope i could make it clear.. it´s 2 AM....). <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a> 07:26, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nanahuatzin has joined <a href="../../../a/z/t/WP%7EAZTEC_be17.html" title="WP:AZTEC">Project Aztec</a>. Nobody else has. That's OK, listing your name as a "participant" is just a formality. Hopefully you've checked out the page and will add any information that you feel is relevant.</p>
<p>Personally, I think creating a project for Aztec-related articles is a bit of overkill. I think there are about 25 Aztec-related pages and about 5 active editors. This is at the very low end of the range for which a project page is useful.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I thought I'd give it a try partly to give a home to the decisions we've take about terminology <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Aztec_Terminology_1a17.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Aztec/Terminology">Wikipedia:WikiProject Aztec/Terminology</a>.</p>

<p>When applying for featured status (maybe for good article status too), we will get the complaint that there are not enough references in the text. It is not enough to have a big list of references at the bottom. Ideally, we would have to say in almost every paragraph what source the information is from. Take a look at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_rain_in_Kerala_5ce2.html" title="Red rain in Kerala">Red rain in Kerala</a> – which is not featured. Guideline is <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>. I would try to improve this a bit, then request a peer review. Other things: relevant picture in every section (not bad as it is, but maybe not enough to be featured); and to get featured, we probably need something about architecture (isn't that a big gap in our article, or is it not as important as I would think?). <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 09:19, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

The epidemic ranked with the deadliest disasters that native annals customarily recorded.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of Nahuatl words</span></h2>
<p>I think too many nahuatl words are used. I some sections it is difficult to know what is meant. Example: <i>Fathers admonished their daughters to be very clean, but not to use makeup, because they would look like ahuianis.</i> I don't know what ahuianis means and it is not explained in that place. I'm guessing it means prostitute, if so I would use that word or a similar English word. In general, I think we should use English except when it is impossible for lack of a good translation. We should limit the number of Nahuatl words to a set that is small enough to handle for the non-expert reader. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 10:34, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry.. My fault, for not explaining.. not all agree that <i>ahuani</i> (bringer of hapiness) were protitute, since there are also references to common prostitues in the streets for the common folks... It seems they were in charge of the "happinnes" of the elite warriors... Of course none of this ocupations were well apreciated by aztec mothers... Sometimes it is translated as a less compromising "coourtisan" (if my enlgish is correct, that is a woman of the court.). Old ahuanis try to keep their beauty with makeup, hence the reference. Ussualy when old they sell themselves as slaves to buy more makeup and try to maintain little more their way of life. Originally the section explaining about ahuani was nearer that text... <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanahuatzin_4ff2.html" title="User:Nanahuatzin">Nanahuatzin</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Footnotes</span></h2>
<p>I've moved a few references to footnotes. What I wanted to do was bring a common citation style to the article, but I ran into a few problems. Here are the options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harvard referencing: like (Boone, 1989). This is the most scientific, but I don't like it because it breaks the flow of the article.</li>
<li>Footnotes: like the ones I have added. There is an equivalent template that doesn't put "Note x" next to the reference; this would be better. Disadvantage is that we have to number them ourselves.</li>
<li>ref template: this is the one I prefer. In the text you add "&lt;ref name=xxx&gt;text of the reference&lt;/ref&gt;" and at the bottom of the article you add "&lt;references/&gt;". Example: <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_rain_in_Kerala_5ce2.html" title="Red rain in Kerala">Red rain in Kerala</a>. Everything is done automatically. The problem is that we can no longer format the references section as we want, so splitting in "Primary sources" and "secondary sources" would not be possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>The guideline is at <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 11:20, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I also prefer the "ref template" method. In the <a href="../../../o/l/m/Olmec.html" title="Olmec">Olmec</a> article, we have both <b>Reference</b> and <b>Footnotes</b> sections -- if we do that, the <b>Reference</b> section can be arranged any way we want. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 13:57, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've replaced the notes using the ref template, then realized why I hadn't done so in the first place. A note could be created inside the current list of references, so we could keep the current alphabetic ordering. Using the references template, the order of the reference list will be the order of the references in the text, which is not as good for a long list. I hope someone else knows how to solve this, maybe I'll find it myself. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 15:42, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Richard, over the past week, I have indeed been inserting some of the Commons images into Aztec-related articles. However, I only want to use great images that also have contextual information (like Nanahuatzin supplied with his recent uploads (source, description, etc)). I complained about the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Image%7EAztec_mask_050910_170205.jpg_c8f3.html" title="Image:Aztec mask 050910 170205.jpg">Aztec mask</a> image above. The <a href="../../../e/d/u/Image%7EEducacion_azteca.jpg_8f38.html" title="Image:Educacion azteca.jpg">Aztec Education</a> image from this article is also weak.

<p>What is "the palace of Moctezuma"? Is it the palace of Moctezuma I or Moctezuma II? I would presume that it is the palace of Moctezuma II but it could have been built by Moctezuma I so I figured I should ask for clarification.</p>

<dd>Let me check, but if i remember correcty, the palace was built by Axayacatl and was the residence of Moctezuma II. I was there where Cortez and the Tlaxcalteca (about 3,000 people) stayed. Adding to the confusion... Moctezuma also has two royal houses. Which sometimes are alss refered as Moctezuma Palace.

<p><a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">User:Madman2001</a> put a caption on the mask image in <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_mythology.html" title="Aztec mythology">Aztec mythology</a> that reads, in part, "of Mixtec-Aztec provenance". I interpret this to mean that archeologists don't know whether this mask is Mixtec or Aztec in provenance. Am I reading this right? (<i>Yes, you are. I was trying to say that in as few words as possible. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 16:44, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</i> )</p>
<p>I can imagine a couple different ways to interpret this. Since the Mixtec were conquered by the Aztecs, it could be that we don't know for sure whether the mask is purely pre-conquest Mixtec or a post-conquest Aztec-style mask found in Mixtec territory. It could even be a post-conquest Mixtec-style mask found in Aztec territory outside the Mixtec territory.</p>
<p>My real point, however, is that there is darn little discussion of the <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixtec.html" title="Mixtec">Mixtec</a> in the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> article or in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Aztecs_3b1c.html" title="History of the Aztecs">History of the Aztecs</a> article. Yet, in the <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixtec.html" title="Mixtec">Mixtec</a> article, we are told "In Pre-Columbian times, the Mixtec were one of the major civilizations of Mesoamerica."</p>
<p>I think we need to insert a list of all the "major conquests" of the Aztecs into the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Aztecs_3b1c.html" title="History of the Aztecs">History of the Aztecs</a> article and to summarize the most important ones in the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> article.</p>

<dd>I, for one, am still a bit confused/ignorant about the differences and similarities between all these cultural groups (if that the right word) in Mesoamerica at the time of the Spanish conquest, e.g. Aztec, Mixtec, <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapotec.html" title="Zapotec">Zapotec</a>, Tolteca-Chichimeca, and probably more. They apparently shared common cultural elements, like dieties and languages, so much so that archaeologists have a hard time determining whether some artifacts (like that mask or like several codices) are Mixtec or Aztec, say.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Which is a long-winded way of saying I would be very interested in reading an essay (and having an essay in Wikipedia) discussing the similarities and differences between these cultural groups (or whatever they should be called). <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 16:44, 17 May 2006 (UTC) (The work never ends!)</dd>

<dd>I agree. <i>The Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan would, in the next 100 years, come to dominate the Valley of Mexico and extend its power to both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacfic shore. Over this period, Tenochtitlan gradually became the dominant power in the alliance, and the Triple Alliance territories became known as the Aztec Empire.</i> This is the only thing about this period while the earliest history receives a lot more attention. We could fix this a bit using information from <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_Triple_Alliance_b571.html" title="Aztec Triple Alliance">Aztec Triple Alliance</a>, but without making the history section as a whole longer. The period is not well covered in the other articles either, there's room for expansion there.
