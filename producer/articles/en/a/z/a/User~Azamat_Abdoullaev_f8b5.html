<p>The user of the page is professionally committed to science (theoretical physics and fundamental mathematics) and ontology (general and computing). Our recent knowledge product is the Universal Standard Entity Classification System (USECS), serving as the skeleton construction for all sorts of general encyclopedias as Wikipedia or Britannica. The product line is currently a free downloadable knowledge content <a href="http://www.encyclopedic-intelligence.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.encyclopedic-intelligence.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. We also suggested the unifying account of entities and relationships, known as UFO (unified ontology framework), meeting the tendency of modern sciences to one general context of things. The UFO is constructed as the World Representation and Reasoning Framework, thus being capable to give a consistent account of reality and its complex nonlinear processes: natural processes (physical effects and interractions, chemical reactions and biological processes), psychological processes (mental and cognitive processes), and social processes (economic, political, and cultural).</p>
<p>About our contribution to cleaning up the meaning of such fundamental issues as the world, reality, entity, relationship, knowledge, science, semantics, meaning, truth, mind, intelligence, mechanical intelligence, computing ontologies, etc., please refer to the E-forums file on the site, <a href="http://www.eis.com.cy" class="external free" title="http://www.eis.com.cy" rel="nofollow">http://www.eis.com.cy</a>.</p>

<p>From 1975 to 1981, a postgraduate and research associate at the USSR Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Physics (Moscow, Russia). In 1988 i received a scientific degree in physics and mathematics (the PhD equivalent) conferred by the USSR Academy of Sciences, the Lebedev's Institute of Physics, Moscow. In 1989, a year latter, i submitted a doctorate dissertation in the philosophical sciences (ontology) published as a book, ‘Introduction into Information World’, by the USSR Academy of Sciences. The book pioneered the role of scientific ontology for building encyclopedic intelligence, all-purpose intelligent systems. From 1983 to 1991, i was a research scientist at the Institute of Scientific and Technical Information at the USSR Academy of Sciences and the Government Committee in Scientific and Technical Information. Up to now, i am Director and Chief Research Scientist of two R&amp;D companies, engaged in Computer Intelligence Ontological Framework enabling a new class of Knowledge Society technologies: large scale intelligent systems with encyclopedic knowledge, general reasoning and natural language power driven by standard ontology and semantics technology.</p>

<p>Our vision of Wikipedia is a rationally (ontologically) structured open eclectic system of world knowledge proportionally presenting all significant ideas, perspectives and systems of human learning. But i see two big concerns with the whole project. The first trouble is rather methodological, lack of a solid structure and framework of now chaotically growing topics, subjects and articles; without a skeleton construction one can't erect a building. The general classification of Wikipedia's categories is worse than the Britannica's categorization. Another trouble is concerned with amateurishness and smattering, making Wikipedia a sort of Folkpedia or Faultpedia. And each one can ruin the good cause of an open encyclopedia.</p>
<p>To be specific. Below the benevolent reader may find two illustrative cases to chew about, <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontology.html" title="Ontology">ontology</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meaning.html" title="Meaning">meaning</a>. First one may read how the significant topics should be described, neutrally and objectively and professionally. Then one can see how the important subjects played down in Wikipedia and to check how the stuff stubbornly guarded by its 'creators'.</p>
<p><br />
<b>ONTOLOGY</b></p>
<p><b>Ontology</b> (from the [Greek <i>on</i>, <i>ontos</i> being, existence + <i>logia</i> &lt;<i>logos</i> word, study]) is the philosophical science of <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality.html" title="Reality">reality</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existence.html" title="Existence">existence</a>, or <a href="../../../b/e/i/Being.html" title="Being">being</a>. It studies the basic divisions and modes of being as the general entities and things of reality like as <a href="../../../s/u/b/Substance.html" title="Substance">substance</a> or <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object.html" title="Object">object</a>; <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quality.html" title="Quality">quality</a>, or <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantity.html" title="Quantity">quantity</a>; <a href="../../../c/h/a/Change.html" title="Change">change</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Process.html" title="Process">process</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relationship.html" title="Relationship">relationship</a>. It is characteristic that most accepted definitions of ontology marked by deep similarity:</p>
<p><i>the science of entity (or being) as such; the most general theory concerning reality, being, or existence; the general cosmology or universal science dealing with the whole of reality; the knowledge of the most general structures of reality; the theory of the kinds and structures of things in every domain of reality; the science of the essential nature and fundamental relations of all that exists; the research of the necessary and universal truths about the essences of beings</i>.</p>
<p>Any mature science implies some ontological assumptions about its knowledge domain of study. For ontology serves as the unifying knowledge framework (the general context of use) both for the philosophical sciences as <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemology</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantics.html" title="Semantics">semantics</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethics</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/l/Value_theory.html" title="Value theory">value theory</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a> and for the particular sciences, basic and applied, hard and soft, theoretical or experimental, natural or humane, material or formal.</p>
<p><b>The subject matter and scope of ontology</b></p>
<p>As the most fundamental science, ontology is seeking the final resolution to the problem of problems: "What is existence, being, reality, or entity, and what are the fundamental categories of being identifying the basic classes of things and relationships in the world?" Different <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophers.html" title="Philosophers">philosophers</a> make different lists of such fundamental categories of being. As the science of being <i>qua</i> being, ontology deals with the topmost categories of being and becoming, whereas the particular sciences and branches of knowledge deal with the special classes or kinds of being, as regional and applied ontologies. Therefore ontology is viewed at three distinct levels of abstraction: fundamental and universal level, applied and domain level. The fundamental ontology belongs to the highest human science (known also as metaphysics, dialectic, first philosophy, transcendental philosophy, or natural theology). Since it is all about the universal thing, named <a href="../../../b/e/i/Being.html" title="Being">Being</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entity.html" title="Entity">Entity</a>, or <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thing.html" title="Thing">Thing</a>, the class of which everything must be a constituent part, inclusive the null entity, termed nonbeing or nonentity. Thus foundational ontology is fully concentrated on the issues of being, its essential meanings, nature and key properties, its possible modes, kinds, divisions, and forms and relationships. Along with <i>being</i>, the major categories in terms of which ontology describes reality are: <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causality.html" title="Causality">causality</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chance.html" title="Chance">chance</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Change.html" title="Change">change</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Element.html" title="Element">element</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Form.html" title="Form">form</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matter.html" title="Matter">matter</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind.html" title="Mind">mind</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature.html" title="Nature">nature</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/c/Necessity.html" title="Necessity">necessity</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contingency.html" title="Contingency">contingency</a>, <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object.html" title="Object">object</a>, one and many, <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition.html" title="Opposition">opposition</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quality.html" title="Quality">quality</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantity.html" title="Quantity">quantity</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relation.html" title="Relation">relation</a>, same and other, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space.html" title="Space">space</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/b/Substance.html" title="Substance">substance</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a>, universal and particular, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World.html" title="World">world</a>.</p>
<p><b>Ontological problems</b></p>
<p>The ontological knowledge of being, entity, reality, or existence consists in finding the solutions to the following challenging questions: 1. What is entity, being, thing, reality, the world, or the universe? Or, what are the essential meanings of being? And what is not to be, nonbeing, nothing, or nonentity? 2. What are the primary kinds, classes, genera, and categories? How do the primaries exist? What are their number and character? 3. How should we divide, partition, and classify each kind or genus? What are we to assume as its species or partitions? And what is the full number of contrary divisions of a class? 4. What are the order and interrelationships of the kinds of entities? 5. What are their properties and how should they be truthfully represented?</p>
<p><b>Being and entity</b></p>
<p>The substance (core) of the ontological universe of discourse is nothing else but entity in its major meanings of being, thing, reality with its essential classes and kinds lying behind everything of the sorts of particulars, or concrete things. There are several senses in which the term ‘entity’ can be used. Primarily and most properly, the term is employed as a mass noun referring to <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existence.html" title="Existence">existence</a> or <a href="../../../b/e/i/Being.html" title="Being">being</a> (<i>ens</i> or <i>entia</i> from <i>esse</i> be) as the total class of thing, meaning the essence (substantial nature) of all that exists. But mostly popular is the sense of individual substance, something that exists or is supposed to have actual being or reality, as distinct and self-contained entity. Thus, from one part, the term is linked up with the concept of being. From other part, it is interpreted as a concrete individual; for its meanings range from the class of all things, the most inclusive category possible in the world, to any thing, any concrete individual, an object, a person, a situation, an event, a time, a place, etc. Bearing this inherent semantic ambiguity in the mind, 'entity', 'being' and 'thing' are to be used interchangeably as in the formulas:</p>
<p><i>entity is being and being is entity, while an entity is a being and a being is an entity</i>.</p>
<p>All senses in which things can be said to ‘be’ are comprised by the term ‘entity’: anything, something or nothing are entities or things; individual (material) objects, bodies, or substances belong among entities or beings; minds are entities or beings; states, properties, or qualities are beings; changes, actions, acts, events, processes, and activities are beings; relations as having being are also a sort of entities.</p>
<p><b>The divisions and modes of being: ontological classes</b></p>
<p>It is widely practiced the grouping of things into two or three disjoint divisions of the same rank and status as ontological entity classes. These broad categories are concrete individuals (contingent things as physical objects and events) and universals (necessary things, or abstractions as classes, states, qualities, and relations). Alternatively, this grouping may be extended as the triad: the concrete and the abstract (conceptual, ideal, theoretical entities, or universals) intermediated with collections (or classes or sets) of concrete things (concrete universals). In English, the triple classing is commonly expressed as concrete names (individuals), collective names (collections), and abstract names (classes or masses). Such division originated from the classification of things first given by the progenitor of foundational ontology and formal logic, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, who laid down ten categories of being: <a href="../../../s/u/b/Substance.html" title="Substance">substance</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantity.html" title="Quantity">quantity</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quality.html" title="Quality">quality</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relation.html" title="Relation">relation</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Place.html" title="Place">place</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/s/Position.html" title="Position">position</a>, and <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activity.html" title="Activity">activity</a> or passivity. Sometimes they were reduced to eight categories: <i>being, quality, place, time, relation, quantity, and activity and passivity</i> (or agent and patient as productive <a href="../../../c/a/u/Cause_and_effect.html" title="Cause and effect">cause and effect</a>). Of all the multiplicity of the ensuing typologies, taxonomies, and classifications of entities, the most noteworthy and valuable happen to be those that had been inspired by this definitive model of the primitive classes. Some of the distinguished typologies to be indicated are the general schemes involving the following categories:</p>
<p>1. being, motion (change), stability, <a href="../../../d/i/f/Difference.html" title="Difference">difference</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Identity (philosophy)">identity</a> (<a href="../../../p/l/o/Plotinus.html" title="Plotinus">Plotinus</a>);</p>
<p>2. quantity (<a href="../../../u/n/i/Unity.html" title="Unity">unity</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plurality.html" title="Plurality">plurality</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totality.html" title="Totality">totality</a>); quality (<a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality.html" title="Reality">reality</a>, negation, <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limitation.html" title="Limitation">limitation</a>); relation (inherence/subsistence, causality/dependence, community/reciprocity); modality (possibility/impossibility, existence/nonexistence, necessity/contingence) (<a href="../../../k/a/n/Kant.html" title="Kant">Kant</a>);</p>
<p>3. things (matter, body, spirits, nature, operations, relations), actions (human practice, happiness), <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signs.html" title="Signs">signs</a> (mind, knowledge, representations, sounds, ideas, and words) (<a href="../../../l/o/c/Locke.html" title="Locke">Locke</a>);</p>
<p>4. quality (firstness), relation (secondness) and representation (thirdness) or signs (icons, indexes, symbols) (<a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierce.html" title="Pierce">Pierce</a>);</p>
<p>5. thing, the same or different, kinds, minds, bodies, time, space, subject and attribute, causal influences, the fancied, the real (<a href="../../../j/a/m/James.html" title="James">James</a>).</p>
<p><br />
<b>Causality</b></p>
<p>Causality is the centerpiece of the universe, its central mechanism of changes and so the main subject of <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontology.html" title="Ontology">ontology</a>; for comprehending the nature, meaning, kinds, varieties, and ordering of cause and effect amounts to knowing the beginnings and endings of things, to uncovering the implicit mechanisms of world dynamics, or to having the fundamental scientific knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristole.html" title="Aristole">Aristole</a>, a great mind and ontologist, is the first who claimed that "all causes of things are beginnings", in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysics.html" title="Metaphysics">Metaphysics</a>; that "we have scientific knowledge when we know the cause"; that "to know a thing's existence is to know the reason why it is", in <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posterior_Analytics_802a.html" title="Posterior Analytics">Posterior Analytics</a>. Setting the guidelines for all the subsequent causal theories, by specifying its number, nature, principles, elements, varieties, order, and modes of causation, Aristotle's account of the causes of things is the most comprehensive theory up to now.</p>
<p>According to Aristotle's theory, all the causes fall into several senses, the total number of which amounts to the ways the question 'why' may be answered. Namely, by reference to the following basic things: 1. matter or the <i>substratum</i>; 2. the <i>essence</i>, the pattern, the form, or the structure; 3. the primary moving <i>change</i> or the agent and its action; 4. the goal, the plan, the <i>end</i>, or the good.</p>
<p>Consequently, the major kinds of causes come under the following divisions:</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/a/t/Material_Cause_9758.html" title="Material Cause">Material Cause</a> is that from which a thing comes into existence as from its parts, constituents, substratum or materials. This reduces the explanation of causes to the parts (factors, elements, constituents, ingredients) forming the whole (system, structure, compound, complex, composite, or combination) (the part-whole causation).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formal_Cause_fa54.html" title="Formal Cause">Formal Cause</a> tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis, or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (macrostructure) is the cause of its parts (the whole-part causation).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../e/f/f/Efficient_Cause_e11c.html" title="Efficient Cause">Efficient Cause</a> is that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of "cause" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Cause_7bf9.html" title="Final Cause">Final Cause</a> is that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is. This also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition, need, motivation, or motives, rational, irrational, ethical, all that gives purpose to behavior.</p>
<p>Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. [Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or action or influence of cause and effect.] Also, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects, its presence and absent may result in different outcomes.</p>
<p>Besides, Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. It is also essential that ontological causality does not suggest the temporal relation of before and after between the cause and the effect, that spontaneity (in nature) and chance (in the sphere of moral actions) are among the causes of effects belonging to the efficient causation, and that no incidental, spontaneous, or chance cause can be prior to a proper, real, or underlying cause <i>per se</i>.</p>
<p>All further investigations of causality will be consisting in imposing a favorite hierarchy on the order (priority) of causes, like as final &gt; efficient &gt; material &gt; formal (Aquinas), or in restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or to the efficient causality (deterministic or chance) or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena (the natural sciences describing <i>how</i> things happen instead of explaining the <i>whys and wherefores</i>).</p>
<p>In natural languages (English), chiefly following Aristotle's theory of causes, there are three sorts of causative constructions: i) a set of causative verbs [<i>cause, make, create, do, effect, produce, occasion, perform, determine, influence; construct, compose, constitute; provoke, motivate, force, facilitate, induce, get, stimulate; begin, commence, initiate, institute, originate, start; prevent, keep, restrain, preclude, forbid, stop, cease</i>]; ii) a set of causative names [<i>actor, agent, author, creator, designer, former, originator; antecedent, causality, causation, condition, fountain, occasion, origin, power, precedent, reason, source, spring; reason, grounds, motive, need, impulse</i>]; iii) a set of effective names [<i>consequence, creation, development, effect, end, event, fruit, impact, influence, issue, outcome, outgrowth, product, result, upshot</i>].</p>
<p><b>Ontological truths: the relation between being or reality and the mind</b></p>
<p>The task of ontology is to produce the truest fundamental explanatory schemas of all being and reality, giving the primal rules of all special truths. According to Aquinas, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> is defined as an equation (agreement, correspondence) between the mind (intellect, thought, cognition) and reality (being, thing, entity), where the nature of things or the intellect may be alternatively the measure and rule of each other. Although the truth as a relative entity can reside both in the mind and in the real world, the truth in the intellect (as logical truths) can not be the cause of the truth in things (as ontological truths); for the truth or falsity of the statement (that somebody is) first depends on the fact of the somebody’s being or not being. The ontological verities as the basic laws of reality occupy the highest level in the hierarchy of the kinds of truth: mental, logical, mathematical, semantic, verbal, scientific, empirical as well as moral, ethical, esthetic, and religious. A case of religious truth is the invocation, "There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger", falling into the inclusive ontological statement, "There is no Entity but Being and Relationship is its agency".</p>
<p>The explicit cases of ontological truths admitted by modern sciences are as follows:</p>
<p>1. there are things or (entities) in the world;</p>
<p>2. all things have parts and properties;</p>
<p>3. everything changes with respect to properties;</p>
<p>4. the world and its entities can be in different states;</p>
<p>5. things exist in various relationships with each other;</p>
<p>6. there are changes in which substances participate;</p>
<p>7. changes (or events) exist as causing other changes;</p>
<p>8. time and space are sorts of relationships;</p>
<p>9. causality is the basic mechanism of the world changes;</p>
<p>10. the world is organized into several levels: physical, chemical, bilogical, cognitive, social, and informational.</p>
<p>So the quest of underlying real truths, universal and necessary, is the ultimate goal of the fundamental ontology and ontological theories, aimed to uncover the general knowledge and fundamental laws applicable to all reality and its basic levels, parts, and domains: natural, psychological, social, technological, and informational. For example, when applied to information sciences, <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontology_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Ontology (computer science)">ontology (computer science)</a> is bridging the real world and the information universe, giving the dynamic world modeling fundamentals, principles, constructs, representations, and schemes for building a new class of intelligent technologies and knowledge systems.</p>

<b>MEANING</b></p>
<p>The nature of meaning, its definition, elements, and types, is mainly established by Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas (the AAA framework of meaning). According to the classic tradition, 'meaning is a relationship between two sorts of things: signs and the kinds of things they mean'. One term in the relation of meaning necessarily causes something else to come to the mind as a consequence of itself. In other words: a meaningful relationship usually involves an entity that indicates another entity to some agent for some purpose.</p>
<p>With respect to meaning and signification, a threefold division of things is traditionally suggested; namely: 1. there are things which MAY have meanings (the things of the external world, as all sorts of indications, evidences, symptoms, and physical signals); 2. there are things that ALWAYS have senses and meanings (the entities of the mind); 3. there are things that HAVE to get their meanings (as cultural symbols and linguistic entities).</p>
<p>All modern meaning inquiries emphasize some particular perspectives within the general AAA framework. The major contemporary positions may come under the following specific definitions of meaning:</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought.html" title="Thought">Thought</a>, intention, or understanding, in psychological theories;</p>
<p><a href="../../../i/n/t/Intension.html" title="Intension">Intension</a>, cognitive content, or sense, in logical and cognitive theories;</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/x/t/Extension.html" title="Extension">Extension</a>, reference, or denotation;</p>
<p>Intension and extension;</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/e/s/Message.html" title="Message">Message</a>, content, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a>, or communication;</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a> conditions;</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/s/a/Usage.html" title="Usage">Usage</a>, and the instructions for usage;</p>
