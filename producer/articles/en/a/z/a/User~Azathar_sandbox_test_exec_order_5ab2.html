<ol>
<li>Any player who needs to take a short period of time away from their duties for personal reasons, shall be eligible for a</li>
</ol>
<p>Leave of Absence (LOA).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>A player requesting an LOA, must contact their simulation CO informing them of the LOA. Depending on the reason for the</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>LOA, requests may be granted for a period of up to 14 days. The LOA notification should include a simple reason for the LOA</p>
<p>and the expected return date.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If the period of time needed for the LOA extends beyond 14 days, the CO must authorize the player's leave, and may grant an</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ELOA to a maximum period of 3 weeks.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If after 3 weeks, the player continues to need an LOA, the CO shall make a request with their Task Force CO (TFCO), which</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>shall include the name, rank and reason for the request. The TFCO may grant an ELOA extension.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>At no time shall a player be granted an ELOA lasting longer than 2 months. Should a player be faced with such a scenario,</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>they can request the CO to change the character to a protected PPC status, where no major character alterations can occur,</p>
<p>however that position will be considered open to any other player desiring to apply to the simulation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Any character, position, rank or title possessed by a player who is actively on an approved LOA or ELOA shall be protected</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>from demotion, removal or reprisal by the CO of the simulation for failure to post or otherwise carry out assigned duties</p>
<p>during the LOA period, except as required by provision 1.6 of this by-law.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Any player who is granted an ELOA shall be required to maintain verifiable communications with their CO via email, Instant</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Message, Private Message (IRC or Forums) or forum posting, on at least a bi-weekly basis. Failure to report under this</p>
<p>provision, or to return from the LOA by the agreed return date, may constitute the player as being AWOL, and may subject the</p>
<p>player to corrective action by the CO and/or BFJAG team.</p>
<ol>
<li>Any CO who needs to take a short period of time away from their duties for personal reasons, shall be eligible for a Leave</li>
</ol>
<p>of Absence (LOA)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>A CO requesting an LOA, must contact their TFCO or his/her designate, informing them of the LOA. Such requests are granted</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automatically for a period of up to 14 days. The LOA notification should include a simple reason for the LOA and the expected</p>
<p>return date.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If the period of time needed for the LOA extends beyond 14 days, the TFCO must authorize the CO's leave, and may grant an</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ELOA to a maximum period of 3 weeks.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If after 3 weeks, the CO continues to need an LOA, the TFCO shall make a request with their Division CO, which shall</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>include the name, rank and reason for the request. The Division CO may grant an ELOA extension.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>At no time shall a CO be granted an ELOA lasting longer than 2 months. Should a CO be faced with such a scenario, the TFCO</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>shall be required to contact the XO of the simulation to check eligibility and fitness for command.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If the XO of the simulation does not currently hold a Commanding Officer position in the Fleet, the TFCO shall inquire if</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>the XO wishes to take over the simulation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If the XO already holds a CO position, chooses not to take over the simulation, or is otherwise found unfit for Command,</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>the TFCO shall inquire of the crew of the simulation to see if any candidates to assume Command may be available.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If no suitable candidates are found on the simulation, the simulation shall be closed, and the players on board shall be</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>offered assistance in finding another simulation on which to play.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Executive Officer of the simulation (XO) shall be required to carry the duties of the Commanding Officer of the</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>simulation during the time that the CO of the simulation is on LOA.</p>
<ol>

<ol>
<li>Any character, position, rank or title possessed by a CO who is actively on an approved LOA or ELOA shall be protected from</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>demotion, removal or reprisal by the TFCO of the Task Force for failure to post or otherwise carry out assigned duties during</p>
<p>the LOA period, except as required by provision 2.7 of this by-law.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Any CO who is granted an ELOA shall be required to maintain verifiable communications with their TGCO, TFCO and their</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>simulation's XO via email, Instant Message, Private Message (IRC or Forums) or forum posting, on at least a bi-weekly basis.</p>
<p>The CO shall also be responsible for ensuring that the Monthly Report for their simulation is filed with the TFCO in a timely</p>
<p>manner. Failure to report under this provision, or to return from the LOA by the agreed return date, may constitute the CO as</p>
<p>being AWOL, and may subject the CO to corrective action by the JAG team.</p>
<ol>
<li>Any member of the BFA, with the exception of the BFCO, who needs to take a short period of time away from their duties for</li>
</ol>
<p>personal reasons, shall be eligible for a Leave of Absence (LOA).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Any BFA Member, with the exception of the BFCO, requesting an LOA, must contact one of their immediate superiors (Division</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>CO or the BFXO) and the BFCO, informing them of the LOA. Such requests are granted automatically for a period of up to 14</p>
<p>days. The LOA notification should include a simple reason for the LOA and the expected return date.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If the period of time needed for the LOA extends beyond 14 days, the BFCO must authorize the leave, and may grant an ELOA</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>to a maximum period of 1 month.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>At no time shall the BFCO grant an ELOA that lasts longer than 1 month. Should a BFA member be faced with such a scenario,</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>the member must make a make a motion to the BFA to extend the ELOA, which shall include the reason for the request. The BFA</p>
<p>may grant up to 2 ELOA extensions, in 2 week increments.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The motion to extend the LOA must be agreed upon by a simple majority (&gt;50%) of the BFA.</li>
<li>Should the motion pass, the member shall be granted an extension to their LOA not to exceed 2 weeks, and shall only be</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>eligible to request a total of 2 such extensions for a maximum of 2 months overall LOA.</p>
<pre>
               + 3.3.c Should the motion fail and the member not be able to immediately return to active duty, or if the 
</pre>
<p>member is unable to return to active duty at the end of an approved extension, the member shall immediately forfeit their</p>
<p>position, and the BFCO shall nominate a replacement to fill the vacancy.</p>
<pre>
         o 3.4 The following forms of relief shall exist to temporarily fill in during the LOA of a member of the BFA:
               + 3.4.a The Task Force Executive Officer (TFXO) shall be required to carry the duties of the Commanding 
</pre>
<p>Officer of the TF during the time that a TFCO is on LOA.</p>
<pre>
               + 3.4.b In the event that a Division CO should take an LOA, the BFXO shall cover the duties of the Division 
</pre>
<p>CO.</p>
<pre>
               + 3.4.c In the event that the BFXO should take an LOA, the most senior Division CO shall cover the duties of 
</pre>
<p>the BFXO.</p>
<pre>
         o 3.5 Any character, position, rank or title possessed by a BFA member who is actively on an approved LOA or ELOA 
</pre>
<p>shall be protected from demotion, removal or reprisal by the BFA for failure to post or otherwise carry out assigned duties</p>
<p>during the LOA period, except as required by provisions 3.3 or 3.6 of this by-law. This protection shall not apply if the</p>
<p>member is a TFCO, and the BFA votes to close the Task Force in which the member is TFCO.</p>
<pre>
         o 3.6 Any BFA member who is granted an ELOA shall be required to maintain verifiable communications with their 
</pre>
<p>immediate superior and the BFCO via email, Instant Message, Private Message (IRC or Forums) or forum posting, on at least a</p>
<p>bi-weekly basis. The member shall also be responsible for ensuring that the Monthly Report for their Task Force or Division</p>
<p>is filed with the BFCO in a timely manner. Failure to maintain such communication, or to return from the LOA by the agreed</p>
<p>return date, may constitute the member as being AWOL, and may be grounds for the BFA to seek relief in the form of</p>
<p>impeachment from office.</p>
<pre>
         o 3.7 Any BFA member who also serves as a simulation CO shall also be bound by the communications rule and other 
</pre>
<p>requirements provided in Section 2 of this by-law.</p>
<pre>
   * 4 Should the BFCO need a short period of time away from their duties for personal reasons, s/he shall be eligible for a 
</pre>
<p>Leave of Absence (LOA).</p>
<pre>
         o 4.1 The BFCO must contact the BFXO and the BFA, informing them of the LOA. Such requests are granted 
</pre>
<p>automatically for a period of up to 14 days, during which the BFCO may opt to keep the power of Executive Authority or grant</p>
<p>it to the BFXO in their stead. The LOA notification should include a simple reason for the LOA and the expected return date.</p>
<pre>
         o 4.2 If the period of time needed for the LOA extends beyond 14 days, the BFCO may grant themself an ELOA to a 
</pre>
<p>maximum period of 2 weeks, however the BFXO shall act with full Executive Authority during the ELOA.</p>
<pre>
         o 4.3 If after 2 weeks, the BFCO continues to need an LOA, s/he shall make a motion with the BFA to extend the 
</pre>
<p>ELOA, which shall include the reason for the request. The BFA may grant the BFCO up to 3 ELOA extensions in 2 week</p>
<p>increments.</p>
<pre>
               + 4.3.a The motion to extend the LOA must be agreed upon by a simple majority (&gt;50%) of the BFA.
               + 4.3.b Should the motion pass, the BFCO shall be granted an extension to their LOA not to exceed 2 weeks, 
</pre>
<p>and shall only be eligible to request a total of 3 such extensions for a maximum of 2 months overall LOA.</p>
<pre>
               + 4.3.c Should the motion fail and the BFCO not be able to immediately return to active duty, or if the BFCO 
</pre>
<p>is unable to return to active duty at the end of such extensions, the BFCO shall immediately forfeit their position, and the</p>
<p>BFXO shall be promoted to fill the vacancy.</p>
<pre>
         o 4.4 If the BFCO is granted an ELOA, s/he shall be required to maintain verifiable communications via email, 
</pre>
<p>Instant Message, Private Message (IRC or Forums) or forum posting, on at least a bi-weekly basis with both the BFXO and the</p>
<p>BFA. Failure to maintain such communication, or to return from the LOA by the agreed return date, may constitute the BFCO as</p>
<p>being AWOL, and may be grounds for the BFA to seek relief in the form of impeachment from office.</p>
<pre>
         o 4.5 Since the BFCO must also serve as a simulation CO, s/he shall also be bound by the communications rule and 
</pre>
<p>other requirements provided in Section 2 of this by-law.</p>
<pre>
   * 5 Unless approved by a 2/3 majority of the BFA on a special motion, no player, BFA member, the BFXO or the BFCO shall 
</pre>
<p>have the right to an ELOA lasting in excess of 2 calender months (8 weeks).</p>
<pre>
         o 5.1 The following exemptions will automatically apply for ELOA extention without need of a vote from the BFA, for 
</pre>
<p>a period of 6 months, which can be extended for an additional 6 months as needed so long as the status of the member does not</p>
<p>change:</p>
<pre>
               + 5.1.a Deployment of a member of the Armed Services.
               + 5.1.b Major medical/surgical procedure and/or long term medical treatment.
         o 5.2 When an automatic ELOA for a simm CO is approved for the reasons in section 5.1, the XO of the simulation 
</pre>
<p>will be contacted to check eligibility and fitness for a temporary command.</p>
<pre>
               + 5.2.a If the XO of the simulation does not currently hold a Commanding Officer position in the Fleet, the 
</pre>
<p>TFCO shall inquire if the XO wishes to take over the simulation.</p>
<pre>
               + 5.4.b If the XO already holds a CO position, chooses not to take over the simulation, or is otherwise found 
</pre>
<p>unfit for Command, the TFCO shall inquire of the crew of the simulation to see if any candidates to assume Command may be</p>
<p>available.</p>
<pre>
               + 5.4.c If no suitable candidates are found on the simulation, the simulation shall be suspended pending the 
</pre>
<p>return of the of the CO on the ELOA, and the players on board shall be offered assistance in finding another simulation on</p>
<p>which to play.</p>
<pre>
   * 6 Any CO, TGCO, TFCO, Division CO, the BFXO or the BFCO who receives an LOA notification or request from a player, CO, 
</pre>
<p>BFA member the BFXO or the BFCO, shall immediately send notification of receipt of the LOA request via the same medium as it</p>
<p>was received on, as well as by email if the original medium was not such. The receipt should include acknowledgement of the</p>
<p>LOA, as well as the understood return date. Failure to send such receipt may hinder the ability to seek relief against the</p>
<p>player for failing to return from E/LOA. It is suggested that the return receipt also be CC'd to the acknowledging party's</p>
<p>immediate superior for the purpose of independent verification.</p>
<pre>
   * 7 Any player, CO, BFA member, the BFXO or the BFCO who wishes to claim unfair removal from their position or demotion 
</pre>
<p>based on an LOA status, must provide the return receipt of confirmation from their superior that the LOA request was actually</p>
<p>received, and that the date the player actually returned was on or prior to the agreed return date.</p>
<pre>
   * 8 In the event that such a claim is raised, unless the original decision was made by a vote of the BFA, the BFA shall 
</pre>
<p>vote to uphold or to reverse the decision that was made. The vote to reverse any decisions made shall require 2/3 majority of</p>
<p>the BFA. If 2/3 majority cannot be established, or if the original decision was a result of a vote of the BFA, the decision</p>
<p>shall be determined as upheld.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>VAdm Clawson will serve in this capacity as described by the Constitution for a period of no more than 90 days, unless removed by the BFCO, installed permanently by the BFCO or the person acting in the BFCO's stead, or by a vote of the BFA.</p>
<p>VAdm Clawson will be allowed to pick assistants as she deems necessary, and I will give her access to the hoh@bravofleet.org email address immediately.</p>
<p>So Ordered this 6th day of October 2006,</p>
<p>Admiral Marcus Shepherd<br />
Acting Fleet Commanding Officer<br />
Bravo Fleet</p>
<p><i>This Executive Order will expire 90 days from its inception, unless adopted as a permanent change by the BFA.</i></p>
