In fact New York city has intelligence agreements with several countries and posts its Police officers to gather intelligence in many countries with the cooperation of intelligence agencies of many countries.

<p>Hi Deepak</p>
<p>Some people still respect him on all 3 sides of the Borders of J&amp;K, he may someday help people to come together and reach some understanding, atleast he can do some good on his own, he has a historical connection to this disputed land and its people, we can atleast provide a link to people for an important chapter in the history of J&amp;K and a very important personality of the state.</p>
<p>Thats all, I was just thinking the best for the people of J&amp;K, I am not here to fight with you, please rethink and revert</p>

<dd>Well I know that Mr. Karan Singh has a great personality and is a good man but you have to understand the rules of Wikipedia. Adding a link to Karan Singh defeats the very purpose of the See also section and would result in a decline of Wikipedia's overall credibility.

<p>I have also copyed this discussion with you in the <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jammu_and_Kashmir_d1bc.html" title="Jammu and Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a> as well as Dr <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karan_Singh_667a.html" title="Karan Singh">Karan Singh</a>'s discussion page, just for the record that Dr <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karan_Singh_667a.html" title="Karan Singh">Karan Singh</a> article was discussed, as it is a legitimate discussion.</p>
<p>If you get time later please help in developing Dr <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karan_Singh_667a.html" title="Karan Singh">Karan Singh</a>'s article on Wikipedia too.</p>

<dd>Of course I am obsessed with the article on J&amp;K. As a matter of fact, a good chunk of that article is written by me (including the History section). And before calling me inconsiderate, look at yourself! Have you analyzed my arguments above in a logical way? You say: "<i>Some people still respect him on all 3 sides of the Borders of J&amp;K, he may someday help people to come together and reach some understanding, atleast he can do some good on his own, he has a historical connection to this disputed land and its people, we can atleast provide a link to people for an important chapter in the history of J&amp;K and a very important personality of the state.</i>" Hello! This is an encyclopedia. Not a propaganda website. Anyways, I find this discussion a waste of time and unintellectual. So I won't take part in it anymore as I have better things to do. --<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepak_gupta_071e.html" title="User:Deepak gupta">Incman</a>|<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeepak_gupta_f27b.html" title="User talk:Deepak gupta">वार्ता</a> 20:31, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>"The Kashmir puzzle"</b></p>
<p><b>THE HINDU</b></p>
<p><b>Online edition of India's National Newspaper</b></p>
<p><b>Thursday, Dec 14, 2006</b></p>
<p><b>Opinion - Letters to the Editor</b></p>
<p><br />
This refers to the editorial "Clues to Kashmir peace puzzle" (Dec. 13). Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam's statement that her country has never claimed Kashmir as an integral part of its territory is a pleasant surprise. She has buttressed her assertion, saying Pakistan-held Kashmir has its own president and prime minister. It is clear that there is a paradigm shift in Pakistan's stand on Kashmir. If it indeed has no territorial design in Kashmir, it should leave the issue to the Kashmiris and stop fighting on their behalf. K.V. Seetharamaiah, Hassan</p>
<p><br />
Ms. Aslam's remarks vindicate New Delhi's stand that Kashmir is an integral part of India. One feels that the latest statements by President Pervez Musharraf and his Government are effective catalysts for a change. K.S. Thampi, Chennai</p>
<p><br />
By stating openly that it has never claimed Kashmir as its integral part, Pakistan has only reiterated the legal position. The Indian Independence Act 1947 gave the princely states the right to choose between India and Pakistan. Jammu and Kashmir became an irrevocable part of India once Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession to India. It is an open secret that Pakistan's relations with India have been closely linked to its fixation on Kashmir. When all is said and done, Pakistan's latest statement is welcome, as it is likely to take the neighbours closer to solving the peace puzzle. A. Paramesham, New Delhi</p>
<p><br />
A week ago, Gen. Musharraf said Pakistan was willing to give up its claim to Kashmir if India accepted his "four-point solution." Why should he offer to give up the claim over something his country never claimed in the first place, using a non-existent thing to negotiate? "Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practise to deceive!" (Sir Walter Scott, Marmion) S.P. Sundaram, Chennai</p>

<p><br />
Now that Gen. Musharraf has clarified Pakistan's stand on Kashmir, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should seize the opportunity to settle the issue once and for all. The BJP should not be a stumbling block to the negotiations. M.N. Srinivasan, Vellore</p>
<p><br />
Statements emanating from Pakistan are intended to pressure India in two ways. While they will invoke the wrath of those who favour self-rule for Kashmir, India will be forced to negotiate the Kashmir issue more seriously on bilateral and multilateral forums. The Government should respond with a strong message. Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi, Dhenkanal, Orissa</p>
<p><br />
Pakistan's latest statement is superficial and bears no significance. It should not be seen as a shift in its Kashmir policy. It is an attempt to mislead the world until the tide turns in Gen. Musharraf's favour. With India set to sign a nuclear deal with the U.S., Pakistan wants to gain some ground and win credibility in American circles. Had Gen. Musharraf really believed that the people of Kashmir should decide their fate, he would have ended cross-border terror by now. Shashikant Singh, Roorkee</p>
