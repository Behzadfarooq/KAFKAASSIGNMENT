ONE TALENTED TEEN: Amy Bruckner</p>
<p>By Traci J. Grant</p>
<p>Exclusive to TheStarScoop.Com <a href="http://www.thestarscoop.com/amy-bruckner.php" class="external free" title="http://www.thestarscoop.com/amy-bruckner.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestarscoop.com/amy-bruckner.php</a></p>
<p>Call her cute, call her funny, but don't call her Pim Diffy. Amy Bruckner, also known for her role in American Dragon: Jake Long as Haley is nothing like Pim, who she says, "Is maniacal. She can be evil."</p>
<p>At the youthful age of 14, Amy has worked in an array of acting endeavors, from a TV series, to a cartoon to a feature film. "[American Dragon is] a lot more hands on for me. They're definitely instructing you more about what they want you to do. But it's a lot less stress than doing a live show. It's just kind of manipulating your voice. Phil takes a lot more physical. I play different characters but they have a lot of similarities. They're both super smart, and they don't like their older brothers." As the intelligent, straight-A student was quick to point out, while she works with mostly adults, Phil of the Future is a kid's show. "I spend the most time [on camera] with the guy who plays Mr. Hackett as well as the caveman. He's a brilliant comedian; he's such a great guy. I was a lot on the show with Kay Panabaker, but she's on Summerland now so she can't do our show. Aly [Michalka] and I bond together because we're the only two girls on the show...offset I probably spend a lot of time with Ricky [Ullman]."</p>
<p>With a role in the upcoming Martin Lawrence film Rebound and three recently aired Malcolm in the Middle episodes many are wondering if her recent success is the result of her role in Disney's Phil of the Future. "It helps. It definitely helps build your fan base, and that seems like what they're interested in. It has really helped me grow as an actor. It has helped me a lot, as an actor."</p>
<p>While her bubbly voice screams self-confidence, it's surprising to discover that Amy Bruckner doesn't like to watch herself on TV. "I like to critique myself, but if I've already seen an episode of Phil of the Future and it's on Disney, I won't watch it again." However, she'll certainly be watching her new movie, Rebound. The long process Amy went through to acquire the role will finally pay off when it hits theaters in June. "I went to the callback, they said, 'you did a great job.' Two months later they called and said, 'We really like you..."</p>
<p>What did she expect from her first feature film? "It was a lot more different than I expected. There's so much more money in features than in TV and time is money." Don't expect Pim Diffy to be showing up on the big screen, because, says Amy on her character in Rebound, "I'm very different from Pim. I'm very sweet, a little boy crazy. There's Martin, there's the team... [I'm one of] the school reporters and I'm kind of [the] sidekick. I would explain my part as kind of tying the movie together."</p>
<p>Amy's current show, Phil of the Future, kicks into its second season and with its cast members hoping it's picked up for a third. Is her work as Pim becoming more routine or more difficult because of the increased complexity of her character? Says Amy, "That's a good question. It's gone from - in the pilot, I didn't have any say. I was pretty new. First season we were all kind of finding our feet, learning to walk on our character's legs. All our characters have found their niche, that's easier for me to act - someone who's real."</p>
<p>Speaking of real, Amy Bruckner couldn't be more down to earth. On herself she said, "I'm, oh goodness. I care about the people that I love. I'll trust you, but I'm really hard to get your trust back...I'm very random with my humor...I love animals..." She loves them so much that her choice to do anything for a day would be, "probably spending a day with exotic animals that have been orphaned, being able to nurse them. That's a good cause. I'd love to be able to do that."</p>
<p>Something else she'd love would be "to meet Nicole Kidman just to know how she does all those accents." Other favorites, Amy? "I really look up to Megan Mullally, simply because she has amazing comedic timing."</p>
<p>So where did the evident zeal for acting come from? "I'd have to credit my second grade teacher. She really inspired me to be one with my creativity. You get to be someone you're not, and that's freeing."</p>
<p>The future looks bright for this young star. "I'd love to do something that shows I can be versatile in my acting. More movies, with a lot of depth. I love being on Disney, but I don't want to be Pim Diffy forever."</p>
<p>Favorite animal: dogs Future official website address: www.amybruckner.com or www.amybruckner.net Quote: "I'm a straight A student. I'm very proud of that."</p>
