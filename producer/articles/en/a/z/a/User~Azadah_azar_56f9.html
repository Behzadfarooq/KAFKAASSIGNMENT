	    <p><b>William Shakespeare - His life and his works</b></p>
<p>William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon on the twenty thirst of April in 1564. He passed away Stratford-upon-Avon in 1616.</p>
<p>He was an English poet, player and playwright of the age of the Renaissance-drama’s, whose theatre-works enclose 7 historic drama’s (about the English kings), 12 tragedies, 5 romantic drama’s and 10 comedies.</p>
<p>Elizabeth the first was the queen when Shakespeare born. On the twenty sixth of April Shakespeare was baptized in the parish church. He was the first son of a well-to-do shopkeeper in the little town Stratford-upon-Avon and Mary Arden, who came out a family of landowners. William had 7 brothers and sisters, of whom 3 died on young age.</p>
<p>Shakespeare went till his fourteenth age to the grammar school. On this academy he has become acquainted with stories of Ovidius, comedies of Plautus and probably tragedies of Seneca.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare hasn’t attend a higher education, but he probably worked in his fathers business.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare’s father was for short time the mayor of Stratford in 1568 and invited professional actors to perform in the Guild Hall. There’s no mistaking that his love for theatre is come into being here.</p>
<p>In 1576 has James Burbage built the first fixed theatre: “The theatre”.</p>
<p>In 1582 William Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway, the daughter of a local farmer.</p>
<p>In 1583 was their daughter Susanna born.</p>
<p>In 1585 were the twins Hamnet and Judith born. The two daughters shall in the future marry with two men from Stratford but Williams sun will die at the age of 11.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare leaves Stratford to set up as an actor/author in London. He also leaved his wife and his three children.</p>
<p>Shakespeare became actor at several company’s. London grew very fast in that time to 200.000 inhabitants. There were many theatre company’s. They played every midday, at least if there are no plagues in the city, and if it was government said it was all right. A piece was repeated several weeks before there came another piece. But the visitors always want something new to see. While the play of a piece a player has to practise for the following piece. Any theatre company plays about fifthteen to twenty different plays a year.</p>
<p>The Globe: this is a theatre where Shakespeare was working and also shareholder.</p>
<p>Something what is clear is that Shakespeare’s first pieces had subjects from the English history. This is without a doubt partly to blame to the fact that he was a passionate patriot, but he was also a very clever businessman. He putted that the theatre visitors loved his historically pieces and it is clear that he wanted to pull profit from this sort of drama.</p>
<p>1589 “Hendrik VI” - part 1 (historydrama) 1590 “Hendrik VI” - part 2 (historydrama) 1590 “Hendrik VI” - part 3 (historydrama) 1590 “Farce of the mistakes” (comedy)</p>
<p>In London theaters are closed as a consequence of a dominating pest epidemic.</p>
<p>1592 “Richard III” (historydrama)</p>
<p>After the historically drama’s he especially writes comedies and romantic love story’s about young people who are in love and at the and of the piece they marry.</p>
<p>1593 ”Titus Andronicus” (tragedy) 1593 “The whined feeks” (comedy) 1593 - 'Venus and Adonis'.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare knows the taste of his public and he writes a playful and erotic poem about a ravishing beauty on basis of a known mythological data: Venus who tries to entice Adonis, but notices how these the wild boar hunt chooses above her avances; its end is then inevitable, on which she the solitude seeks on Paphos. In the choice of its subject, Shakespeare follows the custom of its time: the repeating of episodes from the classic antiquity, out often the Metamorphosen of ovidius.</p>
<p>When he had published with his own works, created that unexpected competition among the London “grub-street hacks” the necessary trouble. The people blamed him that he both acted and wrote. The other authors had all attend a higher education and William Shakespeare is an author who comes from the actors-practice who knew how terrible it was when people get bored while the performance (Probably threw the spectators hard objects to the actors). So he took care that serious texts alternate with passages in the work where the public can laugh about.</p>
<p>Publication of the poem “The Rape of Lucrese”.</p>
<p>In London were the theatres, that were closed because of the bubonic plaque for two years, opened again. Shakespeare became a member of “The Lord Chamberlain’s Men”, a group actors.</p>

<p>At the end of the sixteenth century disappears the luck feeling and Shakespeare's to pieces become melancholic, embittered and tragic. This change becomes causes also the death of Shakespeare's only son Hamnet Shakespeare in 1596.</p>
<p>Shakespeare moves to the southern bank of the Thames, where its company the theater The Swan plays on. Just outside the jurisdiction of the puritanical cities government, this cities part becomes around the turn of the century an unique theater center.</p>
<p>Shakespeare was not the only author whose works were very serious in that period. England wrong in a crisis. The on hands behave queen Elisabeth became a day parent and the old men were sad by the thought that she fast would die. They had also fear because of the fact that the queen married never and that about it thus no descendant was her on to follow.</p>
