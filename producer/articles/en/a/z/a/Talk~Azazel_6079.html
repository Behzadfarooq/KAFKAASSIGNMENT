<p>I don't know how to comment without editing someone else's comment.</p>
<p>Look, I heard one person say that this is also being confused with Azarel from the Batman comic.</p>
<p>I don't mean to be one of the faithful... but what are your sources? This is complete allegory compared to the KING James Auth. Version. It doesn't use Azazel as a proper or active noun, instead it speaks directly of the Scape-Goat. You can't claim to have better personal or educational wisdom than the translators of the KJV nor the editions leading up to that. If it was interesting myth worthy of association, it would be in the "Shakespeare Team" version. Shakespeare was able to rewrite the great tragedies because he researched and found a gold mine. He found myth and applied modern truth. If there was value here, it would be the KJV.</p>
<p>I can over turn this proganda based on Enoch not being canon for a reason from great minds. Look if you are going to use the Bible, understand the story and seek out the truth. If you weight the facts that Azazel is the scape-coat in line with considering that 'Azazel' means 'strength of the lord'... you'll find the complete story of god's love for man according to the traditional canon. God's strength is to save or forgive. You can forgive the Man and save the Goat at the same time. You might call it a demon, if you don't consider something natural. God saves the goat and forgives the man for making it a slave. At least the goat is grateful to god for the world we live in.</p>
<p>Blah-gaia-blah-goddess-blah... I write fiction too.</p>
<p>You should remove the bible verses if you can't find a reason not to include Jesus as the scape-goat. That's the story the bible tells... goat, lamb, strength of freedom, aryan promise to Abraham, pyramids, sahara desert... this entire entry in subjective and the bible connection with Leviticus should be limited due to the editorial liberties. Does the Volgate include Enoch and use Azazel in Leviticus? Sacrifice the subjective associations to Western Civilization's God and stop using it as your scapegoat and strength. Hail Satan! I am his prosecutor of fools! <small>(The above was written by FinLives (<a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinLives_9bbc.html" title="User talk:FinLives">Talk</a>)</small></p>

<p>I took the liberty of rewriting the "Azazel in Leviticus" section to make it more accurate by reporting that we <i>don't</i> in fact know what Azazel's identity was. It could have been a person, place, or thing; the text <i>just doesn't say</i>. Later mythology, like the Book of Enoch, created a whole literary tradition out of Azazel, and I am not qualified to write about that. However, there are some things that I have corrected:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Leviticus text, though comparatively late compared to the rest of the Pentateuch, is much earlier than the Book of Enoch and the subsequent literary tradition about Azazel. I replaced the Leviticus section above the other sections to reflect this and show more clearly where the tradition grew out of.</li>
<li>The scapegoat designated "for Azazel" was not called "Azazel"—Azazel is clearly something else. Why would the scapegoat and the place (or demon, or whatever) it was destined for have the same name?</li>
<li>The word "Azazel" does not mean "the goat of removal". The derivation is unclear at best, possibly incorporating <i>-el</i> ("God", often used as a suffix in Hebrew to mean "of God"). The idea that the <i>az</i> part means "goat" is dubious because of the spelling in Hebrew; the <i>az</i> is not reduplicated (the actual spelling is ayin-zayin-aleph-zayin-aleph-lamed), so this leaves a part of the word unaccounted for.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Interesting. I didn't know about that. Avestan is, however, an Indo-Iranian language, whereas Hebrew is Semitic, and these families aren't related. It is possible it's some kind of loanword, but the absence of other loanwords from Iranian languages as early as the Book of Leviticus is fairly telling in my opinion. On the other hand, it would be interesting to note this. Maybe I'll add a section about possible etymologies, and consolidate all the information we have come up with so far. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakaristos_ca2a.html" title="User:Makaristos">Makaristos</a> 15:37, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>no, come on, <i>azhi</i> is completely unrelated. If anything, compare Avestan <i>*aza</i> (Sanskrit <i>aja</i>) "goat"!

<dd>or maybe, since the spelling is <i>'z'z'l</i>, <i>'wz</i> "to mock"?

<dd><a href="../../../a/z/a/Azazel.html" title="Azazel">Azazel</a> is not etymologically related to the <i>Azhi</i> element (which is from <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-European_b6da.html" title="Proto-Indo-European">PIE</a> <i>*angwhi-</i>, 'snake') in Azhi Dahaka.

<p>I was at Yom Kippur services this year and could not help but notice that there is absolutely nothing to suggest that Azazel is evil. He is simply whatever it is that takes the goat that bears the sins of the people. There is no other reference to him anywhere in the Torah, I spent weeks looking for it while I was at shul. I'm a little confused as to the demonizing of Azazel both by the Talmudic scholars and the media. I just thought that that should be mentioned. Oh, and El does not mean "of God." It's meaning is one of the mysteries of the Torah, but it proceeds the names of most of the important biblical figures. Very good information you've got there, and I have a deep respect for your skills in etymology.gust 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm going to list some Semitic demonic figures here with similar names (by the way, Decius used to study demonology but he's rusty at it now) and where they occur.</p>
<ul>
<li>Auza---Alternate form of <i>Azza</i> (see below).</li>
<li>Aza---Alternate form of <i>Azza</i> (see below).</li>
<li>Azza---Mentioned in Rabbinic lore, Solomonic lore. In the Talmud, Azza and Azael are said to have fathered the <i>Sedim</i> upon Naamah, before the Flood.</li>
<li>Azael---"In <i>Midrash Petirat Mosheh</i>, <i>Azael</i> is mentioned as one of two angels (the other being <i>Ouza</i>) who came down from heaven and was corrupted."---Gustav Davidson, <i>A Dictionary of Angels including the Fallen Angels</i>.</li>
<li>Azazel</li>
<li>Aziel</li>
<li>Azzael</li>
<li>Azzazel</li>
<li>Oza</li>
<li>Ouza</li>
<li>Uzza</li>
</ul>
<p>All these forms are <i>Shem</i> ('name') compounded to Aza (Yaza, Iaza, etc.):</p>
<ul>
<li>Semiaza</li>
<li>Semjaza</li>
<li>Semyaza</li>
<li>Shemhazai</li>
<li>Shem-Yaza</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
---There's too much stuff to quote from my references now, but Davidson regularly states that Uzza (in these sources depicted as male not female) and Aza were interchangeable in the literature, so they may have the same etymology. It's pretty clear from this list (they are almost all interchangeable and may refer to the same or similar figure) that it is useless to just isolate Azazel and examine the etymology on its own. ---Decius 19:33, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>well, I cannot rule out that popular etymologies between Azazel and Uzza, Azazel and serpents etc. were at play, but we have to clearly separate this from the actual <i>etymology</i>. Azazel appears in <i>Exodus</i>, in a goat-connection. Even if you think that Exodus was written in the sixth century, it is highly unlikely that Azazel is a hybrid Persian-Hebrew compound. Connection with Uzza is also impossible (where is the `ayin?). But sure, demonology is basically free association, I agree that such parallels have almost certainly been drawn before. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:19, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I made clear above that I don't connect the Leviticus <i>Azazel</i> to PIE <i>*angwhi-</i>, 'snake' (from which comes Persian <i>azhi</i>). But I doubt that Semitic Azza and Azael have a different etymology from the duplicated Azazel. I maintain that one should be aware of the forms Azael, Azza, etc., when considering the etymology of Azazel. None of those forms I listed above are Persian, they are all from a Semitic source. It may be popular etymology (as I indicated when I said <i>may</i> have the same etymology) that developed a progression from <i>Auza</i>, <i>Ouza</i>, <i>Azza</i>, <i>Uzza</i>, but I haven't seen evidence that they are definitely not sharing the same etymology. The phonetics involved make Uzza and Azza unlikely, but I see nothing preventing Azazel and Azza (unduplicated) from being connected. Azael in my reference is said to be a compound of strength (aza) and god (el); Semyaza means "He who is named Aza (strength)". <i>Azza</i> on its own is said to mean 'strong', etc. So it's not just Azazel on his own here. ---Decius 08:36, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I dropped in on you guys (Makristos and Dab) discussing the etymology of <i>Azazel</i>, and noticed no mention of Azael (Semitic), Azza (Semitic), Aza (Semitic), Azzael (Semitic), and all the other forms known, that may have the same <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">etymology</a>. I admit I threw in <a href="../../../a/z/h/Azhi_Dahaka_0801.html" title="Azhi Dahaka">Azhi Dahaka</a> because I felt like "fucking around" with you guys while at the same pointing to a mythological parallel. ---Master Killer 09:26, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Removed the following material to talk:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Traditionally the word "Azazel" has been translated as "scapegoat" because the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masoretic.html" title="Masoretic">Masoretic</a> texts read <i>‘ēz’ōzēl</i> (rather than <i>‘ăzā’zēl</i>), "goat which removes [sins]". However, more recent findings of older Hebrew texts (see <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_scrolls_8d81.html" title="Dead Sea scrolls">Dead Sea scrolls</a>) read <i>‘ăzā’zēl</i> and <i>‘ăzaz’ēl</i>, "Azazel". The confusion of the word is due to the Hebrew <a href="../../../n/i/q/Niqqud.html" title="Niqqud">niqqudoth</a>, vowels represented separately from consonants (<i>‘ăzā’zēl</i> and <i>‘ēz’ōzēl</i> share the consonantal base <i>‘z’zl</i>).<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The "scapegoat" referred to in many translations of Leviticus (here translated as Azazel) most likely does not refer to either of the two goats mentioned in the chapter ("the goat for a scapegoat" is often changed to "the goat as a scapegoat"), but more probably refers to someone or something (see cliff theory below) that is a scapegoat — therefore, possibly a demon Azazel.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The first goat (for Yahweh) was to be used as a sacrifice, while "the goat chosen by lot for Azazel must be presented alive before Yahweh to be used for making atonement by sending it into the desert for Azazel" (Lev. 16:10, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">niv</span>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is not to say that the goat being sent to "Azazel" is a sacrifice to the demon (if Azazel is, indeed, a demon) — the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> itself explicitly says not to worship anyone but Yahweh (Exodus 20:3-6). The goat (instead of the Israelites) is being sent to be forsaken by God, a point made clearer in Leviticus 16:21-22, when Aaron was to "lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites — all their sins — and put them on the goat's head." He would then "send the goat away into the desert in the care of a man appointed for the task." The goat would "carry on itself all their sins to a solitary place; and the man must release it in the desert" (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">niv</span>). Leviticus also says that "the man who releases the goat for Azazel must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may come into the camp" (16:26, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">niv</span>)</dd>

<p>THis material clearly does not come from either the Hebrew Bible or Rabbinic literature as claimed. Wikipedia should not misrepresent or misattribute the contents of the Hebrew Bible or Rabbinic literature. If some of this material is commentary from one or more contemporary sources, these sources must be attributed. Unattributed claims that a particular interpretation is "most probable" or similar are particularly problematic, as they violate <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a>. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 12:53, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good that you removed those parts, I thought they were a bit problematic. I think the last part of the section <i><a href="../../../a/z/a/Azazel.html#In_First_Enoch" title="Azazel">In First Enoch</a></i> actually takes care of the confusion there. It seems the person who wrote it finds the article in confliction with their inherent dogma. -- <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowren_587a.html" title="User:Kerowren">Kerowren</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../k/e/r/User_talk%7EKerowren_3718.html" title="User talk:Kerowren">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kerowren_5622.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kerowren">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <span class="plainlinks" style="color:#002bb8"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=Kerowren&amp;site=en.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=Kerowren&amp;site=en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">count</a></span>) 17:13, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect much of this is likely perfectly legitimate material from modern commentators, and the difficulty is most likely attribution and sourcing. Perhaps sources will surface and this material can be put in an appropriate section. It's fine to present e.g. <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Pelosi_1644.html" title="Nancy Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>'s opinion of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bush_24e4.html" title="George Bush">George Bush</a>, but there's a problem if someone tries to present it unsourced in a section entitled "In George Bush's writings". --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 23:06, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why is William Tyndale's translation of "scapegoat" definitely incorrect? It seems like it could be true to me. 68.239.71.45 18:43, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
