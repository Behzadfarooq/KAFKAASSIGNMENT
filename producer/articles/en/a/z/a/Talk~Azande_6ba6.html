<p>The last two changes to the article by two anonymous editors are very strange, and I can't make up my mind if it's vandalism, someone being very confused, or I'm simply wrong. These changes include changing the statement that the plural of Azande is Bazande (a statement that appears in many web pages!) into a statement that the singular is Zande and the plural is Azande. Another change explains their whichcraft beliefs (source???), and another change talks about a tribe with a tail (?!). I'm itching to just revert all these bizarre changes, but I'm waiting for other people's comments, or some time to do some more research myself. <a href="../../../n/y/h/User%7ENyh_7d57.html" title="User:Nyh">Nyh</a> 10:50, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Except for the last change (the tribe with tails) these all appear to be from E.E. Evans-Pritchard's "Men Bewitch Others When They Hate Them" in <i>Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Amond the Azande</i> Oxford: Clarendon Press 1968, pages 107-117. 131.247.37.100 00:17, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Nyh,</p>
<p>I agree with the revert, but it would be nice to include some of the new information as HISTORY. Evans-Pritchard originally wrote that book in the 30s. I said it down below, but I'll say it again: We need to use up-to-date information; otherwise, we'll perpetuate stereotypes and what is now misinformation.</p>
<p>By the way, in Pazande, the plural of Zande is Azande; in Lingala/Bangala (the regional language the Azande speak in the DRC), the plural is Bazande.</p>
<p>Also, I think the reference to Niam-Niam is pass√©. I never heard of the term until I read this article. No Zande ever told me "Don't confuse us with the Niam-Niam." Maybe it was pertinent in Evans-Pritchard's day, but not now. <a href="../../../d/b/l/User%7EDblomgren_c6e4.html" title="User:Dblomgren">Dblomgren</a> 04:17, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Like the "The Name" section (that I wrote) explains, the name "Niam-Niam" is indeed "passe" - it was common in the 19th century, but isn't used today. Should we mention it? I think the answer is yes; In fact, the reason I started contributing to this page at all was that I read a book by <a href="../../../j/u/l/Jules_Verne_fa88.html" title="Jules Verne">Jules Verne</a> which mentioned the tribe "Niam Niam", and didn't know it was a real or fictitious tribe, and wanted to learn more about it. As you can see in the "external links" section, Jules Verne was not the only person using the name "Niam Niam" - in the early 20th century the Encyclopedia Britannica had an article with that name. So I do think it is worth mentioning this archaic name. <a href="../../../n/y/h/User%7ENyh_7d57.html" title="User:Nyh">Nyh</a> 13:09, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>I decided to be bold and revert to the December 8th version. I've copied the text from the December 12th version and will insert it where appropriate. User:129.81.146.18 apparently noted their sources by writing "s-1" etc., which I assume refers to the sources listed at the bottom of their text. My only worry is that User 129 wrote may have taken the text verbatim from the sources and I'll be plagiarizing. Therefore, I'll probably reword the text and note the source. If there are any comments, questions, or snide remarks&#160;:), you know how to reach me. --<a href="../../../d/b/l/User%7EDblomgren_c6e4.html" title="User:Dblomgren">Dblomgren</a> 02:08, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I've gone through the text posted on December 12th and find that what I thought were source notes do not correspond to the sources cited. For example, source 8 was <a href="http://www.gurtong.org/resourcecenter/people/profile_tribe.asp?TribeID=29" class="external free" title="http://www.gurtong.org/resourcecenter/people/profile_tribe.asp?TribeID=29" rel="nofollow">http://www.gurtong.org/resourcecenter/people/profile_tribe.asp?TribeID=29</a> but the text supposedly based on this was not on that webpage. Neither that webpage nor the other webpage cited, <a href="http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/EthnoAtlas/Hmar/Cult_dir/Culture.7829" class="external free" title="http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/EthnoAtlas/Hmar/Cult_dir/Culture.7829" rel="nofollow">http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/EthnoAtlas/Hmar/Cult_dir/Culture.7829</a>, give sources for their information, so I'm not going to include info found on those sites.</p>
<p>The other seven sources cited by User:129.81.146.18 are books that I don't have access to, so I'm not going to cite them either.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm going to try to start a research project on the Azande by Azande so we can get some up-to-date information. --<a href="../../../d/b/l/User%7EDblomgren_c6e4.html" title="User:Dblomgren">Dblomgren</a> 21:12, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Niam-Niam" id="Niam-Niam"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/z/a/Talk%7EAzande_6ba6.html" title="Edit section: Niam-Niam">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Niam-Niam</span></h2>
<p>Someone added to the end of the paragraph explaining the old name Niam-Niam, a sentence saying:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>The Niam-Niam (or Nyam-Nyam) a subgroup of the Azande multi-ethnic group.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>This sentence outright contradicts the paragraph before it, so the two cannot stay together! I'm removing this sentence because I cannot find a reference for it. Can someone find a reference? <i>Which</i> subgroup does the name "Niam-Niam" refer to? Is this only the case today, or was the Niam-Niam as used by Encyclopedia Britannica, by <a href="../../../j/u/l/Jules_Verne_fa88.html" title="Jules Verne">Jules Verne</a> (see <a href="http://jv.gilead.org.il/pg/cinq/19.html" class="external free" title="http://jv.gilead.org.il/pg/cinq/19.html" rel="nofollow">http://jv.gilead.org.il/pg/cinq/19.html</a>), and by other contemporaries also referring only to a subgroup? Does this subgroup agree to its naming "Niam Niam", or is it still a pejorative term?</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/y/h/User%7ENyh_7d57.html" title="User:Nyh">Nyh</a> 10:26, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I'm starting to answer myself. I'll start with sources supporting the above line. In in <a href="http://anthromuseum.missouri.edu/online/africaonline/cultures.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://anthromuseum.missouri.edu/online/africaonline/cultures.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> the following paragraph can be found:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Niam Niam (Nyam Nyam) A subgroup of the Azande, a multi-ethnic group known for warrior qualities who live in northern Democratic Republic of Congo. They are an agricultural group that raises maize, yams, manioc, nuts, and bananas. They grow cotton, tobacco, and jute as cash crops.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In <a href="http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/EthnoAtlas/Hmar/Cult_dir/Culture.7829" class="external autonumber" title="http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/EthnoAtlas/Hmar/Cult_dir/Culture.7829" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, the following paragraph appears:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Azande, as they exist today, are an agglomeration of indigenous and invading Sudanic peoples, whose different origins, languages, and cultures over a period of two centuries have become homogenized into a more or less common social pattern. This process has taken place through the military and political domination of the Ambomu conquerors under the leadership of the ruling sib, the Avungara. The name "Azande" is spelled with many variations, such as Asande, Assandeh, Asandeh, Badjande, Bazende, Basingi, Sande, and Sandeh. In common usage, "Azande" is used when referring to an individual, or simply as an adjective. Sometimes the name of a section is used to signify the whole group, as in Abandiya, Adio, Avungara, Makaraka, and Niam-Niam (also called Gnam-Gnam, Dem-Dem, Jem-Jem, and Lem-Lem).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The first problem with these sources is that they don't really answer any of my question (is this more-specific designation 'niam-niam' something new, whereas the equation of niam-niam with Azande something from the late 19th century? Is the name 'niam-niam' no longer pejorative?)</p>
<p>Moreover, other sources say something else. Encyclopedia Britannica says that "Azande" is another name for the Niam-Niam. <a href="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575584/Azande.html" class="external text" title="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575584/Azande.html" rel="nofollow">MSN Encarta</a> says the same: <i>Azande, also known as the Nyam-Nyam</i>, not that Nyam-Nyam is only a subgroup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.basenji.org/african/tudor885.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.basenji.org/african/tudor885.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> appears to be an interesting letter from 1945 about names of dog breeds. It says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>... these names are ridiculous and should be altered while there is yet time. Nyam-Nyam was the old slavers' name for Azande and allied races. It was probably coined from the Dinka name "Nimyam" which is onomatopoeic, meaning cannibal. As a name it is locally considered insulting and has died out.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, this doesn't agree with Niam-Niam being a modern name for part of the Azande.</p>
<p>Another page <a href="http://members.tripod.com/aalsafi/tm/profession/merits.htm#_ednref43" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.tripod.com/aalsafi/tm/profession/merits.htm#_ednref43" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> says this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahr_el_Ghazal_a997.html" title="Bahr el Ghazal">Bahr el Ghazal</a> Handbook says that the name is probably of onomatopoeic origin and was originally applied to the unknown conglomeration of people whose cannibal propensities were a matter of common report. It now seems to have become the general name in the Sudan for the Azande, though it is not used by the Officials in the South of the Province, who have to differentiate between many different tribes all of whom are described further north as Nyam-Nyam. This name, being as I have said completely meaningless, might be discarded.‚Äù Major R. G. C. Brock. Some Notes on the Azande Tribe as Found in the Meridi District (Bahr El Ghazal Province). Sudan Notes and Records. 1918; 1: 249-262.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The last two quotes imply that the name Niam-Niam was once used for the Azande <i>and more</i>, rather than for just a part of the Azande! It also imples that "Niam Niam" is an archaic name which should not be used today.</p>

<p>Quote from article: "Because witchcraft is believed to always be present, there are several rituals connected to protection and cancelling of witchcraft that are performed almost daily." I put the "citation needed" remark because I lived with Azande for two years and never saw these almost-daily rituals. I only saw one ritual and that was at a funeral (washing your hands after shaking hands with family of the deceased). I suspect this information is from some outdated anthropological source. I think we need to use up-to-date information; otherwise, we'll perpetuate stereotypes. <a href="../../../d/b/l/User%7EDblomgren_c6e4.html" title="User:Dblomgren">Dblomgren</a> 05:10, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
