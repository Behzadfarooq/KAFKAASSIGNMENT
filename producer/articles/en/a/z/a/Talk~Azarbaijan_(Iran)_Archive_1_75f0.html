<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Southern Azerbaijan Argument</span></h2>
<p>None of you guys are making valid arguments. The number of searches on Google or the belief that most people refer to the region by Southern Azerbaijan are not valid, relevant or even correct facts regarding your argument.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/l/y/User%7EKlymen_c80c.html" title="User:Klymen">Klymen</a> 02:27, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Things that can be confirmed</span></h2>
<p>FWIW, I have a couple of rather old atlases and can confirm that the term "Azerbaijan" in the early twentieth century referred to a region in modern-day Iran, south of the Aras; these sources corroborate the 1911 EB.</p>
<p>The region later known as the Azerbaijani SSR and more recently the Republic of Azerbaijan was at that time part of what was called Transcaucasia, which was under Russian control.</p>
<p>Maury's New Complete Geography (1906)<br />
depicts this in the map facing page 136, and in the text on 149 says this: "Transcaucasia, formerly Georgia, lies on the south side of the Caucasus Mountains... The people... belong to the Tatar (tah'tar) race... Tiflis is the capital and chief city. The region about Baku is famous for its wells of petroleum..." This clearly includes what is now the Republic of Azerbaijan, as well as what is now Georgia, and probably also Armenia; the border between Transcaucasia and Persia on the map appears to be very close to the same shape as the northern border of Iran in my late-cold-war-era 6th ed. National Geographic Atlas of the World, and in the same position relative to Tabriz.</p>
<p>Additionally, the New Ecclectic Series Complete Geography (1896) shows Caucasia, a region belonging to Russia, in the same location as Maury's shows Transcaucasia. This atlas however does not have sufficient detail of Persia to show the region then known as Azerbaijan; for that we have to go with what Maury's and the Britannica tell us, in the absense of another source from that era.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not have an atlas from the 1920s, which would be very useful for resolving at least one point of dispute. I do however have a dictionary with maps from the early fourties (which shows Poland dividing East Prussia from the rest of Germany), and this shows Azerbaijan as part of the USSR, east of Armenia, in roughly the present location of the Republic of Azerbaijan (though borders between the SSRs are not drawn in on this map), showing the state of affairs between WWI and WWII. This is from Webster's Complete Reference Dictionary and Encyclopedia, The Publisher's Guild, NY, The World Publishing Company, 1944.</p>
<p>If someone has maps, or, better, a detailed atlas, from the 1920s, that would help to nail down _when_ the term 'Azerbaijan' began to refer to the region north of the Aras. Why may be harder to establish, but let's start with what should be straightforward and go from there.</p>
<p>And please stop calling people Persian Chauvenists and Pan-Turkists; it helps nothing.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonadab_d568.html" title="User:Jonadab">Jonadab the Unsightly One</a></p>
<p>The fact is as my learned friend above has mentioned Southern/Iranian Azerbaijan should simply be Azerbaijan based on historical grounds. Azerbaijan SSR was a soviet contruct and it has no more right to refer to Azerbaijan as South Azerbaijan than people in New England have a right to refer to England as East England or Novo Scotian to Scotland as East Scotland. I think the argument here are rather silly. The implication is that the twenty million or so Azerbaijanis in Iran who are pillars of a strong country and central to the great Iranian culture should accept the suzerainty of four million people living in a small, weak and rather undistinguished country whose history does not extend beyonf twenty years. It should be the reverse. Those people in the caucauses who identify themselves as Azerbaijanis should join the mainstream of their cultural identity and enter the brotherhood of the Iranian nations. As the heirs to the Median culture, Azerbaijanis are one of the principle groups of the Aryans and the racist comments made about them by random contributors shows an ignorance when distinguishing language and culture.</p>

<p>As seen from above, "Iranian Azerbaijan" and "Southern Azerbaijan" are the most commonly used names for the area.

<p>Try with <b>"Azerbaijan-Iran"</b> in google. You find <b>18,300</b> results with this one. I think, it is some more dann 4240 by "Southen Aterbaijan" ....

<dd>please, do not disrupt Wikipedia and follow naming conventions as well as Wikipedia norms of behavior. "Azerbaijan-Iran" is simply the combination of two words, names of countries, whereas 'Iranian Azerbaijan' and 'Southern Azerbaijan' are actually the most widely used references used for most of the northwestern part of Iran. I ask other editors to intervene if necessary because, I have absolutely no desire to engage in a new senseless and artificial dispute here. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabib_5b29.html" title="User:Tabib">Tabib</a> 15:11, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no such thing as "South Azerbaijan". This term is extremely offensive to all Persian people as it is only used by a very small group of terrorist seperatists. The only land to have ever been named Azerbaijan is the current Iranian province. When Russia took the Caucauses from Iran in 1813, the Russians decided to name the 3 previous Persian provinces "azerbaijan" in hopes of further expantion into Iranian territory. Please remove this article as it is innaccurate and the content is false.</p>

<p>the fact is iran became a country since 80 years ago, before that iran was a country with 4 main lands, and states in them, well persian theory is old which genetic refuses being azeris as even indo-europeans</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Population and name of "Iranian Azerbaijan"</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The population of Iranian Azerbaijan is less than 8 million. The area is only some 7% of the total territory of Iran and consists of less than 10% of the Iranian population. So, the REAL population number should be something arround 6 or 7 millions, NOT 28 millions. That's totally wrong!

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The name "South Azerbaijan" is politically motivated, has no historical basis, and is usually used by Turkish nationalists and fanatics. As you can see in the following map: <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~bvon/images/map3.gif" class="external text" title="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~bvon/images/map3.gif" rel="nofollow">Abbasid Caliphate</a>, the nation "Azerbaijan" has never been a part of the region known as "Azerbaijan". There is no such thing as "North or South Azerbaijan".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Interesting argument, using this map. According to this map and many other documents, there was never ever a real country or state called Iran till the Safavids coming to power. Iran and Turan were mythical lands in Shahnameh.</li>

<dd>Sorry, but calling it South Azerbaijan wouldn't be neutral. Iranian Azerbaijan is simply a geographical name, while South Azerbaijan is political. By calling it that you would imply that the region should break apart from Iran and become part of Azerbaijan, that's why the term is used by separatists. --<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> 02:55, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Southern Azerbaijan results also contains google hits which includes the South of the republic of Azerbaijan, this coppeled with Azeris websites as well as unrelated sites which contains the text ' Azerbaijan' in the same phrase and the term 'Southern.'</p>
<p>Also, Azerbaijan in the form it has been presented is a VERY RECENT term, the second paragraph was simply wrong, call it what was called at that time, but it was not spelled 'Azerbaijan.' <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:56, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An also called is used for a notable term, not what some group of people refers too. Maybe we should edit the Holocaust and also add the term Holohoax, because some neonazi who denies the Holocaust call it such? The term Southern Azerbaijan has a place in the article, but is simply not an 'also called.' What would happen if I added 'Western Armenia' as an also-called for the entry about Anatolia? The term Western Armenia is much more used and not only by Armenians, even included in history books after the Republic of Turkey was founded.</dd>

<dd>BTW, the second paragraph in its form is simply wrong, there was no spelled 'Azerbaijan'... try finding any history book of that period claiming what it is claimed there.

Virtually all the Azeri independence movements in Iran refer to it as "South/Southern Azerbaijan".

It is not only Azeri nationalists who use that name, it is quite popular with people around the world. According to the naming conventions, the article should be titled South Azerbaijan.

South Azerbaijan is also the South of the republic of Azerbaijan, or the term South could be in the same paragraph as the term Azerbaijan but yet those are included in googles hit. And you very well know it but still use that as evidence. A peoples claim over a land can not be an also called in an encyclopedic article. We all have seen all the conflicts that has generated over Kurdistan articles, but it might be OK for Kurdistan, because there is no country by that name, there is no need for desumbiguation. But the Republic of Azerbaijan DO EXIST! And South Azerbaijan for the VERY LARGE MAJORITY in this planet Earth IS the south of the republic of Azerbaijan. If you live in the US, go ask anyone in the street about what is the South of Azerbaijan.

<dd>No, read the policies again, you present a supposed encyclopedic article from an encyclopedia which has a history of letting a concerned party to write the text, and that it uses the term Azerbaijan even when reffering to the Uratian period clearly shows that the authors article is far from being encyclopedic. Britannica 1911, present Azerbaijan as a land of 32,000 sq. km insteed of the current republics 86,600 sq km, it doesn' talk of anything else about any South, West, East. The republic of Azerbaijan exist, and there are no historc words of that period claiming what you claim, Britannica being one example, Britannicas reported Azerbaijan is even smaller than the current republic of Azerbaijan. South of a republic, is South of a republic. You can't impose a term which is not notable in the English world, and this is English Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:10, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Grandmaster, MOST of the hits on google have NOTHING to do with what you claim. Go on to the few hundreds hits later and see what you find. The term is not only not notable beyond Azerbaijani separatists, but also it doesn't concord with name conventions, there is an entire page covering misleading names and such things are not encouraged in Wikipedia. By requesting this you are simply showing your hypocrasy. You requested the removal of the term enclave for Karabakh, which was used widely including by the CIA factsheet and the very large majority of newspaper articles, records, documents etc. And now, you want the inclusion of a term which is only notable in Azeri publication. Your double standard is only affecting your credibility here Grandmaster. Why should I not also include in Karabakh entry 'also called the republic of Nagorno Karabakh'&#160;? Would you accept that? Afteral it is notable among Armenians. The fact is, that South Azerbaijan for the very large majority of people is the South of the republic of Azerbaijan, that you like it or not. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:24, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How do you know what most of the hits on google refer to? Did you check them all? The term is not notable just in Azeri publications. I showed you that Columbia encyclopedia uses the term <i>northern part of Azerbaijan</i> with regard to the territory of Azerbaijan republic, I showed you that Russian version of radio liberty uses the term South Azerbaijan. And Karabakh has nothing to do with this. In fact, the article about NK says that it is called by Armenians the republic of Nagorno-Karabakh and it has no international recognition. I don’t know what happened to you and you suddenly started showing so much interest in this issue and claiming that South Azerbaijan is South of Republic Azerbaijan for most people without giving a single proof. How do you know what the term means for most people? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 19:37, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For hell sake, you don't even try to comprehend anything. The Columbia Encyclopedia also use the term Azerbaijan for the period of Urartu. It has a history of letting people that have interest to push their POV writting those articles, but unlike Universalis they aren't even honest enough to provide the author of their articles. AND YES!!! I DID GO ON PAGES BY PAGES ON THE HITS ON GOOGLE, GO ON AFTER THE FIRST HUNDREDS OF HITS AND SEE HOW MANY DO YOU FIND THAT ARE EVEN RELATED TO THAT? Look here Grandmaster, I have no interest to continue on that, from all the discussions we had you had no inclination to stop for a while TO try understandING what others are saying. The naming convention in Wikipedia is a guideline, and I DO NOT MAKE THE RULES, this is what is written ON ITS FIRST LINE. <i>Convention: Use the most common name of a person or thing <b>that does not conflict with the names of other people or things.</b> The principal exception is in the case of naming royalty and people with titles. For details of the naming conventions in those cases, see the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles) page.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28common_names%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28common_names%29" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> I have told you to read the policy in various occasions and this didn't changed a single thing, you will go on with what you have in your mind and have since now not a single time tried understanding what others are trying to make you understand. And I repeat, if you want to use your own standards at least don't impose it to be used in one direction. You were the one going on fighting to get the term enclave deleted from the entry on Karabakh while the majority of sources call it that, but here you try to impose an independantist movements name and you even make use of dishonest tactics as to claim it has some notability beyond those nationalist circles. I repeat this for the last time. SOUTH AZERBAIJAN REFERS TO THE SOUTH OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN FOR THE VERY, VERY, VERY LARGE MAJORITY OF PEOPLES. ACCORDING TO THE GUILDLINES ON NAMING CONVENTIONS THIS TERM SHOULD BE EXCLUDED, BECAUSE IT CONFLICTS AND IS MISLEADING. I never said that this term has no place in the article, BUT IT IS NOT, NOT AN ALSO KNOWN. CLAIMING IT IS ALSO CALLED OR ALSO KNOWN IS SIMPLY POV PUSHING. Now write whatever you want, I do not want to waste my time repeating myself all over again. I will not take part in a revert war, introduce your POV for all I care. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 20:23, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Cool. Again, not a single proof that South Azerbaijan refers to South of Republic of Azerbaijan for most or many people. And I actually don’t find it to be correct that <i>the name of South Azerbaijan is used primarily by Azerbaijani nationalists</i>. In fact, it is the only term used in the Republic of Azerbaijan, the term Iranian Azerbaijan is not commonly used. It does not mean that people of independent Azerbaijan lay claims on Iranian Azerbaijan, it is just a name that’s always been used there. According to the current version of the article, all people of independent Azerbaijan are Azerbaijani nationalists. To me it does not sound right. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 05:40, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But I know that adding Western Armenian to Anatolia is not a good thing to do, because it is misleading and against the guidline. The guidline specifically covers the uses of words that are misleaing in their nature. That the independence movement is more important now, doesn't change the fact that for nearly all non-Azeris people, South Azerbaijan means the South of the republic of Azerbaijan. I do not make the rules, that this was there before before an anonymous user deleted it doesn't change the fact that this term is not an also known, because the very large majority of people don't know that place as South Azerbijan, and that as if that was not enough that term is in contradiction with the guidlines because Azerbaijan is a republic and its South is it's South. That term has a place in that article, by saying something such 'Azeris often refer to that locality as 'South' or 'Southern' Azerbaijan, but to say that it is an also known is simply wrong, it simply conflict with another existing place, which is the South of the republic. Also, that term was not there first, it was introduced there by Tabib, who also requested the term 'Khojali genocide' as an also called in the lead of the article in Khojali massacre, and he claimed that just because Azeris claim so or that it yields result on google it should stay. The term 'holohoax' yield more result than South Azerbaijan, according to those standards the Holocaust entry should also contain something to the effect 'holohoax.' We have guidlines for a reason, and it is for the quality of the articles, if every national group was to write things the way they would want, Wikipedia will just fall apart.

That every significant databases from internet(which contains reputable journals like those in oxford databases) doesn't even yeild any result IS enough to not present something as an also known. As for the library of congress, read it a second time, more particularly the part about Armenia. The Treaty's concencerned territories had little to do with what Azeris nationalist call Southern and Northern Azerbaijan. Also the library of congress does have documentations contradicting even this text which doesn't yet support you. Maybe you should take a look at their articles on Armenia and Karabakh too, using it I can creat an article about far East Armenia and say it is also know as the republic of Azerbaijan.</dd>

<dd>I apply no double standard as you do, if I have double standards just provide one example, you have deleted Karabakh Enclave, which gives much much more results, and even if it is included in various reputable very notable publications..., you did it according to your original research about the definition of enclave to justify the deletion of a word that is used in the most notable sources, and now you want to include a word that has no any notability beyond Azeri nationalist circles. Go read how entries about Kurdistan mains have been sliced neutralised beyond needed, even if there is no country of the name Kurdistan which would lead people to believe that such geographic characterisations are part of Kurdistan.</dd>

<dd>Obviously you are pushing your POV, and I doubt that any neutral users would deny it. When Azeris claim something it becomes notable enought, when somethings notability is not limited to nationalist cicles when it doesn't satisfy you it has no place in Wikipedia. This is called POV pushing and you are a POV pusher. Now, call me POV pusher for all I care, but that you refuse to adhere to the guidline is an indication of who is the POV pusher. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:56, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well sorry, be tired, you should have known I don't like POV pushers. I have few things to do now, but when I have free time next week, I should maybe re-add the term enclave and creat an article about far Eastern Armenia and call it also known as the republic of Azerbaijan. Afteral, the library of congress support it. Oh yeh, I should also maybe add for the Anatolia article, 'Western Armenia' because afteral it gives millions of links on google, or add idiotic terms like 'Holohoax' in the Holocaust article. You are contributing for months yet still doesn't comprehend the basics. So again, be tired. As for community opinion, there is no question that you won't obtain the support needed if I place a RfC, the problem here is that by suggesting this you even think that the community might support such an obviously against the guideline act. Kurdistan articles had a clear opposition for much less than that. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 20:19, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>BS, there are various examples of other cases, starting with articles related to Kurdistan in which even Kurds had to admit and accept for less than what you POV push. Grandmaster, I am warning you to stop calling me a POV pusher unless you provide the example of POV pushing, repeating what I have been accusing you of doesn't give credence to your claim. One has to read what you accept and revert to on the History of Azerbaijan to see who the POV pusher is. Had such cases been in Armenian articles, I would have been the first to edit them. For others, you might visit the history of Azerbaijan and read what I have added in the talk page, and while I said I would not read the rest, I did. The fact is that there is probably no encyclopedic article relating to Azerbaijan that could be found here thanks to POV pusher like Grandmaster who don't understand that this site is not theirs but conform to guidlines and policies and that if they don't want to adhere to those guidlines(example name convention Grandmaster doesn't want to conform with), they should find elsewhere. Such POV pusher with their double standard have no credibility to impose guidelines. As for RfC, I will Grandmaster, not for the article, but on you next week.

And no, I haven't read every crap(as we are now, I guess with all the POV pushing you've been doing, I can from this day on consider those crap) you've been introducing. I just got interested in the article History of Azerbaijan, and the first paragraphs were already tainted by the sort of crap you've been spewing. As for your question, for now I have better things to do than chassing again some dishonnest POV pushers that still can't comprehend that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not there to present what they believe as truth but positions. Also it amuses me that you have requested comment for name conventions after you have been adviced to read those guidlines. Assuming good faith has limits and this limit has been crossed. I make concessions and debate trying to come to solutions and I, as a Wikipedian, and not your opponment(I doubt you are understanding the differences) will not tolerate such behaviors which are harming Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 20:02, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Azari people are genetically Iranians, NOT turks!</span></h2>
<p>Pan-turanists (turks) are trying to deny Azari people their Persian heritage. Turks from Turkey are making up false claims and lies about Azari people. It really annoys me when people try to say that Azaribaijan is not Persian. Here are the facts:</p>
<p>Azarbaijan is a Persian word meaning land of fire, (reffering to the the ancient Iranian religion of Zoroaster).</p>
<p>Azarbaijan was a province of Iran and settled by Iranians thousands of years before the turks ever left mongolia and outer china.</p>
<p>Azari people are racially, ethnically Iranian. They are caucasoids of the Iranian branch. Not central asian ural-altaic turks...Simply, they look like Persians not mongolians..or people from central asia.</p>
<p>Azari culture is Persian. They celebrate ancient Iranian holidays like now rooz, char shambeh suri, etc...Their cuisine is Persian, their traditional costumes are Iranian...(original turks were a nomadic horse breeding people and had no similiarites culturally to the present day "turks" of azerbaijan or turkey. Azeri music is definatly Persian, (instruments, etc...)</p>
<p>More than 40% of the Azari langauge is Farsi (Persian).</p>
<p>Most "Azari" names are actually Persian.</p>
<p>The only land to have ever been named Azerbaijan is the current Iranian province, The fake republic of Azerbaijan was actually 3 different Iranian provences when Russia invaded and seperated them from Iran.</p>
<p>Throughout History Azerbaijan was always under Iranian rule, (the northern part of the territory was taken from Iran by the USSR in 1813 -turkmenbachi &amp; golestan treatys) Dariush4444 03:32, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You seem to be confused here...in 1813, the ONLY place to have been named Azerbaijan was the current Iranian provance.

You have yet to justify the notability of this term. While Northern Kurdistan is more notable and actually found in notable publications unlike your Souther Azerbaijan, the article was redirected and it has even no such mention as 'also known as Northern Kurdistan.'

<dd>Here's the thing, that's not actually using the specific phrase "South (or Southern) Azerbaijan" ("south" being capitalized). I mean, it's an issue of semantics - there are different implications to saying "southern Azerbaijan" and "Southern Azerbaijan" or say, "southern part of Azerbaijan." Geographically speaking (and totally ignoring political and territorial realities) there is nothing wrong with saying "southern Azerbaijan." But of course the situation is intensely political because of the obvious existence of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the other half having remained a part of Iran. From a modern point of view, "southern Azerbaijan" is therefore irredentist, just as with "northern Azerbaijan." Because the Republic of Azerbaijan exists and has been separated from Iran for quite awhile now, there is no longer any "north" or "south." We have the Azerbaijan Republic, and we have the Azarbaijan of Iran. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 06:00, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was actually surprised to notice that the term of Southern Azerbaijan is perceived by some Persian people as irredentist, while in Azerbaijan it’s just a geographic term. For some reason that has been the only term used here.

The guidline is clear, a name that conflict with anothers is not to be used. Pratically speaking, Azerbaijan is a republic, and its South is its South. And I don't have to prove this as you requested. South Canada is the South of Canada, South Syria is the South of Syria. I am repeating myself like a parrot, but you still show no inclination at all.

<dd>So you are trying to say that the words “southern section of Azerbaijan” are about the south of the republic of Azerbaijan? I showed you that the words <i>south</i> or <i>southern Azerbaijan</i> or <i>southern part or section of Azerbaijan</i> are used as a reference to the region by sources other than ethnic Azerbaijani. The exact wording may not always match, but nonetheless it is sometimes being referred to as southern part of Azerbaijan. There’s absolutely no need to politicize this issue, as some people do. You previous comment is absolutely irrelevant. The term maybe wrong and has no historical justification, but it is still used by authoritative sources and is therefore notable. And you repeat yourself just because you have personal beef with me over Azeri-Armenian disputes and you follow me to every page I contribute to desperately trying to find some fault with me. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 06:14, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

It is also true that before the treaty the term Azerbaijan was applied to Iranian Azerbaijan, while the north was Arran so South Azerbaijan is something of a newer term, although it is undeniable that the people on both sides of the border speak the Azeri language and are related etc. At any rate, this is just pointless semantics and I think SouthernComfort's compromise edit is fine as it mentions that the term is also used, but is not common and is politically charged etc. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 22:39, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Comment</span></h3>
<p>There seems to be some ambiguity about what the "proper" spelling, a misnomer, of the region and polities are. Some Wikipedians have commented that <i>Az<b>e</b>rbaijan</i> should be used. In fact, there are <i>numerous</i> spellings in English: Azerbaijan (common), Azarbaijan, Azerbajdan, Azerbaydzhan ... Just because one prevails, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">that does not mean it is appropriate in this instance</a>. Importantly, the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_Iran_b61e.html" title="Provinces of Iran">provinces of Iran</a> (in Wp and elsewhere, like the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>) are commonly rendered as <i>Az<b>a</b>rbaijan</i> ... and little has been presented to forego or demonstrate why the Iranian region (co-terminous with the provinces) simply rendered should differ.

<dd>The Iranian pronounciation of it is Az<b>a</b>rbaijan so that should be fine? We can take a vote if needed for that but shouldn't be necessary.

<dd>Despite all of the above, IMO, little above justifies why we should not render the region similarly to the provinces (with -a-).

<dd>I, and others, already have cited reasons and sources ... not solely depending on one interpretation. Az<i>a</i>rbaijan <i>is</i> English, so invoking that it isn't rings false.

There may be an argument that this was consensus, in our sense; it is certainly not unanimity. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 20:43, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wp is dynamic and votes have been made for and against since. On the face of it, "near unanimous support (provisionally)" was an apt assessment and based on a binary read of the votes (and therefore <i>not</i> an "abuse of language", which is arguably even more problematic), which the RM Admin will do. I've no difficulty settling for references to mere consensus ... as that is all that Wp requires.

<li>I accept E Pluribus's retraction; but it would have been preferable to read the discussion while counting the votes. Three supports for <i>Azarbaijan</i>, four (now seven) for <i>Azerbaijan</i>, and four not discussing the matter do not make consensus - they may excuse an erroneous claim of consensus. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 03:04, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Move to Azerbaijan</span></h3>
<p>Since the above comments make a clear majority for the prevalent English name Azerbaijan, this page should be moved there. Other comments in the above section should be counted, and are clearly intended to express opinion on this issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>The accuracy and validity of this comment and reopening is challenged. First, a <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a> scant days ago supported the recent move to <i><b>Azarbaijan (Iran)</b></i>. In addition, the reopening is based on the somewhat faulty premise that the current title is not English, which various sources contradict. Moreover, as all things are not equal, the tally below is somewhat misleading: it glazes over users who actually supported moves to <b>x</b> <i><b>Azerbaijan</b></i> not <b><i>Az</i>x<i>rbaijan (Iran)</i></b> (e.g., including anon and another, suggesting <i><b>South(ern) Azerbaijan</b></i> or <i>status quo</i> <i><b>Iranian Azerbaijan</b></i>), thereby indicating (if anything) near-parity ... which is yet insufficient to forego prior consensus.

<p>Using a different letter would make sense only if these were unrelated words that just happened to be spelled alike. This is not the case, origin of the word is the same no matter you spell it Azarbaijan or Azerbaijan. While I understand the political motivations in trying to differentiate it as much as possible, but those political aims can not be the reason for us here in Wikipedia to decide about such matters. The voting process was hastened and the matter is going to be opened again. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimBits_9563.html" title="User:TimBits">TimBits</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 21:09, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The final vote was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>9 unqualified for the move that was done.</li>
<li>2 expressed preference for a move to "Azerbaijan (Iran)", but were willing to support the move that was done.</li>
<li>7 opposed the move, all expressing a preference for "Azerbaijan" over "Azarbaijan."</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the vote to move to Az*rbaijan (Iran) was 11 to 7. This is not a consensus under any definition, but take the result as given. The problem is that the spelling preference was dead-even. For anyone to claim that the vote reflects a consensus over spelling would be silly. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 22:04, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

This was affirmed by the RM Admin with the move. Even using alternate vote counts/interpretations (11 vs. 7, etc.), consensus was achieved. Lastly, the (proposed) move was <i>clearly</i> to the -a- spelling, <i>not</i> -e-, so those who supported the former with proviso still did so. So, who's being 'silly'?

<dd>Hey, I know that it is not about you and me.&#160;:) Take it easy. As for the argument, my argument is that artificially differentiating these two words by only one letter is not correct in this situation. That letter can be transliterated form the Arabic script in a number of ways, and in the case it is mostly by <b>e</b>. But even if we accept the <b>a</b> version then the name of the Azerbaijan Republic should be changed in order to agree with this. Otherwise, this move will be nothing but an attempt to artifically differentiate between two, rather than having the correct spelling. Az<b>e</b>rbaijan and Az<b>a</b>rbaijan are not two different words with different origins. Azerbaijan Republic refers to the areas north if the Iranian Azerbaijan. Untill any argument proves it otherwise, this very well obviates the recent move. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimBits_9563.html" title="User:TimBits">TimBits</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 18:13, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You keep repeating yourself buddy. OK, then let's say intentional instead of artificial. I know you can find other meanings to anything said, but nitpicking aside I know that the context was understood. What I am saying has not been discussed at all. And it is questioning the need to deliberately differentiate between the words of the same origin by a letter instead of a qualifier in a bracket. This argument standing, the merit for the recent move will be questionable. And as I have made it known before, I will not accept this 'suck it ap and let's move on' attitude. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimBits_9563.html" title="User:TimBits">TimBits</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 18:41, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>The term south azerbaijan is mainly used by azeri nationalists as can be seen in CAMOH's home page and those of other separatist groups. Even if Encyclopedia Iranica uses the term, it does not change the fact that this term is loaded. The neutral term is Iranian azerbaijan since the area is a province of Iran. This must be clear to any reader of the article. So Grandmaster, please stop your endless reverting of the text. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.238.23.206 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.238.23.206_43e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.238.23.206">contribs</a>) 22:37, 5 May 2006.</small></p>

<dd>The term South Azerbaijan is used by various sources, not just CAMOH. Iranian Azerbaijan could be more correct and appropriate, but it does not change the fact that South Azerbaijan is also sometimes used by reputable sources. For the same token you can claim that the term Aryans is politically loaded, because it was used by Nazis. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 11:39, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>South Azerbaijan (Iran) is a more descriptive title for this article. The fact that a term has been also used by this or that group is irrelevant, and point less to argue over it. The agenda behind changing the titles ot this article are very much politically driven. I understand the concern of our pan-farsist friends, as they feel threatened by any term or name that shows the relation between Azeri the inhabitants of the north and south of Araz river. The push for the change of the article from Iranian Azerbaijan to Azarbaijan (Iran) follows the same trend. To me it shows the desperation of few out of touch people to hold into old grandpa stories. It is a sad case of not understanding that it is not the Wikipedia that makes the facts, but other way around. Denying the fact that there is a strong bond between Azerbaijanis in the south and north not only would not solve any problem it is just a case of heads being in sand. Wikipedia should be reflecting the facts on the ground not on some small minority who can influence this free encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/e/h/User%7EMehrdadd_0feb.html" title="User:Mehrdadd">Mehrdad</a> 04:29, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I had never heard of it and It is quite hilarious! In any case, the whole argument is just funny. The Azarbaijan in Iran, is <b>part of Iran</b>, nevermind the ethnicity of the people.

<li>Dear Kash, Pan Fars-farsist/panfarsist is a term to defines those who promote and would like to impose control of Farsi people over the rest of the Iranian population. In effect they are the grandchildren of Pan-Iranists and they carry the same ideology of supremacy of Arian race etc, but due to crumbling state of <i>pure race</i> theories of last century, these ones are too shy to shout as loud as the grandpas.

But we shouldn't be renaming territories of another country. If other people like to call it southern azarbaijan, that's fine, but i don't think it should be mentioned in the article at all, let alone along with it's official name. so this to me is a compromise, to include a disputed name in the article and title it as such. i believe it's less confusing this way, and gives people a better perspective. and note that nothing was removed from the article, it still says the same thing, just shuffled around. i'm curous to what others think, so please be patient as we haven't tried this yet.

<dd>The thing is that there’s no formal naming dispute. There’s no dispute at all, except here. The name of South Azerbaijan is also used in academic sources, so therefore it’s notable enough to be mentioned. I don’t think that sources like Iranica pursued any political agenda by using it. So mentioning that this name is also sometimes used would be helpful, because some people may encounter it in some source and think “Where is that?” <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 04:18, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no specific rule about that. However, when the first paragraphs of the articles in the two major encyclopedias are quite similar and the first paragraph of this article is very different from them, it's a good indication of a strong POV and the necessity of its modification.<a href="../../../b/i/d/User%7EBidabadi_cdd5.html" title="User:Bidabadi">Bidabadi</a> 08:09, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page does have a host of problems as even the spelling veers from the common English language usage of Azerbaijan as opposed to the native Azarbaijan used in Iran. Simply listing alternative names shouldn't raise automatic alarm bells. Most of the time, I've read Azerbaijan and then the Republic of Azerbaijan, while I've also read Iranian Azarbaijan and South Azarbaijan when used in discussion regarding the Turkmenchai treaty etc. A more encyclopedic rendition would be to avoid narrative and just list the alternative names (with links that denote their usages) and stop catering to any one side. Thus, nothing about South Azerbaijan is also used and is seen as nationalistic etc. Just list it and leave it as is. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 21:12, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>first off, i just checked the <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Azerbaijan (disambiguation)">Azerbaijan_(disambiguation)</a> page, and it was missing both the provinces of zanjan and ardabil. now, those two provinces are a part of iranian azarbaijan, yet are not "turkic" language provinces. the term southern azerbaijan, which is incorrect to begin with, refers only to the two east and west provinces of azarbaijan in iran. therefore including it in the title is completely false. not to mention parts of gilan which are also considered a part of iranian azarbaijan and are completely non-turkic, and not a part of this so-called southern azarbaijan. people drop your opinions because this title needs to change. iranian azarbaijan does not equal the area falsly considered area of "southern azarbaijan".

<dd>Rugsnotbombs , for your information both Ardabil and Zanjan are both historical part of South Azerbaijan, and both are populated by the Azerbaijanis. The administrative division of Azerbaijan region to four ostan has nothing to do with the ethnicity of these divisions being different. Most of Gilan has never been considered to be part of Azerbaijan, the only Azeri city in Gilan is Astara. I fail to understand why people are jumping into the discussions that do not know much about it? Right now as I write these words , there is a wide action demonstration and protest activity going through out the Soutern Azerbaijan cities of Urmia, Tabriz as well as Ardabil and Zanjan, in reaction to a belittling article agains Turks. <a href="../../../m/e/h/User%7EMehrdadd_0feb.html" title="User:Mehrdadd">Mehrdad</a> 16:35, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By real, unbiased news you apparently mean the information from the state-run IRNA agency. To me it’s pretty much the same as the Soviet <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telegraph_Agency_of_the_Soviet_Union_19c7.html" title="Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union">TASS</a> agency, which was not trusted even by Soviet people. I prefer info from third-party sources. I could not read the source that was in Arabic script, as for IRNA report, it was about the newspaper employees protesting the closure and blaming the “mistake” on “one of the daily's journalists”. But it does not change the fact that this cartoon controversy led to serious unrest in Iranian Azerbaijan. And what “Soviets” have to do with it, it’s Iran’s internal problems. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 17:02, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I figured you would miss the point. By real i meant, it wasn't ethnic tension and blown out of proportion like your links suggested and when you read the newspaper's statement, it shows that it wasn't meant to cause a divide as your links also suggest. And yes, <a href="../../../i/r/n/IRNA_4d4f.html" title="IRNA">IRNA</a> is state run, just like the <a href="../../../c/b/c/CBC_d905.html" title="CBC">CBC</a>, and <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> and the hundreds of other state run news agencies, not some unofficial news agency like the ones you cited. I guess you would prefer "privately" funded <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediaset.html" title="Mediaset">Mediaset</a> right? As for the soviets in Iran, you should look up and read Aliyev's apology speech regarding soviets that entered iran in a failed effort to cause a divide, funny enough, it was azari's who captured, turned them in, and executed them.

<dd>Well that's why you have to take all these articles with a grain of salt. There were Soviet Azarbaijani's who snuck into Iran a few years ago and started to spread propoganda against the gov't of Iran in hopes of getting the Azari's to seperate from Iran. The plan failed, they were arrested, charged with espionage and executed. Aliyev apologized about it and it went away, and now i'm sure they're trying again. Because what happened in Iran was the equivalent of those people who protest infront of Kmarts and Wallmarts, just a handful of people trying to make something out of nothing. I'm just clearing up the info in the articles you gave and taking the bias out, because most people don't understand the situation in Iran, even those who report on it.
