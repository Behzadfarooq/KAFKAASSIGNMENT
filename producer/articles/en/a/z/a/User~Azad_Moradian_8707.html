<p>It’s fascinating to look back and realize how much of my present and future is and will be shaped by my past experiences, and how much of my perception is either expanded or limited by those events. It’s quite interesting to realize how much my understanding of myself and the world, and how much my goals and ambitions are formed through the bases of my existence. These are my mother’s womb, my unidentified homeland, my belittled ethnicity, all the places I was raised and taught, and those most gripping moments, which have defined who I am today and who I wish to become. My history and background, my triumphs and tragedies, my accomplishments and losses, and the never quite realized endless checklist of hopes and dreams have painted the vivid picture that I envision to be my future. What I have chosen to study, and that to which I have chosen to devote my life is a direct result of the journey, which has brought me where I am today. Knowing myself as a Kurd; one out of the thirty-five million people who have no place to call home, no rights to speak their sweet mother tongue, no chance to celebrate their rich culture and heritage, these have indeed played a big part in how I have lived my life and in how I want to continue to live. Too often I was not given choice, about the nature of the life I would live. For one never chooses a life in which one is punished and abused for merely existing. However, today I do have a choice. So I choose to dedicate my life to the development of the understanding of human existence. Growing up in an extended family system with multiple siblings and grandparents, speaking one language at home, and being forced to study in another at school, being raised in an era of struggle and war, put down by others for the mere fact that I am a Kurd, and becoming affected by political movements and revolution, I came to see much of the complexity of the world. Not much fairness is practiced in the chaotic atmosphere of a third world country, especially in the case of people who have no rights of their own. I grew up in an environment, with little resources for advancement, and thus was among a growing population of enthusiastic youth, who were fighting for reform and change. Throughout my childhood a distinct goal became rooted in me that has since only grown. That goal is to help my fellow people and to have a positive impact on their lives; to somehow lessen the heavy burden that they must carry. From my early years I came to realize that there was much need for the care of the human mind. For I saw how fragile human sanity could be. I witnessed how easily a strong, grown man can be emotionally and mentally paralyzed by the loss of a child, and how dysfunctional a bombarded society can become. In a land where the fundamental needs of a human being are not met, where filling an empty stomach is a struggle, not much thought is given to mental health. Although it was often apparent that the essence of a crippled community was its inability to cope and overcome grief, not much thought was given to the need for psychological assistance. Perhaps the awareness of such a need was one of the major reasons why I chose to study Psychology. My own motivation to overcome the continuous traumas and losses of my early adulthood gave me a better understanding of how I could make a difference in my people’s lives. I joined the political movement at a very young age and this involvement in politics took me through a series of life altering events and painful experiences. The essence behind the political movement was to fight towards human rights and equality, which fed my desire to help others. The psychological damage that imprisonment, prosecution, torture and the domination fear had on the development of my family and friends were undeniable. The changes each individual went through within the process of injustice and how much help they needed to be able to stand on their feet once again, never escaped me. I was able to fully commit myself to my goal in 1989 when I applied for Clinical Psychology in undergraduate school in Iran. Within the process of my education in Clinical Psychology I realized that what excites me most is the investigation, dissection and understanding of the issues surrounding my people. As I took courses in Developmental Psychology, Psychopathology, Personality Theory and Personality Disorders, I found myself more and more stimulated to think and explore my world. I had the chance to be educated by some of the best Psychology professors in Iran, which certainly played a part in my advancement. I received practice in Clinical Diagnostic methods and Pediatric Clinical Psychology at Rozbeh psychiatric hospital, the best psychiatric hospital in Iran, and this opportunity gave me a well-rounded training in the areas of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy. I received research training while working at the Institute of Iranian Veteran Study, and writing honors thesis and subsequent poster presentation about psychological problems among college student in 1993. My work with Dr. Ahadi and Dr. Shamlo PhD, currently director of Iranian Psychology Association, helped me develop my observational skills and learn to classify and define abstract descriptors into concrete variables. During the years of 1993- 1996, while studying to receive my masters in Clinical Psychology, I also worked in the field as a Psychologist Assistant and Family Counselor under supervision.</p>

At the end of 1996, the complication of the political atmosphere in Iran forced us to flee from my country in order to ensure our safety. During my two-year stay in Azerbaijan as a refugee, I worked with an international refugee organization for a year, researching the diversity of culture in the former Soviet Union. Being a refugee gave me an inside view of the lives of refugee families and the impact of trauma on their mentality. This experience directed my attention towards Political Psychology. 
My family and I received political asylum in Denmark and lived there from December 1997 to July 2000. During these three years along with learning Danish language and History, I worked as a Counselor with immigrant and refugee families, Assistant School Counselor, and Coordinator of the Immigrant/Refugee Program through the Danish Refugee Council. My work experience in Denmark was able to improve and expand my knowledge of various cultures, and focused my studies on the psychological aspects of diverse cultures. 
</pre>
<p>My family and I immigrated to the United States in the year 2000 and within the following year I began work at the Institute for Applied Behavior Analysis (IABA), a well-known international agency with 24 years of experience that provides living support, behavior integration and behavioral modification services for individuals with mental and developmental disability. As a Case Coordinator and Senior Staff I have had the opportunity to work directly with clients suffering from many forms of developmental and mental disabilities. I was selected to participate in educational and professional courses through IABA Educational Committee to improve my job knowledge; the following are a few of those courses: 1.Psychological Assessment by Dr. Gary W. Lavigna, PhD and Dr. Thomas J. Willis, PhD, 2.Augmentative Communication &amp; Visual Support Strategies for Communications &amp; problem Behavior By Pat Miranda, PhD, University of British Columbia 3.Challenging Behavior: Emergency Management conference by Dr. LaVigna PhD and Dr. Willis, Ph.D. 4.Competency Training for working with people with mental and developmental Disability, including 80 hours educational conference, workshop and discussion, case study presented by IABA Educational committee under supervision by Dr. Maryam Abedi Ph.D. 5.Professional Assault Response Training with a three days workshop and discussion directed by Lorry Leak, LCMSW. In addition to those courses I received courses and training sessions related to my work with Autistic children. The following is a list of some of the major tasks I carry either independently or under supervision: • Behavioral assessment, positive future plan assessment • Behavior modification and behavior intervention program • In home counseling • Emergency management through out a 24 hour period for at least twenty-five clients • Teaching independent living skills • Teaching emergency skills and community integration plan • Data collection, data analysis, data graphing and preparing all necessary reports • Monitoring medication and medical condition • Work with Psychiatrist/ Physician as a case coordinator to monitor all medical issues. I was able to work directly with Dr. DeAntonio, director of the Adolescence Psychiatry, at the UCLA Neuropsychiatry Institute. Along side my work at IABA I am also actively involved in the community through volunteer work. I work with Community Service Institute (CSI) to help individuals with disabilities integrate into the community, and with the Parent Teacher Student Association (PTSA). My volunteer work with The LAUSD provided me with a chance to attend the National Association Bilingual Education (NABE), the Phoenix conference, as a representative of PTSA, and gave a lecture on bilingual education among Iranian families. I have presented several lectures in Farsi and Kurdish regarding psychological and cultural issues among immigrant families in Iranian media. I also had few discussion interviews with a local radio station regarding the Kurdish psychology on behalf of the Kurdish American Education Society (KAES). Throughout my eventful journey I have seen a wide range of human emotion created by beauty, love and many times cruelty and the brutality of history. My observations, experiences, and professional work have all directed me towards the continuation of my education in Clinical Psychology and as a result of my history I have chosen to emphasize in diversity.</p>
