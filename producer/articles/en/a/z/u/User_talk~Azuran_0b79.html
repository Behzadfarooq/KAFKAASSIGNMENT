If you don't indicate the copyright status of the image on the image's description page, using an appropriate <a href="../../../i/c/t/WP%7EICT_6197.html" title="WP:ICT">copyright tag</a>, it may be deleted some time in the next seven days.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:BJRyan.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">first fair use criterion</a> in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_disputed_a5fb.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use disputed">Replaceable fair use disputed</a>}}</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_de0d.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_de0d.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a></span>.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:JoshBeckett.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">first fair use criterion</a> in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add <code>{{Replaceable fair use disputed}}</code>, <b>without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template</b>.</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license</a>, or by taking a picture of it yourself.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria.
