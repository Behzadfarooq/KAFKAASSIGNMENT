<p>Are Sakaki and Yomi really Americans, or was that just Osaka being... well... Osaka?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just Osaka being Osaka, what with Americans on average having larger breasts than Japanese people.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have heard that Osaka is actually from Kobe (both cities being "the boonies" to Tokyo-ites and often confused) but find anything to corrobate this rumor.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the first manga volume, soon after Osaka gains her nickname, she remarks to Tomo that although she is technically from Osaka, she spent most of her childhood in Kobe, and was born in Wakayama. Tomo replied, "Wakayama?! I don't even know where that is! Just be Osaka, okay?"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is a sort of joke for Japanese. Compared to Osaka, which is known as a wild place, Kobe is more sophisticated and "European" because of its port and Wakayama is basically a middle of nowhere. The way she dresses reflects this. In the group picture on this page, Osaka is dressed in a conservative Kobe-style with her long skirt, a hut and a <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purse.html" title="Purse">purse</a>. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevth_904e.html" title="User:Revth">Revth</a> 07:36, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've noticed there are no images. I've been trying to figure out the copyright issues involved; would it be a flat-out violation of copyright to post a few example images from the show, such as of the characters? How does this fall under the "fair use" concept? I mean, it would be a picture <i>of</i> a copyrighted work, after all, what would that mean? I've tried to figure it out from the copyright information section of Wikipedia, but copyright law makes my head hurt. --<a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirk_Gently_4242.html" title="User:Dirk Gently">Dirk Gently</a> 02:26, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AFAIK, this would fall under fair use. Screenshots are generally okay. I wouldn't post a whole page from the manga, but cover art or a frame from the anime shouldn't cause problems. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShibboleth_3624.html" title="User:Shibboleth">Shibboleth</a> 09:21, 9 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Er, consdering the recent change in Maya/Mayaa's name, well, what do people think of this? "Mayaa" seems a bit odd to me; I've never seen that spelling in the manga or anime ("Maya" there), though I saw only fansubs of the anime. Not a big deal, but I thought I'd mention it. (Does anyone know what the cat's untranslated name is? eg, まや or まやあ or something)</p>

<p>I've never heard this theory. While some of Yomi's traits may be associated with Asperger's, she also seems to be missing some symptoms -- there's no sign that she's missing any social cues, for instance.

<p>Somebody just added a long passage comparing Osaka's behavior to schizophrenia.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Miruchi and Yuka's "resemblance" to Yukari and Minamo</span></h2>
<p>Some people seem to think that Chiyo-chan's friends, Miruchi and Yuka, bear a resemblance to the series' teachers, Yukari Tanazaki and Minamo Kurosawa, respectively. I can only assume that they think that this "resemblance" is intentional on Kiyohiko Azuma's part. If they can't find a statement from him proving this resemblance, that bit of info shouldn't be in the article. I've certainly never heard any Azumanga Daioh fans discuss this "resemblance". It's always fine to add more info about the characters, but conjecture like this doesn't count.</p>
<p>You can see Chiyo's friends here: <a href="http://rakhal.com/florestica/comics/azumanga03/azumanga-1-031-001.jpg" class="external free" title="http://rakhal.com/florestica/comics/azumanga03/azumanga-1-031-001.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://rakhal.com/florestica/comics/azumanga03/azumanga-1-031-001.jpg</a><br />

<p>And here's Yukari and Minamo: <a href="http://www.animegalleries.net/albums/Azumanga_Daioh/yukari-nyamo/azu_yukarinyamo0057.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.animegalleries.net/albums/Azumanga_Daioh/yukari-nyamo/azu_yukarinyamo0057.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.animegalleries.net/albums/Azumanga_Daioh/yukari-nyamo/azu_yukarinyamo0057.jpg</a><br />

<p>The only visible "resemblance" is that one has long hair and the other has short hair. Beyond that, there's no simimarities in facial features, clothing, personality, or any dialogue that would hint at anything more than a vague coincidence. Even their hairstyles, the main "resemblance", are quite different. Yukari's is wavier and darker with more bangs, and Minamo's is shorter and much less of a shag cut, with her trademark "sideburns".</p>
<p>That being said, I'm going to edit the comment out and direct them to this page. If they come up with reasonable proof of resemblance beyond their own conjecture, they're welcome to put the comment back in. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcg106_96c3.html" title="User:Marcg106">Marcg106</a> 16:09, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Yomi's Weight</span></h2>
<p>I cut out the bit about Yomi only percieving herself as overweight...this is just as much speculation as assuming that the art style doesn't allow it. I still believe that Yomi IS supposed to be overweight: Osaka readily accepts Tomo's assertion that 'Yomi bends easy cause she's chubby', which the literal-minded girl would not do if the physical evidence wasn't there. In any case, I like how it currently stands. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurohone_4d11.html" title="User:Kurohone">Kurohone</a> 20:36, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Osaka also readily accepted Tomo's story about the mold monsters, and that it would be possible for them to get into Wimbledon by playing volleyball in PE class. Osaka lives in a world of her own, really...
<dl>
<dd>True, but if you look at a lot of the large colour arts, you'll notice that Yomi's stomach is (usually) drawn a little different to the other girl's. May be just poor fitting clothes, but I'm pretty sure that she's meant to be slightly overweight too (not to the extent where she has to diet, but she IS surrounded by stick-women) --<a href="../../../o/p/p/User%7EOppolo_8c67.html" title="User:Oppolo">Oppolo</a> 20:02, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Whether it should be kept depends on the focus of the article, and whether fan speculation should be included in articles of this sort is an open question. My personal opinion is that it should. One could solve the question by moving the fan speculations to a separate part of the article: it would take a major edit but might evlimante the problem of distinguishing between <i>fanon</i> and <i>canon</i>. Nonetheless, <i>shoujo-ai</i> and related topics are a vital theme in the fandom and deserve to be mentioned at some point rather than dismissed out-of-hand. -<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hopcroft_b302.html" title="User:Michael Hopcroft">Michael Hopcroft</a> 22:24, 24 November 2005 (PST)</dd>

<dd>I agree. It's an important part of how the show is perceived, and none of the references in the article itself make themselves out to be statements of fact. They're referred to only as the considerations of the fans. Considering the longstanding presence of lesbian or female bisexual relationships in manga and anime, it's not ridiculous to include notations on how this can be inferred from what we see in the series. (Heck, at one point Yukari practically admits to going on a date with Kurosawa, even if she's embarrassed about it.) As long as it's presented as just an interpretation, and one that's held by such a large amount of the show's audience, let it stay. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 07:40, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you want to be really anal retentive about it, neither are individual anime series. Or characters of series. Or any other number things which Wikipedia covers. It's an encyclopedia, yes, but in the case of entries like this it is an encyclopedia that is built and contributed to by fans. So yes, fandom is in fact an aspect of this entry. If you're going to start calling for the removal of anything not of a strictly encyclopedic nature, we can cull this down to "Azumanga Daioh is an animated series produced in Japan. It is about a group of girls in High School. It was created by Kiyohiko Azuma." There, it's covered the exact specifics of what it is and no more. - <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 21:37, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

A seperate section (if not article) about Speculation and Rumours would probably be an encyclopedic way to get both aspects (the canon and the fanon) installed. That way those interested in the show itself, rather than purely speculative notions of fans can get that without having to get the other...and vice versa. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurohone_4d11.html" title="User:Kurohone">Kurohone</a> 20:25, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This stuff should be removed from the article, <b>period</b>. It has no encyclopedic value whatsoever. At least descriptions of the characters' personalities are verifiable by anyone who watches the show. <b>The yuri/shojo-ai pairings only exist in the mind of those who want them to exist.</b> In short, it's <b>baseless, worthless fan speculation</b>. Keep fanon and the dreams of fanfiction writers out of Wikipedia. I've come across very few examples in this site where there was a decent reason to keep this sort of material. It does <b>nothing</b> except give the wrong impression to new readers. This material shouldn't stay up for much longer. If we don't get some mindblowing defense, it'll be edited out sometime this week. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcg106_96c3.html" title="User:Marcg106">Marcg106</a> 06:22, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What, and your hostility towards it isn't "baseless, worthless fan speculation"? Your tone makes it clear that you're just ticked off because it's not a view you share of the series. At least the other people commenting on it were making an attempt to appear as if they were neutral and simply didn't believe the information belonged, but you've just got some rage issues over it. While I might have left along any of them editing it and just considered it an inevitability, if you do so I'd consider it vandalism and say it should be reverted, because you're just angry over it being a view you disagree with, not a view that's invalid. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 19:47, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem that I have with it being in there with descriptions of personality is that it is subjective, not objective. It can objectively be seen that Tomo is hyper, that Sakaki is shy, that Chiyo is excitable. The subjectivity comes from the interpretation of why that might be. This is doubly difficult when it is (presumably) a Western audience writing about a Japanese story...remember, that cultural norms are extremely different, particularly those regarding friendships. To state that Tomo and Yomi, or Yukari and Minamo have a romantic relationship is to state an opinion...there is at no point anywhere in the anime or manga that would provide incontrovertiable backing for that assessment.</dd>

I've no problems whatsoever with it being put in its own section, such as "Viewpoints and Speculation", since I still consider it a valid interpretation but it might go over better outside of the regular character profiles. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 20:48, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have reworded the entire article, not because of this discussion alone, but it was difficult to read because it kept jumping back and forth between topics. I have included said section about "Viewpoints and Speculation" and have moved anything to do with fandom into it from the character profiles. Although I haven't been a part of this discussion up until now, I hope it resolves the issue. - Squilibob 23:29, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>Question: I was wondering what those short scenes with the "Ah!" bubble mean. In the New Year's dream episode, there was one after each character's dream. I'm wondering if it's a Japanese thing. Thanks!</p>

<dd>I think it's just a quirk of the show. It's used as the eyecatch as well. - Squilibob 11:06, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's A for Azumanga. It's the first character of the Japanese name anyway.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A list of Azumanga Daioh episodes</span></h2>
<p>Is there any interest in creating a list of Azumanga Daioh episodes? This is clearly Wikipedia convention for several shows with large followings. Also, many shorts or episodes could have their own articles, again, as per wikipedia convention of episode of a TV show article- because there are a lot of things that could be explained to an english speaking audience that would be taken as read by a Japanese audience. Unfortunately, I have neither the special expertise in Japanese culture, nor do I really know the precise interpretation of Kaorin seeing a kitty-cat in the locker room in the first episode. I don't even have the gall to hazard a guess.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, anybody think this should exist, go ahead and say so. Then we can all start, and I'll help for whatever I'm worth in this venture.</p>
<p><br />
Also, can we clean up this talk page? It seems like a lot of these issues are already resolved. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 02:19, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The problem I see is, how would one classify an episode? Would you list them by their original five minute segments and titles, or as they were grouped together for episodic release on the DVDs? Either way, it would probably be too long to include as part of the article. If they were done in the format of the original five-minute segments, then there would probably be enough of them to have their own article. (Otherwise, it might seem a little short for an article all its own. And Kaorin saw a kitty cat because she caught a glimpse of Sakaki's panties, which had a kitty on them. It's more blatantly spelled out in the manga, but in the anime you'll notice that immediately after the flash of the cute cat print, it goes to Sakaki finishing pulling her shorts up and Kaorin looking over with that odd expression on her face. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 03:34, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, 125 episodes would seem more reasonable for an article called "list of azumanga daioh episodes" than 25, but 25 seems an equally reasonable number of episodes to qualify for a list. There are only 22 episodes in the list of Star Trek the animated series episodes. And dare I say that that is more obscure. Here's a question- would the amount of information put up about any given 5 minute segment make that episode a stub? Or would having each dvd release episode with 5 subdividers make that article too long?<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 17:27, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hm, I definitely wouldn't say that each individual episode needs its own article either way. If we do a separate article for episodes, I'd put them all in a single other article as a list and set of fairly short synopses. I think even if we did the five-minute episode splits, as long as the synopses weren't describing every single little thing that happens, it wouldn't get too long for a single article. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 17:43, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a good point. That could probably work, with just breif explanations of Japanese culture as seen in the show and explanations of events from the Manga.

<dd>If each episode was also given its own section heading in the Azumanga Daioh Episodes article, that way we could also put a list of just the titles here in the main article and then Wikify them. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 04:47, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's a good question. This would be unlike most lists of episodes, because it would just be episodes and their descriptions, so it would be less listy in that way. It might be more like an archive than like a list.<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 19:27, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You know what? If we can do something to reverse the precedent that lists must be dry and devoid of information on the things that are listed, lets.
