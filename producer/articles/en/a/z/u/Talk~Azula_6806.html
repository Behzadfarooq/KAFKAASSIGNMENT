<p>Are we seriously going to get into a reverty war over Azula's age? Someone please bring forth the known information as provided by the show or Nickelodeon.</p>
<p>We don't know what her age is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm all for not starting an edit war. We do know what her age is: the newly updated Nick.com Avatar website lists Azula as being 14 years old. <a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERaceberry_af04.html" title="User:Raceberry">Raceberry</a> 05:19, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
But the creators of the show said she was the same age as Sokka and he's 15.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You got a reference about that?</dd>
<dd>They allegedly said that at a convention a year ago. The official website empirically states that she is 14. The website has the fact that it's more recent and also the fact that it's documented on its side. Unless Mike or Bryan comes out with an interview that specifically says, "Azula is 15," then we have to assume that the official site is correct. <a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERaceberry_af04.html" title="User:Raceberry">Raceberry</a> 00:55, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree. The Nick.com website is an official, <i>published</i> Avatar: The Last Airbender source and should take final precedence on the issue. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrototime_62d7.html" title="User:Prototime">Prototime</a> 06:01, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>Seems some lovely soul has decided to start this again...would that person care to explain why we should not go with Nick.com, the authoritative source for Avatar?--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> 17:20, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, I'm The Dragon's Daughter, and for the sake of love, update Azula's page. Her age now says 14 (possibly 15), as I can see this may come to be a dividing issue and some people still believe she is 15. So to make everyone happy, I did that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>And I undid it<a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> 03:42, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You don't seem to understand...there is verification that she is 14. To quote from <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus verifiability, not truth." This means, then, that since we have a published, authoritative source that says she is 14, that's what the article should say, unless a published, authoritative source (or the show itself, I’d suppose) says otherwise. Some comments at a comic-con, even from he show's creators, do not superceed a published source.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> 04:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p>This is countmall (the guy fighting an editor about mai's pic), I think we can agree that Azula could possibly be 14 comming up on her 15th birthday.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, we can't. She's 14, period. That's what the source says, that's what goes in.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>)</sup> 18:34, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just for the record...Nick.com is the offical source.

<p>I say she's 15. Think about it: Zuko was 14 when he was bannished. In Season Two, he says it has been three years. That means that now he's 17. Azula is two years younger than Zuko, making her 15. Happy? User:Hot Firebender Princess 17:20, 15, November 2006</p>
<p>Maybe you don't understand. Nick.com, an official source, says she is fourteen. Until that changes, that is what we go by. That's how Wikipedia works. Information is posted when it is verifiable, and it has been confirmed that she is 14, so she is. -<a href="../../../e/x/h/User%7EExhibit_A_69b2.html" title="User:Exhibit A">Exhibit A</a> 22:28, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The show itself is *also* an official source. Did Zuko say in Season Two that (1) he was exiled at 14 and (2) it has been three years? If so then he would need to have aged three years, thus he is 17 and Azula 15. I don't remember what the show says, but continuity errors aren't exactly impossible ... I'd take what the show says over what nick.com says. But that's just me. At the least if there is a contradiction between nick.com and the show, it should be noted. Gothic Chevalier 23:17, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>But the nick.com page is a year old. Thus she is 15. I should know. Look at my username. She's my namesake. user: Hot Firebender Princess</p>

<dd>Until someone finds a source that says that she's 15, the Nick.com one is the one that's going to be used, even though it's older... Perhaps a notation would be better than constantly editing it? Actually, for all we know, Azula could still be 14. Maybe her birthday falls months after Zuko's exile...</dd>

<dd>I am forced to scoff at your argument, Hot Firebender Princess. The Nick.com page on the show is almost two years old. Does that mean the characters have aged two years in that time? NO, BECAUSE TIME DOESN'T PASS THE SAME WAY IN THE SHOW! In case the reference to Aang having to achieve his destiny by "Summer's end", and the message being given to him in the MIDDLE OF WINTER doesn't make it clear. Stop trying to apply math. Cite a verifiable source that says she's fifteen, and THEN you can change it. I don't care how big a fan of Azula you are, you can't prove that statement no matter how much you believe you're right.

<p>I don't know if you think that this would be a good idea, but why don't we just not put what age she is at all? If not, can't we just put that she is 14-15 years old? User:ZukosGal14</p>

<p>In relation to Iroh being superior to Azula, I'd say that after seeing him fight groups of people on his own before, I doubt age is a problem. His problem comes in never expecting an attack being that he is either too carefree of a person (hot springs capture) or that he is simply careless due to the fact that he is constantly observing everything (attack during The Chase). I do believe that in a one on one bout, Iroh would easily take on Azula due to his experience and wisdom. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> 04:05, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I 100% agree!</p>
<p>I don't. So far Iroh has yet to use Blue Fire.</p>
<p>I agree as well. In a fight, the person who punches harder doesn't always win; typically its the one who has better skill and technique. I would have to argue that that would be Iroh in this case.--<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriPredRavage_6f5a.html" title="User:TriPredRavage">TriPredRavage</a> 03:19, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Then again, you can't really make judgements of either of them since we really don't know Azula's or Iroh's total skill. However what we do know is that Azula is capable (and practicly did) beat the Avatar in battle (The Drill) The fact is, we really don't know if Iroh is better then Azula. We do know however is that Azula does have a better mastery of Fire the Iroh, as evident by her Blue Flames.</p>

<dd>I don't Believe Azula has "better control over flames". In firebending, emotion plays a key role in creating fire, and Azula is easily made angry. Her power comes from her adolescent hissy fits, and I would imagine that they come with some weaknesses as well. I strongly doubt that just because she makes a different color of fire, she is the strongest firebender to ever live. Even when aang is in the avatar state, his flames are red and orange (as in winter solstice). Azula's technique must have some detrimental effect that other firebenders are reluctant to embrace (the cost of having no heart, perhaps?)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.61.200.253 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.61.200.253_dec3.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.61.200.253">contribs</a>) 23:36, 3 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>It is clearly stated in the show that Azula is named after her grandfather, Azulon. I think this bit of trivia is somewhat misleading if we are to believe what the show tells us. I understand the conection between "azul" and "blue fire" but it would mean that the producers of the show named Azulon after Azula and her blue fire, instead of vice versa.<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManniTheUnCanny_bce2.html" title="User:ManniTheUnCanny">ManniTheUnCanny</a> 07:23, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Honestly I wouldn't doubt that they didn't name Azulon after Azula when writing the script. While writing the script they wanted to show that Azula was the prodigy or the more noble so they named her grandfather Azulon to show just that. IN THE SHOW, Azula is named after Azulon. However, when writing the script it could be the other way around. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 08:52, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, i'd have little doubt that the writers created Azulon's name based on Azula's.

<p>Daughter to Fire Lord Ozai, Azula is Zuko's 14-year-old younger sister. She's a lot like the typical "Little Miss Perfect" younger sister, only she's also a deadly Firebender. Azula has always been the favorite of the Fire Lord, and of everyone around her for that matter  everyone but Zuko, that is. Azula excels at her royal role  she is extremely gracious, smooth and put-together. An ideal Princess, she is also cold, calculating, and precise. Zuko will tell you that Azula is "lucky." Things just tend to turn out in her favor.</p>

<p>Come to think about it, the fire lord may like her better, but Zuko was actually the prefered one. Azula's fans include fire lored Ozai, and Ty Lee, while zuko's fans include Ursa, Iroh, probably Lu Ten, and Mai. Azulon is undecided, he called one of his grandkids` show a pomp, (show fit for a king) but it is unclear which one he directed it to.</p>

Azula has bangs! Its those two locks of hair on either side of her face. Katara has bangs, though they are in the form of "hair loopies".

<p>Alright, I noticed that Azula is listed as a Firebending master. Isn't that false considering she was training to master lightning - as in she hasn't mastered it yet? Ture, she was called a prodigy, but she had trainers in the Avatar State, indecating that she hasn't actually mastered Firebending, otherwise they wouldn't be there. <a href="../../../x/e/p/User%7EXepeyon_440b.html" title="User:Xepeyon">Xepeyon</a> 02:41, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Azula may have been training, but it seems that she's at least among the top three Firebenders we've seen so far, the others being Firebending masters themselves-Iroh and Jeong Jeong. Of those two, only Iroh has displayed a technique (redirecting lightning) that Azula has not. Also, think back to the Agni Kai between Zhao and Zuko. Zhao was dubbed a Firebending master, even though he had left Jeong Jeong's teaching before it was completed. Zuko has managed to defeat Zhao twice, and Azula has shown that she is more skilled than Zuko on two separate occasions. Now, it should be noted that "mastery" does not necessarily correlate with skill (Zuko is not a master, yet he defeated Zhao). Technically we don't really know if Azula is truly a master or not-she could have completed her training with Lo and Li by this time. The fact that she's the only one to have used blue Firebending and Lightning in combat, however, indicates that she is on level with Firebending masters at the least. <a href="../../../y/_/b/User%7EY_BCZ_9daf.html" title="User:Y BCZ">Y BCZ</a> 03:51, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is that paragraph even there? The paragraph itself says that we don't know how Azula felt about Lu Ten (or vice-verca), nor have we seen any interaction between the two. I would delete it myself, but I believe it should be discussed here first. Objections to the sections' deletion?

<dd>That's the family section of Azula's article. Lu Ten is part of her family. So yeah, objection. <a href="../../../y/_/b/User%7EY_BCZ_9daf.html" title="User:Y BCZ">Y BCZ</a> 17:45, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, it is the family section. But if we were to use that excuse, then where is Azulon? Azulon has interacted more with Azula (which is still not alot; she just demonstarted some Firebending for him), and her name comes from Azulon. Yet he is not there, while Lu Ten, a person who has not interacted with her at all, nor share any sort of connection (besides being related), is there. Lu Ten should be deleted. (<a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E11987.html" title="User:11987">11987</a> 01:12, 18 February 2007 (UTC))</p>
<p>From what the viewer can see, she holds no regard to Lu Ten whatsoever. She also was not affected by her cousin's death. It kind of shows more of her sadistic attitude. However, I do agree with you that Azulon should be on her page too. <a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMomoroxmysoxoff_509c.html" title="User:Momoroxmysoxoff">Momoroxmysoxoff</a> 20:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm, I see what your saying. Though that should be mentioned in his section. Ok, I agree it should stay, but Azulon should be added. (<a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E11987.html" title="User:11987">11987</a> 08:49, 22 February 2007 (UTC))</p>
