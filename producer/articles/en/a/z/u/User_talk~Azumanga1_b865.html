<p>Just for future reference, the -17 in "CBLFT-17" does not mean that the transmitter <i>broadcasts</i> on channel 17. Canadian television rebroadcast transmitters aren't necessarily numbered that way. What it means in this case is that the transmitter in Sarnia was the 17<sup>th</sup> one added <i>chronologically</i>. (There are some that are numbered with the actual channel number, but it's at the choice of the broadcaster — so you should always assume that the two <i>aren't</i> related unless proven otherwise.) So I'd ask you to please not change the channel number for CBLFT-17 again unless you can confirm that it's actually been moved to channel 17 even though all the media directories still list it on 68. Thanks. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:56, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I would like to ask you, if possible, to use <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summaries.html" title="Edit summaries">edit summaries</a> more often when you contribute. An edit summary helps others understand what you changed when checking the watchlist or the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recent_changes.html" title="Recent changes">recent changes</a>, and often times complements studying the diff. Think of it as the "Subject:" line in an email.

<p>Could I please ask you again, what's your source for claiming that CBLFT's transmitter in Sarnia has moved to channel 17? The CRTC has no decision on file permitting a channel change.

<p>I have to question whether to include WCTV in the <a href="../../../c/b/s/Template%7ECBS_Georgia_af22.html" title="Template:CBS Georgia">CBS Georgia</a> template. Even though WCTV is licensed to Thomasville, for all intents and purposes it's a Tallahassee station. From what I remember in reading previous versions of their Web site, WCTV has NEVER had its main studio on the Georgia side of the market, so it has always considered itself a Tallahassee station.</p>
<p>In my book, WCTV is in the same category as a few other stations licensed in one state, but pretty much identify with another:</p>

<p>On that basis, I would argue that WCTV is a 100% Tallahassee station. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboy96_de0a.html" title="User:Blueboy96">Blueboy96</a> 15:52, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the article Crayon Shin-chan, you've changed a line that says "Starting April 2006, Crayon Shin-chan celebrates its 15th anniversary" to "Crayon Shin-chan celebrated its 15th anniversary in April 2006." That is not true, however. At the beginning of each current Crayon Shin-chan shows, Shin-chan says, translated literally, "Crayon Shin-chan, Television 15th Year!" As of June 2006, it says, "Even this summer, Crayon Shin-chan, Television 15th Year!" meaning it still has not finished celebrating its 15th anniversary.</p>

<p>I see you update the information KASY-TV often. But all of your information is wrong. We have no association with KUPT or those others that are up there. We do not transmit a signal to Lubbock Texas. If there is a station in Lubbock that is taking our signal, it is not legally being done so, and they don't have the permission of our station or the company that owns us. We do help boost our signal to reach other parts of New Mexico, but it's all done under our KASY call letters. We were recently added on Comcast cable in smaller parts of New Mexico. But that's it. Where are you getting this information about the Texas station?</p>
<p>Now you are adding more incorrect information regarding some station called KTEL.</p>
<p>I'll have to start reporting you for posting wrong information.</p>

<p>You changed the article, stating that their license was canceled as of 9/7. Do you have a reference for that? I cannot find where their license was canceled. CDBS has "Permit Canceled" as the current status of their analog license, but AFAIK, they still have the digital construction permit active, meaning that the station is not defunct. I've been trying to get an answer on this for over 2 months now, but I have a feeling that they're going digital-only instead, as <a href="../../../k/w/d/KWDK_7558.html" title="KWDK">KWDK</a> in Seattle did. --<a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 05:05, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It says, "License Cancelled"; if the FCC says so, then it must be true, unless there is evidence saying otherwise.

<dd>Know what? You're right. I misread the status date as 6/27/<b>2006</b> instead of 6/27/2002. The FCC's publication of <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/video/files/dtvstas.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/video/files/dtvstas.html" rel="nofollow">this list</a> on 7/21/2006, effective 7/13/2006, led me to believe that the CP for KTFL-DT was still active, even though their latest STA expired on 7/1/2006.

<p>Why do you persist in putting useless information into articles? The fact that K08MM is Class A has been documented already in three places in the article.

<p>Regarding our minor conflict on several of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_CW_Television_Network_7388.html" title="The CW Television Network">CW</a> templates, I have thought that Wikipedia convention for digital subchannels was to use the PSIP number as opposed to the actual given that <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> regulations require stations to use the PSIP number. Yes, PSIP doesn't apply to early adoptors with older sets, but considering the fact that that percentage of those viewers are declining daily I'd consider it a moot point to list actual considering the FCC circumstances in place.

<p>Is your change to Multimedios based on my post in Radio-Info? I was about to make the change myself that night, then noticed that they still had a lot of TV Inspiracion material. Since then, I'd been looking for more Multimedios programming before changing the Wikipedia article, but so far, all I've seen has been TV Inspiracion, including right now. I'm kinda puzzled about the whole thing - have you seen any other Multimedios programming from them? <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 04:21, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only Multimedios programming I've seen is on my local affiliate, <a href="../../../w/t/a/WTAM-LP_f1bd.html" title="WTAM-LP">WTAM-LP</a> ch.30 in Tampa -- and that's only through fleeting glances at thriftshops (I'm a cable person). If they still are primarily a TV Inspiracion affil, maybe they have dual affiliations, or they got cold feet. -- azumanga 05:22, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They're still running a lot of TV Inspiracion material, but I'm seeing more Multimedios material now, enough to where I'm now comfortable in calling them a Multimedios affiliate. However, I wouldn't assume that KPHE is running the same programming as KTAM-LP, even though they've been owned by the same companies for several years now. (Both stations, along with KHLM-LP in Houston, participated in the Digital Data Services Act pilot project in 2000-2002. Lotus bought all three stations in a package deal.) <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 19:34, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wouldn't bother. The kid seems clueless. His (her?) first attempt at an article was to lift the opening page text from the BVM website verbatim to use as his opening, then lift a MySpace entry by one of the owners verbatim as the article. At first, I didn't realize it was <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYVIO_ef21.html" title="WP:COPYVIO">COPYVIO</a>, so when I tagged the article {{<a href="../../../a/d/v/Template%7EAdvert_8bb0.html" title="Template:Advert">advert</a>}} and confronted him about it, he changed the first person text to third person, removed the tag, and proclaimed that he had removed the advertising. Then I found out it was plagiarism and stubbed it down to its present opening paragraph. The {{<a href="../../../i/n/a/Template%7EInappropriate_tone_9781.html" title="Template:Inappropriate tone">inappropriate tone</a>}} tag was a good idea, but I doubt he'll get it. For now, I'll just let him work his "magic", then when he's satisfied with his work and quits, I might just go in and do a massive cleanup.

<p>This, while true, will change soon. WHSV requested that Winchester City and Frederick, Clarke, Warren, Shenandoah, and Page counties be made part of the Harrisonburg DMA. This was approved by the FCC, and since WHSV-DT3 will be seen in Harrisonburg, which has always been in the Harrisonburg DMA, WHSV-DT3 (the DT signal of TV3 Winchester) is technically a Harrisonburg station.</p>
<p>To settle this, I am going to make TV3 Winchester a Washington, DC and Harrisonburg station, since it serves in both DMAs. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 04:17, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No worries. I do try to keep an eye on several radio and TV pages for updates and edits to make sure the information is correct and there are a couple that I do revert, but most of the info is up-to-date. I do pay particular attention to changes made my IP addresses as there is an IP editor that caused many problems, but is out of the Boston area. If you have any questions on any pages (information you think may be false or whatnot) just let me know and I can give you a hand.
