The name of this period is taken from Nobunaga's castle, <a href="../../../a/z/u/Azuchi_Castle_5289.html" title="Azuchi Castle">Azuchi Castle</a>, in the present-day town of <a href="../../../a/z/u/Azuchi%2C_Shiga_cea5.html" title="Azuchi, Shiga">Azuchi</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiga_Prefecture_8829.html" title="Shiga Prefecture">Shiga Prefecture</a> and Hideyoshi's castle, <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fushimi_Castle_3323.html" title="Fushimi Castle">Momoyama Castle</a> (also known as <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fushimi_Castle_3323.html" title="Fushimi Castle">Fushimi Castle</a>), in <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyoto.html" title="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>.</p>

<p>During the last half of the 16th century, a number different <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daimyo.html" title="Daimyo">daimyo</a> became strong enough either to manipulate the Muromachi <i>bakufu</i> to their own advantage or to overthrow it altogether. One attempt to overthrow the <i>bakufu</i> was made in 1560 by <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imagawa_Yoshimoto_3b70.html" title="Imagawa Yoshimoto">Imagawa Yoshimoto</a>, whose march towards the capital came to an ignominious end at the hands of <a href="../../../o/d/a/Oda_Nobunaga_1fea.html" title="Oda Nobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Okehazama_0b85.html" title="Battle of Okehazama">Battle of Okehazama</a>. In 1565, an alliance of the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matsunaga_Hisahide_a836.html" title="Matsunaga Hisahide">Matsunaga</a> and Miyoshi clans attempted a coup by assassinating <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashikaga_Yoshiteru_f91b.html" title="Ashikaga Yoshiteru">Ashikaga Yoshiteru</a>, the 13th Ashikaga shogun. Internal squabbling, however, prevented them from acting swiftly to legitimatize their claim to power, and it was not until 1568 that they managed to install Yoshiteru's cousin, <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashikaga_Yoshihide_9f9a.html" title="Ashikaga Yoshihide">Ashikaga Yoshihide</a>, as the next Shogun. Failure to enter Kyoto and gain recognition from the imperial court, however, had left the succession in doubt, and a group of <i>bakufu</i> retainers led by Hosokawa Fujitaka negotiated with Nobunaga to gain support for Yoshiteru's younger brother, <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashikaga_Yoshiaki_3f76.html" title="Ashikaga Yoshiaki">Yoshiaki</a>.</p>
<p>Nobunaga, who had prepared over a period of years for just such an opportunity by establishing an alliance with the Azai in northern Omi and then conquering the neighboring province of Mino, now marched toward Kyoto. After routing the Rokkaku clan in southern Omi, Nobunaga forced the Matsunaga to capitulate and the Miyoshi to withdraw to Settsu. He then entered the capital, where he successfully gained recognition from the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_of_Japan_1c74.html" title="Emperor of Japan">emperor</a> for Yoshiaki, who became the 15th Ashikaga shogun.</p>
<p>Nobunaga had no intention, however, of serving the Muromachi <i>bakufu,</i> and instead now turned his attention to tightening his grip on the Kinai region. Resistance in the form of rival daimyo, intransigent Buddhist monks, and hostile merchants was eliminated swiftly and mercilessly, and Nobunaga quickly gained a reputation as a ruthless, unrelenting adversary. In support of his political and military moves, he instituted economic reform, removing barriers to commerce by invalidating traditional monopolies held by shrines and guilds and promoting initiative by instituting free markets known as <i>rakuichi-rakuza</i>.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/5/7/1573.html" title="1573">1573</a> he had destroyed the alliance of Asakura and Azai clans that threatened his northern flank, obliterated the militant <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tendai.html" title="Tendai">Tendai</a> <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhists</a> monastic center at <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Hiei_e794.html" title="Mount Hiei">Mount Hiei</a> near Kyoto, and also had managed to avoid a potentially debilitating confrontation with <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeda_Shingen_9b9b.html" title="Takeda Shingen">Takeda Shingen</a>, who had suddenly taken ill and died just as his army was on the verge of defeating the Tokugawa and invading Oda's domain on its way to Kyoto.</p>
<p>Even after Shingen's death, there remained several daimyo powerful enough to resist Nobunaga, but none were situated close enough to Kyoto to pose a threat politically, and it appeared that unification under the Oda banner was a matter of time.</p>
<p>During the period from 1576 to 1579, Nobunaga constructed on the shore of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Biwa_9a5f.html" title="Lake Biwa">Lake Biwa</a> at <a href="../../../a/z/u/Azuchi%2C_Shiga_cea5.html" title="Azuchi, Shiga">Azuchi</a> (in present-day <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiga_Prefecture_8829.html" title="Shiga Prefecture">Shiga Prefecture</a>) <a href="../../../a/z/u/Azuchi_Castle_5289.html" title="Azuchi Castle">Azuchi Castle</a>, a magnificent seven-story castle that was intended to serve not simply as an impregnable military fortification but also as a sumptuous residence that would stand as a symbol of unification.</p>
<p>Having secured his grip on the Kinai region, Nobunaga was now powerful enough to assign his generals the task of subjugating the outlying provinces. <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shibata_Katsuie_c0e0.html" title="Shibata Katsuie">Shibata Katsuie</a> was given the task of conquering the <a href="../../../u/e/s/Uesugi_clan.html" title="Uesugi clan">Uesugi clan</a> in <a href="../../../e/t/c/Etchu_Province_e49a.html" title="Etchu Province">Etchū</a>, Takigawa Kazumasa confronted the Takeda in Kai, and <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hashiba_Hideyoshi_7e88.html" title="Hashiba Hideyoshi">Hashiba Hideyoshi</a> was given the formidable task of facing the Mori in the Chūgoku region of western Honshū.</p>
<p>In 1582, after a protracted campaign, Hideyoshi requested Nobunaga's help in overcoming tenacious resistance. Nobunaga, making a stop-over in Kyoto on his way west with only a small contingent of guards, was attacked and killed by one of his own disaffected generals, <a href="../../../a/k/e/Akechi_Mitsuhide_6a7f.html" title="Akechi Mitsuhide">Akechi Mitsuhide</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Hideyoshi_completes_the_unification" id="Hideyoshi_completes_the_unification"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/z/u/Azuchi-Momoyama_period_5787.html" title="Edit section: Hideyoshi completes the unification">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hideyoshi completes the unification</span></h2>
<p>What followed was a scramble by the most powerful of Nobunaga's retainers to avenge their lord's death and thereby establish a dominant position in negotiations over the forthcoming realignment of the Oda clan. The situation became even more urgent when it was learned that Nobunaga's oldest son and heir, Nobutada, had also been killed, leaving the Oda clan with no clear successor.</p>
<p>Quickly negotiating a truce with the Mori before they could learn of Nobunaga's death, Hideyoshi now took his troops on a forced march toward his adversary, whom he defeated at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Yamazaki_a425.html" title="Battle of Yamazaki">Battle of Yamazaki</a>, less than two weeks later.</p>
<p>Although a commoner who had risen through the ranks from foot soldier, Hideyoshi was now in position to challenge even the most senior of the Oda clan's hereditary retainers, and proposed that Nobutada's infant son, Sanposhi (later, Hidenobu), be named heir rather than Nobunaga's adult third son, Nobutaka, whose cause had been championed by <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shibata_Katsuie_c0e0.html" title="Shibata Katsuie">Shibata Katsuie</a>. Having gained the support of other senior retainers, including Niwa Nagahide and Ikeda Itsuoki, Sanposhi was named heir and Hideyoshi appointed co-guardian.</p>
<p>Continued political intrigue, however, eventually led to open confrontation. After defeating Shibata at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Shizugatake_c531.html" title="Battle of Shizugatake">Battle of Shizugatake</a> in 1583 and enduring a costly but ultimately advantageous stalemate with Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battles of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Komaki_a7dc.html" title="Battle of Komaki">Komaki</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Nagakute_9961.html" title="Battle of Nagakute">Nagakute</a> in 1584, Hideyoshi managed to settle the question of succession for once and all, to take complete control of Kyoto, and to become the undisputed ruler of the former Oda domains. He was adopted by the <a href="../../../f/u/j/Fujiwara_family.html" title="Fujiwara family">Fujiwara family</a>, given the surname Toyotomi, and granted the title <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sessho_and_Kampaku_4742.html" title="Sessho and Kampaku">Kanpaku</a> in representing civil and military control of all Japan. By the following year, he had secured alliances with three of the nine major daimyo coalitions and carried the war of unification to <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikoku.html" title="Shikoku">Shikoku</a> and <a href="../../../k/y/%C5%AB/Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB.html" title="Kyūshū">Kyūshū</a>. In <a href="../../../1/5/9/1590.html" title="1590">1590</a>, at the head of an army of 200,000, Hideyoshi defeated the Hōjō, his last formidable rival in eastern <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honsh%C5%AB.html" title="Honshū">Honshū</a>. The remaining daimyo soon capitulated, and the military reunification of Japan was complete.</p>

<p>With all of Japan now under Hideyoshi's control, a new structure for national government was configured. The country was unified under a single leader, but the day-to-day governance of the people remained decentralized. The basis of power was distribution of territory as measured by rice production in units of <i><a href="../../../k/o/k/Koku.html" title="Koku">koku</a></i>. In 1598, a national survey was instituted and assessed the national rice production at 18.5 million koku, 2 million of which was controlled directly by Hideyoshi himself. In contrast, <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokugawa_Ieyasu_2764.html" title="Tokugawa Ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>, whom Hideyoshi had transferred to the Kanto region, held 2.5 million koku.</p>
<p>The surveys, carried out by Hideyoshi both before and after he took the title <i><a href="../../../s/e/s/Sessho_and_Kampaku_4742.html" title="Sessho and Kampaku">Taiko</a>,</i> have come to be known as the "Taikō surveys" (<i>Taikō kenchi</i>).</p>

<p>A number of other administrative innovations were instituted to encourage commerce and stabilize society. In order to facilitate transportation, toll booths and other checkpoints along roads were largely eliminated as were unnecessary military strongholds. Measures that effectively froze class distinctions were instituted, including the requirement that different classes live separately in different areas of a town and a prohibition on the carrying or the owning of weapons by farmers. Hideyoshi ordered the collection of weapons in a great "sword hunt" (<i>katanagari</i>).</p>

<p>Hideyoshi sought to secure his position by rearranging the holdings of the daimyo to his advantage. In particular, he reassigned the Tokugawa family to the Kanto region, far from the capital, and surrounded their new territory with more trusted vassals. He also adopted a hostage system in which the wives and heirs of daimyo resided at his castle town in <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osaka.html" title="Osaka">Osaka</a>.</p>
<p>He also attempted to provide for an orderly succession by taking the title Taikō, or "retired Kanpaku," in <a href="../../../1/5/9/1591.html" title="1591">1591</a> and turned the regency over to his nephew and adopted son <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyotomi_Hidetsugu_a291.html" title="Toyotomi Hidetsugu">Toyotomi Hidetsugu</a>. Only later did he attempt to formalize the balance of power by establishing administrative bodies.

<p>Hideyoshi had on his deathbed appointed a group of the most powerful lords in Japan—Tokugawa, Maeda, Ukita, Uesugi, Mori—to govern as the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Five_Regents_23cf.html" title="Council of Five Regents">Council of Five Regents</a> until his infant son, Hideyori, came of age. An uneasy peace lasted until the death of Maeda Toshiie in 1599. Thereafter, Ishida Mitsunari accused Ieyasu of disloyalty to the Toyotomi name, precipitating a crisis that led to the Battle of Sekigahara. Generally regarded as the last major conflict of the Azuchi-Momoyama period and <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sengoku_period.html" title="Sengoku period"><i>sengoku-jidai</i></a>, Ieyasu's victory at Sekigahara marked the end of the Toyotomi reign. Three years later, Ieyasu received the title <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seii_Taishogun_fe8c.html" title="Seii Taishogun">Seii Taishogun</a></i>, and established the <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokugawa_shogunate.html" title="Tokugawa shogunate">Edo <i>bakufu</i></a>, which lasted until the <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meiji_Restoration_4cc3.html" title="Meiji Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a> in 1868.</p>

<p>The Momoyama period was a period of interest in the outside world, which also saw the development of large urban centers and the rise of the merchant class. The ornate castle architecture and interiors adorned with painted screens embellished with gold leaf were a reflection of a daimyo's power but also exhibited a new aesthetic sense that marked a clear departure from the somber monotones favored during the Muromachi period. A specific genre that emerged at this time was called the <i>Namban</i> style—exotic depictions of European priests, traders, and other <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanban_trade_period.html" title="Nanban trade period">"southern barbarians."</a></p>
<p>The art of the tea ceremony also flourished at this time, and both Nobunaga and Hideyoshi lavished time and money on this pastime, collecting tea bowls, caddies, and other implements, sponsoring lavish social events, and patronizing acclaimed masters such as <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sen_no_Riky%C5%AB_4440.html" title="Sen no Rikyū">Sen no Rikyū</a>.</p>
<p>Hideyoshi had occupied <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagasaki.html" title="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a> in 1587, and thereafter sought to take control of international trade and to regulate the trade associations that had contact with the outside world through this port. Although China rebuffed his efforts to secure trade concessions, Hideyoshi commercial missions called to present-day Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand in <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_seal_ships.html" title="Red seal ships">Red seal ships</a> were successful. He was also suspicious of <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirishitan.html" title="Kirishitan">Christianity in Japan</a>, which he saw as potentially subversive and some missionaries were crucified by his regime.</p>

<p>The contrasting personalities of the three leaders who contributed the most to Japan's final unification—Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu—are encapsulated in a series of three well known <i><a href="../../../s/e/n/Senryu.html" title="Senryu">senryu</a></i> that are still taught to Japanese schoold children:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Nakanunara, koroshiteshimae, hototogisu</i> (If the cuckoo does not sing, kill it.)</li>
<li><i>Nakanunara, nakashitemiseyou, hototogisu</i> (If the cuckoo does not sing, coax it.)</li>
<li><i>Nakanunara, nakumadematou, hototogisu</i> (If the cuckoo does not sing, wait for it.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nobunaga, known for his ruthlessness, is the subject of the first; Hideyoshi, known for his resourcefulness, is the subject of the second; and Ieyasu, known for his perseverance, is the subject of the third verse.</p>
