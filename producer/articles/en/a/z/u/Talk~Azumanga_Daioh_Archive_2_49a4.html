<p>"<i>Azumanga Daioh is a relatively short series, both in manga and anime. In collected format, the manga totals a mere four volumes, and the anime only six (with twenty-six episodes split among them).</i>"</p>
<p>I don't see how Azumanga Daioh anime can be seen as a "relatively short" anime series. Almost all anime I've heard of is made up of either 13 episodes or 26 (with a few rare exceptions of series with 70 or more episodes). <a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzyxx_3bc3.html" title="User:Xyzyxx">Xyzyxx</a> 14:38, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You haven't heard of a lot of anime then. While 13-26 episodes is common for some series, especially the majority that Cartoon Network licenses for Adult Swim, many animes run up to 52, or into the hundreds of episodes. Even with the anime that only run for 13-26 episodes, the manga versions are usually much, much longer. (The Big O manga is, to my knowledge, still running. So is Inuyasha, I believe.) In this case, the length is more in reference to the fact that it's not terribly long in either version. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 19:35, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Xyzyxx is correct: less than half of anime series go above 26 episodes. --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">日本穣 Nihonjoe</a> 22:39, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is this comment really necessary?</span></h2>
<p>"Although the series has a cast of cute girls and an obvious lack of men for the most part, it is not considered a shōjo series. It also has some popularity among fans of yuri and shōjo ai (and in the case of Chiyo, lolicon) due again to the lack of presence of male characters and the distinct relationships (close friendships, for the most part) between the girls."</p>
<p>Is it really relevant that people who enjoy lesbian/pedophiliac anime would like this show? even if it wasn't obvious that a show with a predominantly young female cast would attract those sorts of people, is this piece of 'trivia' even worth it's digital real estate? Craig Sniffen 04:50, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first part is in fact valuable information. Japanese manga tends to be <i>very</i> highly targeted at particular demographics and to follow particular "formulas" for those demographics, so someone who is familiar with the formulas might mistakenly assume "shōjo" from being told that the series is about six high school girls who are close friends. (Hey, if all you told someone about <i><a href="../../../w/a/t/Watership_Down_abdf.html" title="Watership Down">Watership Down</a></i> was "all the protagonists are bunny rabbits", they'd think it was a kid's book...)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The second part is less encyclopedic. The good thing about fans is that they often have a lot of valuable information about a series; the bad thing about fans is that they often mistake "what fans think" for valuable information. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:40, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is anything going to become of this? I agree with Craig Sniffen that is seems quite unnecessary. I may remove it myself unless someone comes up with a valid argument for keeping it. As far as I see it, it's <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a> which has nothing to do with the series detailed on Wikipedia. The closest AzuManga gets is Kaori's crush on Sakaki, and that (along with the entire series, save for one mishapful episode for Minamo) has no sexual overtones. Anyone with reasons to keep or remove the section starting with "It also has some popularity among fans" and ending with "between the girls"?</dd>
<dd>Likewise, could this one also be chopped out? "<i>Among yuri/shōjo ai fans, Tomo and Yomi, Yukari and Nyamo, and Kagura and Sakaki are all popular fan-pairings, though there is not quite as much canon subtextual support for the latter of the three as the other two, which are frequently considered to be strongly-supported pairings. Other popular pairings include Kagura and Tomo, Kaorin and Sakaki (mostly likely due to Kaorin's preexisting unrequited crush on Sakaki), and the more controversial Chiyo and Osaka or Chiyo and Sakaki (this is controversial mainly due to the fact that Chiyo is underaged in the original series, though most fan fiction stories featuring such pairings generally take place several years after the girls have graduated high school and often university, namely, after Chiyo has long since passed the sexual Age of Consent).</i>" I see no relevency to the series here. I realize it's a "speculation" section, but since when does an encyclopedia (even with the webwikiness of Wikipedia) speculate on a series, such as the completed AzuManga Daioh?</dd>

<dd>Reporting on fan speculation, I'll accept that as what it is. I'll question what speculation should appear in a <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">Good Article</a>, and what size of a fan base it requires to include. <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">Straw man</a> question: If a lot of fans speculated that Chiyo-chan was really an alien, or an undersea creature, would that appear as well? Better question: If a lot of fanfics featured Chiyo-chan as an alien, would that make an appearance, even with cites? The latter question is one I'm rather unclear on (and the former not a serious question). <a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyrius_a4d6.html" title="User:Fyrius">Fyrius</a>, do you have a position on whether the above-mentioned part of the page should remain or be removed? --<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELesoria_3a0f.html" title="User:Lesoria">Lesoria</a> 05:34, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnarRene_e013.html" title="User:GunnarRene">GunnarRene</a> asked for sources to prove the popularity of the speculation. Well, I don't think I can give you any permanent sources, but you can take a look or ask around at Azumanga-related fora like the Azumanga section on <a href="http://www.iichan.net" class="external text" title="http://www.iichan.net" rel="nofollow">Idlechan</a>, or at shoujo-ai-related fora like <a href="http://www.shoujoai.com" class="external text" title="http://www.shoujoai.com" rel="nofollow">ShoujoAi.com</a>. Although I understand that such sources would be out of place in the article. To answer <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELesoria_3a0f.html" title="User:Lesoria">Lesoria</a>: I'm not familiar with the rules of Wikipedia on this kind of things, which of course will eventually get their way, but if some speculation is really popular (as in, with more than half of the fans agreeing about it) then I'd put it in the article. - <a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyrius_a4d6.html" title="User:Fyrius">Fyrius</a> 15:21, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This isn't speculation though - it's just what some perverts like to write about in their fanfics. Your normal anime watcher won't care, and the people who would care probably have already read one or two. Should the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Jack_Sparrow_5f5e.html" title="Captain Jack Sparrow">Captain Jack Sparrow</a> article mention that lots of fanfic writers add themselves as a love interest, male or female?Craig Sniffen 06:15, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Azuma Kiyohiko (the manga artist of Azumanga Daioh) did do hentai manga before, so it's a possible reason that the readers look for any sexual connotations (whether perceived or real) in his works. -Anonymous 219.95.14.1 14:45, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find that disturbing. Why can't people just take things for what they are? Pokemon has more sexual theme and tension than Azumanga Daioh. The delusions of hardcore fanboys should not be listed in the article. --67.172.10.82 13:05, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Azumanga is <i>rare</i> for a Japanese manga/anime. It has a cast of cute girls but is <i>not</i> lolicon or a shōjo series.

I believe that the content can be justified and reworded with anyone with the time to do it. Bring to the talk page anything else that seems to be POV langauage or sounds like fan cruft and we can collaborate on changes that need to be made. I'll try and find a cite for popularity now. --Squilibob 05:18, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"A cite for popularity"?! Did <i>you</i> not read the initial comment either?! Noone has disputed the comic/manga's popularity in any way, not even the slightest bit. What's been disputed is the unsourced section which tries to <i>explain</i> that popularity, "Reasons for popularity", which makes assertions such as "Azumanga Daioh is distinctly different" (meaningless without qualifications, and poorly-written), "There is no overriding goal" (false without qualifications: getting through school and graduation can be considered a goal, and there are various other goals for the individual characters which run through most of the series, such as Sakaki's goal to pet a cat), "nor is there a grand event such as saving the world from some horrible doom" (how does that, in itself, make Azumanga Daioh unusual? the majority of series in existence do not involve a grand event such as saving the world from some horrible doom), "There is no struggling romance to prolong the series or be used awkwardly for the comedy inherent in misunderstandings" (Sakaki and Kaorin don't count?), etc. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> are absolute requirements: noone here has the slightest doubt that it would be incredibly easy to verify Azumanga Daioh's <i>popularity</i>: but how are you going to provide reliable references to explain the <i>reasons for its popularity</i>?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sakaki having Asperger Syndrome</span></h2>
<p>"Tomo's actions can be interpreted as showing characteristics of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Osaka may have some form of Autism, or Attention-Deficit Disorder. Sakaki may also have a high-functioning form of Autism, called Asperger's Syndrome -- she excels in sports and her classes, but doesn't talk much and prefers to stay isolated from the others." I agree with the comments about Tomo and Osaka, for these are pretty obvious, but I think that saying that Sakaki might have Asperger Syndrome is a bit far-fetched. Having Asperger Syndrome includes much more than just talking little combined with being very good at one thing. She might as well just be shy. <a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyrius_a4d6.html" title="User:Fyrius">Fyrius</a> 09:06, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>But it also counts as original research, considering that this article is the first and only place I've seen any such speculation.

<p>The problem is not that it's speculation without any canon support, the problem is that it's far-fetched. Nothing about Sakaki suggests a mental anomaly as clearly as Tomo's and Osaka's behaviour. Sure, she doesn't talk much and she's a bit preoccupied with cute things, but you can see subtle symptoms of Asperger Syndrome and other forms of Autism in everyone if you look for them. <a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyrius_a4d6.html" title="User:Fyrius">Fyrius</a> 13:42, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree as well. The sections about Osaka and Sakaki should be changed. There's no doubt about Tomo and ADHD, however saying that Osaka merely has ADD is uninformed and saying Sakaki has Aspergers is just weird and incorrect, especially after having just covered Osaka. The author seem to be quite misinformed. Having first person experience (Classic AS diagnose) and also in agreement with other know-it-alls (people with AS...&#160;;) ) and my 'normal' friends who see the similarities between the two os us, I can confidently say that if there is any character in this story that has a case of classic Aspergers Syndrome, it would be Osaka. She's 'slow' but really not stupid, just thinking different, plays with words a lot, clumsy, not very athletic, unusual body language, behaving strange (like the frying pan/kitche knife incident), "living in her own world", not really fitting in in the normal world, falling asleep easily and also she have her special interests, kanji and marine biology (especially sea slugs ^^). Attention problems is a sign of ADD, however also one of AS, and combined with the above mentioned it is a clear sign of AS. She gets along well, but a bit awkwardly, with people and is not very irate, but that doesn't disqualify an AS diagnose, while it actually lowers the posibility for a pure autism diagnose. I recognize so many of both these and many more signs that most people wouldn't even notice, from first hand experience, that there is no doubt about it. Sakaki is a quiet and shy person for other reasons, like her physical size, however, being interested in cute things and cats doesn't qualify as a 'special interest'. Maybe if she, on demand, could tell you detailed information about cat anatomy, pedigree lineages and the specifics on the various fur patterns of domestic cats in the Ural region, it could. Even if it's under 'speculation' it would not be a valid statement for reasons apparent to anyone with more than a minor amount of research. <a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIon_seal_c009.html" title="User:Ion seal">Ion_seal</a> 11:52, 8 August 2006 (CET)</p>

<dd>Obviously we can be just as sure about Tomo's ADHD as about Osaka's ADD or AS, or about whatever Sakaki would have. It's all speculation, and Wikipedia should acknowledge that. Azuma himself was no psychologist. He was just a manga author who wanted to create some interesting personalities. So no matter how apparent some diagnosis might be, it's still speculation, and it should be described as such in the article. And it is. So I thought this issue would be settled now.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That's not the point! The point is that some people are reminded of Asperger's by Sakaki's personality, and those people want this trivium in the article.</dd>
<dd>Besides, you can't recognize Asperger's from knowing <i>one</i> person who has it. It's different for everyone. And first hand experience is unreliable by nature, especially in subjects like this one. I have an official Asperger's diagnosis myself, I know tons of people with it or with similar anomalies, and still I can't tell an Asperger from someone without it. That's why psychology is a serious subject of scientific study, because not any average Sally or Joe can go handing out labels just like that.</dd>

<dd>Sorry about frustrating you. I tend to have that effect sometimes.&#160;:/</dd>
<dd>But isn't it kind of against the idea of an encyclopedia to give people the wrong idea, though?</dd>
<dd>I'm certainly not qualified to give a diagnose, but according to my worldview and experience, I could put Osaka in the ADD file, if I were making a hasty judgement.</dd>
<dd>Heck, I'd put myself there every now and then. But with all the data, I would have to put her in the AS file, and it seems that most people agree.</dd>
<dd>Most people seem to agree about not putting Sakaki there as well.</dd>
<dd>Since it's just speculation, why not speculation that the people with a little knowledge thinks is most correct? If the personalities are so apparent, then why not reflect that?</dd>
<dd>Pathetic as it sounds, I feel a bit hurt by the current description as I feel that it's not quite correct and would give people a wrong or incomplete view.</dd>

<p>I see.</p>
<p>While most people may agree about Sakaki probably not having Asperger's, including me, I thought the phrase implying this already had enough <i>if</i>s and <i>maybe</i>s to make clear that it's not very likely, so I thought that should be a good compromise. Don't you?</p>
<p>As for Osaka and AS, just to eliminate misunderstandings: when you say AS, do you mean Asperger Syndrome? Because people also use AS to refer to the so-called <i>autistic spectrum</i> of all disorders related to autism. But I suppose you'd want to add something along these lines?</p>
<p>"...and Osaka's behavior is consistent with some forms of Autism, Asperger's Syndrome or Attention-Deficit Disorder."</p>
<p>I wouldn't really have any trouble with this formulation, even though it would be a bit redundant to say that she might have some form of autism <i>or</i> Asperger's, which <i>is</i> basically a form of autism (right?). So I'd say we could just edit it into this, and if someone who's not here doesn't agree we'll find out soon enough (in the form of more talk page chatter, that is). <a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyrius_a4d6.html" title="User:Fyrius">Fyrius</a> 00:45, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, that's pretty much it. By AS I mean Aspergers Syndrome. If you think that it's cluttered, then Autism could be removed, since that makes you think about someone like Rainman, while Aspergers most often is not that serious.</dd>
<dd>Suggestion:</dd>
<dd>"Tomo's actions can be easily interpreted as showing characteristics of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Osaka's behavior is consistent with Asperger's Syndrome or Attention-Deficit Disorder. Sakaki's behavior is also reminiscient of (though not necessarily deliberately modeled on) Asperger's Syndrome or a high-functioning form of Autism, though this is much less apparent."</dd>
<dd>That way, "thought this is much less apparent" have some kind of comparison to the previous sentence as well. <a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIon_seal_c009.html" title="User:Ion seal">Ion seal</a> 09:28, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I <i>almost</i> agree. Maybe it would be a better idea to say "Osaka's behaviour is consistent with ADD or a high functioning form of Autism, like Asperger syndrome" or something along those lines. That would keep the label more general, and (hopefully) that way people won't associate it with Rainman either.</p>
<p>Also, if Asperger is a form of high functioning Autism, the part about Sakaki isn't right the way you wrote it. "Asperger's Syndrome or <b>another</b> high-functioning form of Autism" would make more sense. <a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyrius_a4d6.html" title="User:Fyrius">Fyrius</a> 09:53, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't see anyone supporting the idea that Osaka has a debilitating form of Autism, while Sakaki has a "high-functioning" form of autism: which is what is currently in the article. Throwing around these kind of theories upsets people, obviously.</p>
<p>I've known a few people who have Autism. One could compare it to being around a ghost. Like they aren't really there. Prone to fits of violence, thrashing and aggression. While I could believe that Osaka has a form that mildly dislocates her, like this "Asperger's Syndorme," I could not possibly see it as being anything more than that.</p>
<p>There's just something deranged about this addition to the article. Like there's something not intirely right with the person who added it. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalty_Morton_291c.html" title="User:Salty Morton">Salty Morton</a> 20:13, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the article doesn't quite imply that Osaka has anything debiliating ('some form of Autism' isn't really that specific, and Autism comes in many forms, many of which don't stop people from leading a normal life), but since that's what Autism generally seems to be associated with it might indeed be a good idea to stress the high-functioning-ness of her potential Autistic disorder.</dd>
<dd>How about this:</dd>
<dd>"Tomo's actions can be easily interpreted as showing characteristics of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attention-Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder_a64e.html" title="Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</a> and Osaka's behavior is consistent with <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attention-Deficit_Disorder_e842.html" title="Attention-Deficit Disorder">Attention-Deficit Disorder</a> or some <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_functioning_autism.html" title="High functioning autism">high-functioning</a> forms of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a>, possibly <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_Syndrome_92e0.html" title="Asperger Syndrome">Asperger Syndrome</a>.

<dd>Yet, I still have a problem with the part about Sakaki. She has near-perfect motor skills; a shear sign that she <i>does not by any means</i> have Asperger Syndrome. The whole basis of such in the article is that she is easily distracted by cute things and is shy; none of which are signs of Asperger Syndrome. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalty_Morton_291c.html" title="User:Salty Morton">Salty Morton</a> 21:43, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's far-fetched, indeed, I agree (that's basically why I started this talk page paragraph in the first place). But the reason why it's still in the article is because some people really do believe she might have Asperger's, which should be enough reason for it to stay because this is after all the "viewpoints, trivia and speculation" paragraph. On the other hand, there have been many people who have been offended by it (and edited it out without visiting the talk page first, much to my frustration), so I think some rephrasing might be a good idea, to clarify that it's just a fan theory.</p>
<p>How about this?</p>
<p>"Some fans also believe that Sakaki's behavior is reminiscient of (though not necessarily deliberately modeled on) Asperger Syndrome, though this is much less apparent."</p>
<p>I'm not sure, though, if this is okay with Wikipedia's <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">no weasel words</a> rule.

"Osaka's behaviour is consistent with ADD or a high functioning form of Autism, like Asperger syndrome" works well for me. In fact, I think it's even better formulated than what I wrote. I didn't want to push the issue, but <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalty_Morton_291c.html" title="User:Salty Morton">Salty Morton</a> said it best. Sakaki has near-perfect motor skills, she's the best athlete in school, which would be virtually impossible or at least extremely rare for someone with Aspergers, and that she's shy and likes cute things are not signs of it either. <a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIon_seal_c009.html" title="User:Ion seal">Ion seal</a> 13:27, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Sakaki never demonstrated any characteristics; although she does display a trait that may be confused for an autistic one: shyness.</p>
<p>Autism is a debilitating mental disorder, one that completely dislocates people from the world around them. I find it in poor taste and ignorance to throw about these kinds of statements. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalty_Morton_291c.html" title="User:Salty Morton">Salty Morton</a> 12:19, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually I don't think this really is a screenshot. It looks more like an amazingly accurate redraw to me, or maybe it's official concept art. Anyway, I don't think this is a capture from the actual animation; I can't find any differences in even the tiniest details, but it just looks too sharp to be a screenshot.

<p>In pages of individual characters (<a href="../../../a/y/u/Ayumu_Kasuga_8448.html" title="Ayumu Kasuga">Ayumu Kasuga</a> etc), there is a "name translation" box, which listed differential translation of the names in China and South Korea. I don't mind listing their Chinese and Korean names (In this case, Chūnrì Bù / Běipíng and Maeng Sun-jeong / Busandaek etc), but I was a bit miffed to see the Korean name actually <i>translated</i>. In my opinion, unless that translate name has a special meaning (eg Busandaek) so it has to be translated to make things clear, names are not supposed to be <i>translated</i>. They are supposed to be <i>transliterated</i>.</p>
<p>What's more absurd is the editor(s) even tried to translate the name with the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surname.html" title="Surname">surname</a>, which usually has no meaning at all now... <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Curtis_8906.html" title="User:Samuel Curtis">Samuel Curtis</a> 02:35, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In many ways very different from most other anime series.</li>
<li>Unusually popular both in and outside of Japan for a series of its type.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, I can't seem to come up with a way to express this in an encyclopedic manner (which is why the Reasons for Popularity section is now hidden).

<p>If I remember correctly, I read, in the references to popular culture, there was a reference to Chobits in episode 17 where Osaka and Tomo used the word "Mii" (snake) instead of "Chii", with similar mimics.

However, because the word used for "snake" in that mnemonic is a bit obscure, they get stuck and can't remember how to complete the mnemonic.

<dd>Yeah, they have trouble remembering the mnemonic, but then they remember that "this year was the year of the dragon, so next year must be the year of the snake", and thus, lazy as they are, don't bother remembering the rest of the mnemonic, and having concluded that then next year is the year of the snake, starts mimicking Chii from Chobits.</dd>

<dd>(1)The manga ran in Dengeki Daioh, a decidedly shōnen/seinen (probably right on the border) magazine. There is nothing remotely shōjo about it. Only a very small number of series are ever "declared" to be shōjo, shōnen, or something else. The determination is made by what magazine it runs in.</dd>
<dd>(2)The magazine it runs in is aimed squarely at a male audience (anyone who reads it can clearly see that based on the topics coverd in the magazine), though it's always possible a female will pick up the magazine and even enjoy it. Taht doesn't change who the target demographic is, however.</dd>
<dd>(3)I do agree about the fan service, though. The really isn't any, even when they are in swimsuits. Outside of the sukebe teacher, there's no ogling or emphasis placed on anything that would be considered fan service.

<p>I only just saw the tagging overkill you inflicted on the "Viewpoints, Trivia &amp; Speculation" paragraph. I think you're missing the point of that part. It's basically a paragraph <i>intended</i> for OR and speculation, as long as it's within the usual boundaries of verifiability. And even if it weren't, many of the things you marked as needing citations aren't the type of information that giving citations would be appropriate for. Like "Chiyo's elementary school friends look like the teachers", "Yuka sounds like Yukari and Miruchi slightly sounds like Minamo", or the trivium that this topic is about. Surely you don't need anyone else to say it before you'll believe that Yuka sounds like Yukari.</p>
<p>As for the ADHD, ADD &amp; Autism trivium, it links to articles that provide all the background information you need, like the symptoms of the disorders. If a reader would want to verify those assertions, they should just read the linked articles and compare the symptoms to the characters. The same goes for the "magazine intended for boys / aimed at male audience" part and probably some other trivia as well.</p>

Come on, guys. <a href="../../../a/z/u/Talk%7EAzumanga_Daioh_ada3.html#Sakaki_having_Asperger_Syndrome" title="Talk:Azumanga Daioh">We've been discussing this for months already.</a> I had hoped we would finally have made enough compromises by now. We've already picked the most careful wording we could, with many "ifs" and "maybes" to avoid being interpreted as original research.</p>
<p>Anyway, please read the topic above and continue the discussion there, if you must. <a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyrius_a4d6.html" title="User:Fyrius">Fyrius</a> 10:24, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"... the "Viewpoints, Trivia &amp; Speculation" paragraph. I think you're missing the point of that part. It's basically a paragraph <i>intended</i> for OR and speculation, as long as it's within the usual boundaries of verifiability." Am I reading this right? It seems like the editor is stating that if a section header is inserted that <i>announces</i> the section as a haven for unencyclopedic content, suddenly unencyclopedic content becomes okay for the article, as long as it's in that section. Needless to say, I don't agree with that theory. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 14:40, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's nothing wrong with <i>describing</i> unencyclopedic content in an encyclopedia. While it's true that even within this section it would be wrong to present outright speculation as encyclopedic facts, this part of the article is made for <i>reporting</i> popular viewpoints and fan speculation. So we're still dealing with verifiable facts here, although some of those might still need a citation toverify the popularity of the viewpoint. Which is why I also agreed with many of the "citation needed" tags that Ashibaka added. <a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyrius_a4d6.html" title="User:Fyrius">Fyrius</a> 16:05, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>137.22.3.34, will you please quit vandalizing the page? It doesn't make your case any stronger. Also, in defense of the trivium in question: it doesn't say that the characters <i>have</i> any disorders, only that their behaviour is similar to the symptoms of the disorders, which is a verifiable and true fact. Read the linked articles on high-functioning Autism and ADHD and compare them for yourself. Surely you'll agree that at least a few characteristics would remind you of Tomo or Osaka respectively.</p>

<dd>[edit] Obviously, since the only source for this trivia is the show itself, it can be debated endlessly. Per <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">WP:TRIVIA</a> and related proposals that were actually accepted as guidelines, Wikipedia is not the right place for speculation.</dd>

<p>Well, congratulations, you ridded the article of its main source of controversy. Personally I think it's a bit of a waste, considering how long we've all been working on it, but if this is more consistent with the rules of Wikipedia it's probably the best solution. And it'll save us (or me, at least) a whole load of time and trouble that would otherwise go to waste in pointless debates that are never really solved. <a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyrius_a4d6.html" title="User:Fyrius">Fyrius</a> 18:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>MHO is that the trivia and speculation section was probably the most interesting part of the entire article. There are many pieces of trivia that I didn't even think about but that made watching it a whole lot more interesting. There are things sourced in the series itself that is pretty obvious and interesting enough to have here. Speculation, while more unfounded, is also very interesting. Speculation such as that Tomo and Yomu would be lesbians or that Osaka/Sakaki/Tomo have various kinds of AS/Autism/ADHD is things that wouldn't surprise me a bit if they were true, and that I have overheard in online conversations and other forms of media, that apparently enough people speak of to make it worthy of mention, but that I have yet to see a scientific paper on, so it's quite hard to find a definite source for things like that. I would rather have to read a number of possible subjective opinions than the absence of an objective fact. I agree that some things can be debated back and forth, but removing the entire segment is a bit harsh. It DOES say "Trivia and Speculation", so anyone with half a brain looking for facts will at least disregard the speculation bits. $0.02 <a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIon_seal_c009.html" title="User:Ion seal">Ion seal</a> 23:02, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ADV's Thinpak</span></h2>
<p>Does anyone know why ADV released (re-released?) the 5 DVD Thinpak? Was there a legal reason behind it, perhaps? Either way, I added it into the page for those who would be confused as to why they only have 5 discs. <a href="../../../s/o/s/User%7ESosei_6fc8.html" title="User:Sosei">Sosei</a> 14:57, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No legal issue involved to my knowledge. This is just something ADV typically does with a series after completing its disc-by-disc run. There are boxes like it for numerous ADV series, such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martian_Successor_Nadesico_4558.html" title="Martian Successor Nadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hopcroft_b302.html" title="User:Michael Hopcroft">Michael Hopcroft</a></dd>

<p>Is there any specific reason why the shows name is written Daioh? It should be daiou or daiô, i've never seen ou been written oh in any other context. AniDB also writes it as Azumanga Daiou. - Tobberoth</p>
<dl>
<dd>As noted in the <a href="../../../a/z/u/Azumanga_Daioh_5292.html#Title_origin" title="Azumanga Daioh">Title Origin</a> section, the 'Daioh' part of the name comes from the magazine <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dengeki_Daioh_8259.html" title="Dengeki Daioh">Dengeki Daioh</a>. This magazine writes the 'Daioh' part of its name in English on the cover (as well as in Japanese), and has always used the 'oh' spelling, possibly to aid pronunciation by people would don't know how to pronounce Japanese.

<dd>It would actually be "daiō," not "daiô." according to the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA">WP:MOS-JA</a>, except that the official English title is "Azumanga Daioh," and that's how it's most commonly known in English. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">Nihon</a><a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">jo</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><b><font color="darkgreen">e</font></b></a></small></sup> 15:51, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally, I hate "daioh", and I barely tolerate "daiō" (but I do because it's wikipedia policy). I prefer daiou because it makes going from kana to romaji easier, imo, since it translates part by part, da-&gt;だ, i-&gt;い, o-&gt;お, u-&gt;う, thus daiou to だいおう, or 大王. But yea, the official English translation that the Japanese creators came up with was Daioh, and it's licensed in the US as Daioh, so Daioh it stays as per wikipedia policy. --<a href="../../../w/i/r/User%7EWirbelwind_a23d.html" title="User:Wirbelwind">Wirbelwind</a> 21:56, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
