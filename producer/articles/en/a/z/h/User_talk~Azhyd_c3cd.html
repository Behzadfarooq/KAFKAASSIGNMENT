<p>Hi, I see that you edited <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_constant.html" title="Physical constant">physical constant</a> recently. I had a question about that. The edit history comment for your major edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Physical_constant&amp;diff=4535798&amp;oldid=4535769" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Physical_constant&amp;diff=4535798&amp;oldid=4535769" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> says "reorder the constants - add a few constants and equations - fix some constants". Can you clarify what you mean by "fix some constants"? Which ones were fixed? Also, which ones were added? I looked at the diff but it's not easy to see what changed. One suggestion I would make is to separate major revisions into a series of smaller ones. For example, change numerical values in one step, add more constants in another, redo layout in another, etc. Thanks for your work on Wikipedia!

<p>Hi, it's cool that you've taken up the banner on fish taxa! (I have a beetle book out of the library instead, so am temporarily redirected). It would be nice to have a sentence or two describing genera in plain English; one of the reasons we often link from family direct to species is that there isn't much to say about the genera, they're just byproducts of classification rules. The English info also prevents reader disappointment, who click on the link but don't get an explanation of what the subject is all about. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 00:24, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi from me too, and a welcome from me, too, to the unequal battle to get the fish pages sorted out. Just a note of explanation of why I reverted a rename that you did on <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Cod_09bc.html" title="Murray Cod">Murray Cod</a> - our usual rule is that if a species has a widely used common name, we use that as the title of the article rather than the systematic name.

<dd>Please stop modifying taxoboxes until we have a chance to talk things out. You are compressing things too much. {{Taxobox_begin_animalia}} was the first compression i have serious reservations about, but i have reservations about others, and you are continuing to make more compressions. These compressed templates make taxoboxes less flexible, or require a larger variety of templates to maintain the level of flexibility. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> 22:10, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found the taxobox on <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salmonidae.html" title="Salmonidae">Salmonidae</a>, I think I like it as it is even more flexible than the older taxobox with messages like {{regnum}} that I introduced. I am experimenting, in stead of Kingdom you can put in there the regnum message; and it does work nicely. It is also a good vehicle to export taxoboxes to other wikipedia's. I think I really like it. Would it be possible to add two parameters to the taxon: "taxon" and "taxonname". This would reduce the number of needed messages even further. No need for a message for every taxon.. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerardM_80cb.html" title="User:GerardM">GerardM</a> 22:20, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gerard - Most of what Azhyd has done on <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salmonidae.html" title="Salmonidae">Salmonidae</a> was what others (mostly myself) have created and put through peer review on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_7339.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tree of Life">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tree of Life</a>.

<dd>... as you can see from the previous message, there is some controversy about my changes (that are still somehow experimental and I commit myself to fix them if there is some problem. And up to now I haven't found taxoboxes out of the range of the templates I've created.). To answer <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> reservation, I'm stopping now to make more modifications to taxoboxes but I just simplified the set of templates I am using. Do you mean something like {{Taxobox_entry | taxonname = {{classis}} | taxon = ...}}&#160;? that would indeed reduce the number of templates to maintain but maybe a bit too verbose (it's also nice to have short taxoboxes, there are much faster/easier to edit). <a href="../../../a/z/h/User%7EAzhyd_38f3.html" title="User:Azhyd">Azhyd</a> 22:38, Aug 4, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some of my concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>{{Taxobox_begin_animalia}} is rigid. It either does or does not have a taxobox entry for Domain. sometimes it's good to have Domain, usually it's just extraneous and should be left out. Using {{Taxobox_domain_entry}} and {{Taxobox_regnum_entry}} as before allows the flexibility.</li>
<li>Removing {{Taxobox_genus_entry}} and {{Taxobox_species_entry}} so that {{Taxobox_binomial_name_simple}} or {{Taxobox_binomial_name}} perform those functions as well as the binomial name section mean that there can be no discrepancy between them. However, it means having to have yet another set of endings for when you have a subgenus and another for when you have a subspecies and another for when you have both a ubgenus and a subspecies. Keeping the function of the classification section and the binomial/trinomial section separate allows more flexibility with fewer templates in our bag of tricks.</li>
</ul>
<p>You've also made some changes to the taxobox format:</p>
<ul>
<li>The binomial name should be bold and italic, but not a link to anything. You've made the genus portion of the binomial a link.</li>
<li>For non-species level boxes, the subdivision section heading should be plural and a link. You've unlinked it in several cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things I like:</p>
<ul>
<li>You've done good to note that the templates now allow the pipe trick. I'm so glad that's been fixed.</li>
<li>{{Taxobox_image}} is great! Do make sure to comment out the template when there is no image, though, to prevent the blank space between the taxobox title and classfication section.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have mixed feelings about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combining {{Taxobox_begin}} and the Status templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whew! *grins* - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> 23:34, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The status and the begin are best left alone as the status is not universal; a rare plant in Europe can be a bad exote in the Americas. The protection status is therefore not universal. A second reason is that they are not used in many wikipedia's. I think it is best to have the infrastructure without the need to _have_ to use them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>ok I've taken good note of everything you said and I admit that it mostly makes sense. I'm still feeling (for the Taxobox_binomial_name template) that shorter taxoboxes are much easier to deal with. I'll remove the "begin_status" templates and I will comment the empty image templates. I also don't agree that the title for subdivision section should be a link, after all the entries like "Kingdom", "Class", ... are not links. If somebody wants more information on Scientific Classification the link is already in the box... too many links are distracting imho. Btw I am also working on a html page with javascript (outside wikipedia but self-contained) that allows easy creation of taxoboxes... <a href="../../../a/z/h/User%7EAzhyd_38f3.html" title="User:Azhyd">Azhyd</a> 16:03, Aug 5, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I think your spirit and energy are good and that you should continue to work to improve the taxoboxes. However, don't just come up with a change and start implementing it on the articles. Bring it to the ToL talk page and show off your work. your changes may insppire the rest of us to think differently and come up with even more changes, or we may have some constructive criticism that will help you improve your work. Good luck with the taxobox creator. I'd love to see it when you've got it going. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> 16:42, 5 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ok the problem with the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_65b4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life">Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life</a> page (that I checked at first) is not helpful on which templates to use and the talk page is simply impossible to read&#160;:)... Anyway here is an update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxobox_begin_"status" templates have been removed</li>
<li>Taxobox_section_image will be phased out and replaced by Taxobox_image (commented if empty)</li>
<li>I'm still conviced that Taxobox_animalia &amp; co are a good idea (replace two long template lines by a short one)</li>
<li>I still think that Taxobox_binomial_name is a good idea (replace three templates lines by one and remove duplicate entries). If there is a need for a discrepancy (which is rare), it's always possible to detail the taxobox by hand; this is similar to the begin_animalia problem; imho if templates are good for 99% of pages then there are useful. The Taxobox_binomial_name template still need to be fixed to remove the link in binomial name that you noticed.</li>
<li>I think that the Taxobox_end_placement template is not needed and just clutter.</li>

<dd>We haven't "officially" rolled out the new templates. We're still working out the kinks, which is why you didn't see anything on the Project's page about them. It's not reasonable to expect you to read all of the talk, but there are certaily some relevant discussions going on regarding taxoboxes you should join. I think it's a good idea if you do, so that you can work with us instead of off on your own, making decision that might not align with the Project. Also - working with us on ToL you have a greater chance of changing our minds than if you are working independantly without communicating with us.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for your wanting to keep various "compressions", think of each portion of the taxobox as parts of a train. Each is coupled to the one before, but should be able to have other sections put inbetween them. For instance, some taxoboxes have a range map section after the binomial section. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> 17:47, 5 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Azhyd, while your work on the taxoboxes is appreciated, please slow down and be more careful in what you are changing. As to Taxobox_end_placement, it should be up to all of us to decide its use, but in any case it is currently being used on species pages and not on higher ranks. This mixed standard is worse than both using it and not using it, and has already spread so quickly it will be difficult to fix.

<p><i>You recently recently removed links from taxobox subdivision sections (<a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymenostome.html" title="Hymenostome">Hymenostome</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinophyceae.html" title="Dinophyceae">Dinophyceae</a> for e.g.).

Doesn't seem a good reason for me. <a href="../../../a/z/h/User%7EAzhyd_38f3.html" title="User:Azhyd">Azhyd</a> 19:55, Aug 14, 2004 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>For the most part I didn't manually clear links - I was copying lists from older versions of the page to fix redirects and get rid of bullets. But in cases like hymenostome, they're blank because the groups are small and technical, so are unlikely to have anything written about them that wouldn't fit better on the parent's page. Stubs could be created, but the taxonomy of protists is still unusually unstable, and I don't want to encourage creating empty pages if they're as likely to be obsoleted as filled. That's also why the boxes say "typical orders."</p>
<p>The Dinophyceae are a special case - the classification has already been contradicted by genetic studies, and is listed mainly because it's the most recent scheme. That's why its not in the taxobox. Not many people have taken any interest in the protists beyond their taxoboxes, but if one of the related pages does get created, it shouldn't be hard to link to it after the fact.</p>
<p>In short: in cases where the taxonomy varies, pages that are unlikely to have any content don't need to be linked. Does that sound fair? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Grosse_d1d0.html" title="User:Josh Grosse">Josh</a> 20:25, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>sounds completely reasonable.

<p>I also appreciate the work you are doing on updating the taxoboxes. However, I am not sure we should be redirecting articles to categories (as happened at Whiptail lizards. If a subject is big enough to warrant a category, it will warrant an article too. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 07:47, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also thought that it might be controversial. But from a conceptual point of view, in my opinion, a category and the corresponding article should be fused... Anyway this was intended to be a temporary solution since there is no article at the moment. <a href="../../../a/z/h/User%7EAzhyd_38f3.html" title="User:Azhyd">Azhyd</a> 16:51, Aug 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for all the good work you've done especially on taxoboxes. One query, though. As you know, all/almost all bird taxon articles have a taxobox, even when the group is only part of a family, so I'm not sure why you have removedthe box from this article. If the concern is that there are parts of the family not included, why not just add ...other genera...?</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallpox.html" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> article was hit by a vandal 212.135.1.83 on 21 Feb 2005. The vandalism was evidently generally undiscovered by subsequent users, including myself. However, I finally read all the way through it today and caught the problems. Rather than simply revert, as others had made additions, I printed a copy dated Feb 12th and blocked the information back in, with some copy editing. As you had edited the article since that date, please look it over and make any appropriate changes.
