	    <p>Curious as always about the origin of the stories, I found that the Angel named in the Book of Tobit was named Raphael, not Azrael. Raphael impersonated the human Azariah who was the son of Annias the Great. Azariah does translate as "Help of God" though, using the "Yah" suffix for God instead of the "El" one, but he was a mortal and there was no Angel of Death at all in the story. Raphael came to heal the family of vexations that had plagued them. Needless to say, I wonder who said: "Azrael was the Angel of Death named in the Book of Tobit". Wonders never cease. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinth_Scribe_82a4.html" title="User:Ninth Scribe">Ninth Scribe</a> 20:44, 9 April 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed -- Tobit includes no mention of Azrael. I'm familiar with much religious myth, including the "seven handfuls" tale and the story about Azrael sneaking into Hell periodically to rescue mistakenly-damned souls -- but I've never before seen an allegation that he was associated with Tobias/Tobit. The reference should be removed, unless someone can provide specific citation for its inclusion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.218.67.134 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.218.67.134.html" title="User talk:24.218.67.134">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.218.67.134_0a2b.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.218.67.134">contribs</a>) 06:22, 26 June 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>"...He is said to reside in the 3rd Heaven and possesses 70,000 feet and 4,000 wings, while his body is provided with as many eyes and tongues as there are men in the world." <b>Where is that said? Islam, Bible, Torah??</b>.</p>
<p>This article (especially the introduction) is not accurate. In Islam, although comonly known as Azrael, none of the, relied upon, Islamic references (<a href="../../../q/u/r/Quran.html" title="Quran">Quran</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunnah.html" title="Sunnah">Sunnah</a> of the prophet) mention the angel of death by this name. It is simply mentioned as the <b>The Angel of Death</b>:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Say: "The Angel of Death, put in charge of you, will (duly) take your souls then shall ye be brought back to your Lord."</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– <cite style="font-style:normal;">Sura: 32, verse: 11</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name Azrael is very commonly given to the angel of death in the Islamic world (but not in scholarly work). Basically, some narations mention this name, but it is not agreed on (and is not even a subject of debate) by Muslim scholars.</p>
<p>In Islam, the angel of death is the angel responsible for taking souls out of bodies at the time of death. In <a href="../../../t/a/f/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">tafsir</a> <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Kathir_c2b2.html" title="Ibn Kathir">Ibn Kathir</a>, the angel of death (says Ibn Kathir) has aids (other angels) that take the soul out of the dying body. This soul is then handled by the angel of death. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 137.205.33.220 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.205.33.220_c2cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.205.33.220">contribs</a>) 14:11, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd><i>"...He is said to reside in the 3rd Heaven and possesses 70,000 feet and 4,000 wings, while his body is provided with as many eyes and tongues as there are men in the world."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This narration has caused a dispute between the Shiite and Sunni scholars, courtesy of Ka'abul Ahbar. Transmission of the verse differs, but I'll quote here from Qisas al'Anbiya:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kaab said: "As for the Angel of Death, his name is Azrael and his abode is in the heaven of this Earth. God created for him the same number of helpers as those who shall taste death. His legs are on the borders of the seventh and lowest Earth, his head is in the seventh and highest heaven at the last partition and his face is turned toward the Preserved Tablet. He has three hundred and sixty eyes, in each of which are three eyes. He has three hundred and sixty tongues, in each of which are three tongues...." yadda yadda.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The description about his body being covered with eyes comes from Avodah Zarah 20b:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is said regarding the Angel of Death that he is full of eyes. When a sick person is about to die, he stands above his head with his sword drawn and a drop of poison hanging from the tip. When the sick person sees him, he trembles and opens his mouth [in terror]. He then drops the poison into his [victim’s] mouth (Avodah Zarah 20b].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In this story, however, the name Azrael is not used. Jewish scholars identify the name of this Angel of Death as Samael (Hebrew = poison of God).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Imagine for a moment that several stories (say nine) were represented by moving trains and they each collided at different points along their journeys. It's kind of hard to tell what fragment came from which train but if you have an eye for detail, it's not impossible. It's like a jig saw puzzle. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinth_Scribe_82a4.html" title="User:Ninth Scribe">Ninth Scribe</a> 16:17, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In Muslim tradition, Azrael is forever writing in a large book and forever erasing what he writes; what he writes is the name of a man at birth, and what he erases is that said name at death. Also, in Islamic legend, God is said to have sent out four angels, Michael, Gabriel, Israfel, and Azrael, on a mission to retrieve seven handfuls of earth for the creation of Adam. Michael, Gabriel, and Israfel returned to God empty-handed, but the persistent Azrael had succeeded in wrestling soil away from the earth. For accomplishing this feat, he was appointed as the angel of death with the task of separating human souls from their bodies.</p>

<p>In standard Arabic transliteration it is `IzrA'Il or `Izraa'iil Chambers English dictionary gives Azrael, but it doesn't seem to be in the Oxford English Dictionary. The external link added in this article (songofazrael)is an advertisement for their site. This is the last time I would use Wikipedia as I found it biased and inaccurate.</p>
<p><b>Rebuttal</b>: <i>Of course an unidentified 'opinion' is hardly unbiased. As for your accusation that Song of Azrael uses Wikipedia to 'advertise'... wouldn't they have to be 'selling' something to do that? Song of Azrael is not a commercial website and I don't see why the external link for Song of Azrael should not be included, considering the fact that some of the information on Wikipedia's Azrael page was obtained from it.</i> <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinth_Scribe_82a4.html" title="User:Ninth Scribe">Ninth Scribe</a> 16:58, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I did some researching and from what I can gather Azrael and Azriel are not the same angel, but the similar names make for some intense confuzzlement (confusion).</p>
<p>Azrael is the angel of death with black hair and a black cloak whose light radiates inward rather than outward and who can be seen in the blackest part of the shadow cast by the four archangels when they stand at their comapss points. He is also known as the archangel of spirit. He is present at birth and writes the name of the person in his book and erases it upon death. At death he guides a soul through the transformation.</p>
<p>Azriel is the (an?) angel of destruction. Doing more research on him even now, but if someone else has made these findings and thinks it a good turn to fix the page then I encourage them to do so. Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Actually there has been quite a lot of confusion. Azrael is an unorthodox varient transliteration of the proper, Azriel.</p>
<p>Varient transliterations are too numerous to mention here, but due to the varients used, and sloppiness on the part of translators, he was quite often confused with the angels Azael and Azazel. As you can see from the top of this page, he was even confused with Azariah, the mortal son of Annias in the Book of Tobit. Call it a slip of the pen, but it's happened frequently and is very annoying.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinth_Scribe_82a4.html" title="User:Ninth Scribe">Ninth Scribe</a> 17:17, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/z/r/Talk%7EAzrael_7f8b.html" title="Edit section: Azrael's Story in the Qur'an?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Azrael's Story in the Qur'an?</span></h2>
<p><i>"Azrael is also portrayed as the wisest or cleverest of the archangels. One story in the Qur'an has that God asked the four archangels (Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Azrael) to gather seven handfuls of dirt from the base of the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden. They realized that only three of them would be able to present the Lord with two handfuls, while the last would only bring one handful. Michael and Uriel immediately began to argue over which of them would carry two handfuls and which would carry only one. Gabriel tried to step in as a mediator, but eventually fell in with the argument. While they were thus distracted, Azrael snuck away and gathered all seven handfuls of dirt by himself, putting them in a bag and taking them to God alone."</i></p>
<p>I have never heard of this story. I think you are confusing religions. There is little mention of the 'Tree of Life' in Islam anyways, and the story of creation of man isn't related to it. I have also never heard a story including Uriel in islamic tradition: what is his arabic equivalent?</p>
<p><br />
The actual story, which comes from authentic Hadith, not Qur'an, is as follows:</p>
<p>God asks Mikhael (Micheal) to go down to earth and get some clay/earth/mud. Micheal goes and asks the earth for some, but it refuses, saying "I seek refuge in God". Since it used God's name, Michael goes back empty handed. God then asks Jibreel (Gabriel), and the same thing happens. Finally God asks 'Uzra'el (angel of death) and he goes to earth and asks it for clay. Again it refuses, and seeks refuge in God's name, but Uzrael replies "I seek refuge from coming back empty handed to God", and her rips a piece of earth and returns it to God.</p>
<p>Thats the jist of things</p>
