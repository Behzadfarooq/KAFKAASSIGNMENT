<p>Hakim was released by the Lions in <a href="../../../a/p/r/April.html" title="April">April</a> of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. He received interest from multiple teams before and on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_15.html" title="June 15">June 15</a> it was believed he had signed with the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Chiefs_89f3.html" title="Kansas City Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>. The move would have reunited him with former Rams head coach <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Vermeil_0808.html" title="Dick Vermeil">Dick Vermeil</a>. However, some provisions in the contracts caused the league to void the deal, and Hakim and Vermeil decided it would be best if he did not join the team. Hakim signed a one-year deal with the New Orleans Saints on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_19.html" title="June 19">June 19</a>.</p>
<p>During the season, Hakim was the team's third best receiver and finished with 34 catches for 489 yards and two touchdowns. He set a career high with nine kickoff returns, while his punt return average was the lowest of his career at just 7.6 yards.</p>

<p>Despite receiving some interest in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> offseason, Hakim remained unsigned until the regular season began. He signed a one-year deal to return to the Lions in 2006, despite new head coach <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Marinelli_93ac.html" title="Rod Marinelli">Rod Marinelli</a> in charge. Not all was unfamiliar to Hakim, however, as this time around with the Lions he would be working with former Rams offensive coordinator and head coach <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Martz_7eab.html" title="Mike Martz">Mike Martz</a>, who was now the offensive coordinator in Detroit.</p>
<p>Hakim's second tenure with the Lions was not nearly as productive or long as the first. In six games with the team, he caught just 17 passes for 147 yards. He was eventually released on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">October 30</a>, and remained unsigned until joining the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_Chargers_92bd.html" title="San Diego Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_14.html" title="December 14">December 14</a> after wide receiver <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Floyd_e3ee.html" title="Malcolm Floyd">Malcolm Floyd</a> was placed on Injured Reserve. Hakim was inactive for all three games as a Charger, resulting in the first season of his professional career in which he did not score a touchdown.</p>

<p>After his contract expired following the 2006 season, Hakim once again because a free agent. He received little interest on the open market, but on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a> he signed a one-year contract with the Miami Dolphins. the move reunited him with new Dolphins head coach <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cam_Cameron_2bd7.html" title="Cam Cameron">Cam Cameron</a>, who was offensive coordinator in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_36a0.html" title="San Diego">San Diego</a> the previous season.
