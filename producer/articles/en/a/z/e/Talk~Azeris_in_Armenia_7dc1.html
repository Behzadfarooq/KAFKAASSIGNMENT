<p>Recently, <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">User:Parishan</a> has added a large amount of text to this article that supports a clear Azerbaijani point of view.

<dd>Aivazovsky, I've made some corrections to your edits. Quite frankly, I don't see anything wrong with it - I came up with a relatively concise and informative article based on 21 sources, none of which were Azeri or Armenian. You've deleted at least three of them, and this is already unacceptable.</dd>
<dd>(1) The Russian administrative unit called <i>губерния</i> / <i>gubernia</i> is normally translated into English as 'governorate'. See: <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_divisions_of_Russia_in_1744-1764_0b95.html" title="Administrative divisions of Russia in 1744-1764">Administrative divisions of Russia in 1744-1764</a>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia uses the term <i><a href="../../../g/u/b/Guberniya.html" title="Guberniya">guberniya</a></i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(2) <i>Due to conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan during the early 20th century, Armenia's Azerbaijani minority, much like Azerbaijan's Armenian minority diminished greatly</i> - incorrect statement. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a> these was neither Armenia, nor Azerbaijan. I'm not sure how wise it is to call it a conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. On the other hand, the previous statement about marginalization and discrimination was more than appropriate since it was a direct quote from a neutral source.
<dl>
<dd>No, we need to reword this to make it balanced. If there was an article on Armenians in Azerbaijan, then I'm sure Azeri editors would demand the same thing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The comment about Azerbaijan's Armenian community is unnecessary and needs to be taken out - we are not compare-and-contrasting here; the only time I mentioned it was while addressing the question of autonomy (it is significant in light of Soviet Union's policy towards ethnic minorities), which you for some reason deleted and which now goes back into the article.
<dl>
<dd>When discussing ethnic autonomy, you were also making a very clear political statement.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(3) What I found outrageous
<dl>
<dd>No, don't accuse my actions as being "outrageous" when you go off and edit a sensitive topic at a time of mediation. You should have known better. You were being completely irresponsible.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>...is you removing a four-sourced statement about Muslim massacres in Armenia
<dl>
<dd>That's because those massacres occured in what is now eastern Turkey during the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish-Armenian_War_f3c5.html" title="Turkish-Armenian War">Turkish-Armenian War</a> - that is a Turkish-Armenian issue, not an Azeri-Armenian issue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>...and replacing it with a statement about the Armenian Genocide - something completely irrelevant in this context.
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't say so, even de Waal states that Armenian refugees from Eastern Anatolia moved to Armenia. This increased the number of Armenians in that region.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>First of all, I don't see a point in bringing up examples of Armenian victimization (genocide, khachkar issue, etc.) in every single Azeri-related article; it's just getting annoying.
<dl>
<dd>What about examples of Azeri victimization? What about "marginalization, discrimination, mass and often forcible migrations"?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Besides you write: <i>massacres of Muslims in Armenia had nothing to do with the Armenian-Azeri conflict. They were a result of the Turkish-Armenian War</i> yet you shove a completely offtopic (if one looks at it from your perspective) sentence about the Armenian Genocide instead. Second of all, it does not matter what those massacres were a result of. The fact is, they did happen, they did affect the Azeris in Armenia, and they were the greatest turning point in the history of that community. So back in goes replacing the Armenian Genocide statement.
<dl>
<dd>I'm not denying that they didn't happen, but rather that they had more of an effect on the Turkish-Armenian war and Turkish-Armenian relations than on Azeri-Armenian relations.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I guess that's it, I'm okay with the rest of your edits. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 01:02, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(1) Wikipedia does use the term <a href="../../../g/u/b/Guberniya.html" title="Guberniya">guberniya</a>, but all the units are listed as governorates, not guberniyas:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkhangelsk_Governorate_3f46.html" title="Arkhangelsk Governorate">Arkhangelsk Governorate</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../c/o/u/Courland_Governorate_9c39.html" title="Courland Governorate">Courland Governorate</a> and so on.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>(2) The massacres did not only happen in Turkish Armenia. You should have read the sources before deleting them: they mention Erivan (the Russian source) and Zangezur (de Waal).</dd>
<dd>(3) Like I said, the part about marginalization and discrimination is a direct quote from Thomas de Waal; I didn't make it up or rephrased it in any way. If I were to mention the victimization of Azeris in every article possible, 90% of Armenia-related articles would have been swarming with that info, since you can tie it to pretty much everything. However understanding the touchiness of the subject and the given mediation, I'm not attempting to go beyond the reasonable limit, and that is, beyond mentioning the massacre of Azeris in Armenia at least in the matter-of-course 'Azeris in Armenia' article. And even that you seem to have a problem with. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 01:48, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't have an issue about mentioning massacres, but what frustrates me is the fact that, during mediation, you would go ahead and add all of this information to this article without consulting anybody first. Especially in regards to the period of brief independence and Sovietization, which are grossly under-researched, we should be extremely careful. It's almost as if you <i>want</i> to provoke an edit war. -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 01:59, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Yet by the twentieth century the Azerbaijanis people, who had lived in Eastern Armenia for centuries, had become its silent guests, marginalized and discriminated against. The Armenians asserted their right to their homeland at the expense of these people. In 1918 – 1920, tens of thousands Azerbaijanis were expelled from Zangezur. In 1940s, tens of thousands more were deported to Azerbaijan to make way for incoming Armenian immigrants from Diaspora. The last cleansing, in 1988 – 1989, got rid of the rest</i>.</dd>

<dd>Aivazovsky, if there's mediation in process, it doesn't mean you can take sourced facts out of articles and replace them with irrelevant statements that benefit "crucial" <i>Armenian</i> issues. If it was the case of me rephrasing or rewording the information provided in the sources, I would agree with you on all of your points. However all the facts are strictly taken from the neutral sources, some being direct quotes, and some summaries. From what I understand, your reference to the arbitration page is the only argument you have left, which is why I strongly recommend that we go back to the blended version of our edits (the one prior to your reverting). <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 08:46, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If there is mediation, you will probably be able to explain what Russian Armenia has to do with it? Ardahan with its 75,000 Muslim was lost to Turkey, Kagisman with its 34,000 Muslim population was lost to Turkey, Kars with its 64,000 Muslim population was lost to Turkey, Nakhichevan with its 81,000 was lost to Azerbaijan, much like Qazakh with 30,000 Muslims. Oh I forgot Olti, with its 27,000 Muslim population and Surmalu with its 71,000 Muslim population both to Turkey. As for Yerevan, those were the relative values of the population, when the total population of Yerevan was insignificantly low since Shah Abbas depopulation it never returned in its previous state. In 1913 the entire population was of 30,000 people. Again, I am pleased (not) to see Grandmaster silence there too. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 14:16, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fadix, there is reference to George Bournoutian presented. And Erivan khanate and later governorate had well defined borders. This has most to do with Russian Armenia, because "Azeris in Armenia" means the populus in modern Republic of Armenia (there is no other Armenia acknowledged), which is the territory of Erivan governorate minus Nakhchivan, plus Zangezur and part of Kazakh Uyezd of the former Elisavetpol governorate. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 18:21, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This has nothing to do with Azeris in Armenia. Most Tartar population decline have to do with territorial loss which has nothing to do with emmigration. And your answer doesn't answer my point at all, you are actually confirming it. Since those statistics have to do with lands which are now outside of the bounderies of the republic of Armenia, it is irrelevent filling of the article. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 23:05, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Qazakh was not part of Erivan guberniya, and we have statistics for each uyezd from Brokhauz. Azeris were a majority in Erivan uyezd and the town of Erivan, which indeed had population of 30 000 at the time. Muslim population desappeared completely from that area. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 18:23, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is not accurate, part of Kazakh was actually included, it was later lost. As for the population, this is again not accurate. First, the Azeri were not a plurality there, the punching card census system to falicitate things have dumped Kurds and Tartars according to religion and dumped them as Tartars, as religion and listed language were the two predictators used. There were basically 48% Armenians, 49% Muslim and 3% other groups, which included Russians, Assyrians etc. The Muslim population was actually less than 15,000. The city population records still did provide data for various Muslim population years later. Your claims are simply original research. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 23:05, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fadix, Kazakh uyezd was part of Elisavetpol governorate, it was never part of Erivan governorate. The territories, as you call "lost to" (and I call "liberated by") Turkey were actually Kars governorate (Karsskaya guberniya) not Erivan governorate. And as you know, Bournoutian mentioned specifically Erivan, not Kars and not Elisavetpol, and said specifically, it's 80% Muslims and 20% Christians (Armenians). The situation is 99% Armenians and 0% Muslims Azeris and Muslim Kurds, says that there was some heavy ethnic cleansing going on in Erivan governorate territory over the past century or so. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 00:21, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fadix, the source states that "in 1918 – 1920, tens of thousands Azerbaijanis were expelled from Zangezur." You mean you don't consider Zangezur part of Armenia? Besides, the Russian source that I've provided (the one deleted by Aivazovsky) said "...pogroms in Kars Province <i>and</i> Erivan Governorate." You also claim that Azeris didn't form the majority in Erivan without even familiarizing yourself with the source (<i>The Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopaedia</i>), which clearly indicates: <i>The population of Erivan district</i> ("uyezd") <i>grouped in 16 rural communities and 205 villages consists of 53.5% Aderbeijani Tatars, 37% Armenians, 8% Kurds, 1% Assyrians and about 0.5% Russians.</i> As you see, the source makes a clear distinction between Azeris and Kurds and doesn't "dump" one into another. Azeris <i>were</i> the majority in the city of Erivan. Please read the sources more carefully and don't be making inadequate assumptions. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 02:01, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not exactly, the relative figures are according to the punching census figure drawn, it was somewhere 29 thousand etc. according to this punching system. While Kurds were incorporated, it was not always true, since Kurds have various dialects, and household language and mainly religion sometimes, in the few % range in many regions, to simplify things population were included simply by region. Including Kazakh and the other places I have included, it amount to about slightly over 400,000 Muslims. The figure you provide is not supported by the official census, and most Muslim loss is due to territorial amputation. Indeed there were refugees from Zankezur, Zankezur was the exception to the rule. The homogenity in Armenia is not due to Muslim refugees, but rather to territorial emputation and the Armenian refugee crises, mostly those from the Ottoman Empire. This is covered with a dozen of League of nations publications. There is not a single such publication about any Tartar refugee crises. Kars province is mentioned yes! Doesn't change the fact that those are totally irrelevent here. Dumping various statistics has little revency with the subject here. Zankezur does have a place, that is about all. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 03:39, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Amazing how you state things without having a single source to back them up, merely based on your inapt assumptions. (1) According to the official census of <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a>, there were 362,565 Muslims in Erivan Governorate <i>alone</i>.<a href="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/119/119475.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/119/119475.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Of those, 313,176 were Azeris and 49,389 were Kurds. That is, without counting parts of Azeri-dominated Zangezur, Gazakh and Borchali which were later incorporated into Armenia; and most imporantly - <b>without Kars</b>, which had another 147,183 Muslims (63,547 Turks, 42,968 Kurds, 29,879 Karapapaks, 8,442 Turkmen and 2,347 Azeris).<a href="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/049/49280.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/049/49280.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Erivan Governorate was 43.6% Muslim, of which 37.7% were Azeris. Kars Province was 50,6% Muslim. Erivan had <b>three times</b> as many Muslims, as Kars; so your argument about low figures on Muslims due to territorial losses is completely incorrect and made up. (2) Altogether there were <b>509,748</b> Muslims in these two provinces, <i>not counting</i> Zangezur, Gazakh and Borchali ("slightly over 400,000" my foot). And of course, by <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> this figure was way higher due to population growth. (3) The massacres in Erivan are covered by another neutral source, which Aivazovsky also deleted, apparently because it didn't go well with his POV: <a href="http://safety.spbstu.ru/book/hrono/hrono/sobyt/1920arm.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://safety.spbstu.ru/book/hrono/hrono/sobyt/1920arm.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Having said that, I strongly urge you to stop coming up with "facts" off the top of your head. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 05:49, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have neutral sources? Well I have Turkish sources for it. Yusuf Kemel Tengirsenk, the foreign minister of Ankara government at the time said: “…the two sides are murdering one another.”(And I have various, various sources on the massacre and expulsion of the Armenians during this period, in Nakhichevan, NK etc.) I will not cover all the inaccuracies above, but, just to mention, for example that East Kars was sliced between Erivan governate and the government of Tiflis, the province was the general term. In round numbers about half of Kars Muslim population were living there and the figures of those in the Erivan governate were clearly including those Muslim. The punching card system allowed for records of 1. Religion, 2. of household language. There is even an article on Wikipedia about that. Before accusing me of making up things, (and I won’t lower myself to the level of some by reporting you for that) you should probably read what I wrote above another time. I did not say that Kurds were not counted, I said that in some regions where a group of Muslim were a slight minority, according to the two prerequisite, they were included with the majority Muslims. In Erivan town, there was a disproportion between Tartar population and Kurds. The Kurds were in their every day life speaking Tartar Turkic, and practicing the same religion. In that town Muslim had acquired great prosperity, and commerce language for the Kurds was Turkish. So, according to the punching card system questionnaire, those Kurds were classified as Tartars. The town of Yerevan, with its 29 thousand or something, with its Muslim population of less than 15,000, those Muslim was not much affected, in fact, there was an increase of population. It was the absolute number of Armenians which increased at that time, not the Muslim decline.</p>
<p>The territorial lost, as I have enumerated above, would explain alone most of the recorded loss of population. Reread one more time my list, and the governate did include those. Either peripherial zone. Either slice, Zankezur was indeed the exception and indeed recorded. But Nakhichevan Armenians had the same exact fate.</p>
<p>Now, this article is about the Azeri in the republic of Armenia, not some lands which are not included. Shusha had a statistic attached to it, NK, Adil had attached a statistic, and this has a statistic. According to Ottoman records, up to the 1860s, Armenians were constituting a majority in Anatolia, do you find a large junk of statistics in the article about Armenians in Turkey? And no, it was not about few hundred thousands, as the records of the time were of 2 million. Dumping various such statistics under the alleged claim that the article is about Azeri in Armenia is called POV pushing, as various such articles have had the same fate. What do you say that from the same token, I cover history a little deeper since the Khans oppressions and evacuations of the Armenian population from the region? Oh and, your foot is veryy well where it is, keep it down, don't put it in your mouth. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 14:39, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Parishan provided reliable statistic info from Russian Brokhauz encyclopedia, while you quoted no sources. Now please tell me how many of 362,565 Muslims of Erivan gubernia lived in the areas that became part of Turkey and Azerbaijan and how many lived in Zangezur and other areas that became part of Armenia? I think we can find that statistic and make a calculation. Kars oblast was not part of Erivan gubernia, while Nakhichevan was. So if we deduct the Muslim population of Nakhichevan and add the Muslim population of Zangezur, we will get an accurate picture. We know that there were only 78,228 Azerbaijanis left in Armenia by 1926. Also, what happened to 15 000 Muslim population of Erivan? Soviet Yerevan had no significant Muslim population, and 5 out of 6 mosques were pulled down, the last one in 1990, according to de Waal. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 19:59, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Look, you guys have only questioned two of the area's I have cited, make the count, go ahead, do the count and compare it yourself. Zankezur is the only area, and indeed documented in records including British, the rest is not even notable. Parishan has done nothing such as you claim. Erivan Gubernia is not the republic of Armenia, the peripherial zones were still not even clearly defined, and it was in those same zone that the propertion of Muslim was the highest. You ask what happened of the 15,000 Muslims. Well, check the population of Muslim in Yerevan city from the first Armenia SSR census. The relative figure of Muslim did decrease very significantly indeed, but Armenia did recieve more refugees than the entire Muslim population living there. Many Muslim left the place very soon when the Ottoman Empire cut the supplies and left the place into total starvation, this is recorded in German archives.</dd>

No one cares how many Armenians there were in the Ottoman Empire or what the khans did in Shusha in the 18th century. If you have neutral sources which state that Muslims weren't massacred and just walked away from Armenia; or sources that prove the results of the 1897 Russian population census wrong, bring them on.

<p>Let repeat this again. From the US archives, Record Group 256, Inquiry no. 11, from the public domain, not some obscure source. Surmalu 71,000 Muslims, Ardahan, 75,000 Muslims, Olti 27,000 Muslims, Kaghistan 34,000, Kars 65,000, (again those with in Governate control, and if you still doubt E. was indeed within, check Britannica 1911). In fact, only Qazakh was not clearly defined (peripherial) so the figure comes from the Republic of Armenian archives. I haven’t also included some not much more defined regions like part of Sarur-Tarallagiaz. Oh and to finish, Nakhichevan. Clearly over 400,000 Muslim losses were due to land loss. Those are indeed sourced. If you think I am forging this out, US archive record does exist; it will be my pleasure to help you out by showing you how you could use the interloaning system to make such a request, it is as easy as a request from Bonn Centralarchiv. Even if you could slice the figure (400,000) by half, your assertion doesn’t make much sense.</p>
<p>-1 Armenia lost most of the lands where there was a substantial number of Muslim, rendering this throwing of statistics clearly misleading.</p>
<p>-2 The history section is a throwing of various statistics and has little to do with Azeri history in the republic of Armenia.</p>
<p>-3 The Yerevan town is only containing relative figure, which is totally misleading as even if assuming all those 49% were Azeri (impossible as there is no way that all the Muslims in Erivan were Tartars), it would represent about 14 thousand people. Statistics don’t show a decrease of Azeri population, but rather an increase of Armenian population. And as I repeated, the number of refugees the republic of Armenia received was amounting more than the total number of Muslims. While it was losing territories, it also in the same process received the influx of Armenians from those lost lands.</p>
<p>-4 There was indeed massacres and crimes, they were mostly recorded in Zankezur.</p>
<p>As for the result of the 1897 being wrong, stop putting words in my mouth, I am not saying they are wrong, I am saying that the punching card system was the punching card system, much like we have modern census here in Canada, there is an entry about the last census here in Canada. Check those who identify as Quebecer, as French Canadians etc., and compare them with the actual number of French Quebecers. Language affiliation and religion was the predicator in the Russian census, them being Tartar is an interpretation of that census. The Kurds have very ancient roots in Yerevan older than Tartars, and they were still living there during the Soviet times, yet the 1897 recorded Muslims as Turkic speaking Shiites, them being classified as Tartars is a position. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 21:18, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are not reading carefully what I am saying. Sources support the position exist, it does not give the right to mix them to build another position which does either not exist or is a fringe. We both know that claiming that Azeri were constiting 49% of the population in Yerevan is totally misleading. First because its total population was under 30,000, second because they were not classified as Azeri but Tartars, according to the household religion and language. And I told you check Wikipedia entry about 1897 census, it does say how it was processed. Furthermore, you totally ignored my point. Finding a source does not justify a statment of fact. It is contradicted by US official records, so obviously you can not present a statment of fact. Also, another mention, is that something could be very well sourced, it could just be irrelevent to include it in a given article since it could just not fit in that article. I also have sources about Armenians having all been killed or expelled, like those in Shushi <a href="http://www.books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0801487366&amp;id=2Plw98pTk5wC&amp;pg=RA1-PA57&amp;lpg=RA1-PA57&amp;ots=lgza9fKMJw&amp;dq=1918+armenian+tatar&amp;sig=Q74vlJVNzJ6RccjOUMUAfQb_8KQ#PRA1-PA51,M1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0801487366&amp;id=2Plw98pTk5wC&amp;pg=RA1-PA57&amp;lpg=RA1-PA57&amp;ots=lgza9fKMJw&amp;dq=1918+armenian+tatar&amp;sig=Q74vlJVNzJ6RccjOUMUAfQb_8KQ#PRA1-PA51,M1" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> it doesn't mean I can add them in irrevent articles.

<dd>Fadix, all you are expected to prove is that Azeris did not constitute 49% of Yerevan's population and that they weren't massacred in the regions other than Zangezur. So far, I have three sources backing up my point of you, and you have none (the U.S. archive one has nothing to do with what me and your other opponents are saying). Like I said, if you do not provide them and keep presenting your assumptions as a fact, the page will have to be restored back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Azeris_in_Armenia&amp;oldid=113203606" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Azeris_in_Armenia&amp;oldid=113203606" rel="nofollow">this version</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 02:46, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Where in the Russian records the term Azeri was used? Shiit Muslims who speak Tartars was how they were recorded. Not Azeris, all Muslims in Yerevan were NOT Azeris, you can not assume that. As for all being sourced, those are fringe positions. And no, I haven't said that Azeris were not massacred, what I said was that the loss of Tartar population was mostly due to land loss. Even Justin McCarthy in hiw work claims that the situation under which Armenia was, it lost 25% of its population, who died of war conditions. When the Turks cut the lines, the Armenian population was starving by tens of thousands and they had nowhere to go unlike the Tartars. There is a dozen of League of Nations publications and a book from its cofounder and Nobel Price, about the situation of Armenia. It was flauded by tens of thousands of Orphans comming from the Ottoman Empire. You have no notable source for massacres having happened besides Zankezur. Every other pieces where there was any significant Muslim population were actually lost with its Armenian population either killed or kicked out. And there actually are more notable work about this, the reports from German archives are abound.</dd>

<dd>Nakhichevan Armenians were brutally murdered when the Turkish army backed the Tartars, in Shushi, most of its Armenian population was mudered, the rest being kicked out, Nagorno Karabakh Armenian population faced a very brutal reaction from the Turkish army, in that army, there was many commanders who were responsable of the destruction of the Eastern Anatolian. Those are notable, published positions published in University presses around the US. Yet, do you see me or any Armenians injecting statistics and such events reglardless of how well it is sourced in irrelevent articles. Also, it is amazing that you do not see what is wrong in placing a relative figure of Muslim population, when in this case the relative figure is totally misleading as it represent less than 15 thousand people. If you want to expend this article, good, I do believe it needs expention, but do so by adding materials which have relevency. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 14:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The source doesn't call them "Shiit Muslims who speak Tartars"; it calls them "Azerbaijani Tatars" (<i>татары азербайджанские</i>) and it clearly distinguishes them from the Kurds by mentioning the latter separately. What other proof do you require? I agree with you that with the loss of Kars, Armenia's Muslim population descresed, <b>BUT</b>: we are not talking about Kars, and Kars was never part of Erivan Governorate, and I have no idea why you keep bringing up Kars. Let's leave Kars alone and focus on Erivan: how do you account for the decrease of Erivan Governorate's (not Kars'!) / Armenia's Azeri population from 313,176 in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a> to whatever tens of thousands there were left by <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>? Well, I have a neutral source that proves they were massacred: <a href="http://safety.spbstu.ru/book/hrono/hrono/sobyt/1920arm.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://safety.spbstu.ru/book/hrono/hrono/sobyt/1920arm.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and honestly I'm getting tired of restating this to you with each reply.

<dd>Eastern Kars was under Erivan Governorate, for the last time, check the online edition of Britannica 1911 for "Kars" <a href="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Kars,_Transcaucasia_(Province)" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Kars,_Transcaucasia_(Province)" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Not only Kars, in which there was a very significant number of Muslims, check all the lands I have cited. It amount to hundreds of thousands of Muslims. And no, I have never said there was no massacres, what I have said is that beside Zankezur, all the territory now being part of Armenia there was no significant Muslim massacres recorded, all the other territories where a significant massacres was reported are all outside of the frontiers of the republic of Armenia, its Armenian populations have found to have a harsher fate and this is recorded. And many Muslims did leave Armenia by choice, much like many Armenians did leave Azerbaijan by choice. You can not assume they did not do this, national affiliation is something that one can hardly control. To assume that most Tartar losses was due to massacres and eviction is original research. Substract the land loss and do compare the Muslim population and you'll see that much of the deficit is indeed du to land loss. Throwing numbers like this with a hidden meaning is actually original research. Lastly about Azerbaijani Tartars, I was talking about the way they were included in a group, check the Wikipedia entry about the census and you will see that nothing I have said was original research. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:20, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So you claim that when the sources say "massacres in Erivan Governorate" they only mean that little part of Eastern Kars (Surmali) that happened to be part of Erivan? You have no proof of that and besides, that can't be correct as in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a> Surmali's Azeri population constituted only 11.8% of Erivan Governorate's entire Azeri population. <a href="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/098/98265.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/098/98265.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> So what happened to 270,500 Azeris (that's what's remained after I "substact" and "compare the Muslim population") that lived outside of Zangezur and the Erivan part of Kars in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a> (and that probably doubled in population by <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>)? How is that close to 78,000 that were left there in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>? Do the math. And keep in mind that the latter includes Zangezur and that population growth among Azeris was pretty high back then. P.S. The Wikipedia article on the 1897 census doesn't say anything about Kurds being included into Azeris, so that argument is out. Azeris were the majority in Yerevan. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 00:04, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is original research. Evidences are not created by “what happened to them.” Neither could this justify dumping statistics. Again, you are not being accurate, read one more time the figures I have provided and subtract 78,000. And no, the Azeris were not constituting a majority in Yerevan during World War I, in fact not even according to the 1897. Census do not record ethnicity, with the punching card system they recorded language and religion. And this was what I told you to check in the 1897 census entry. There is no way that you will claim that all Muslims in Yerevan were Tartars ethnically. Beside even if that was true, fewer than 50% can hardly be classified as majority. Neither do we know if Catholic Armenians were included with Apostolic and not plainly foreigners like it was often the case, more particularly in the Ottoman Empire. The census represented the 1896/1897 population, during the same year many Armenians during the Hamidian massacres settled in Yerevan, also during the Adana massacre under threats that it would spread in the East. Less than 15 thousand Muslims in Yerevan was what was recorded added recorded as Azeri Tartars with the absolute figure I will not have any problem with it, the relative figure is totally misleading without absolute numbers. And that was easily reversed and only the Tartaro-Armenian conflict of 1905/1906 alone would have changed the demography of Yerevan like nothing when Armenians moved “inner.” <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:14, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there's enough evidence from the provided neutral sources (which I'm tired of including in my every message to you - and I think this is the last time I'm doing so) that the Azeri community suffered greatly from the massacres by the Armenians outside of Kars and outside of Zangezur, which led to the decline in population of Armenia's Azeri population. I'm not talking in terms of percentage, I'm talking in terms of <i>numbers</i>. No fast-growing community would diminish from almost 300,000 to some 78,000 within 30 years by natural causes, especially if a source clearly states that community experienced pogroms and massacres, i.e. that people from that community were killed en masse. So here's the deal: this is the source <a href="http://safety.spbstu.ru/book/hrono/hrono/sobyt/1920arm.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://safety.spbstu.ru/book/hrono/hrono/sobyt/1920arm.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>; go ahead and prove it wrong with another source, not with your assumptions.</dd>
<dd>Your claim that the population of Russia in 1897 was divided in the census in accordance with their religion is ridiculous: how could then they tell Russians from Ossetians, or Mordvins from the Chuvash? The source says "Aderbaijani Tatars - 49%" <a href="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/119/119478.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/119/119478.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. It does says 'Muslims', it doesn't say 'Kurds', it says 'Aderbaijani Tatars.' So yes, that <i>does</i> give me the right to claim that Azeris were the largest ethnic group in Yerevan at the time. And yes, judging from the source I <i>can</i> state that they were the only significant ethnic group that adhered to Islam in that city. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 05:46, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We're turning in circle. What neutral source? You are taking census statistics and then taking the 1926 and making a connection. Again, this connection is yours, it is called original research. I have never denied that Tartars were massacred, what I said was the there was no significant massacres recorded in the lands which now constitute the republic of Armenia. I have read the British dispaches, even the Turkish commanders report. They allude to Erzerum, Kars, Nakhichevan, Zankezur, Qazakh, later the conflict in Baku etc. But not anything significant in what now constitute the republic of Armenia. You post me some chronology table from a Russian site, first translate it, second post the source. Armenia was starving to death, there was more deaths in Armenia than there was Muslims living there. If you allude that most population deficit was due to massacres or eviction this is your original research. Before making such original research read the conditions of Alxendripole, and the blockage of supplies, following that many Muslims left. Armenians stayed, they had nowhere to go, they were stuck there. About census, look, I am not inventing anything. Ethnic qualifications have always been a problem including with current census. Armenians spoke a language that mostly only they spoke, and the Armenian Apostolic church was the Armenian Apostolic church. Kurds did speak Turkish and were Shiit Muslims. Check how many qualify themselves as French in Quebec. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 16:12, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The source says: <i>1920.09 <b>ARMENIA</b>. Massive pogroms of Muslims by Armenians in Kars Province and Erivan Governorate</i>. Another source: Andrew Andersen <a href="http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Armenia/turkarwar.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Armenia/turkarwar.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>: "some of Armenian regiments reportedly started performing ethnic cleansing in Kars and Yerevan districts that still remained under Armenian control." I hope this is enough evidence.</dd>
<dd>As for your claims about the 1897 census - sorry, you've presented no proof, so the info about Azeris forming the largest community in Yerevan will go back. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 22:10, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Kars, as I told, control in 1920, Governate. Reread what I have said, entirly my point, you have to document what was left after that as the republic, those were the dates that the 1918 republic still did not fell. As for 1897, read the entry last lines on language. If you don't find that too, well, the last thing that remains for me is to quote. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 22:44, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>In census summary tables, nationality was based on the declared mother language of respondents.</i> Just for you to understand what it means, is that in Cilicia for example, the mother thong of many Armenian community was "Turkish", they would have been classified as Turkish using the same standard. Add that, and the absolute numbers, and I will not have any problem with that part for neutrality, but for relevence, I still have.

<dd>I see no point in indicating that, since there's no evidence that there were non-Azeris in Yerevan who spoke Azeri as a native language. <i>We don't know that.</i> In fact, I can challenge your statement by saying that the number of Azeris may have been higher than 49% but some of them may have been listed as Armenians cause they declared Armenian as their mothertongue. See what I mean? You keep assuming things and claiming them as facts.</dd>
<dd>And just to catch up on the massacres point: both sources indicate that there were massive pogroms and massacres of Muslims in Erivan Governorate in 1920, so I'm adding that back to the article. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 05:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, as religion was recorded. So, what I understand is that you don't want to change that part as it was represented. That is, "Those who were registered as having as moth thong Azerbaijani Tartar"&#160;? Also, that you don't want the absolute number being added? Your chalange makes no sense, as I base myself on the official census, while you make speculations. The source you provide has no relevency, we are at square one. I already told there was recorded massacres in Kars, the question here is about the Governate, you can not include territories which were later lost, it would have nothing to do with "Azeris" in "Armenia." Also, if you want me to assume good faith with you, you must stop adding "Armenian terrorism" cathegory in articles, when it will be deleted regardless because of a guideline. Would you assume good faith, had I added such a cathegory in articles? <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 16:28, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have not stated one thing that wasn't covered by a source. And I would urge you to stop labelling sources you disagree with as "unrealiable" (you were saying that about Brockhaus and Efron too, if I'm not mistaken). Now all of a sudden Andrew Anderson, whom you were complimenting, is no longer a reliable source? And why exactly isn't the other source reliable? You're accusing me of things when in fact you are the one who's been making speculations all along; such as "Azeris were not the only Muslims in Yerevan", "Kurds were listed as Azeris", etc. with no source to back those up whatsoever. The fact that I am not throwing this at you every time I prove you wrong, doesn't mean i don't notice it. I'll run this by you one last time: the two sources state that the massacres took place in Yerevan and were launched by the Armenian troops. As far as I know, Yerevan was and still is Armenia, which is why that point goes back in the article. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 07:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is going nowhere, could you please consider me as another editor and not an "Armenian" editor. Where have I claimed he was not reliable, I actually am agreeing with what he is saying. But what he is saying does not support what you claim, it actually say exactly what I have been saying. In 1920, Armenians were controling sections which are NOT currently part of the republic of Armenia, I don't see how more clear I can be? Read all the pages he has written about the topic, you will see the entire situation, you are selectivally piking and alluding significantions to that quote. As for Yerevan, look, Yerevan had published Kurdish works, the first of their kinds. They had a Kurdish community, yet, the census recorded the Muslims as those speaking Tartars, it isen't surprising. The census were based on mother thong(as stated by the census itself), this was how they were recorded. You don't want to present the census as the way they were recorded and yet make accusations when what when what I am requesting is to present things as they were presented.

<dd>Unless you present a source that says something like "in Yerevan, there were Muslims who spoke Azeri/Tartar as a mothertongue and weren't Azeri/Azerbaijani Tartar and were listed as Azeris/Azerbaijani Tartars nevertheless," you cannot and will not prove your point. As for the massacre issue, I'll requote it for you from the Anderson source: "some of Armenian regiments reportedly started performing ethnic cleansing in Kars and <b>Yerevan districts that still remained under Armenian control</b>".

<dd>This is a logical falacy, it is like asking someone, prove that a god does not exist. It is to the person making the claim of existance to support it. You claim that all those household recorded as speaking Tartar, were ethnically Tartars. You have to provide that evidence, I don't have to prove non existance, you have to prove existance. The Russian census was based on language. And confirms this, the entry about it, which was neither worked by Azeri or Armenians, what I request is to present the info the way it is represented. The same goes with the second point, it does not support your claim as those territories controled by Armenians in 1920 does not represent the current Armenian republic. They have lost many territories in the process. You have to confirm that most of those happened in lands which formed Armenia.

<dd>I'm sorry but I've presented just enough evidence. The source says "Azerbaijani Tartars." The burden of proof is on you, since you're challenging that statement. If you have an evidence that says there were non-Azeris in Yerevan who considered Azeri their mothertongue, bring it forward. If not, please don't waste our time. Same goes with the massacres in Erivan Governorate. I've spent two weeks on this discussion that keeps going in circles, and all I've heard from you are vague ideas and iffy assumptions. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 07:11, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That it's, I stopped assuming good faith. Look, the Russian census says according to what process people were classified under a nationality. There is no way that all Muslims in Yerevan were Tartars(language does not equal ethnicity, as most Irish would be Englishmen), there is still right now after the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflicts Kurds living in Yerevan, and they do also speak Azeri. You are refusing to clarify the census, there is no way in the world you would refuse clarification if it is not to push a position. I request clarification, I am the person here that request that the informations and records be presented what they represent really. The census of 1897 was based on language spoken by the household. This is what the figures represent. Yerevan was Muslims Market center and their language was Turkish, it was used as import export for marchandises comming from the Ottoman Empire, there are countless numbers of works on that. So, if you really care about the accuracy of this article, you will add that clarification on what those figures represent, the entry about the census was neither prepared neither worked by Armenians neither Azeri, so sorry to say, it is much more neutral than this one. As you see, I am not editing the article, I am waiting you to admit the need of clarification and that you take the dispositions yourself. But you are not doing that, you are justifying a lack of clarification of the article itself. As for Yerevan Governorate, I have presented a record from the US archive, it is a public record accessible threw an interloaning program. Armenians have lost various territories in the process, beside Zankezur all places with significant Muslim population were lost. So for you to add such a statment, you have to document, provide sources which support that what now constitute the republic of Armenia it happened. I admit, crimes happened in Kars, Erzerum, Nakhichevan, Zankezur, Qazakh etc., but beside Zankezur, not one of all those territories became part of the current republic of Armenia. If you want to dump all those fine, but for accuracy, you have also to clarify that in all those lands 0 Armenians remained as Armenians have found a worster faith. Also, one of the sources which is provided from a work from Armenian House, document actually that in Yerevan Governorate, it was the Armenians when a minority who were mistreated by the Tartars. If you want to provide a source at least provide one which support your assertions and don't pick selectivally what support what you claim. And please, don't accuse me of turning in circle, I have respected you again and over again, but you kept assuming bad faith. And this is how things degenarate and I stop assuming good faith. For now, you stole the good faith which was left on you. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 16:56, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"There is no way that all Muslims in Yerevan were Tartars" - first of all, this is an assumption made by you. Second of all, the source doesn't say anything about Muslims. It says "49% Azerbaijani Tartars, 48% Armenians, 2% Russians and the rest are Georgians, Jews, and <b>others</b>." 'Others' is most likely where Kurds are included. And even if they aren't you cannot claim anything like "no way that all Muslims in Yerevan were Tartars", unless you provide a valid source. And you cannot claim that there were Kurds who stated that Azeri was their mothertongue. <b>You simply have no proof</b>. How hard is it to realize that? It's like you're enjoying going in circles not being able to admit that you lack evidence to prove your argument. On the contrary, you're trying to act as if it's me who's lacking sources.</dd>
<dd>As for the massacre, I have my source. It clearly says "massacres in the Erivan Governorate". When a source says "Erivan Governorate" it means by default the governorate as a whole, unless specified otherwise (which is entirely your task). "Kars, Erzerum, Zankezur, Qazakh" were never part of the Erivan Governorate. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 07:16, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Either you are doing this on purpouse or you are refusing to understand what I am writing. For the last time, I need not to bring evidences for a non existance, it is a logical falacy. You claim that all those who spoke Tartar were Azeri, don't you even remember what had happened and still happens in the Safavit article? You are making the claim, what I am doing is questioning it, questioning an imprecision does not require an evidence, making a statment of fact does. You are assuming that "others" included Kurds. Do the math, 49+48+2 = 99%. So 1% others. There were Circassians in Yerevan, Kurds, Persians, there was Awali communities, Zaza's, you are claiming that all other Muslims represented less than 1% of the population. Good, now bring evidences for that. You claim those who spoke Tartars were ethnically Tartars, while the Russian census does clarify that the nationality classification is based on the language of the household(one of the work you even quote claims Tartars had Kurds supports). Most Irishmen are not Englishmen, are they? Muslim communities for centuries were either in Turkish rules, Tartar rules, Safavid imposed Turkic rules in particular in Yerevan area etc. The same way the Irish had an imposed British rules. If you refuse to clarify as to what the census really represent, explain me why you are doing it. As for the enumerated recorded massacres, don't you see that you don't even listen to me? Above, I have cited records from the US archives, with pieces which were part of it, as stated those represented the area's with a significant Muslim population in 1920. Since you refuse to adhere to NPOV, and ater my various attemps you show no inclination to even listen, there is absolutly no point to discuss. Check for example, the distortion on "majority" do you even know what majority means? <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 14:21, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Safavid article has nothing to do with this article. I've cited the same source (Brockhaus and Efron) where it distinguished between Azeris and Kurds - an evidence serious enough to claim that Kurds were not included into the figures for Azeris. And if you believe there were "Circassians in Yerevan, Kurds, Persians, there was Awali communities, Zaza's" and that there were Kurds in Yerevan who spoke Azeri natively, I'd like to see a valid source.</p>
<p>Your source on the population figures only covers Kars Oblast and Surmali district of Yerevan. It doesn't have any numbers for the rest of Erivan Governorate, hence is not applicable to our discussion. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 06:08, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
