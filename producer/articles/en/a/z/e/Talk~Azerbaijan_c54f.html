</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are several hypotheses regarding the origins of the name "Azerbaijan." The most common theory is that Azerbaijan was eponymously named after <i><a href="../../../a/t/r/Atropates.html" title="Atropates">Atropates</a></i> or Atarepata, a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satrap.html" title="Satrap">satrap</a>(governor) of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medes.html" title="Medes">Media</a>, who ruled a region found in modern <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Azarbaijan_fc5a.html" title="Iranian Azarbaijan">Iranian Azarbaijan</a> called <i><a href="../../../a/t/r/Atropatene.html" title="Atropatene">Atropatene</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-ISBN_2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ISBN_2" title="">[1]</a></sup> Atropates' name is believed to be derived from the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Persian_243e.html" title="Old Persian">Old Persian</a> roots meaning "protected by fire."<sup id="_ref-ISBN_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ISBN" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are also alternative opinions that the term is a slight <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkification.html" title="Turkification">Turkification</a> of <i>Azarbaijan</i>, in turn an Arabicized version of the original Persian name <i>Âzarâbâdagân</i>, made up of <i>âzar+âbadag+ân</i> (<i>âzar</i>=fire; <i>âbâdag</i>=cultivated area; <i>ân</i>=suffix of pluralization); that it traditionally means "the land of eternal flames" or "the land of fire", which probably implies <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrian.html" title="Zoroastrian">Zoroastrian</a> fire temples in this land.</p>
<p>According to Prof. Tadeusz Swietochowski, Azerbaijan is the name of the region stretching from the northern slopes of the Caucasus Mountains along the Caspian Sea to the Iranian plateau. As a political or administrative unit and a geographic notion, Azerbaijan's boundaries were changing throughout history. Its northern part, on the left bank of the Araxes River, was known at times under different names – <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_Albania_1fac.html" title="Caucasian Albania">Caucasian Albania</a> in the pre-Islamic period, and, subsequently, Arran.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>However beginning from the 13th century A.D. the name of Azerbaijan became applied to the territories north of Araxes river.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<li>This is my idea for what the section should look like.

<li>This doesn't look acceptable to me, especially the last sentence, but I'll reserve my final judgment until after I've heard what User:Azerbaijani has to say about the issue. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">Mardavich</a> 18:05, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I think it's too short, why don't we expand the last sentence to include a short line regarding the modern Republic's decision to adopt the name Azerbaijan by saying "According to some sources...But according to the other sources...". What do you think? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">Mardavich</a> 18:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If we divided it into clear sides without elaborating on one or the other too much, if may be acceptable. Paste your idea underneath this so I can give a better response. The problem currently is because the "illegitimate" view was receiving much more weight on this page, even though this is the main page for the whole nation. Understandably, this caused a lot of Azeris to be offended, and then came all of the conflict here. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 18:23, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, as the above clearly states, Azerbaijan is indeed according to a neutral source an area belonging to north and south of the Aras river, which was divided by the two treaties among which the last one is mentioned in this particular instance. There are also other places at Iranica where there are references about "greater Azerbaijan" when they talk about Iranian and the independent Azerbaijan. However the sources mentioned in this article are from Armenian and Iranian sources and I read those sources. They have no desire to hide their prejudice toward Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis. According to Wikipedia rules sources should be "verifiable" and "neutral". However, no matter how much we try some members have no intention of doinbg anything but distorting issues.</dd>

<dd>About some "conflicts" about the name Azerbaijan it is obvious that some parties and sources dispute the name of an independent and recognised country by the UN. That is their business. But neutral sources, whether it is the UN or it is Iranica recognise both independent Azerbaijan and Iranian Azerbaijan as being Azerbaijan. Don't forget that there was no Azerbaijan clearly defined prior to the establishment of the province of Azerbaijan in Iran by the Qajar. And this was AFTER northern Azerbaijan was ceded to Tsarist Russia. I found this on the article about Iranian Azerbaijan (again mocked by user Azerbaijani and a few others) where the source, correctly, was another Western one, Columbia Encyclopedia. So if there are also some local (Iranian, Armenian or Soviet sources) who dispute the name, or if some individual, Resulzade for example, are told to have said that Azerbaijan is different from Iranian Azerbaijan then all this should be made into a separate article. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 18:59, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Please, those older users, edit and remove nonesense material that are offending to the citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

<dd>User:Pejman47 wrote me that he agrees with the proposed changes. I don't know exactly how and what to do. The above, as I have written are from Western renowned sources. They are not perfect but they are scholarly sources, without political bias. We should not put texts that have biased sources, such as the ones from Armenia and Iran. These texts are making this article look like a political pamphlet. Please read the above sources and bring arguments against them but please use neutral sources. This is the Wikipedia rule as far as I know. One of the sources is the Armenian envoy to the UN, right? That source is just a joke. Did an IRANIAN put that source on? Pure pity for an Iranian (Azerbaijani or Fars) to do that. Such a pity. To quote a source from a waring nation!! The other source is an Iranian named Farokh who DOES NOT HIDE his prejudice toward the issue. His writing IS NOT scholarly. It is an article. We cannot use this quote for this article becasue this article is about the COUNTRY Azerbaijan. I don't know how to unlock. Would someone more experienced do it? And I don't know when user:Azerbaijani or someone like that will appear and start calling what we have done VANDALISM or POV. Then we should do our best to get him blocked. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 13:39, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lets not be selective about quoting Iranica. <i>the final episodes consisted mainly of stabilization and integration, such as the organization of the large confederation of the ˆa@hsevan, evolving between the highlands of Azerbaijan (notably the huge massif of Savala@n) during summer and the lower lands of the Araxes and Transcaucasus in winter. The annexation of the latter by Russia with the treaty of Torkamana@y, in 1828 fixed the political borders of the Iranian state, in an artificial manner, by dividing the Azeri ethnic group but without really affecting the profound unity of a common cultural space, marked by the Shi¿ite affiliation and the resonance of Iranian civilization.</i><a href="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v13f2/v13f2024i.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v13f2/v13f2024i.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<dd>As per the user Behnam's quote, I disagree, it should be shorter. I think this is sufficient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_name_Azerbaijan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_name_Azerbaijan" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>: <i>The name Azerbaijan itself is thought to be derived from Atropates, an Iranian Median satrap (governor), who ruled a region found in modern Iranian Azarbaijan called Atropatene.[1] Atropates name is believed to be derived from the Old Persian roots meaning "protected by fire."[2] The name is also mentioned in the Avestan Frawardin Yasht: âterepâtahe ashaonô fravashîm ýazamaide which translates literally to: We worship the Fravashi of the holy Atare-pata. [3]</i>. For the history, etymology and designation of the name of Azerbaijan see<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_name_Azerbaijan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_name_Azerbaijan" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. If there is any proof that there is any Turkification of the term Azerbaijan, then relavent linguistic scholarly references should be brought as well and added to the etymology section of this article for that particular sentence. The thing is we want to keep the naming of that section too a minimal, thus quoting the same scholar(Tadeusz Swietochowski) who wrote: <i>What is now the Azerbaijan Republic was known as Caucasian Albania in the pre-Islamic period, and later as Arran. From the time of ancient Media (ninth to seventh centuries b.c.) and the Persian Empire (sixth to fourth centuries b.c.), Azerbaijan usually shared the history of what is now Iran.</i> might also be a POV push. I think just keep it as minimal as possible.</dd>
<dd>On the mussavites, the same thing..they established a government and etc.. And then we refer to the relavent Mussavite article where the nature of their government is discussed. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 17:23, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Thanks everybody for working this out. One minor thing; should we say "Iranian Median", "Persian", or "satrap of Media"? I think the third is best because it avoids the conflict between sources over exactly which type of Iranian he was; see the discussion further up on this page for links. I don't see the importance of his ethnicity here anyway, so I think that simply mentioning that he was a satrap of Media avoids the unnecessary ethnicity source conflict. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 00:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Iranian Median" is the best accurate description, as both Persians and Medians were Iranian. Iranian here is a significant linguistic and geographical designation, it shouldn't be omitted. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">Mardavich</a> 01:04, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How about "Iranian satrap of Media"? If you take a look at the Atropates section of this talk page, there isn't consensus between the sources as to whether or not he was Median or Persian. So, if we don't know, say "Iranian", and if we do know, just say either "Median" or "Persian" since they imply Iranian ethnicity and hence saying "Iranian" would be redundant. By the way, "Iranian Median" sounds terrible in English regardless of whether or not it is true. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 01:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Are there TWO Medians to specify whether it is the Iranian one or the non-Iranian one? Just trying to be informative and neutral it does not blend well with neutrality to write "Iranian" Median unless there is also another Median. For example when you say IRANIAN Azerbaijan it is correct becasue you say so in order not to have confusion with northern Azerbaijan. It is funny that WE, the Iranians, are writing the article about the Republic of Azerbijan. It is not very nice of us but we are probably numerically superior. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 01:27, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually you are right there is only one Median.

<dd>I think it is useful and necessary to mention that here, in the talk page, that the people of Azerbaijan are not PAN-TURKIST as many Iranians think and loath about. Pan-Turkist means different things but it essentially links the identity of Azerbaijan primarily with Turkey, rather than the Azerbaijanis in Iran and the Iranian culture and heritage. The Republic of Azerbaijan from its inception has been relatively pro-Turkey becasue Turkey was, and still is, the only powrful country in the region that offered serious support to Azerbaijan. Let's remind that Iran's Islamic regime gave economic aid to Christian Armenia during the Armenian campaign against Azerbaijan while Turkey has a blockade on Armenia even now due to its aggression toward Azerbaijani territory. And in 1918 when the Republic of Azerbaijan was established Iran was in a civil war and in a deep internal chaos, so Azerbaijan found its only refuge to survival in the Ottoman Turkey of the time that was just starting to become a Turkish nationalistic state. And finally let's not forget that although Azerbaijanis in Iran are powerful and influential they do not have some very important human rights respected by the Iranian regime, such as their own specific culture and language. So, Iranians shall not view Azerbaijan in a negative way becasue it has been Iran's fault too. But Azerbaijanis are different from Turks in Turkey and this difference is a deeply-rooted difference that has been the main cause of their historic union with Persians. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 15:51, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My main problem with the republic of Azerbaijan is that there is a lot of negative news about Iran which I believe actually that Turkey is planting and perhaps some grey wolf groups or who knows what. These groups are definitely not the representative of the people of Azerbaijan. The people there are our kin and even I have Azeri relatives (great aunt). I think a better idea is to make an Iran-republic of Azerbaijancooperation board since lots of topics are in common (Shervanshah , Safavids, Qajars, Aras, Mugham, Akhunzadeh..). A book that is going to be the hot topic for sometime is the Safina Tabrizi. <a href="http://www.rozenbergps.com/index.php?frame=boek.php&amp;item=714" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rozenbergps.com/index.php?frame=boek.php&amp;item=714" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. The book is from Tabriz and thus the people of the republic of Azerbaijan who are also culturally part of the Iranian world should also do research and write about it. I do not think in the last 100 yers a more important manuscript has been found from the area. Also I disagree with human rights and Azerbaijan in Iran, because now there are Azerbaijani language courses in universities and summer, as well as there is government backed TV, newspaper, music and etc. Even programs from Azerbaijani and Kurdistani provinces are on sattelite and can be seen by everyone. <a href="http://www.baztab.com/news/59650.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baztab.com/news/59650.php" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. I am not sure what the situation of minorities is in republic of Azerbaijan, but I believe Iran is better than Turkey with this regard. There has been attempts to incite some groups in Iran at least from the time of the USSR. In Azerbaijanis it won't work since they are organic part of Iran. I hope for better relationship between what-ever governments are in place in both countries and right now actually the situation has improved relative to the time when ilchibay was in power. Anyways these are issues I am interested in and willing to discuss with anyone (specially the republic of Azerbaijan) but since it is not related to topic at hand, I'll stop here. I am glad that compromise was reached at least in this important topic since this is the first google link and it is important that people of the republic of Azerbaijan are also not offended as you said. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 02:13, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Ali, our main problem with negative perception of Iran has nothing to do with Turkey. The negative perception of Iran in Azerbaijan is mostly due to radical Shia religious movements incited in the Republic by the Iranian state. In fact, I don't understand why you blindly blame Turkey without having facts at hand. This country by itself goes through deep identity transformation, and issues of Grey Wolves and other ultra-nationalism were left in 1970s. It's appalling to see educated Iranians still living with perceptions and stereotypes of 16th century though.</dd>
<dd>Instead of quite visible jealousy of Turkish influence in Azerbaijan, or trying to denigrate Turkic identity, and emphasize Iranian connection, you should think of more peaceful and respectful solutions, more of a balance. We carry no goals of dividing Iran in Azerbaijan. But we also expect respect towards our statehood and people, and especially ceasing unpaid services to the known enemies of our country, from Iranians. Believe me, these issues again have nothing to do with Turkey or Turkish people. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 07:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Atabek. Actually the MHP party is strong in Turkey (even at least 5% of the vote in a country of 70 million is significant but they have more that) and believe me there is rivarly between Turkey, Russia and Iran governments with regards to Azerbaijan. Turkey's government will push pan-turkism and Iran's government will push pan-Shi'ism and Russia will use its economic and military influence. All these aside (and they are all wrong in my opinion), I do not think we can equate government with people. That is why I said Turkey and I did not say people of Turkey whom I have no problems with. Thus the average Iranian harbors no ill will towards the average Turk from Turkey or the average Azerbaijani republic citizen. I believe the feelings are mutual there. Also I am not aware of what you mean by unpaid services. I also do not think the rivarly between Armenian government and Azerbaijani government means that we should not have relationship with both countries and do our best to make a peaceful settlement. Indeed Russia will look out for Armenia and Turkey for the republic of Azerbaijan, but Iran as a country that has both Armenians and Azerbaijanis with strong national Iranian identity. I am not happy with the geopolitical situation of the region as I am sure you are not either, but I can gaurantee you that average Iranians have nothing against the average person from the republic of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Turkey. I hope the feeling in those countries are the same. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 02:49, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Ali, Iran, in case it was a normal and relatively democratic country, would have sided with Azerbaijan, not Armenia. It is offensive for all Azerbaijanis, from all countries, that Iran helped Armenia (economically, not militarily) and has good relations with Armenia. Armenia was and is an aggressor (occuppying Azerbaijani land) and 25% of Iranians are Azerbaijanis. There are at most 200.000 Armenians living in Iran so the comparison is not relevant. I hope that the attitude is ONLY the government and not the Fars people, and I really think so. Maybe those who are acting as if they were from Iran or Iranian Azerbaijan and editing Azerbaijani (people as a whole or the republic) articles in an offensive and misinformative manner are NOT actually Iranians. I hope so. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 13:28, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Roazir Jan. I think Iran was neutral and Iran also has economic ties with the republic of Azerbaijan. I think Iran's responsibility is to really bring lasting peace and give humanitarian aid to both sides. I know there is less Armenians than Azerbaijanis in Iran, both are Iranians first. Thus Iran must actually try to make sure the conflict does not spill over in its own borders (which so far thankfully it hasn't) and also it must try to bring peace. I did a google search and found this article <a href="http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/archive/54526.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/archive/54526.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Although it is on an Armenian website, it seems to be from an Azerbaijani republic newspaper (Zekarlo), Baku. These sort of newspapers seem to publish false information unfortunately from demographics to everything else urging ethnic agitation. The newspaper though makes one logical point. <i>There is another question - why did the Tehran regime and radical Shi'is prefer to support not Shi'i Azerbaijan, but Christian Armenia? This question, as it were, is completely clear. The point is that Christian Armenia has never laid territorial claims to Iran.</i>. That is why I said we should not allow politics to get in the way of friendship between Iranian people and the people of republic of Azerbaijan. I think the Azerbaijani government (not people) is not innocent when it comes to dealing with Iran either and their preception of both countries with respect to each other is wrong. Iran's Azerbaijan is integral. Even the the newspaper claims there are 8 million Azerbaijans million out of 12 million people in Tehran. (which is not true but assume it is they should then ask are the 8 million Azerbaijanis or 2-3 million or whatever going to leave Tehran since this is larger than the population of the republic of Azerbaijan or Baku). Anytime there is a conflict 99% of time both sides are at fault. Thus the mistakes by various governments should not reflect upon the preception of the people of two countries upon each other. Well that is all I am going to discuss. believe I got my point across that the average citizens with no ties to either of those governments should try to be understanding. I'll be glad to discuss this topic further via e-mail with anyone. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 03:05, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was rather amused to find a link to my website, Million Dollar Babies, embroiled in some virtual turf war on Wikipedia. But I was also bemused and insulted by some of the childish ranting that passes for rational discussion on your forum - probably why I (and others) try to assiduously avoid using any information posted to your site. If any of you took the time to view the material on my site - and I'm doubting that few have - then you would realize that the offending text is intended to be my summary of Events and Causes of the chaos that provided the background noise to historical periods of Hyperinflation. These summaries are all from information that I have gleaned from NON-WIKIPEDIA sources, and condensed to present viewers with a sense of zeitgeist while viewing my collection.</p>
<p>None of my summaries are meant as reference material since I have not listed any particular sources, and this should be obvious. However, it is not "utter bunk" as stated by Francis Tyers · 10:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC). Nor is it "Milliondollarbabies numismat site is even more laughable reference, and insult to intelligence of Wiki users." As proposed by Atabek 00:15, 31 January 2007 (UTC). ( actually, I take this as a compliment… as "spellchecking" seems to be an insult to the intelligence of most Wikipedians ).</p>
<p>The only rational voice in the crowd seems to be Grandmaster, who stated that, "And as it was pointed out, sources like "milliondollarbabies.com" are not academic, and should not be used to support such allegations as those included in the article."</p>
<p>Well… no, I am not an Azerbaijani Historian (and would not care to be after seeing the disparaging comments offhandedly posted here), but I have researched my material and stand by it. Now if you boys find you are having trouble with some Wiki-troll linking to my website - and can find some free time between your squabbles - then I would gladly write up a little ".htaccess" file to block my offending material from your playground. That is… if you have the brains and/or guts to NOTIFY ME FIRST, instead of assuming that your opinions are the only ones that matter in the world.</p>

<dd>I am greatly sorry for any offensive statements. We have managed to find a solution to the problem that satisfies both parties. Obviously, there was a rather heated discussion, and I apologize for any disparaging remarks about your website. The basic problem was that your website, focusing on hyperinflation, wasn't the best choice as a source for the information that we were looking for. The academic sources that you used in creating your website would probably be more appropriate here. You put it best, "None of my summaries are meant as reference material since I have not listed any particular sources, and this should be obvious." About the spell checking... aside from the articles themselves, spelling isn't important on discussion pages like this one as long as the idea is communicated effectively. And as far as trolling goes, the problem has passed, and hopefully will not resurface on this page.

Those comments were directed not as much at you, as much as they were directed to those who did not even try to make their own research of facts and sources outside of Internet. Without any disrespect to the hard work you’ve done to create your very interesting articles and website, we have the rules that require using published academic sources, which some people don’t realize or don’t want to realize.

<dd>Interesting. I often thought almost all Azerbaijanis were Shia. For example in Iran almost all Azerbaijanis and all Persians are Shia. Almost all means probably more than 98%. So, about 70% of the republic of Azerbaijan are Sunni. Well, I have known that most Azerbaijani citizens are very secular and often hardly know about Shia-Sunni. Are the 30% Sunni newly-turned Sunnis or they have historically been Sunni? <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 21:35, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Northern regions of Azerbaijan are largely Sunni. It historically has been like that. Central and southern areas are overwhelmingly Shia. However, Azerbaijani people are mostly secular and don’t care about religious differences, so for the most part Sunni – Shia denomination is nominal. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 10:48, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for clearing that out! As you can see, we the Azerbaijanis in Iran, worked to fix the problems that existed in this article. We are all Azerbaijanis, no matter from the south of the Aras or the north. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 20:33, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<div style="background-color:#e8f0ff;">On the WikiProject Countries talk page, the section <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Countries_c1c1.html#Location_Maps_for_European_countries" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Countries">Location Maps for European countries</a> had shown new maps created by David Liuzzo, that are available for the countries of the <i>European continent</i>, and for countries of the <i>European Union</i> exist in two versions. From <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">November 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> till <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_31.html" title="January 31">January 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, a poll had tried to find a consensus for usage of 'old' or of which and where 'new' version maps. Please note that since <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> all new maps became updated by David Liuzzo (including a world locator, enlarged cut-out for small countries) and as of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_4.html" title="February 4">February 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> the restricted licence that had jeopardized their availability on Wikimedia Commons, became more free. At its closing, 25 people had spoken in favor of either of the two presented usages of new versions but neither version had reached a consensus (12 and 13), and 18 had preferred old maps.<br />
As this outcome cannot justify reverting of new maps that had become used for some countries, seconds before <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">February 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> a survey started that <b>will be closed soon at <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 23:59:59</b>. It should establish two things:
<ul>
<li>whether the new style maps may be applied as soon as some might become available for countries outside the European continent (or such to depend on future discussions),</li>
<li>which new version (<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Countries_c1c1.html#Creator.27s_comment_on_the_whole_long_lasting_discussion.2FNew_maps_with_and_without_EU-marking_available" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Countries">with of without indicating the entire European Union by a separate shade</a>) should be applied for which countries.</li>
