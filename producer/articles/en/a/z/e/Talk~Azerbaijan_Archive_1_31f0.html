<h2><span class="mw-headline">US-Azeri Chamber of Commerce</span></h2>
<p>I wonder if it would be informative to also note the many powerful people that sit or have sat on the US-Azeri Chamber of Commerce. Certainly, it would be POV to assert that this has been an influence on US policy toward Azerbaijan and its tolerance, accomodation and some would say encouragement of Ilham Aliev, but readers might deserve to draw their own conclusions from the fact that Ilham Aliez sits on the Chamber with Brzinski, Kissinger, James Baker III, Cheney, Armitage, Scofcroft, etc. <a href="http://www.usacc.org/contents.php?cid=2" class="external free" title="http://www.usacc.org/contents.php?cid=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.usacc.org/contents.php?cid=2</a>67.184.111.43 04:14, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Azerbaijan is Iranian and always will be. "azerbaijani" culture is PERSIAN!!!!</p>
<p>Pan-turanists (turks) are trying to deny Azeri people their Persian heritage. Turks from Turkey are making up false claims and lies about Azeri people. It really annoys me when people try to say that Azeribaijan is not Persian. Here are the facts:</p>
<p>Azerbaijan is a Persian word meaning land of fire, (reffering to the the ancient Iranian religion of Zoroaster).</p>
<p>Azerbaijan was a province of Iran and settled by Iranians thousands of years before the turks ever left mongolia and outer china.</p>
<p>Azeri people are racially, ethnically Iranian. They are caucasoids of the Iranian branch. Not central asian ural-altaic turks...Simply, they look like Persians not mongolians..or people from central asia.</p>
<p>Azeri culture is Persian. They celebrate ancient Iranian holidays like now rooz, char shambeh suri, etc...Their cuisine is Persian, their traditional costumes are Iranian...(original turks were a nomadic horse breeding people and had no similiarites culturally to the present day "turks" of azerbaijan or turkey. Azeri music is definatly Persian, (instruments, etc...)</p>
<p>40% of the Azeri langauge is Farsi (Persian).</p>
<p>Even their names are Persian.</p>
<p>The only land to have ever been named Azerbaijan is the current Iranian province, The fake republic of Azerbaijan was actually 3 different Iranian provences when Russia invaded and seperated them from Iran.</p>
<p>(Different person speaking) My commentary and NPOV: Azerbaijan IS a Persian name, and does have Persian culture and has been heavily influenced by Persians, but that is because Persia took over Azerbaijan before the Russians, Azerbaijan is an area that has been occupied by many ethics. The fact that Azerbaijan's culture is Persian, does not mean that the Azeri people are of Persian origin. NavidT 05:35, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Let me tell you the reality. Unexceptionally all the peoples of the Middle East are ethnically well mixed. Just like in Turkey or Azerbaijan, you can not find any ethnic unity in Iran as well, even in the very Persian regions, both culturally and physically. So the only way to separate societies from each other is the language. Turks and Azeris speak Turkish with different dialects, and the Persians speak Farsi. So Turks and Azeris are on one side, Persians on the other. And it has nothing to do with Panturkism.</p>
<p>I hope it was explicable enough...:)</p>
<p><br />
who is talking about name? this is about history of nation.</p>
<p>It really doesn't matter what Iranians think about Azerbaijan or consider Azeris to be. I am an Azeri, I have Azeri citizenship and gurantee you that the 91% Azeris in Azebaijan ALL consider themselves and their language Turkish. It's a simple fact, no one will deny it. And no one relates themselves to Iranians, this is only seen through the internet by Iranian propaganda whatever its intentions are. Azeris from Iran whatever they are, are not considered or regarded as Azeris in the republic of Azerbaijan either and hardly look like us. Most of them are treated as foreigners. We have nothing in common. They're WAY too religious and basically persianised in culture. Most of them guard their sisters like a baby does with his toys. I personally was shocked when I visited Tabriz and Tehran and I could not understand their language either. Whatever it was, it wasn't the same Turkish we spoke in Naxcivan, it had so much farsi in it I could hardly understand any of it. I don't even think it can be regarded as Turkish. Culturally I found none of our foods to be similar in the least bit, or much else either. There seemed to be more in common with other un-related peoples to us like the Chechens then this supposed brethen to us in Iran. I think most of them have probably mixed with Persians or Kurds or something cause they are nothing like us.</p>

<pre>
What has the name Azerbaijan have to do with the Azerbaijan Turks? Azerbaijan is just the name
of the place, just like Anatolia, which is a Greek name. However, Azeris are Turks from the
Oguz branch just like people of Turkey. They have founded numerous Turkish states, and it is 
</pre>
<p>well known that a lot of Oguz Turks from Anatolia immigrated to Azerbaijan especially during the reign of Sah Ismail in the 16th century because they see it as a country more adherent to Turk traditions than Ottomans. The people of Azerbaijan are the ones that are claiming they are Turks, they know their heritage and certainly will not bend over to the dumb brainwashing of the Persian state trying to twist history to avoid an ethnic conflict already rising against the oppression of the Turkish culture in the Persia. Surely, your Islamic state which tries to hold together people of different ethnicity on the basis of religion is fearing this to happen. The rest of the things were not even worthy of mention, culture and clothes Persian? yes, sure buddy, dream on. BTW, Nevruz is celebrated in the whole Turkish world and probably in many other cultures as the spring festival, it is funny how weak your claims are.</p>

<p>It is a good suggestion, however resolving the conflict assumes substantiation of version/claims by facts. To begin with I would like someone presents facts that there was a state called Azerbaijan before 1918. - TT</p>
<p>Grunt, I can see that we have a bunch of real competent admins here in wikipedia. You and another admin are locking the pages of this guy's version of lies and deceptions and invite me to resolve the problem with him? Can you read and understand plain english? I responded to your comments on the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Talk%7ESouth_Azerbaijan_de31.html" title="Talk:South Azerbaijan">Talk:South Azerbaijan</a> page the other day, and explained that this moron with a random IP and no histoty of constructive work in wikipedia changes the pages with a CLEAR political agenda, and DOES NOT engage in any dialog. He puts out flat out lies, he is not even a registered contributor, and his rubbish get to overridde my work with over a year of active, accurate and useful contributions to Wikipedia. On page <a href="../../../n/e/z/Nezami.html" title="Nezami">Nezami</a> he writes Nezami has works in Turkish. So in the discussion area I tell him why don't you then just name his "Turkish works" in the article? (mind you, there is NONE) He does not respond. So we revert the article to the version that is CORRECT, and he immediately reverts back to his version. The same bullshit is going on a a bunch of pages, ALL OF WHICH are related to one cause: Pan-Turkism. He has today created a new completely false article Persian Chauvinisim in conjunction with his other contaminations of the neighbourhood -- thanks to admins like you who encourage abuse of the open nature of Wikipedia. This moron's IP should have been blocked a long time ago after a couple of warnings when his abuse and malintentions became apparent. <a href="../../../k/1/_/User%7EK1_d397.html" title="User:K1">--K1</a> 09:24, 28 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no need for Iranians to falsify their history. It is rich and well documented. Unlike Azerbaijani history which is 99% falsified. After all the topic shall be named "History of the territories occupied by Azerbaijan" rather than "History of Azerbaijan".</dd>

<dd>As far as I'm concerned both of you have equally valid (invalid?) points of view here; we are going to have to accept that fact and attempt to create a version of this article that properly represents both points of view. Clearly two points of view exist; otherwise there wouldn't be enough material to create two versions of the article, would they? If we can just calm down enough to accept that fact, perhaps we'll be able to resolve this whole mess... -- <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrunt_6e8a.html" title="User:Grunt">Grunt</a> <a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrunt_2a44.html" title="User talk:Grunt">(talk)</a> 01:35, 2004 Jul 7 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Interesting how all the people fighting so passionately for what they write about Azerbaijan are from Iran... All I can read is Iran this, Persia that. I wouldn't be surprised if the admin is some sort of Iranian descent. Is this not supposed to be Azerbaijan's history? As opposed to the glorious Persian history? I hope the brainless admins try searching up some websites made in Azerbaijan to ban these incompetent fools.</p>

<dd>I as an Azerbaijani condamn the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Wolf_dc9e.html" title="Grey Wolf">Grey Wolf</a> pan-Turkist attempt to fabricate a falsified and distorted history for our land. Its as clear as day that we were a part of Persia before being captured by the Russians. You escape reality just to feel good and bring more misery for the people of Caucasus. Get off of my history and go back to your camps in Ankara.</dd>

<p>I myself am Azeri, i have taken alot of time into considering where my roots are from. I have seen on this talk page arguements and declairations, but i am going to give my peaceful POV. I think that Azeri people are from more than just one area, some of us may be from centural Asia, some of us may have Persian ancestors, some of us can be Turkish, some of us may be native Azeri, and many other places. What i conclude is that Azeri people are from different places with different mixes of cultures, although i think most are from centural Asia, they would have mixed in with the other ethics by now. I do not think that we are a part of the Persian race, although the cultures are very close together. -Navid</p>

<dd>It is an improvement, but it is far from "simply great". For example, in the history section is jumps from "IV c. BC" all the way to the Islamic era, without a single mention of the large gap in between. It also does not mention the fact that the name "Azerbaijan" was used only after the end of World War I, although it does mention the formation of it after WW-I. Also it does not mention at all that it used to be called Arran and that "Azarbaijan" has always historically been to the south of the Aras river.

<p>I agree. There is a tendency here on Wikipedia that "opposing parties" take over separate pages and expand them, defending them against revert wars and developing them in separate directions. All this has happened in the past in the Azer|Azar-baijan|beycan|beijan complex of pages over and over again. There were "Turkish" pages and "Iranian" pages and others too Very few <i>encyclopaedic</i> pages though. Tabib has - by culling this page to the bone - created a good <i>encyclopaedic</i> page which could last and now allows the disputes to concetrate on one page - the historical page e.g. I do agree on one count - the bit about the "name shift" should be menitioned, preferably in a a way that does not inflame over and again the revert wars. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 10:39, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

Keystone in all Azeri "histories" is a postulate that everything, which has ever happened on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan, is related, and directly linked to Azerbaijan and Azeries. This is nonsense unless Azerbaijani scientists present solid data proving the concept. Just one remark - how would you respect an Egyptian scientist who would claim that Arabs are ancestors of Nubian and pharaohs? Or Turks are ancestors of Romans? With smile, right? But why you do not smile when Azeris make similar claims? The truth is - there were no state or monarchy, which was Azerbaijani. First state with that name was created only in 1918. People started to be called Azerbaijanis only by 1938. Before they are identified themselves as Tats, Tallish, Lezgi, or even simply as Muslims. TT</p>

If it is well founded, then there should be no issue with validating the addition through propper citation of sources. But policy states that the burden of proof falls on the submitter. I'm going to consider any additional uncited reverts as vandalism and have warned Bagration-Mukhransky that this will lead him being blocked.

<p>From history logs I have noticed that there was a brief mutual reverting between <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">User:El C</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagration-Mukhransky_6638.html" title="User:Bagration-Mukhransky">User:Bagration-Mukhransky</a> (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;diff=15238566&amp;oldid=15222809" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;diff=15238566&amp;oldid=15222809" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>).</p>
<p>I want to state right away that the edits that Bagration-Mukhransky supported are totally false. I do not question this user's good faith, but I think it is necessary for you and all editors to know that this absurd claim that allegedly "the Azeri Turks" comprised only "around 30%" of the population of Azerbaijan, whereas <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talysh.html" title="Talysh">Talysh</a> minority ostensibly constituted 60% (?!) is simply absurd. (Btw, today Talysh number around 50-70,000 in present-day Azerbaijan and are the fastest growing population group in Azerbaijan). <b>This absurd and stupid claim was first introduced by vandal Rovoam</b> in <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijanis.html" title="Azerbaijanis">Azerbaijanis</a> as a part of his massive and wide-range vandalism which covered more than thirty (!) Azerbaijan and Turkey-related WP entries. He is still introducing same vandalisms in that entry, in many other Azerbaijan-related entries and even such unrelated entry as <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Turks_1d9f.html" title="Ottoman Turks">Ottoman Turks</a> (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ottoman_Turks&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=14992929" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ottoman_Turks&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=14992929" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) or <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ottoman_Empire&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=14992929" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ottoman_Empire&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=14992929" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>)</p>
<p>As I said, I do not want to question Bagration-Mukhransky's good faith in his edits, but those spurious edits come from vandal and everyone should bear this in mind. I have also expressed similar concerns in <a href="../../../a/z/e/Talk%7EAzeri_8ae7.html" title="Talk:Azeri">Talk:Azeri</a>, where Rovoam introduced same vandal edits.

<p>Term "Azerbaijan" was first introduced in 1918. There were no state with that name in history prior to 1918. Using the term to period in history preceeding 1918 is a nonsence. Moreover, 'Azerbaijani people' is a term for Turks, Lezgi, Tats and other ethnic groups which were assimilated under soviet rule in Azerbaijan. Turks, or Azeri (Turks who lived in Persian northern province of Azerbaijan) constituted ca 30% of the population of the republic of Azerbaijan in 1918. The term "Azeri" became wide spread only by 1938. Thus, refering to people in the region az Azeri for period preceeding 1918 is a nonsence. For example there is absolutely no proof that ancient Caucasian Albania or Manna had anything to do with Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Main reason for these history falsifications is an attempt to create new "older" history for newly born state and substantiate territorial claims.</p>

All topics in Wikipedia encyclopedia regarding Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh are bombarded with Azeri propaganda.

<p>Keljbadzhar - 1,936 sq. kм/50,600 Lachin - 1,835 sq. kм/59,900 Gubatly - 802 sq. km/ 30,300 Dzhebrail - 1,050 sq km/ 51,600 Zangelan - 707 sq km/ 33,900 Agdam - 1,094 sq. km /158,000 Fizuli - 1,386 sq km/ 100,000</p>
<p><a name=".3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D"></a></p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline">================</span></h6>
<p>Total population: around 400,000</p>
<p>In addition, armenian forces control only 35% and 25% of Agdam and Fizuli regions, which make 383 and 347 sq km, respectively.</p>
<p>Bottom line is - Karabach, which was "occupied" by Armenians for thousands of years, makes ca 8% of Azeri territory; territories outside Karabach, which are under Armenian control make only 4.9%. Total - 12.9%. In addition, two regions of Karabakh are still under Azerbaijani control (Shaumian and Mardakert). Thus, Azeri territory under Armenian control is only 4.9%, or five times less than claimed by official azeri propaganda.</p>
<p>It is also obvious that there were no 1,000,000 people lived in the regions. Max. number of displaced Azeri cannot be more than 400,000, which is close to a number of Armenians fled Azerbaijan after pogroms in Sumgayt and Baku in 1988 and 1990, respectively.</p>
<p>Thus, all Azeri talks about "20% of occupied territories and 1 million displaced people" is nothing but a big lie.</p>

<p>The word Azerbaycan is a acient Avestian word for Land of the Eternal Flames. Azerbaycan has always had its own culture, dont mix it with Persians or Iranians. We were part of Persia but Azeri remained a different culture untill this day. The word Azerbaycan means in acient Avesta language; Land of the Eternal Flame. That comes from Zerdost religion. But Zerdost religion was also started somewere in Medes Empire. We are Turkish but also Persians. We have great history with Persia, and later on with Turkish.</p>

<p>Iran = Azeri not in refurse, 51&amp; of current Iran are all Azeri and live in North Iran also called South Azerbaycan. Azerbaycan is a Avestian word which means Land of the Eternal Flame. Avestian language was started in Azerbaycan territory in Medes Empire! This is referring to ancient relgion -&gt; Zorastrianism.</p>
<p>Iran is a new name and is no longer the country of Persian but Azeri, Kurds and Persians! Thats why they changed the name from Persis to Iran.</p>
<p><b>Reply:</b> Iran is not a new name, the Sassanid period it was called Aryanshahr, Time of Darius it was called Aryanam, Iran is derived from Ir (short for Aryan) and An (place of) the Shah then made Iran the official name because the west continued the greek way of Calling it Persia. Iran is not New and only 25-30% of 70 milliuon people are Azeris and then only 20% have Turkish blood. So before you call them Turks or anything else do some research about them. Even the name of the Place is Persian! Medes and Persians are the same race, the tribes split and were related both ethnically and linguistically! --Aryan Khadem 06:56, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no Evidence or proof of any AZ people why is it even in the article? I thought this is a site for knowledge since my article of Turanism is considered disputed etc why is this page not the same?? I can present more evidence to the blocking out of Persian history to this place, and its false name Azerbaijan, invention of the Russians. But I will like this topic to be contrevesal and disputed and a warning put up.</p>
<p>--Aryan Khadem 00:18, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another problem I have is when I go to search and Type Azerbaijan it comes to the Republic of Azerbaijan there should be 2 links either the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Province of Azerbaijan in Iran. not just one link to this disputed name and area. That way we can avoid the arguements and debates and have two differernt pages one for the Republic of Azerbaijan and one for the Province of Azerbaijan!</p>

<b>The word "Azerbaijan," (originally — Aturpatagan in Parthian or Atrpatakan in Old Armenian) is also a confusing term. It never represented a single political or ethnic unit before 1918, being solely a geographic concept, for centuries designating an ancient northern province of today's Iran. Only in the last decade of 1800s, Azeri nationalist intellectuals came up with a controversial idea to hijack the term "Azerbaijan" in order to give a single name to the lands of the present-day Azerbaijani Republic, located to the north of the "original" Azerbaijan. Ironically, if anyone should be rightfully called "Azerbaijani" at that time, they should not have been the proto-Azeri Turkic tribal infiltrators from the sandy plains of Eastern Caspian, but the aboriginal population of present-day "Azerbaijan," i.e. Armenians, Udins, Talishes, Lezgins, Budughs, Tats, etc. All would later become victims of the Azeri policy of forced assimilation and ethnic cleansing.</b> <a href="http://www.cilicia.com/Plagiarism.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.cilicia.com/Plagiarism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cilicia.com/Plagiarism.htm</a></p>

<p>The disputes became so hectic that Azarbayegan proper was called 'Southern Azerbaijan' while Aran and Shiravan were called northern Azerbaijan to deceive the Iranian youth.</p>
<p>Mosavat Party whose real name was 'Mosavat Islamic Democratic Party' was established in 1911 in Baku with the goal of unifying Turks in Asia Minor.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Azeris are NOT Persians</span></h2>
<p>My father is an ethnic Azeri Turk from Hamadan Province and my mother is Persian. Therefore I am not anti-Persian. But I am growing weary of the constant "Farsification" which is the same as "falsification" of Azeri history and culture. South Azerbaijan Azeris are Iranians, yes, but they are NOT Persians. They are Iranian, meaning they have Iranian citizenship. Please let us stop these Persian chauvinist and ethnocentric attempts at denying the existence of Turks in Iran...Azeri is a Turkic language, Azeris are ethnic Turks, and have their own culture as well. Azerbaycanin xalqi fars deyir...menim babam torkdu...o torki danishir...biz torkuz....qanmirsanmi? Azeriler ise Qashqaylar=tork milleti. I support autonomy (but not secession or total independence) for Iran's Azeri provinces (East/West Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Zanjan, and Hamadan provinces). But why should young Azeri children in Tabriz have to learn arithmetic, geography and science in Persian, a language that does not come naturally to them, instead of Azeri? Why does the Iranian government prohibit the Azeri language to be taught in schools? Iranian Azeris do not hate Persians...both share a common Shi'ite faith, and Iranian nationality, but as long as Iran denies her Azeri people their linguistic and cultural rights, and ignores their legitimate aspirations as a separate ethnic group, more of us will gravitate towards Baku. I come from a mixed Azeri-Persian family, and millions of Azeris have married Persians, since they are both Shi'ite correligionists and compatriots. But I am tired of Iran's government stifling Azeri language and culture. Azeri should be declared Iran's second official language. Given the fact that there are 35 million Azeris in Iran, that would only be fair. Yashasin xalqimiz, yashasin torpaqimiz, yashasin dilimiz. --- Well I really doubt your mother is Persian. But as per your arguments, I think you have mixed the definition of ethnic/origin and language. A language like English is spoken by many people, most of them who are not ethnic English. Azarbaijanis are also Iranians, but they speak Turkic language. I do not think there is any prohibition of languages being thought, but the Iraniang government is responsible to teach the official languages, else there are literally hunders of small dialects in Iran and many villages have their own dialects which is not understood in the neighboring villages. I have been to Hamadan and the majority of people there speak Persian and the Luri dialect. Turkic is spoken in the northern parts of Hamadan , but the city is Persian speaking. Also I doubt the 35 million number that some people claim. For most parts for example West Azarbaijan speaks Kurdish languages (except in around oroomiyeh which is a mixed city). With all this diversity, the need for a common language is natural and in the 1906 constitutional revolution, Persian was chosen as the official language.</p>
<p>Well, sorry to disappoint you but my mother is Persian, a Mazandarani born in Sari in fact. Did I claim the city of Hamadan was Azeri speaking? Did I say my father was from Hamadan city? If you have in fact been to Hamadan province, you would know it is over 60 percent Azeri speaking. South of Kabudar Ahang and in the Razan areas, Famenin area (my father's native area), and in most parts of the province, Azeri is spoken. Hamadan Province is the southernmost part of historical Azerbaijan, and it was a tactic of the Iranian government to carve out yet another province of this integral part of Azerbaijan.</p>
<p><br />
==Well this is where you are wrong. Because 1/3 of the population of Hamadan province lives in Hamadan city and 90% speak Persian or a close dialect. Also Nahavand, Towiskaran, Malayer and Asad-Abad are mainly Persian/Lur speaking. The Azari percentage in Hamadan is about 2/5 of what you claim. See this article for details: <a href="http://www.hamedanpolitic.ir/Group.aspx" class="external free" title="http://www.hamedanpolitic.ir/Group.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.hamedanpolitic.ir/Group.aspx</a></p>
<p>As you can see Azari turkish is insignificant in Hamadan city, Malayer, Nahavand, Towiskaran and only 20% in Asad-abad. So if you do the math, the majority of Hamadan province is Persian and the next largest group are Indo-Iranian groups like Lurs/Kurds. Turkic is about 25%. Azari Turkic is small minority in Hamadan, since the three provinces it is predominate (Bahar, Kabudar-Ahang, Razan) are not densly populated relative to the rest of province.</p>

i know that to east of the kurdistan province azeris are in the majority, but still they are are minority in the province but there is no way , that west azerbaijan has only a minority of kurds , counting less then 300.000 we are in the majority in western azerbaijn , especially , in the mountains and tothe south of the province , in the region mukriyan i am from there and i am really pissed off with you turks you turks claim always everything for you in turkey , wich i do not know has up to 20 millions kurds , they were not exised until several years ago , in cyprus , the turks talked always about making about 35% of the population , only to find out , that after the occupation of cyprus by turkey , they made really less then 20% of the total population , the same story for kerkuk i remember how they claimed that kerkuk has a 80% turkish majority, and kurds arent there , only outsiders , and thre were two elections , both times , the kurdish parties gained over 60% of the votes and there was no turqoman boycott , it is always your ,i do not how to decribe it , approach that is ultra nationalistic and facistic , by denying always others and stripping off our rights , how does it come where were the three millions turqomans in iraq , nowhere of course , because they are only several hundreds thousands you azeris do the same with us ,azerbaijan , tradionelly was the soviet state with the biggest kurdih community , there are officially only 10.000 kurds how come , everyone that there several hundreds thousands , still living thre , of course a lot were deported or left to russia , but still in 1923 there 60.000 kurds , and today , they are only 10.000 hahahahaha, what a joke , the big joke ,that in every census , kurds were lesser then before , given the fact , that kurds tend to have one of the highest birthrates on the planet , it is really a joke now you azeris start the same with the west azerbaijan province , you aim is to illegimate us , even before , we have asked for our right</p>

<dd>It doesn't matter which one is the most common. Both of them are reffered as <i>Azerbaijan</i> and <i>Iranian Azerbaijan</i> is not negligible (compared to <i>Republic of Azerbaijan</i>). Indeed, <i>Iranian Azerbaijan</i> is greater (in terms of both area and population). Google results can not be a base for avoiding the disambiguation. For example, if you search for America, most of the results are related to <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>.

<dl>
<dd>It does matter, actually. Think about all the articles that link to <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, about 99% of them are refering to the country. Since the spelling "Azerbaijan" more commonly refers to the country, the less common meaning should be in a little note at the top of the <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> article, we shouldn't have to go out of our way to stress the less common one. --<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> 22:04, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In that case, <i>Azarbaijan</i> should be about the region in Iran. We either should have disambiguation pages for both or have short titles for both. <a href="../../../b/i/d/User%7EBidabadi_cdd5.html" title="User:Bidabadi">Bidabadi</a> 11:05, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Still I don’t understand what’s wrong with having articles called <i>Azerbaijan</i> and <i>Iranian Azerbaijan</i>. It’s been like that for ages.

<dd>I'm unsure that the above proposal is necessary: the <i>status quo</i> seems sufficient ... with tweaks. By most accounts, the simpler rendition <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> unambiguously and <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">commonly refers</a> to the country; while not incorrect, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Azerbaijan_5916.html" title="Republic of Azerbaijan">Republic of Azerbaijan</a> seems extraneous. As well, if the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Azerbaijan_db8d.html" title="Iranian Azerbaijan">Iranian Azerbaijan</a> article is correct, the mere title of that article is unambiguous and little would be served by moving it. I don't believe there is a double-standard at play, since that implies the title of this article is ambiguous: conversely, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> significantly differ because the simplest forms are <i>easily</i> confused for political or geographic entities that coincide and are otherwise contentious.</dd>
<dd>If anything, the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> page should be retrofitted to clarify matters, but the articles remain entitled as they are. Thus:

<dd>Actually, the situation for Azerbaijan and Macedonia is very similar. Also, in most of the related pages in English Wikipedia (such as <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Azerbaijan_7da2.html" title="History of Azerbaijan">History of Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijani_literature.html" title="Azerbaijani literature">Azerbaijani literature</a> and <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijani_people.html" title="Azerbaijani people">Azerbaijani people</a>), Azerbaijan referes to both the country and the region inside Iran. <a href="../../../b/i/d/User%7EBidabadi_cdd5.html" title="User:Bidabadi">Bidabadi</a>
<dl>
<dd>I somewhat disagree and, apparently, so do a few other editors. <i>Historically</i>, Azerbaijan formed a greater region of Persia until the early 19th century, when the northern part was ceded to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>. Currently, however, the Republic of Azerbaijan and Iranian Azerbaijan are distinct and not co-terminous. (For example, the <i><a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a></i> doesn't even include a separate entry for the Iranian sub/region, describing the situation in its entry for the country.) Conversely, the greater region of Macedonia currently subsumes/includes the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28Greece%29_f0f8.html" title="Macedonia (Greece)">the Greek subregion</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">others</a> ... and the republic, upon its admission to the UN, adopted a provisional title due to Greek protests over the name. Similarly, the <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">isle of Ireland</a> is shared between <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">(the Republic of) Ireland</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>. And take a peek at <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>/<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australia (continent)</a>/<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Australia (disambiguation)">Australia (disambiguation)</a> for another example ... the first is not entitled as per its political name (<a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Australia_f3c2.html" title="Commonwealth of Australia">Commonwealth of Australia</a>; redirect) due to prevailing usage. And all of these have DABs.</dd>
<dd>Any references in Wp regarding both country and subregion should be enhanced depending on context and to promote clarity. If anything, this begs for the creation of an article entitled Azerbaijan (region) treating the country and Iranian subregion together. Otherwise, I defer to my prior comments.

<p>One thing which is crucial to understand here is that the Azarbaijan of Iran is actually the mainland of Azarbaijan, not the other way around. The center of mass both in terms of population, and in terms of history, is what is referred to as Iranian Azarbaijan. The historical Azarbaijan also includes the Iranian provinces of Zanjan, Ardabil, Qazvin, and even Nakhchivan. If there were to be any unification, the capital would be <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabriz.html" title="Tabriz">Tabriz</a>, not Baku. Therefore, traditionally and historically, "Azarbaijan" referred to the Iranian side, not the northern side, which is a recent artificial creation. I therefore also would have to agree that "<a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>" should not go to the "Republic of Azerbaijan", but should go to a disambig page.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 13:15, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, I just read what everyone wrote and there are many good points. The main problems are that there are two Azerbaijans, one under Iran and one that is a country. Initially, I was thinking that Grandmaster is correct and he makes some valid points, but then I looked up Azerbaijan in Encyclopedia Americana and it lists Azerbaijan in Iran first and then went to the Republic of Azerbaijan. Now, obviously, we all are aware of the two, but the average American or European may not even know of another Azerbaijan. A disambiguation page would only help to inform that there are two Azerbaijans, but the most common usage is the country which would be first in the listing of a disambiguation page and thus a reader could automatically see which usage is the most common. In addition, just as South or Iranian Azerbaijan goes to that page, Republic of Azerbaijan could go to the country as well. Keep in mind that what we want to do is make sure that readers know as much as possible. The term Turk is most commonly applied to <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_people.html" title="Turkish people">Turkish people</a> and thus required a disambiguation page. My alternative suggestion would be either a separate article on the collective Azerbaijan or something in the opening paragraph that points to there being an Iranian Azerbaijan that is contiguous with the modern country.

<p>I think that to redirect "<a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>" to a country called "Republic of Azerbaijan" is ignoring the rights of the majority Azeris living outside that Republic to call their home Azerbaijan. And thats not right.</p>
<p>It automatically implies centrality for the "Republic of Azerbaijan" as the center of "Azerbaijana", making Iranian Azerbaijan sound like a detached <i>south part of the republic</i>. Whereas in reality, the republic is actually the <i>north part of the real Azerbiajan</i> (based in Iran).</p>
<p>It's like as if tomorrow, some country is established calling itself "Republic of Europe", and then the next day we redirect "<a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>" to that republic's article, instead of refering to the region and continent.</p>
<p>The "country" Azerbaijan did not even exist up until 15 years ago. The region of Azarbaijan has however existed for centuries.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 21:21, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Doesn't it justify having a disambiguation page under the title <i>Azerbaijan</i>? <a href="../../../b/i/d/User%7EBidabadi_cdd5.html" title="User:Bidabadi">Bidabadi</a> 20:46, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Does that article from old Britannica somehow prove that the most common meaning nowadays is not the independent Azerbaijan? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 20:51, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This is a historical reference (as above) to <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Azerbaijan_db8d.html" title="Iranian Azerbaijan">Iranian Azerbaijan</a> (actually within '<a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a>') and it should be enhanced or treated within that context. My more <i>current</i> edition of <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> (and I was blessed to have been provided with the print version a few years back) indicates the republic and discretely details the two Iranian provinces. I've also reflected these in the DAB and alternate spellings too.E Pluribus Anthony | <a href="../../../e/_/p/User_talk%7EE_Pluribus_Anthony_adc5.html" title="User talk:E Pluribus Anthony"><i>talk</i></a> | 20:54, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How about this: <a href="http://wwwa.britannica.com/eb/article-9011538" class="external free" title="http://wwwa.britannica.com/eb/article-9011538" rel="nofollow">http://wwwa.britannica.com/eb/article-9011538</a> <a href="../../../b/i/d/User%7EBidabadi_cdd5.html" title="User:Bidabadi">Bidabadi</a> 20:55, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As above; I believe this is accommodated for in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Azerbaijan_db8d.html" title="Iranian Azerbaijan">Iranian Azerbaijan</a>, with the two titular Iranian provinces, and the DAB. E Pluribus Anthony | <a href="../../../e/_/p/User_talk%7EE_Pluribus_Anthony_adc5.html" title="User talk:E Pluribus Anthony"><i>talk</i></a> | 21:21, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is under the title Azerbaijan and is about <i>Iranian Azerbaijan</i>. So, even if we only consider the current version of Britannica, it shows the necessity of having a disambiguation page under the title <i>Azerbaijan</i>. <a href="../../../b/i/d/User%7EBidabadi_cdd5.html" title="User:Bidabadi">Bidabadi</a> 21:40, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There are others things to consider, as already stated above, for reasons to <i>not</i> do so – namely, common usage. Actually, this might beg for retitling <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Azerbaijan_db8d.html" title="Iranian Azerbaijan">Iranian Azerbaijan</a> to <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan_%28Iran%29_b612.html" title="Azerbaijan (Iran)">Azerbaijan (Iran)</a> or even <a href="../../../a/z/a/Azarbaijan_%28Iran%29_444b.html" title="Azarbaijan (Iran)">Azarbaijan (Iran)</a> (as per the rendition of the province articles in Wp). And I don't think I can comment any further.

<dd>OK. Although I prefer having a disambiguation page under the title <i>Azerbaijan</i>, I don't continue the discussion (It's been already too long). So, please implement your proposal. <a href="../../../b/i/d/User%7EBidabadi_cdd5.html" title="User:Bidabadi">Bidabadi</a> 22:17, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you are really considering to change <i>Azerbaijan</i> into <i>Azerbaijan Republic</i> then we should make to double standards for Iran either. We should then also change Iran into <i>Islamic Republic of Iran</i>. By the way the Azerbaijai regions in Iran are knowns as <i>East Azerbaijan</i> and <i>West Azerbaijan</i> in general its called <i>South-Azerbaijan</i>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBaku87_076f.html" title="User:Baku87">Baku87</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBaku87_48e5.html" title="User talk:Baku87">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Baku87_d2ed.html" title="Special:Contributions/Baku87">contribs</a>) 20:27, 14 April 2006.</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AZERIS ARE NOT TURKS</span></h2>
<p>I am an Azeri and I am not a Turk I am an Iranian. 75%-80% of the worlds Azeris live in Iran and the majority consider themselves Iranians. Many Iranian clerics are Azeris, including the Suprmeme Leader. Much of the militaries commanders are Azeris including a vast spectrum of civil servants and government workers. Professor Mossadegh the nationalist Prime Minister of Iran was an Azeri and a proud Iranian nationalist. The list goes on and on. The people in Iran who fight pan-Turkism are mostly Azeris and Azeris are the strongest defenders of Iranian unity. The Reoublic of Azerbaijan has only been divided from Iran for about 170 years. Remember that. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.196.139.250.html" title="User:69.196.139.250">69.196.139.250</a> 04:31, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And Im an Azeri from Baku who is not a Farsi (Iranian) but a Turk. Why are you farsi trying to claim we are farsis??? WE ARE NOT farsi.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We are not "Farsi"s, but we are sure as hell Iranian. Iran has been run by Azeris in the past 500 years, if not more. Khamenei, Pahlavis, Qajars, Safavids, all were originally Azeri Iranians.</dd>

<dd>I am an Azeri too and I have never ever considered myslef a Turk. The Republic of Azerbaijan was a part of Iran and it will become a part of Iran again. MOst the people here who pretend to be Azeris are actually from Turkey trying to spread their Turkush propganada.
