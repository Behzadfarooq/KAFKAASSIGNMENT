<p>I would like to attract the attention of administrators and visitors to this matter. Every time I edit a page, ranging from <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musavat.html" title="Musavat">Musavat</a>, <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan_Democratic_Republic_5183.html" title="Azerbaijan Democratic Republic">Azerbaijan Democratic Republic</a>, <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_name_Azerbaijan_5c27.html" title="History of the name Azerbaijan">History of the name Azerbaijan</a> to <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safavid_Dynasty_a516.html" title="Safavid Dynasty">Safavid Dynasty</a>, <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">User:Azerbaijani</a> keeps inserting "pan-Turkist and pan-Islamist Musavat" referencing a flag website that does not say so, and Armenian sources of Prof. Hovanissian, who is clearly a POV source in case of Azerbaijan. So, please, address the issue. My belief is that the quote is relevant only on <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musavat.html" title="Musavat">Musavat</a> page which gives a long account of nature of Musavat Party. So inserting this grossly misinterpreted and POV quotes on every page is clearly POV attack tactic. I made major contributions to the article with scholarly references few days ago, yet again this gross and out of context quote is inserted. I ask Azerbaijani to justify the placement of this quote with POV references on this page. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 16:38, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You do not own wikipedia, and I can insert sourced information where ever it is relevant. Secondly, Adil baguirov asked me to put those sources in.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 17:56, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I copy these excerpts from the post of Alan Kaim, owner of milliondollarbabies.com at the <a href="../../../a/z/e/Talk%7EAzerbaijan_c54f.html" title="Talk:Azerbaijan">Talk:Azerbaijan</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>None of my summaries are meant as reference material since I have not listed any particular sources, and this should be obvious</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The only rational voice in the crowd seems to be Grandmaster, who stated that, "And as it was pointed out, sources like "milliondollarbabies.com" are not academic, and should not be used to support such allegations as those included in the article</i>." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Azerbaijan#Etymology_and_usage" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Azerbaijan#Etymology_and_usage" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>As you can see from the above, the owner of the website objects to the use of his website as a reference in wikipedia and states that his resource is not meant as a reference material. He agreed with me that his website should not be used for such purposes. Despite that Azerbaijani keeps on including his claims with reference to that website. It is time to stop, or I will have to contact the website owner, so that he spoke with the wiki admins to put an end to this abuse. Hovanissian is also not acceptable as a reference in this particular article for evident bias. And Roshvald, which also was used as a source, does not support your claims. So Azerbaijani, please stop it already. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 10:24, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>first of all 6 sources that you mention is either biased or not profeesional or you distorted them. as mentioned above by another user in some of this sorces there is not such references. million dollar babies is not a valid source to be cited, and please go to Rasulzade talkpage where a user clled Adil bagirov explained you that How Musavat is not panturkist and panislamist. and if you are not biased and if you think you are a fighter for a justice, <b>I ask you to show a panislamist or panturkist clause or provision in its first and only covenant accepted in 1917.</b> <a href="../../../e/l/s/User%7EElsanaturk_57d3.html" title="User:Elsanaturk">Elsanaturk</a> 22:09, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Azerbaijani, please, refrain from attacking users by baselessly calling them sockpuppeteers. This is really non-constructive and does not contribute to improvement of Wiki articles. You seem to have made no contribution to this article in particular, but only involved in reverts, edit wars and insertion of a single irrelevant quote. Now:
<dl>
<dd>1. Please, provide exact quotes from the articles you indicated, where it says that Musavat was pan-Turkist or pan-Islamist. Also, quotes from Armenian authors, such as Dekmejian and Simonian, as well as Hovanissian and Giragossian are not acceptable, as those are clearly POV and are very biased against Azerbaijan or anything related to it. This is told even by Dr. Kazemzadeh, indeed a top expert on ADR period. Michael Croissant, with all due respect to him, falls into the same category as those above mentioned. So your sources must be impartial, and must be scholarly.</dd>
<dd>2. The program of Musavat is posted on its Wiki page <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musavat.html" title="Musavat">Musavat</a>, thanks to some contributors. No one denies that Musavat played with ideas of cultural Turkism (not pan-Turkism, Musavat did not aspire the creation of Turanic empire, but only revival of cultural Turkism ideas in Azerbaijan). Its program, again on <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musavat.html" title="Musavat">Musavat</a> page, clearly spells that it desires equal rights to all Muslim of the world, no where does it call for creation of Muslim empire either.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So your references to pan-Turkic or pan-Islamic do not hold water, as Musavat simply did not have a plan of creation of a super empire of Turkic or Islamic peoples. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 23:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They don't. I said that Musavat initially supported pan-Turkic (not-Panturkist) ideas, but eventually became an Azerbaijani nationalist party. Moreover, I supported this by sources, which you now try to misinterpret. Also, please explain why you keep on adding milliondollarbabies.com back to the article? The owner of the website told you that you should not do that, he said that I was right by saying that it should not be used. Elsanaturk was absolutely right when he removed it from the article. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 16:53, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There are more sources than just the million dollar baby, and your still stuck on that? We can remove that one source, but that does not change the fact that this information will stay and that it is heavily sourced. The Musavat party was Pan Turkist, and Mahmud Rasulzadeh was a pan Turk.

<p>User "Azerbaijani". I said to you bring a clause from Musavat covenant, you did not bring, but you are holding your biased sources as a blind. instead I bring clauses from that covenanat which show that you are absolutely prejudiced and intentionally harm our articles.</p>

<p>I reverted your additions because its obvious POV whats your excuse for changing "Armenian Genocide" to "Armenian massacres in Ottoman Empire" thats very unusual. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">Artaxiad</a> 02:34, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not all you did. You restored sources like "milliondollarbabies.com" and others, so I roll it back.

</dd>
<dd>Although some of my edits, which <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">user:Artaxiad</a> for some reason reverted, have been restored, but not all. First, I don't understand why was this rv'ed: "However, despite Wilson's attitude, on January 12, 1920, the Allied Supreme Council extended <i>de facto</i> recognition to Azerbaijan, along with Georgia, and ahead of Armenia." Not only do I give a more precise date, 12 January, but this wording is preffered to "suddenly" -- why is it "suddenly", when delegations have been working for months to secure that de facto recognition? In native literature, they describe it as "finally", not "suddenly".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Additionally, isn't it an overkill to cite 6 references about Musavat's Pan-whatever ideology? Especially having a "flag" website as reference, looks very much credible and scholarly. Not.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Then, Mehmandarov, like Shikhlinsky, was a General (and both were full generals of artillery), and that is both a rank and a title, and should be mentioned, just like other honorific and educational titles and ranks are mentioned in English tradition: "President", "Dr", "Minister", "Secretary", "Prof", etc. Likewise, Shikhlinky was Mehmandarov's Deputy Minister in ADR -- that should be mentioned too. I.e., they were not ordinary generals, but the two highest ranked one's.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, "Armenian genocide" is not relevant to the text and cannot apply to the massacre of Azerbaijanis in March 1918 in Baku. To begin with, neither the word genocide existed, nor have the Armenian casualties been high till then (e.g., even in 1919 article in the London Times, the leader of the Armenian delegation to Paris Peace Conference, Boghos Nubar, wrote about 300,000 deaths - and no mention of Turkish and Kurdish deaths, or Azerbaijani, for that matter), especially considering that Eastern Turkey was occupied by Russians, with the help of Armenians, until 1917 or so. Neither does Encyclopedia Britannica use that description -- they use my wording, "massacres in Ottoman Empire". Finally, and most importantly, that reasoning was NEVER given by Shaumyan, or any Bolshevik or even Dashnak leader! In other words, there is no factual, verifiable basis for this claim. And while there is a reference to p. 14 of Michael Croissant's book, he is not a historian, and it shows -- he writes: "most of them refugees who had fled the <b>Turkish genocide</b> in eastern Anatolia". As you can see, there is no mention of "Armenian genocide". And Prof. Swietochowski does not use the word "genocide" or 'genocidal' anywhere in his book either, according to a Google search. Hence it makes sense to change this POV to a NPOV wording. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 08:57, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>There is nothing POV about my edits -- but yours clearly are, as you admit (not that it matters) that both Swietochowski and Croissant don't use the word "Armenian genocide" or even genocidal. Neither did Shaumyan say this anywhere. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">adil</a> 05:58, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once again, neither Swietochowski, nor Croissant use the word "Armenian genocide" -- and it would be completely inappropriate for 1918, especially since it were Armenians who militarily occupied Eastern Turkey at the time, and killed a great many Kurds and Turks, as well as Azerbaijanis. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">adil</a> 06:05, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to see a source that claims that the massacre of Azerbaijanis in March was a “revenge for Armenian genocide’. I don’t see other sources agreeing with that. For example, Tadeusz Swietochowski says:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Just as Turkey was poised to become the dominant power in the region, the Baku Dashnakist forces, which included many of the refugees from Anatolia, staged a sudden and unprovoked massacre of the city's Muslims. The debacle lasted from March 31 until April 2 and resulted in at least 3,000 fatalities, many of whom were Iranians. Armenian historians do not offer an explanation for the political calculations behind this move, which was bound to entail terrible retribution, and they hint rather at an uncontrollable emotional outburst. Such an interpretation would confirm the view of the weakness of the Armenian leadership, which had just concluded an agreement with the Muslims on neutrality in their coming confrontation with the Bolsheviks, and they proved to be unable to restrain the rank and file. Likewise, it would confirm the lack of coordination with the Armenian efforts at putting together the Transcaucasian Federation. The immediate beneficiary of the Baku March Days were the Bolsheviks, who seized the opportunity to institute in the city a dictatorship of the proletariat under the name of the Baku Commune. The local Sovnarkom (Council of People's Commissars) was headed by a prominent Armenian Bolshevik, Stepan Shaumian, who proclaimed its undivided loyalty and subordination to Soviet Russia. In the Azeri mind, the Baku Commune became the bitter symbol of the Bolshevik - Armenian collusion born out of the March Days bloodbath</i>.</dd>
