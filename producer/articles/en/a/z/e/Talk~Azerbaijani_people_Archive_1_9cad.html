<h2><span class="mw-headline">Azeris Are NOT Indo-European</span></h2>
<p>I'm an Iranian Azeri.But I don't think that Azeris are ethically indo-european.</p>
<p>Azeris are descendents of turk people ( Oghuz Turks). Unfortunatey most iranian azeris think they are ethnically IRANIAN!!! due to political propaganda.</p>
<p><b>Iranian</b> is not an ethnological term. Iran is a country and <b>iranian</b> means the one who belongs to iran country despite of the ethnical specialities. then southern azeris ( azeris of iran) are iranian , but they are not indo-european.</p>
<p>All azeris (in Azerbaijan rep. or other countries) are ethnically Turkic. Their Morphological factors and genetic are very similar to turkic people (such as <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxillary.html" title="Maxillary">maxillary</a> bone type or other special facts).</p>
<p>NO One has a good reason to prove that azeris are persian, or indo-european sub-group.</p>
<p>People of Iran are from various ethnic groups such as <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">arabs</a>, <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurd.html" title="Kurd">kurds</a>, <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azeri.html" title="Azeri">azeris</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkmen.html" title="Turkmen">turkmens</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/r/Lur.html" title="Lur">lurs</a> as well as persians. THEY ALL ARE IRANIAN, but they are not totally persian or indo-european.--<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Hamed_60df.html" title="User:Dr.Hamed">Dr.Hamed</a> 22:09, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just look in the face of Azeris and Persians and then look at the Turkic <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazakh.html" title="Kazakh">Kazakh</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkmen.html" title="Turkmen">Turkmen</a>, then you will understand why Azeris are Iranian in stock. Apart from this all the historical evidence show they are Iranians who lost their language to Turkic. It is a well-documented fact.</dd>

<p>MR MANI1:</p>
<p>Don't change my talk headline, it is talk page, and I can say my opinion with my own headline for my Talk. You can't change my sentence "Azeris are not indo-european" to your own "Azeris are indo-european". understand?</p>
<p>and about the morphological facts: In small towns and villages of azerbaijan (where the ethnical mixtures are rare) you can see people with typical Turkish faces. their beard and maxillary bone structure and other facial and anatomical factors. I'm a medicine studentd in Tabriz.Azeri cadavers are compeltely different with Persian ones, even in arterial branches.</p>
<p>Your reason "Just look", is not a scientific reason.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Indo-European" is not an ethnicity. It is a language group. Azeris do not speak an Indo-European language. Western Turks are did not mix with Mongolians and that is why they do not exhibit mongolian traits. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverageTurkishJoe_c916.html" title="User:AverageTurkishJoe">AverageTurkishJoe</a> 03:13, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dear Admin</span></h2>
<p>This is the last time I am visiting this page as I find it very biased. The majority of accepted history versions here are coming from Iranians towards a turkic republics). Azeris are not an iranic people neither are related. We are a turkic people. Shohreh aghdashloo or most the other Iranians being fabricated into Azerbaijani history by the government sponsored propaganda of the Iranian diaspora and iri. Search up most of these names like Shohreh aghdashloo and googoosh that have been labelled as azerbaijanis and you will see that they represent Iranians in American show business. They represent Iran not Azerbaijan. I don't care about the so-called self- proclaimed south Azerbaijan. Just lay your hands off our country and stop accusing Azeris when your own self- proclaimed Iranian "Azerbaijan"'s problems. There is only one Azerbaijan republic. Look in the un, one Azerbaijan. Iranians do not represent Azerbaijan. A poll in Azerbaijan indicated that 86% of the country wants an alliance with turkey. Iran got 2% vote, Russia 9% and none 3%. So lay off&#160;!! And stop trying to represent everything azeri as Iranian to the world. You should have seen the streets in baku during world cup soccer 2002 when turkey became 3rd, joy and parties everywhere. The streets were crowded and people screaming "turkiye-asazerbaycan". Tabi Yeter Issizler</p>
<p>Take it easy, man... Before second half of 20th century Iranians had no influence on ezternal view of the area. If you think that you right support your opinions properly.<a href="../../../y/e/t/User%7EYeti_d9d6.html" title="User:Yeti">Yeti</a> 22:19, 9 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">I'm an Azeri from Iran</span></h2>
<p>Azeris speak a Turkic language but they are, just like the Persians, an Indo-Iranian ethnicity. Some Azeris resent Persian chauvinism, but for the overwhelming majoirity, the identification with Iran is exceptionally strong. The fact that many of Iran's rulers, from the Safavid dynasty to the Qajars, were Azeris, or the fact that the current "Supreme Leader" is also Azeri, I am sure does make the notion that Iran is somehow an "alien" land bizzare for us. There are twice as many Azeris in Iran than there are in Azerbaijan. Most of Iranian national heroes like Sattar Khan, Bagher Khan and even Dr. Mosadegh were Azeri. Azerbaijan is Iran. It's the birthplace of Zartosht (Zorastor). - Yalda</p>
<p>Why does no one talk about Azeri Genocide? It is much more important than the contraversy about whether azeris are turk or not! Azeri Genocide by Armenians should be the backbone of Azeri nationality and history. It happened a decade ago and still occupies 20 percent of Azerbaijan under occupation and we let the world to turn a blind eye on this topic. Come n guys.</p>

<p>I guess, I'm the only Azerbaijani/Azeri here, and I pretty much agree that the article has got completely messed up. Shallot, Shohreh Aghdashloo IS Azerbaijani, no matter what others say. It's obvious even from her name, which can be easily translated from Azeri: "agh" - white, "dash" - stone, "loo" - one of the typical endings for an Azeri lastname. Same with Googoosh. Her parents were originally from Baku and they emigrated to Iran in early 1950s, i.e. before she was actually born. Azerbaijanis of Iran are the majority of today's world's Azerbaijanis. You have no right to call them "self-proclaimed" or "false".</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Other Turkic Peoples</span></h3>
<p>Other <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic peoples</a> who have inhabited Azerbaijan besides those labeled as the <b>Oghuz Turks</b> (majority population in Azerbaijan in the 10th and 11th centuries) were the <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythians.html" title="Scythians">Scythians</a> and Massagets (both reffered to as Ishkuz) Salars, <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avars.html" title="Avars">Avars</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huns.html" title="Huns">Huns</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/k/Gok-Turks_8f75.html" title="Gok-Turks">Gok-Turks</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barsils.html" title="Barsils">Barsils</a>, Saragurs, Kurtugurs, <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khazars.html" title="Khazars">Khazars</a> and the <a href="../../../i/l/k/Ilkhanids.html" title="Ilkhanids">Ilkhanids</a>. The ancient civilizations of the land such as that of Sumer, Elam, Urartu, Mannai, Media and Albania were inhabited by Ural-Altaic (proto-Turkic) peoples. It should be noted that under <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongol.html" title="Mongol">Mongol</a> pressure in the <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13th century</a>, Turkic tribes under the Ilkhanid banner also settled in large numbers in Azerbaijan to escape Mongol persecution.</p>
<p><br />
1. There are no proofs that Turkic peoples constituted a majority of polulation n 10th century. 2. There is commonly accepted that Scythians ans Massagetes were Iranian tribes. This is suppotred by available historical records, archeological findings, language analisis etc. Theories supported by some Turkic scientists about their Turkic origins are not supported by any serious proofs. The first documented Turkic settlemtnt of the sorrounding areas occured after 4th century. 3. Claim that <i>Sumer, Elam, Urartu, Mannai, Media and Albania were inhabited by Ural-Altaic (proto-Turkic) peoples</i> can not be supported by mainstream science.</p>
<p>To summarise: This is a nationalistic bias, which has nothing to do with history.</p>
<p>Azeri is the ethnicity, Azerbaijani is the nationality (aka citizenship) There is also a region in northern Iran that is called Azerbaijan.</p>
<p><br />
I removed the following sentence&#160;: <i>Most Azeris are businessmen (Vahid Alekperov, the head of "LukOil"), lawyers (<a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirin_Ebadi_31ee.html" title="Shirin Ebadi">Shirin Ebadi</a>, the Noble Prize winner), musicians (<a href="../../../a/z/i/Aziza_Mustafa_Zadeh_698e.html" title="Aziza Mustafa Zadeh">Aziza Mustafa Zadeh</a>), actors (<a href="../../../s/h/o/Shohreh_Aghdashloo_fdcd.html" title="Shohreh Aghdashloo">Shohreh Aghdashloo</a>, "The House of Sand and Fog", the Oscar nominee), and scientists (<a href="../../../l/o/t/Lotfi_Zadeh_9c7b.html" title="Lotfi Zadeh">Lotfi Zadeh</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Javan_2444.html" title="Ali Javan">Ali Javan</a>).</i> While i have no doubt that these people are important, I have stumbled over the begin of the sentence "<i>Most Azeri are...</i>". Are there no carpenters, shoemakers, plumbers or farmers among Azeris??? Please reformulate into something more sensible. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 21:10, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do regret the removal of the "Garden of Eden" remark. It was one of the most endearing features of this article&#160;:-). No, seriously - how important is this as a e.g. national myth? Is there actually a concrete place e.g. pilgrimage destination for the Garden of Eden or something similar - If yes, however fanciful the connection might be I think it should be part of the article. If on the other hand this was simply a remark, based on a superficial/wishful reading of the Bible to say - "You thought we are small but we are really SOOOO big!", then yes let us forget it. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 10:36, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I had never heard anything of the Garden of Eden thing, and I'm almost sure there is no national pilgrimage site or anything like that for it. It's ridiculous, and I think is really offensive to sane Azeris. A claim like that will ridicule the Azeris, which is not neutral.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When I told that to two of my Azeri colleagues (born in Tabriz and Urumia), they were ashamed. They hadn't heard about it either (while one had heard about the Sumerian thing). If someone has written that "there are also claims that Moses is buried in South Azerbaijan", should have we kept it? <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoozbeh_5649.html" title="User:Roozbeh">roozbeh</a> 14:08, Jul 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well there are all sorts of fanciful claims for all sorts of people's graves etc around. (not just Iran and Azerbaijan) most prophets have a several burial grounds, the Via Dolorosa has AFAIK little connection with the actual route of Jesus on his walk to Golgatha/Calvary and if you put together the available splinters of the true cross you will get a whole forest - hence I would not be too suprised to have someone claiming "Here is where the Garden of Eden was". But thanks for the info anyway. It seems to be better out than in... <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 15:43, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

There are no nations in the world that are pure. Persians themselves are mixtures of 10s of different nations (Assyrian, Scythians, Greeks) and so on. The same with English- they are mixtures of Anglos and Saxons, the same with Italians. So there are no pure nations. However, there is a notion of ethincity. Azeris are ethnically Turks- despite many people here trying to portray them as mixtures of Persians and Turks. There may be mixtures as I said every nation has, however, if the Turkic language prevailed in the Azeri nation then it means their Turkish ethnicity have become very predominant and therefore Azeris cannot be called a mixture of Perisians and Turks. The Azeri nation has no myth of being associated with the Persians. Yes we have always been associated with the state of Iran and Persia but not to the Persians. Azeris throughout history have always been prouf of their Turkish descent and it shows them being Turks by ethnicity! So full stop to this selseless arguments!</p>

<dd>Nope, probably not, as they are guesstimates. The source - myself. I added the widely varying numbers which were hanging around in the various Azarbaijan related articles here on Wikipedia and gave a sum for the lower end (and deducted a bit more) and a further one for the higher end and added a bit more. The numbers were/are widely diverging and this is quite annoying, therefore a better estimate would be highly appreciated. But 'claim' sounds like dishonesty, while estimate says just this - better numbers are needed. At the moment though I think this range is much better than a definite, but inaccurate number as our anonymous friend is banding about. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 13:18, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I am all for getting the balance right, but the reverted-to version had teh advantage of being supporte dby sources, while Tabib's largely is not supported by sources. Also it introduces the term South-Azerbaijan as a fact while the term itself is expression of a POV. Further the classification of the Republic of Azerbaijan as part of the "historic Azerbaijan" annexed and divided is POV, anotehr is that the name has been Transferred" in order to support territorial claims. I am not saying any of this is right or wrong, but a wholesale cull of a version which <i>tried</i> to mention all disputes and all different angles and insertion of one which shows a single POV as the whole truth is a very poor move. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 23:16, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Azeris are not Turks</span></h2>
<p>I am Azeri man. Yet, I have my minor ethnicity group - Talysh. The latter involves people coming from the Southern area of Azerbaijan. These people have almost identical cultural values with Turkic people but the language is different. It is more like Persian. Also, people residing in the Northern area of Azerbaijan who call themselves Azeris, speak Taty and their ethnicity group is Tat. We can conclude that being Azeri does not mean the same as being Turkic except for the language... To illustrate the difference in societal and ethnical roots and convergence in language, I will use the UK example. People in UK, Scottish, Welsh and Irish, all speak English but they would be strongly offended by being called English themselves. In nowadays Azerbaijan, I can see many people who think of themselves as Turkic, but they are not in reality. These people have been raised with the only thought in their minds that they can not ever have their national identity. Seventy years of occupation by Russians and their communist regime made Azeri people speak fluent Russian and ignore their beloved Turkic language. If you got to down-town squares and central streets in Baku, a capital and the largest metropolitan area of Azerbaijan, there are people speaking Russian only, some for fashion dying on the vine... Now the fashion seems to be to speak Turkic which is slightly different from Azeri language. Coming to the soccer game parade following the third tournament position of Turkey's national team, we, people in Azerbaijan, used to cheer up Russians when they played world cups... So let people trying to convince the world that Azeri people are Turkic calm down, and stop confusing everybody. One must have no respect to his country's history or cultural heritage represented by the think-giants such as Fizuly, who was writing mainly in Arabic and Persian, or King (Shah) Ismayil assassinated by Turkic aristocrat, Sultan Salem during the private audience, to ignore the facts and call for the external links with Turks.</p>
<p>P.S. I am an Azeri man, but not Turkic at all.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Dear "Azeri who is not Turkic at all",</b></p>
<p>Azeri, Azerbaijani or Azerbaijani Turk is a name given to or taken by the Turkic speaking population in Azerbaijan Republic, IRI, Turkey and etc. Giving or adopting this name to non-Turkic speaking population of Azerbaijan, IRI and Turkey, especially over Talish, Tats, and etc does not help to imrove the situation at all, but actually serves to the assimiliation of this people. To be called British or Azerbaijani by your citizenship is your right but to ask to be called Azeri by ethnicity is your assimilation. Enough of Kasravi deeds. True, under Soviet rule, as Iranian speaking Talish people of Azerbaijan were taken away from census almost for a 50 years, most of Talish preferred themselves or were "asked" to name themselves "Azerbaijani" when it came to ethnicity. But today, when there is all the freedom you want in chosing your ethnicity, you do not have to name yourself Azeri or Azerbaijani, except the case when it comes to your citizenhsip (when applicable).</p>
<p>Moreover, being accurate and honest fits all people regardless of their nationality, ethnicity or race. I truly did not want to see here lies from any ethnicity about Fuzuli or Shah Ismayil Safavi. First, Fuzuli wrote mostly in his own Turkman Azerbaijani, whereas Shah Ismayil survived Yavuz Sultan Selim by 4 years (!) <b>--<a href="../../../u/l/v/User%7EUlvi_I._7a28.html" title="User:Ulvi I.">Ulvi I.</a> 6 July 2005 12:14 (UTC)</b></p>

Iran/Persia has long been a close friend and ally of the Azeri and proto-Azeri people. However, they have cut our nation in two, preventing an Azeri union. I understand that it is all politics and economics that have permeated this division, but as an ultra-nationalist and an idealist I hope to live to see the day when Azeri can be united again.

<p>The Turkic population of Azerbaijan are not true "Azeris." They are a hodgepodge of mainly Turkified Iranians and nomadics Turks. Prior to the 15th century a true nation of Azerbaijan existed, and it was an Iranian nation in that they spoke an Iranian language (Azeri), had Iranian customs, and shared in Iranian history. This "old Azeri" language was a Northwestern Iranian language, related to Kurdish and Zazaki. The only true Azeris are the Tat and Talysh; the rest are simply Turks, and should just accept that.</p>

<p>To you whom are writing and editing that the azeri are a turkic people have absolutly no scientific or historic basis on this claim, please research on the subject and you will find out that a) they are desendents of the Medes in Persian Maadha, and they have been living in on the Iranian plateue since 1000-700 bc. b) their language have been changed into a turkic dialect in the 12 century AD, but this not change the fact that they are an Iranian people.</p>
<p>your claims are deeply disturbind and have no historical basis, please stop rewriting history in this way, I am myself an azari, and I know my past, I have nothing against turkic people but we share the same language, not the same DNA or culture, we are Iranian!</p>

   A previous analysis of mtDNA variation in the Caucasus found that Indo-European-speaking Armenians and Turkic-speaking
   Azerbaijanians were more closely related genetically to other Caucasus populations (who speak Caucasian languages) than to
   other Indo-European or Turkic groups, respectively. Armenian and Azerbaijanian therefore represent language replacements,
   possibly via elite dominance involving primarily male migrants, in which case genetic relationships of Armenians and 
   Azerbaijanians based on the Y-chromosome should more closely reflect their linguistic relationships. We therefore analyzed
   11 bi-allelic Y-chromosome markers in 389 males from eight populations, representing all major linguistic groups in the Caucasus.
   <b>As with the mtDNA study, based on the Y-chromosome Armenians and Azerbaijanians are more closely-related genetically to their </b>
   <b>geographic neighbors in the Caucasus than to their linguistic neighbors elsewhere</b>. However, whereas the mtDNA results show that
   Caucasian groups are more closely related genetically to European than to Near Eastern groups, by contrast the Y-chromosome 
   shows a closer genetic relationship with the Near East than with Europe.

<p>So, both the mtDNA (female line) and the Y-chromosomes (from father to son) seem to prove the fact, that modern Azeris are predominantly Turkic-speaking Armenians and Iranians. Their DNA has Europeana and Middle Eastern traces, but not Eastern Asian ones , which one would assume if they really were Turks. -213.39.128.63 15:28, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article about the DNA gives some interesting facts, but the conclution above doesn't make sense to me. The DNA article states that both Azerbaijanis and Armenians are predomenately Caucasians (equal to the Caucasian tribes like Lezgi, Udin) and not Indo European (Persian), Armenian or Turk. The traces of Indo European and Near East influence show that there are som woman that have moved (probably with their family) from European tribes and som men (probably warriors or migranst) coming from Near East tribes.</dd>

<p>One has to separate history from reality, and stop attempts to use on to change the other. One has to accept that today, influence of Iran upon Azerbaijan is minuscule comparing to that of Turkey. The reason is obvious, Iran's support for Azerbaijan's worst enemy - Armenia. As long as this condition, along with resulting Azerbaijan's orientation towards U.S. persists, there can be no appreciation in North Azerbaijan of the fact that most of Azeri Turkic brethren live in Iran. The fault is mostly that of Iranian/Persian propaganda machine, whether under Shah or Islamic regime.</p>
<p><br />
But leave alone politics and international relations. We are talking about history. It's impossible to deny that all of peoples/ethnos/cultures that existed on the territory of Azerbaijan have relation to origins of modern Azeri people. Whether it's Caucasian Albanians, Iranian Medes/Atropats, or 1500 years of Turkic brethren, they all are our origins. Nevertheless, I have to question the opinion of a fella who declared below that Azeris are Iranian ethnicity. Ethnicity is defined by language and nothing else, and Azeris are of Turkic ethnicity. Culturally, Azeris share both Iranian and Turkish cultures, as well as any other culture that surrounded or inhabitted Azeri land, this is natural.</p>
<p>Finally, it's incomprehensible to me why current international relations should change the truth of history. This is exactly the pit that Iranian side is falling into. The Islamic regime and its unobvious allies among Iranian Diaspora are trying hard to erase Turkic resemblance in Azeri origin, thinking that this would enforce Iranian unity. Iranian diaspora websites call Azeris as Iranian people, while Turkmens are Turkic? Why? Didn't Turkic Azeris integrate and live in Iranian society for ages by remaining Turkic speakers and Turks? The glory of Iran came under Turkic rulers of Safavi and Qajars. Why should their history be rewritten, changed now just for the sake of some sick ideologists, whose thinking is only limited to ethnicity? This is not right for 21st century, this is something Nazis did 50 years ago and failed.</p>
<p>Similarly, there was a considerable Iranian influence on Azeri history and origins as well, and nothing wrong with that either. Yes, Azeri origins extend to Zoroastrianism, Babak Khorramdin (who is considered a hero in Azerbaijan), Sassanids as well. This is how the culture emerged in mixture with mostly Turkic elements. I think it's beautiful, and Azeris should cherish their origins, rather than fall into Iranian trap of erasing history and rewriting it as either Turkish or Iranian. We, Azeris, do not need to be Turkish or Iranian, we have our own statehood, culture, language, nation, and building upon true and distinct background will help us overcome our enemies whether in Iran, Armenia, Russia or elsewhere, countries that do not want to see Azerbaijan on the world map.</p>

<p>A couple of topics to consider:</p>
<p>1. When talking about azerbaijanis, one should distinguish between those that live in Iran (the majority) who have kept their Iranian heritage much more than citizens of the republic of Azerbaijan. Those azerbaijanis that have lived under Russian influence for the past 150 years are less influenced by the Iranian culture than those living in Iran. So the opinion of the author beneath is only valid for a minority of Azeris.</p>
<p>2. Ethnicity is much more than language; Ethnicity is composed of language, history, culture, traditions, festivals, cousine, etc. If ethnicity was "language and nothing else" as the author beneath suggests then the Brazilians should be considered Portugese since they speak the same language! Ofcourse, anyone who has visited these two countries, knows how meaningless such a notice is! The same is valid about Iranian Azeris, who have a very strong Iranian ethincity.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">I am a Turk of Turkey</span></h2>
<p>And I would like to tell that any statement claiming that "Azeris are of Persian stock" is nothing but hollow Persian propaganda. Iranis know that the largest ethnic group living in Iran are the Turks (Azeri, Afshar, Turkmen etc.) and because of their Turcofobia they are telling these lies to Southern Azerbaijanis. If they are Iranis who have lost their linguistic characteristics by the time of Mongol invasion, i would like to ask "why do not they speak Mongol but Turkish?". The area of Azerbaijan have been a Turkish land for more than a thousand years, and whole area of Iran had been ruled by Turks (Seljuks, Ilkhanids, Timurids, Safavids, Qachars) until Pahlavi dynasty.</p>
<p>Tats, Talysh etc. does not deserve to call themselves as Azerbaijani at all. I myself perfectly know their role in the overthrow of Elchibey.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan is the land where many pan-turkists were born. Ali Bey Hüseynzade, Ebulfeyz Elçibey, Mehmet Emin Resulzade. The greatest poet of Turkish, Fuzuli was also an Azerbaijani.</p>
<p>The anthropologic structure of Oghuz from the other Turkic groups is different. All sub-groups have different characteristics indeed. Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Nogay are of Kipchak group, they have more Mongoloid admixture than Oghuz (Gagauz, Azeri, Turks, Turkmen). This does not change the truth that we are one!</p>

<p>Hi, I don't know how some one would exlude Shah Ismail from being Azerbaijani. He was considered to be of "pure" Turkish descent. I put pure in brackets because, it is impossible to be of any pure blood in such a region, and his maternal grandmother was a princess from Greek Trabzon Empire. But that aside, Safawids are known to be Turkish, the debate about their origins is actually modern and is mostly politic. There is no mention of Kurdish or any other origin of Ismail I. It's just some people can not tolerate the fact that one of the greatest dynasties of Iran was in fact Turkish and now they have thrown this Kurdsih origin theory, which is totally baseless. I also think that the user's comment on Radjabov is appropriate. If he, being Jewish but born and raised in Azerbaijan is considered an Azerbaijani then why not Shah Ismail? Radjabov actually is a native Russian speaker, in which case we have more reason to consider Shah Ismail an Azerbijani than Radjabov. At least Shah Ismail was a native Turkish speaker. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimBits_9563.html" title="User:TimBits">TimBits</a> 01:38, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I read an entry in Encyclopedia Americana which stated that the Safavi family were of Kurdish background, but had assimilated into Azeri culture and spoke Azeri Turkish. This is an unusual case here as the Azeris themselves are largely not of Central Asian background and show the most similarity to the peoples of the Caucasus. To add to the confusion, the Kurds, although speakers of an Iranian language, also cluster closer to the peoples of the Caucasus. In addition, as so many have stated, it's not inconceivable that many Kurds were assimilated into Azeri culture as were the Albanians. I'm not really going to push this issue as it's kind of border-line.</dd>

<dd>I was under the impression that Radjabov was a native Azeri of Jewish religion and not a Russian Jew. Didn't a lot of Azeri Jews (and others in the Caucasus) simply adopt Russian during the Russian Empire and Soviet period rather than being Russian Jews who are distinct? I mean there are native Jews in the Caucasus, so exclusion by religion seems more of a stretch to me than someone who had assimilated from another ethno-linguistic group. Since the Safavis origins seem to be difficult to pin down, I'm not going to press the issue one way or the other, but I am arguing for the inclusion of Radjabov until someone proves to me that he's a Russian transplant. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 04:31, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Radjabov is an ethnic Azeri, but apparently his got some Jewish background as well. In Azerbaijan, and particularly in Baku many people, including ethnic Azeris, speak Russian, it’s a second popular language here, but that doesn’t make the speakers of that language ethnic Russians. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 05:26, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Radjabov is definetely not a Russian Jew. He just learned Russian as a first language and also speaks Azerbaijani, although with some diffiulty. The same is true for many people in Azerbaijan, including the children of Ilham Aliyev, the president. Even if he was Russian ethnically, I would still consider him Azerbaijani. He was born and raised there and represents Azerbaijan. My point though is that, if Radjabov, being Jewish and speaking Russian as a first language is considered Azerbaijani then, no one can say that Shah Ismail does not belong to Azerbaijani people. Even if we accept that his ancestory was Kurdish, this does not change anything. He is more associated with Azerbaijani Turks than Kurds. This does not mean that he should not be considered Iranian at the same time. Most of the Azerbaijanis are Iranians. So, I would say, keep Shah Ismail's picture. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimBits_9563.html" title="User:TimBits">TimBits</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 05:31, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I totally agree with you.

<dd>I have no objections to replacing Lala, but I would hope that there could be another women put in her place. The reason being that I think it's a good idea to include women since they make up half the population on the planet and are often ignored. Just my two cents. Also, as for the Shah Ismail issue, I'm okay with keeping him and just wanted to discuss this issue because a user pointed his situation out to me, although I was aware of the mixed situation with the Safavis (with a mainly Azeri background interspersed with Kurdish groups), but had not looked into Shah Ismail's background further. Obviously, Ismail can be argued as a member of both Azeri and Kurdish peoples. Not a problem for me if he's included here. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 18:39, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No problem for me - We could insert Natavan instead but what the hell. Ismail Shah Khatai is clearly identified with Azeri people. I would be quite surprised if Kurds identify with him... He has neither wrote in Kurdish, nor he was Sunni, like most of Shias. Now, Sheyki Safi (XiVc) may have been of Kurdish stock but so what. Do not forget that his mother, Despina was the daughter of Trebizond Greek emperor.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Azeri Identity</span></h2>
<p>Here's Persian chauvinism and ethnocentrism at work again. My father is an ethnic Azeri TURK from Hamadan Province. Azeris ARE Turks, whether my Persian brethren like it or not...oh, did I mention my mother is Persian? So you see, I am not anti-Persian...how could I be when my own mother is Persian? Answering those who claim they are Azeris but not Turks, I wonder if they have been brainwashed by Iran's policy of "Farsification" (more like "falsification") of Azeri history and culture. Men ozum azeriyem, ve hemishe deyirem ki torkum...tork fars deyir, qanirsanmi? Biz torkuz. I do not favor secession for Azerbaijan, but I do favor autonomy for Iran's Azeri provinces (East/West Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Zanjan, and Hamadan provinces). The more the mullahcracy continues to deny us our linguistic and cultural rights, the more we will gravitate towards Baku.</p>
<p>Once again, I am not anti-Persian. My mother is Persian, and because of the common Shi'ite faith and common Iranian nationality, there have been millions of mixed Azeri-Persian intermarriages, of which I myself am a product of. There are over 4 million Azeris in Tehran alone, more than any city in Azerbaijan proper, and Azeris run many of the businesses in Tehran. Azeris may be well integrated in Iranian society due to their being fellow Shi'ite correligionists, and there may be many Azeris in prominent positions in the Iranian government. But that does not change the fact that young Azeri children attending school in Tabriz have to learn arithmetic, geography and science in Persian, a language that does not come naturally to them. With over 35 million Azeris, Iran has not made the slightest attempt to make Azeri Iran's second official language, and in Azerbaijan, schools, government offices, public institutions, newspapers, TV and radio stations all use Persian, and not Azeri. Azeri is not allowed to be taught in schools, and the language of instruction is Persian, resulting in many young Azeri children falling behind academically. Finally, we Azeri TURKS will never forgive the mullahcracy for supporting Armenia's terrorist campaign against our people in Qarabag...the mullahs watched as their fellow Shi'ites were slaughtered like sheep, and this was a slap in the face for Iran's own 35 million strong Azeris. Armenians in Tehran freely demonstrate in front of the Turkish Embassy, yet Azeris are not allowed to demonstrate and protest in front of the Armenian Embassy. Once again, I do not favor secession, since I come from a mixed family, and do not want to see my family split in two countries. But Iran's ethnic Azeri Turks have rights. Our legitimate national aspirations must be addressed. Yashasin xalqimiz, yashasin torpaqimiz, yashasin dilimiz.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ya alright. The majority of Mullahs are Azeris and so are all the bankers, industrialists, and military commanders. The Spiritual Leader of Iran is an Azeri. Azeris run Iran and if you look at all the last dynasties in Iran you will see they were Azeri. The Safavids and Qajars were Azeris. One can argue Azeris repress Kurds and Persians. As for what you say about Armenia, let me tell you that Armenia is Iran's friend while the government of the Republic of Azerbaijan is working with Israel and America to undermine and dismantle Iran.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>As for your claims that Azeris are Turks that is simply false because Turks are ethnically Asiatic peoples related to Mongolians. Do you look like an East Asian? Do the peoples of Turkey even look like East Asians? NOOOOO</p>

<p><br />
A previous analysis of mtDNA variation in the Caucasus found that Indo-European-speaking Armenians and Turkic-speaking Azerbaijanians were more closely related genetically to other Caucasus populations (who speak Caucasian languages) than to other Indo-European or Turkic groups, respectively. Armenian and Azerbaijanian therefore represent language replacements, possibly via elite dominance involving primarily male migrants, in which case genetic relationships of Armenians and Azerbaijanians based on the Y-chromosome should more closely reflect their linguistic relationships. We therefore analyzed 11 bi-allelic Y-chromosome markers in 389 males from eight populations, representing all major linguistic groups in the Caucasus. As with the mtDNA study, based on the Y-chromosome Armenians and Azerbaijanians are more closely-related genetically to their geographic neighbors in the Caucasus than to their linguistic neighbors elsewhere.</p>

<p>So, both the mtDNA (female line) and the Y-chromosomes (from father to son) seem to prove the fact, that modern Azeris are predominantly Turkic-speaking Armenians and Iranians. Their DNA has Europeana and Middle Eastern traces, but not Eastern Asian ones , which one would assume if they really were Turks.</p>

<dd>Please buy the article and read it. Nasidze et. al. did not use any subjects from Turkey and Turkmenistan. It is curious that they did not since these countries are the closest Turkish speaking countries to Azerbaijan. Instead they used published data for subject from Kyrgyz, Karakalpak, Kazak, Dungan and Uzbek. Another interesting fact about the article is that (on page 6 of the article, which is page 260 in the publication) there is a graph that shows <i>the phylogenetic relationship of Y-chromosome haplogroups, based on 10 Y-SNPs and the YAP marker.</i> which shows that both Azerbaijanis and Armenians are closer to Turks of Turkey then the the Iranian populations. They don't even mention Iranians as the original population. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverageTurkishJoe_c916.html" title="User:AverageTurkishJoe">AverageTurkishJoe</a> 06:25, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Grandmaster is absolutely correct. If africans assimilated and lived all of their lives in Turkey, and <b>identified</b> with Turks, they are in fact of Turkish nationality, but of different racial stock. We do not need to search for examples too long - French are not considered Celtic or Germanic people, they are Latin people because of language and not ethnical affiliation of neighbors. Another good example is Khazara peoples from Aphganistan - descentants of Mongols speaking Dari.

<p>Yes Grandmaster is correct. Also, the Azeris aren't necessarily Armenians as the more probable origin links them to the Albanians of the Caucasus, while the Armenians, speakers of an IndoEuropean language themselves, also cluster with a related Caucasian people whose language was replaced by Indo-European invaders whose language is today of course Armenian. In this tangled web, this can become quite confusing to relate, but simply calling the Azeris an Iranian people simply makes no sense. In fact, it'd make more sense to call them a Caucasian people, but since neither the Azeris or Armenians speak a Caucasian language this is also not a viable option. The best and most logical option is to classify the Azeris as a Turkic people and then one can also explain their origins in addition. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 20:14, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First of all to the Persian who claims Azeris rule Iran...please wake up...Ayatollah Khamenei is only half Azeri, and was born in Mashad, far from Azerbaijan or Iran's Azeri provinces, and his native tongue is Persian, and he hardly identifies with Azeri people or culture, and is about as Persianized as you can get. As for your claim that the most powerful mullahs in Iran are Azeri, name a few please. The most powerful Azeri mullah in Iran Shariatmadari fought the Farsification or Persianization of Iranian Azeris, and was quickly silenced by the Persian bullies of the Islamic Republic. As for the Republic of Azerbaijan's relation with America, that is because Russia supports Armenia, and the only way to counter that is by forging an alliance with another powerful country like America. As for the Kurds, they are of Iranian stock, yet they seem to have problems with BOTH their ethnic brethren the Persians, not because of any major linguistic or cultural differences, because being of Iranian origin no such differences exist (Kurdish being a sister language of Persian, and Kurdish culture being close to Persian), and Azeris, because they dislike SHI'ITES. As for Armenia, being Iran's friend...Armenia is nothing but a landlocked, small, mountainous, insignifcant country with no major natural resources (like oil, which Azerbaijan Republic has plenty of), and ask yourself why a Christian country would ally herself with a fanatic mullahcracy like Iran's if it weren't a "doostiye maslahati" as Persians call it, or "a friendship of convenience"...Armenia has nothing to offer Iran except alliance in her enmity against Azerbaijan Republic...and last time I checked, Armenia too, had full diplomatic relations with both Israel and America. You also exaggerate Iranian Azeris role in Iranian society...believe me if we had that much power, the first thing we'd do is close Iran's border with Armenia, and suspend trade with both Armenia and the illegal Armenian-run Republic of "Artsakh" (Armenia's name for Dagliq Qarabag). And whether our DNA is Turkic or not, we are culturally and linguistically Turkic, and that makes us Turks. We do not need others to tell us what we are, thank you very much. The Safavids were Azeris, Qajars were Turkmens, Seljuks, Ghaznavids, Ilkhanids, all Turks. Do not try to change history please. The last dynasty before the mullacracy was Persian (Pahlavi) and stifled all forms of Azeri cultural expression...this in spite of Farah Diba herself being of Azeri origin (father from Tabriz)...shameful!</p>

Funny to hear all these arguments. What you define as "alien" is in fact an identifiable part of the culture that defines a nation. The problems that you seem to have is that you identify culture as something static, when it is fluid and prone to changes. Ethnically (or better say genetically) Azeris (mostly of Northern Azerbaijan) are Caucasian people, related to autochtonous population of Caucasus. Culturally, they are cross between Turkish and Persian influence. You know very well that Azeris and Turks are culturally slightly distinct from the Persians, while they are in no doubt are part of Iranian culture. Turks were nomadic pastoralists, Persians were mostly sedentary and agricultural ... Music and oral literature have slightly different tradition and so on. At the moment in practice you see a divergence of SOuth and North Azerbaijan (both Turkic speaking) in different direction.

Only Ethnologue is putting it above 23M (stating that there are more Azeri-Turks in Iran and Persians which is really not true). Right now, you have only one source supporting your claim, while many others - including the official statement of the Iranian embassy in Berlin - put the number at 20% = ca. 15M. This is not about what <i>you believe</i> but about how many reliable sources we have. The CIA factbook 2005, which is used in almost ALL articles in WP, is the most reliable.

<dd>If I may interject here with a few points. First, Ethnologue is actually very reliable and is used by many academic institutions. The new genetic study on the Kurds and Zaza referred to the Ethnologue for example and the article is from the University of London. However, both the CIA and Ethnologue also have spotty records in terms of updating their data. One can often find such errors when verifying the data with official censuses, minority rights groups, and the UN. It's wiser thus to give a range, but I would agree that given the data thus far it's more likely that the Azeris numbers are higher than what the Iranian embassy claims. In addition, I wanted to add that we also can't include the Persians here as a related people simply because it's not a tenable position since some Persians are related and others aren't and the links can be tenuous given the cultural drift with Azeris in the Republic of Azerbaijan. My own position is that I back SouthernComfort's stats on the Azeris as they do appear to corroborate other findings, while I think we should leave it at the Azeris being related to their linguistic brethren until at some point we discover that in fact the Azeri-Persian connection is more substantial (say with the Azeris in Iran who have intermingled with Persians). And I think given my record, I'm not pro-anyone in this debate, but just trying to help as I was the one who largely re-wrote this page without any intent to either belittle or exaggerate the Azeris in any way. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 22:14, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tombseye, it is very, very well established that Azeris are connected culturally and historically to Persians. The level of Persianization in Iran has been very extensive, with many famous people (Farah Pahlavi) and actresses (Aghdashloo) and singers (Googoosh) ALL being of Azeri background. This cannot be denied. It is too extensive to ignore. I could go on and on with all the people who are linguistically Persian but ethnically Azeri in Iran. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 22:25, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, the issue is not their relationship, the issue is categorization that delineates these groups. Culturally Persian is still a bit vague in terms of related peoples and the overlap situation can also be found with Azeris who have mingled with other peoples in the Caucasus as well. I'm not going to argue over this, but this will no doubt annoy some Azeris and possibly Persians who don't agree. The main problem also stems from a perception from these outlier peoples that the larger Persians want to assimilate them and eliminate their language and culture as well. The Kurds are maintaining a desire for a more separate identity for this reason. This will simply become another point of contention when I think we can just walk away at this point and count the article as having covered all the main points. The culturally Persian aspect can be discussed further in the Azeri links to Iranian people section as well. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 22:35, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ignoring sources won't make your versions correct. There are at least 4 sources (CIA, Encyclopaedia of the Orient, Iranian embassy, MS Encarta) stating that Azeris are less than 20 million while there is <i>only one</i> source claiming that they are more than 23 million (actually stating that Azeris are the largest ethnic group in Iran). It's 4 vs. 1. In this case, <b>you are ignoring 3 other sources</b> in favour of only source which is deffinitly not more reliable than any of the others. You are purposely ignoring sources becouse of your personal feelings, ideology, etc. Unless you find more sources supporting your version, your claims are considered POV. You clearly misunderstand the mission of WP. It is not about what certain people <i>believe</i> but about how many reliable sources you can find to support your claim. Any admin of WP will tell you the same. You can ignore sources, but it won't make your version right. According to WP rules, ANY version that has more reliable sources is considered the "correct version". As I have stated above, it's 4 sources vs. 1 source, and therfore, your version is POV. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tajik</a> 22:42, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The talk about Safavids is about history. I posted sources from the Encyclopaedia Iranica, the most authoritive and most trusted source in the world (written by REAL experts all over the world), clearly proving that Safavids were ethnic Kurds. This one is about population stats that change every day. If you check out Ethnologue sources from 1995, you will see that the number of Azeris was put somewhere near 15,000,000. Only 2 years later, they changed the number to 23,000,000! That's +8,000,000 in only 2 years! We have other reliable sources, like the CIA factbook (from <b>2005!</b>) and the MS Encarta (<b>2006!</b>) stating that Azeris are LESS than 20 millions. You are clearly ignoring widly accepted sources because of your own personal beliefs. That's totally against WP rules.

<dd>I am sorry my friend, the problem with giving a consensus on the Azeri population of Iran is hard becuase they are so mixed in with everyone else and their are similar speaking Turkic-speaking Iranians who are sometimes considered Azeris and sometimes not. Qajar are considered as their own type of Turkic peoples and as an Azeri peoples with others. There are Azeris who don't speak a word of Azeris and even Persians in the North who speak better Azeri than Persian. It is a very twisted topic. As for Azeris they are an Turkic-speaking ethnic Iranian people. One thing I got to say is that in the Middle East the terminology used is very problematic such as calling Azeris by the term Turks.</dd>

<dd>I do not have anything against Azeris. I am just quoting reliable sources, while others who - I assume - are Azerbaijani nationalists or some other kind of Turkish fanatics ignore sources because the numbers do not fit into their nationalists views. Right now, we have 4 sources (and all of them can be considered "reliable") while there is onyl 1 source supporting the other claim. In this case, it does not matter wether Ethnologue is reliable or not. It's 4 vs. 1. Case closed!</dd>
<dd>As for those who are interested in other sources which may not be considered "reliable", here are the results of a recent survey in the US among Iranian immigrants: <a href="http://web.mit.edu/isg/survey.htm" class="external free" title="http://web.mit.edu/isg/survey.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.mit.edu/isg/survey.htm</a> Accrding to this survey, out of ca. 4000 American-Iranians, 88.2% consider themselvs "ethnic Persians" while only 11% consider themselvs "Azeri". It is widely believed that the percentage of ethnic Azeris among Iranians living in the US/Eu is higher than the percentage of Azeris living in Iran (many Azeris were rich and educated and left the country after the Islamic revolution). If that is really the case, then - according to this survey - the number of Azeris in Iran cannot be 30% of the population. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tajik</a> 23:17, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

While i have no doubt that these people are important, I have stumbled over the begin of the sentence "Most Azeri are...". Are there no carpenters, shoemakers, plumbers or farmers among Azeris???

<p>I do regret the removal of the "Garden of Eden" remark. It was one of the most endearing features of this article :-). No, seriously - how important is this as a e.g. national myth? Is there actually a concrete place e.g. pilgrimage destination for the Garden of Eden or something similar - If yes, however fanciful the connection might be I think it should be part of the article.

<p>Hmmm,</p>
<p>This dispute should not have taken place. Because <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">User:Tajik</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">User:SouthernComfort</a> are actually on the same side. Both are trying to keep the illegitimate influence of Pan-<b>Turkish</b> editors on Iranian articles out. Let me see if I can diffuse the problem:</p>
<p>First,</p>
<p>The reason I think there is so much variation in the population numbers is that there is a varying definition of what a Persian or Azari is. For example: I am Azari. But I speak Persian as my first language, and I am accused by <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">User:Zora</a> and a few others as being a "Persian nationalist". My Azari cousins have names like "Mehrdad", "Dariush", etc (Persian popular names). They all identify with the mainstream culture, like I do. So am I and my family Persian or Azari? I have a Kurdish aunt in Sanandaj. Her kids are all named "Farhad", "Parviz", and "Shirin". My maternal grandfather was from Georgia. And at the same time, I even have Sayyed blood in me, which makes things even more mixed. I think that's where the source of variation <i>may</i> be coming from: People define things differently. But then again, that's just my opinion.</p>
<p>But what I am certain about is this:</p>
<p>That Azeris and Kurds are Iranian. We have been Persianized just as the Persians have been influenced and changed by other Iranian ethnic groups.</p>
<p>If there were to be a real "melting pot" in the world, it would have to be Iran. In Iran, we dont view things from an ethnic pair of eyeglasses. That viewpoint is being imposed on us by outsiders. The Republic of Azarbaijan was part of Greater Iriana, and was forced to separate by Russia in the mid 1800s. So was Turkmenia and Afghanistan and the rest of Central Asia. We are the children of one family. That's why as an Azari, I feel culturally at home in Baku, as I do in Samarqand and <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiraz%2C_Iran_4618.html" title="Shiraz, Iran">Shiraz</a>, my birth place.</p>
<p>As <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nelson_Frye_f375.html" title="Richard Nelson Frye">Frye</a> put it:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Many times I have emphasized that the present peoples of central Asia, whether Iranian or Turkic speaking, have one culture, one religion, one set of social values and traditions with only language separating them."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And if someone says I am being dominated by "Persianization"? I'll tell them that I am already Persianized! Just as the Persian has parts of me in him. The Persian language isnt even <i>Persian</i> in writing. It's Arabic in script. And half the vocabulary is foreign.</p>
<p>An analogy:</p>
<p>Think of the bonding culture/history/identity that defines us as an Iranian as the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_nuclear_force.html" title="Strong nuclear force">Strong nuclear force</a> that keeps the Nucleus (Iran) stable, and prevents different Protons and Neutrons ("ethnic members") from pushing eachother out and destroying the Nucleus.</p>
<p>My solution,</p>
<ul>
<li>Either, mention a range of population as <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">User:Tombseye</a> says.</li>
<li>Or just mention all <i>sources</i>. Say "According to CIA it's this, according to Ethnologue it's this, according to Iranian embassy it's this..."</li>
</ul>
<p>That should alleviate the problem, I imagine.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">User:Tajik</a>,</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">User:SouthernComfort</a> is not an anti Azari or anti-Persian. He has an indisputable record of fighting pan-Turkists and Pan-Arabs and all the other bellicose pans devoted to defaming and destroying the memory of Iriana, Land of The Arian. He is a top-notch editor that should be respected by all means. Were it not for him, the Iranian/Persian/Zoroastrian/Tajik articles would be decimated by malicious Iran-hating revisionists. Same as <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMani1_e14b.html" title="User:Mani1">User:Mani1</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiacc_5519.html" title="User:Wikiacc">User:wikiacc</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">User:Refdoc</a>, and some others. We're on the same side.</p>
<p>I think that if you make the distinction between Azari/Turkic and Turkey/Turkish obvious in your writings, these disputes wont show up. I always point out to the pan-Turkists that <b>Turkic not= Turkey</b>. As SC pointed out, Turkic is synonymous to Central Asia, the same place where the Ghaznavids, Sultan Malekshah, <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sultan_Sanjar_f880.html" title="Sultan Sanjar">Sultan Sanjar</a>, etc supported and nourished Persian culture and were Persianized a long long time ago. Funny as it may sound, I see them as Iranian too. We are like the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Rug_c81f.html" title="Persian Rug">Persian Rug</a>, with variety in unison.</p>
<p>I think you are doing a splendid job. But if you word your sentences more carefully, we will avoid these needless disputes and instead focus on the real things.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 01:09, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I totally agree with that post. However, that's not the point in here. Wikipedia is not a place to "live" pan-turkist or pan-iranist dreams. It's about how to give this article some quality. And right now, it is about sources - because that's what Wikipedia is about: collecting reliable information from various sources. Personally, I do not give a damn about the number of Azeris or Persians or Lurs in Iran. I was born in Kabul, Afghanistan. My father's family is originally Sayyid-Arab from <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herat.html" title="Herat">Herat</a>, but totally Persianized. My mother's family is <a href="../../../k/i/z/Kizilbash.html" title="Kizilbash">Kizilbashi</a> from the Bayat-clan of <a href="../../../o/g/h/Oghuz.html" title="Oghuz">Oghuz</a>-Turks (in other words: my mother's family is <b>Azeri</b> and settled in present-day Afghanistan during the campaings of <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadir_Shah_d6d0.html" title="Nadir Shah">Nadir Shah</a>). My mother tongue (and that of my family for the last 8+ generations!) is Persian, with my mother's father being a <a href="../../../g/h/i/Ghilzai.html" title="Ghilzai">Ghilzai</a>-Pashtun from Qandahar. The rest of my "ancestors" were indigious <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranians</a>. I have absolutely no interst in altering any numbers, be it Pashtuns, Tajiks, Turks, or whatever. But <b>that is not the point in here</b> - we have <b>four reliable sources</b> attesting that the number of so-called <i>Azeris</i> in Iran is <b>less</b> than 20 million, while we have <b>only one source</b> saying that they are more than 20 millions. It's 4 vs 1 ... and therefore, according to the rules of Wikipedia, it should be written in the article that Azeris are LESS than 20 million. At least till we get to see other reliable sources proving the claims of Ethnologue! -<a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tajik</a> 02:10, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tajik</span></h2>
<p>Tajik you have confused everybody on this page...first of all Ghilzai or Dorrani Pushtuns do not speak Persian as their native tongue, much less for 8 generations. Your name Tajik suggests another ethnicity. Secondly, you claim Azeri descent on the other side of the family...if you mean to tell us Shi'ite Azeris and devout Sunni Pushtuns intermarried back in the era you are referring to, then that is quite an anomaly and should be entered in the Guinness Book of World Records. You were born in Kabul and are an Afghan for all intents and purposes, so what is your stake here in trying to tell the rest of us what our true ethnicity is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, this discussion is not about me or my family, but about the Turkish people. Besides that, you represent - in an unfortunate large part of the world's population who a) do not know as much as they believe.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>There are millions of Pashtuns who are Persian-speakers, including the "royal family" of Afghanistan, the Barakzai Clan of the Durrani branch. Today, they are called "Muhammadzai" and they are native Persian-speakers, though of ethnic Pashtun origin. Other good examples would be <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_Zahir_562a.html" title="Ahmad Zahir">Ahmad Zahir</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farhad_Darya_f0b2.html" title="Farhad Darya">Farhad Darya</a>, both being Persian-speaking Pashtuns.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Tajik" in Afghanistan is the name given to Persian-speaking Non-Pashtuns and Non-Hazaras (=mongoloid looks). It's not really the name of an ethnic group. "Tajik" summarizes a bunch of different families, clans, etc who are all native Persian-speakers and do not identify themselvs with a "clan-system" like the Pashtuns. Usually, the large cities are dominated by "Tajiks". And usually, the Tajiks do not call or consider themselvs "Tajik" but "Farsiwan" (= "Persian speakers").</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>There are a lot of Shia-Sunni marriages in Afghanistan ... and in my case, my grandfather wasn't even Sunni but a Shia from Qandahar (yes, there are many Pashtuns who are Shia). It might surprise you to know that Afghanistan's fomer king, <a href="../../../d/o/s/Dost_Mohammad_Khan_964c.html" title="Dost Mohammad Khan">Dost Mohammad Khan</a>, was himself half-Qizilbash <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/European%20influence%20in%20Afghanistan" class="external autonumber" title="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/European%20influence%20in%20Afghanistan" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Shias make up 20% of Afghanistan ... you can't just generalize everything.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Qizilbash" in Afghanistan do not consider themselvs "Azeri Turks". This is not really surprizing since - in later periods - most of the so-called "Qizilbash" were ethnic Persians, Indians, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This a free Wikipedia and everyone has the right to take part in conversations if he/she has interest in the toppic. On the other hand, you have no right to tell me not to take part in this discussion. After all, it seems like I have more knowledge about Azeris than you have about Afghanistan ...</li>

<p>Excuse me Tajik, I have not prevented you from contributing to this page...my specialty is not Afghanistan, since it is not my country...but neither are my Azeri people yours. I know enough about Hazaras (who are Shi'ites and speak Hazaragi which is a form of Persian but are not Tajiks, and who'se name is derived from "hazar"...thousand...allegedly a thousand mongol soldiers were their ancestors). I know who Tajiks are, dear sir...I have met Tajiks from all over Afghanistan (good friend was from Maimana, Faryab Province, neighboring Uzbek territory) among the Afghan expatriate community in both Oakland, CA. and northern Virginia as well as southern California, and have known a descendant of Amanullah Khan Serraj for years, not to mention relatives of Hamed Karzai in the Baltimore and northern Virginia areas. Not to mention the fact that my father has met Tajiks in Samarkand and Bukhara (even though they are Uzbek citizens)...furthermore I knew already that Zahir Shah was a Persian speaking Pushtun and that the Pushtun elite of Kabul speak "Dari" as their native tongue and I even know about other sub-ethnic groups, Pashaee, Nooristani, Farsiwan, Aimaq, and the Ismailis who are Shi'ites of a different kind, and the very small Hunza minority near the Chinese border... etc. etc....I may not know as much about Afghanistan as you, but for a non-Afghan I don't think I'm doing as bad as you say. Thanks for the clarification anyways...of course why you choose be an apologist for ultra-nationalist Persians in Iran is something that is hard to understand...you spend much time trying to prove that Azeris are not Turks. Azeris are mainly a Caucasian people, but they are culturally and linguistically Turkic, albeit many traits of Persian culture are to be found in Azeri culture (such as the celebration of Novruz). I may not know much about Afghanistan as I would like, but I question your expertise on Iran and her demographics...I know the country MY ancestors came from, better than you, just as you know yours better than me. On that you can rely.</p>

<dd>Who ever wrote the comment above is part of the minority of irrational individuals who do not like the fact that Azeris are Iranians. The majority of Azeris consider themselves Iranian and once more it has been proven scientifically through genetic studies. 75%-80% of Azeris consider themselves Iranian, which again history and science proves to be true, while a very small minority of politically motivated individuals in the Republic of Azerbaijan (which has only been seperated from Iran for a little over 150 years) and individuals in Turkey are trying to brainwash Azeris into believing this rubbish that Azeris are Turks. <b>Azeris are culturally, historically, and racially Iranian and are proud of that fact.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If Greeks, Armenians, Kurds, Bulgarians and all the other nations who lived under Ottoman controle for thousands of years, can speak their own language now, Why do you think that Azeris are assimilated and lost their own language but accepted 100% turkish as their national language? Why don't they speak half persian half turkish but 100% turkish? Why do they speak a better, pure Turkish thn the Turks living in Turkey?. Ottoman Empire its self used persian and arabic as the official languages so we cant say that there was an oppression against Azeris. So why all the Azeris deleted their native language and their roots from their memories and prefered to be Turkic? The purpose is to DIVIDE Turks and Azeris. To all my Azeri friends: Dont forget what Aliyev said "We are ONE nation, two states".</p>
<p>Well Iran is too scared of 24 millions Azeris living in Iran so they dont want them to found their of own state. This nothing but persian propaganda, a brain wash. Azeris are very proudful and people like Azeris doesnt change their language and their roots like they change cloths cause language is sacred.Mysterieux 22:57, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Buddy talk with facts. What you are saying is the other way around. It is Turkish propaganda. It is Turkish propaganda to brainwash Azeries. Turkey use to be divided into four sections, the West was Greek people, the South of Turkey was Semetic, and the East was Iranian peoples( who the Kurds are a racial representation of) and Armenians. Azeris celebrate <a href="../../../n/o/w/Nowruz.html" title="Nowruz">Nowruz</a> for thousands of years and have a lot of Persian and even Kurdish in their langauge.

<dd>As for what you said about the Ottoman Empire don't fabricate falsehood, many Turks know that their great grandparents came from other places like Iran or Bosnia or Albania who adopted Turkish. As for Turkey why don't you let the 35% and up Kurds, Armenians, and Georgians get the freedom they want. <b>It is Turkey that tries to force Kurds into saying they are Mountain Turks!</b> Turks are known for trying to re-write history.

<p>Yes I am Azeri, unlike you are a Turk from Cyprus. See you are the people pushing this propaganda. Itis not Azeris it is people from Turkey who are coming here trying to change Azeri identity. 75%-80% Azeris are from Iran and when we try and put their pictures up you people delete them because they all contribute to Iran and Iranian society. All Azeribajian was a part of Iran for most history. It has only been less than 150 years that the North was taken from Iran by Russia. The Northern culture has also been changed it is the South that has kept the real Azeri culture which is Iranic. I am a proud of my Azeri background and of my Iranian nationality and race!</p>

<p>NO, THEY DONT! THAT IS WHAT YOU PAN TURKS ALWAYS SAY! IF THE AZERI'S WANTED TO SEPERATE, THEN WHY DIDNT THE QAJAR, SAFAVIDS, MOSSADEGH, OR KHAMENEI DO IT? ALL OF THEM RULED IRAN, ALL OF THEM CONSIDER/ED THEMSELVES IRANIAN, AND IT NEVER CROSSED ANY OF THEIR MINDS TO SEPERATE FROM IRAN!</p>
<p>I MYSELF AM PERSIAN, TWO OF MY AUNTS ARE OF AZERI DESCENT, MY COUSIN IS HALF AZERI, ETC... NONE OF THEM WANT TO SEPERATE, INFACT, THEY ARE MORE PATRIOTIC THEN I AM! FOR EXAMPLE, I WAS TALKING TO MY AUNT (OF TURKIC DESCENT) ABOUT IRAN CHANGING ITS SCRIPT TO THE LATIN SCRIPT, LIKE TURKEY. SHE LOOKED INTO MY EYES, SEEMINGLY OFFENDED BY WHAT I SAID, AND REPLIED TO ME, WITH A SERIOUS TONE OF VOICE: "WE ARE IRANIAN, OUR LANGUAGE IS IRANIAN, OUR CULTURE IS IRANIAN, WHY SHOULD WE CHANGE IT TO LATIN?"</p>
<p>AS YOU PAN TURKS SEE, AND AS MY AZERI BROTHERS HERE AHVE POINTED OUT, THEY DO NOT WANT TO SEPERATE. GET THIS TYPE OF THINKING OUT OF YOUR HEAD! IF THEY WANTED TO SEPERATE THEY WOULD HAVE PUT UP SOME SORT OF RESISTANCE RIGHT?</p>
<p>YOU TURKS ARE FUNNY, HALF OF TURKEY WANTS TO BREAK AWAY AND THEY HAVE FOUGHT FOR DECADES TO BREAK AWAY, YET YOU COME IN HERE SAYING THAT IRANIANS WANT TO BREAK AWAY FROM IRAN WITH NO EVIDENCE!</p>
<p>IRANIAN ARABS FOUGHT AND DIED FOR IRAN IN THE IRAN IRAQ WAR! IRANIAN KURDS FOUGHT AND DIED FOR IRAN IN THE IRAN IRAQ WAR! IRANIAN TURKS AND IRANIAN AZERI'S FOUGHT AND DIED FOR IRAN IN THE IRAN IRAQ WAR! AND THAT IS JUST RECENT HISTORY! MOSSADEGH SACRIFICED HIMSELF FOR IRAN! FARAH DIBA IS A PROUD IRANIAN WOMAN, AND QUEEN OF IRAN! AZERI IRANIANS PARTICIPATE IN ALL ASPECTS OF IRANIAN SOCIETY FROM THE MULLAH GOVERNMENT TO THE PRO DEMOCRACY MOVEMENTS! YOU PAN TURKS ARE REALLY SOMETHING SPECIAL, SO NATIONALISTIC, CHAUVINIST, AND SUPREMACIST!</p>
<p>UNLIKE YOUR TURKIC NATIONS, IRAN HAS ALWAYS ENCOURAGED, SUPPORTED, AND PRESERVED THE CULTURE, LANGUAGE, AND LIFE OF ITS ETHNICITIES!</p>
<p>AND FOR ALL WHO SAY THAT IRAN PERSECUTES ITS MINORITIES: THE MULLAHS ARE RULED BY A MINORITY LEADER, AND THE MULLAHS PERSECUTE EVERYONE, PERSIANS PROBABLY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE!</p>
<p>AND FOR THE IGNORANT PERSON WHO SAID THAT NOUROZ IS NOT AN IRANIC/PERSIAN HOLIDAY, I JUST HAVE ONE THING TO SAY TO YOU: IRANIAN CULTURE WAS SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL THEN TURKIC CULTURE, THAT THE OFFICIAL CULTURAL LANGUAGE OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WAS PERSIAN, THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES OF MANY OTHER TURKIC NATIONS WERE PERSIANS (SUCH AS AFGHANISTAN TODAY), AND THAT IRANIAN CULTURE DOMINATED TURKIC CULTURE TILL PAN TURKISM ARRIVED. SO I AM NOT SURPRISED THAT YOU TURKS, WHO LEARN SO MUCH NATIONALIST PROPAGANDA IN YOUR COUNTRIES (OBVIOUSLY WITH INFERIORITY COMPLEXES), WOULD TRY TO MAKE SOME FULLY IRANIAN NON-IRANIAN TO MAKE YOURSELVES FEEL BETTER.</p>

<p>any way, the writer ahmad kasravi, an azeri, fought against pan turk claims that azeri's were originally turkic peoples. he wrote books on the subject, and always claimed that azeri's were of iranic orgin, and then turkified, which is true and most historians agree with this.</p>
<p>another thing you turks keep saying is that "well, you might not want to seperate but the majority do..bla bla bla" how many times have we given you proof that they dont? if the majority wanted to seperate, then why would ahmad kasravi deny it? why would mossadegh not create a nation for his azeri people, why didnt the safavids and qajar's create a seperate azeri kingdom? were they not all azeri's, THEY WERE! they all considered themselves iranian, nothing less. --Iranian Patriot</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Population figures</span></h2>
<p>I'm kinda concerned about the accuracy of the info you've provided on the numbers of Azeris all over the world. I have doubts about Turkey having 800,000 Azeris living in it, since different websites provided different data (numbers ranging anywhere from 25,000 to 3,000,000). Turkey doesn't consider ethnicity when carrying out its censii. As for Canada, the official 2001 census results say there were ca. 1,500 Azeris living there at that point - 1,445 to be precise. Source: <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/list-of-canadians-by-ethnicity" class="external free" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/list-of-canadians-by-ethnicity" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/list-of-canadians-by-ethnicity</a> And only 30,000 for 'Other' is certainly not correct. Uzbekistan alone is a home to 59,000 Azeris.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AZERIS ARE TURKS NOTHING ELSE</span></h2>
<p>Why the people here struggling to prove azeris are indo-european persian people.They are obviously Turks as much as Turks in central asia.Reason can not be a genetic proof.However Azeri Turks have Turkish heritage as much as kazakhs and other central asian Turks.This culture makes them enough Turk to be a turk.Turks of turkey and Turks of İran are sharing same language and similiar culture.Azeris have already developed a national turkish identity despite communist and persian chauvanist.One day the borders between us will be lifted off despite all indo-european efforts.I want to ask this question here. If azeris are in the armenian-iranian genetic pool,why armenians killed thier fellow kins?However they treated poor azeris as if they were not human beings.Armenian and iranians do not think azeris are indo-european,they are turks,so they are right we are turks.</p>

<dd>...says the Panturkic propaganda. Plus no one is trying to prove they're Indo-European. Nations can't be purely X or purely Y. And in the case of the Azeri, its extremely hard to tell since so many ethnicities and cultures have mingled and gotten mixed with each other in the Caucasian lowlands.</dd>
<dd>P.S. I'm really having hard time tracing significant cultural similarities between Azeris and Kazakhs. And yes, I do think that Azeris and Persians are more similar in that sense.</dd>

<dd>No your not an Azeri. If somone clearly looks at the history and traces you back to your unsigned user origin they will see you are lying and a Turk. This says a lot about Turkish propaganda.

<p>I have read that in a book about ethnic divisions of Turkey.Whatever, Turks or Azeri, not so much diffrence... :)</p>
<p>69.196.139.250:</p>
<p>I bet you are not an Azeri.I think you try to be an Azeri because they have high social status(such a Shirin Ebadi) and income in Iran.</p>
<p>Iranian Patriot:</p>
<p>You persians are trying to assimilate the nations(especially the Azeris) in your country.That's the best proof of this.Because they are quite strong in iran.</p>
<p>%70 of Turkey-Turkish and Azeri-Turkish are same! Grammer is already same.We have broadcast of Azeri channels because we are sharing our satellite(Turksat) with Azerbaijan.Sometimes i watch the Azeri channels and i can understand most of the sentences.Azeris are watching the Turkish channels as well(in Iran also).They have only some common stuff with you persians because of alevite.</p>
<p>Turkey is fighting for Nagorno-Karabakh, where was occupied by Armenia illegaly, in the international arena with Azerbaijan.Armenians has nearly killed 20,000 Azeris near Baku in 31 March 1918.Then, we(Ottoman Empire) have sent our army(Caucasus Ottoman Army) there and stopped Armenians who were being supported by Russians.Where was the iran in this period.Why iran is cooperating with Armenia against Azerbaijan if you are racially same? Turkey helped Azerbaijan after collapse of soviets.Gave financial aids, trained and weaponized Azerbaijani army.What did you persians did? Nothing just what i thought...</p>
<p>So let's ask Azeris about who they feel more closer, right?</p>
<p>We have nothing to do with persian culture.We have a very developed culture, already.Iran and Persians have been ruled by Turks for centruies so you should have been affected from us.Persian was never used as an official language.Where do you find those stuff?</p>
<p>Inferioty complex? Don't compare yourselves with us.Turkey is too much more developed than Iran in all ways.Even Turkish and Persian histories cannot be compared...</p>
<p>Nevruz is a Turkish festival.Even the fire in Nevruz is burnt for the fire in "Ergenekon" Mythology.It's celebrated in all Central Asian Republics as well.However, Iranian people(Kurds) try to consider that it's their own custom.On the other hand, Kurds have Turkic roots.You can see this in the museum of Bishek/Kyrgyzstan.Kirmanchi is a Turkish tribe name also but Kurds have mixed with indo-iranian people much more than Azeris.So their language is affected by persian language.Most the words in Kurdish are Turkish words...</p>
<p>Indo-European? You are called Indo-Iranian.Anyone can see that you are diffrent than russians. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKaraman_c950.html" title="User:Karaman">Karaman</a> 02:02, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Buddy We can all see that the education system in Turkey is Third World from you stupid statments. You want us to take you seriously?????? Hahahaha. Iran is a freer, more developed country than Turkey. Go look it up and learn something instead of the false misinformation they teach you in Turkey. DO you know who helped Turkey during the Brd Flue? The Iranians. Do you know which country is the world's most educated Muslim country? Iran. So stop making us laugh and yes Iranians are Indo-Europeans like Russians, Armenians, and Greeks. Greeks are also the Iranians cousins and Iranians support the Greeks against Turkey. By the way the people you insulted were all Azeris and they want nothing to do with Turks. <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.57.230.179.html" title="User:72.57.230.179">72.57.230.179</a> 08:45, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And we can all see that you are a persian from your incivilized speech.The all what you say are too far from reality.Turkey’s anually average income is two times higher than Iran and we are not oil and natural gas riche as you.Because we are selling technology as all developed countries but you are selling raw materials like all backward countries.Besides, %80 of Turkey’s economy out of savings.You can compare the prices between Iran and Turkey as well.</p>
<p>Let’s compare some indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li>GDP of Turkey: 362$ B</li>
<li>GDP of Iran: 178$ B</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Trade Value of Turkey: 189$ B</li>
<li>Trade Value of Iran: 97$ B</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Military Expenditures of Turkey: 16$ B</li>
<li>Military Expenditures of Iran: 4$ B</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Population poverty below line %15 in Turkey</li>
<li>Population poverty below line %40 in Iran</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope those gave you an information about raw material riche Iran and oil and natural gas poor Turkey(But we are still the greatest economy and power in the middle east).Turkey is too much more developed than Iran in all ways as i said before.</p>
<p>I can’t say we aren’t nationalists.However, we are not giving signs to be a terrorist alive bombs such as Persians.We do not call US as “The Great Devil” though we are not supporting them.We do not plan to wipe the Israel off the map.Make a self-criticize at first, then make comments about the others.</p>
<p>I wonder what did you do during the Bird Flu.However, don’t forget who sent you the biggest aid after the earthquake in Iran.We sent you lots of tents, prefabricated houses, foods, drugs, telecommunication systems and so on.Even you didn’t thank us.</p>
<p>Freedom?! Iran is one of the most teribble countries in the world to live.Everything is forbidden.The women have no rights.Everyone are supposed to wear strange clothes such as grim reaper.Any foreign movies, channels, musics...etc. are forbidden.Boys and girls cannot date.Which one i say? There is full freedom in Turkey.No diffrence than USA about rights.Anyone can wear whatever he/she wants.Men and women have compeletley same rights.Everybody can use any foreign stuffs.We do not satirize anyone due to their sexual preferences.We are the model country for all islamic countries.You can hear that sentence so common in Turkey; ”What should we do if we were like Iran?” You are only a little bit shapely form of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The world's most educated Muslim country is Iran?! Please don’t make me laugh.Literacy in Iran is %76 while %94 in Turkey.There are 48 universities in Iran while there are 76 universities in Turkey.If you include the 7 universities in Northern Cyprus, the real figures are much higher.Turkey’s education expenditures are too much higher than Iran.So, Turkey is the most educated Muslim country in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah yeah, I’m sure.So why don’t you look like Russians or Germans? Persians are similar with Kurds, Tajiks, Pashtuns, Urdians, Indians and Gyspies.Your language is similar with Indo-European languages as grammar.You cannot be European only by words.</p>
<p>Well done, and we are supporting Israel(except for Palestine) but don’t forget! You cannot compare the military, economic and politicial powers of Jews and Greeks.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I have never insulted Azeris.Don’t make provocation.Even Azeris and Persians don’t look like eachother.So let’s ask them which side they fell closer.</p>

<dd>The disputes about educational and social standards in Turkey and Iran are irrelevant to this page. As for Azeris, they are a Turkic people, it’s a fact, whether someone likes it or not. I don’t think there’s much to discuss here either. Azeri language only slightly differs from Turkish, and these two languages are mutually understandable, while being an Azer-speaker I can’t understand Farsi, only certain words. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 04:33, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Azeris are a "Turkic people" according to the modern interpretation of the word (meaning that they speak a Turkic language). But they are not "genetic Turks", and they are certainly not descendants of Oghuz Turks or Turkoman tribes - this is confirmed by recent genetic analyses. I think this is the main reason for the confusion in here. There seems to be almost no genetic relationship between Azeris and <i>traditional</i> Turkic peoples in Central-Asia. So, considering Azeris a "Turkic people" along with Oghuz Turks and Seljuqs is like considering African-Americans and certain tribes in Africa, America, and Europe "Germanic peoples" because today they are native English-, Dutch- or German-speakers.</dd>
<dd>As for the language, of course it is different for Azeris to understand Persian, although Azeri has been greatly influenced by Persian. But besides language, there is not much difference between the people of Iran and Central-Asia or Caucasus ... the only thing that seperates Kurds, Pashtuns, Azeris, Hazaras, Persians, etc is the language and some minor cultural elements special to the region.</dd>
<dd>Maybe the article <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic peoples</a> should be expanded, explaining the difference and confusion between "modern Turks" (who are simply Turkic-speaking, but not Turkic by heritage) and "ancient Turks" (meaning the original Altaic/<i>mongoloid</i> people in Central-Asia).</dd>

<dd>Well, that’s what Azeris are according to any major academic source – Turkic people. There are no such things as modern Turks and ancient Turks, people are grouped by the language, and therefore Azeris belong to the same Turkic people category as Kazakh or Uyghur people despite racial differences. I agree that Azeris have culturally a lot in common with Iranian people, but again they belong to different group of people. You see, many European people have a lot in common with each other, but they are ethnically grouped according to their language. And also Azeris have as much of Turkic heritage too, especially in literary tradition. With all due respect, your proposals are what is called an original research, which is not allowed here. You should back you theories up with some authoritative sources. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 05:01, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Finns are actually a Urlic people whos language is related to Turkish and Hungarians are also from the same Uro-Altaic group, with their language being an Oriental or Asian language related to the Asiatic Turkic languages, but they are not categorized as ethnically non-European or as Turkic-related, proving that it race is the primary base of ethnicity. So please that is enough hot air from you. Additionally Brazil, where everyone speaks Portugese is considered to have manny different ethnicities. According to your twisted and very wrong logic all these people in Brazil should be considered one ethnic group or race, just by speaking the same language, BUT GUESS WHAT THEY ARE NOT.
