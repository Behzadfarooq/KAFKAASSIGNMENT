<p>All the reasons for what I'm doing are stated on the talk page. No one even bothers to notice them. All you guys are doing is blind reverting. And you have the nerve to give <i>me</i> revert warnings? C'mon guys, discuss the issues.

<dd>Hi Azerbaijani, that paragraph you took out was actually sourced, it's from the Schofield book, page 35-37. The reference must have got lost somehow during the reverts. Could you put it back in? Right now, there's nothing left that presents the UAE position at all, which I think is unbalanced (because the Iranian position is rightly still there.) - Now you pushed me to the 3RR limit and reminded me of it, I can't put it back in myself I suppose ... <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFellFairy_450f.html" title="User:FellFairy">FellFairy</a> 11:29, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Huh? "Pan-Arab POV"? How pray am I a Pan-Arab? I'm Dutch by the way, LOL. No connections with Arab countries whatsoever. And what's "POV" about that paragraph, what's that even supposed to mean? Silly Wikipedia jargon. You mean it's non-neutral? Well, it is presenting the points of view of the two sides. Anything wrong with that? And I insist both sides must be presented in some way, if you have a better summary of what the UAE point of view is, feel free to put it in instead. But the way you had it, the UAE wasn't represented at all any more. Are you seriously claiming that would be a better version? <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFellFairy_450f.html" title="User:FellFairy">FellFairy</a> 12:03, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>For the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turko-Persian_Tradition_42f7.html" title="Turko-Persian Tradition">Turko-Persian Tradition</a> article, please do not remove the wikifications and the references, it takes 15 mins to add them. You're always welcome to contribute, but please respect the fellow editors. Feel free to edit the newest version, rather than reverting cause reverting also removes the minor edits. We can discuss the issue at the talk/discussion pages. I'm getting bored of this edit/revert business.

<li>Hi, thank you for your reply. Wikifications are the links to other wiki-articles. For example, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_people.html" title="Iranian people">Iranian people</a> is a wiki-link, in addition to these, there are also categories, see also, external and references links. If reverted, these are also removed. For this reason, feel free to contribute to the last version. Any problems, gimme a shout!

<p>Dear "Azerbaijani", I don't know how old you are, but I have only tried to make articles correct, not pan-whatever. I tried to change "Turkmen" which was written incorrectly about many Iranian Turks, Azerbaijanis, whatever. You think I have time for propaganda and stuff like that? But articles shall be without bias. If YOU feel that you are more like Persian that is your issue. Try to be fair! I am not Persian and that is a fact. I am an Azerbaijani. Doesn't matter, but that is a fact. I don't like to be called a Persian, but that is MY problem too. Let's have decent, unbiased and correct data so that we preserve the truth. <a href="../../../b/m/7/User%7EBm79_c438.html" title="User:Bm79">Bm79</a> 03:38, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These are all very valid points you are raising, and it would be so much better if you made them on the talk pages. That way, if another admin ever examines the situation, he will find one user (you) willing to discuss the matter, and another user who isn't. Why don't you try attributing the sources properly? For exaple, you can say, "according to Atabaki...etc. etc." You can also add quotes. There are many different possibilities of what you can do, but just reverting and reverting won't solve the problem. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 05:20, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please read the articles closely and do not do blind reverts&#160;:) I put a lot of effort into finding sources and writing that article's intro. The ones that you called sourced information are not so actually. The other refs in the intro are actual books on architecture with visible pages. The ones provided by anon are one of them from a web forum, the other one from a book description - I read very carefully every source provided and write them carefully. If you have any other concerns about the specifics of the article, you can leave me a note. Ottoman architecture was influenced primarily by Byzantine architecture, and Mimar Sinan, originally a Orthodox convert to Islam made a great synthesis of the Islamic Mamluk and Byzantine styles. Seljuk styles was never predominant after the 14th century. In any case, the influence of Persian styles can be extensively talked about in the article of Seljuk architecture. If you ever come to Istanbul, you would see what I mean&#160;:) Cheers! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 18:45, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Listen, did you even read what I just wrote above? Why are you insisting that Persian is placed in front of Byzantine? Do you have any idea what Ottoman architecture was? Have you ever seen Sinan's works? One of the source is from a forum, the other one is a book summary. This has nothing to do with NPOV, it has to do with academic correctness. Seljuk styles were influenced by Persian architecture, and Seljuk architecture was the basis for Ottoman architecture until 1453. What about 1453-1922? It was Byzantine and Mamluk influence (after the transfer of the Caliphate to Ottoman dynasty). <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 19:29, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Have you checked the other refs? They clearly state that the Byzantine influence was the greatest, the whole pages from the books are visible directly. Other sources I cited are precise, those ones are a) one from a web forum, b) a book summary not written by an academic. Please see the other refs. You can talk to any admin you would like. I provided seven serious refs for that intro, there is no POV push. Please be civil and don't accuse anyone in that manner. I am simply trying to make the article more academic in good faith. Please see the difference between Persian influence on Seljuk architecture and the extent of Seljuk influence on Ottoman architecture. Have you seen Ottoman buildings at all? Please be reasonable. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 19:34, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why? Other books clearly specify that the main influence was Byzantine with Islamic Mamluk influences that was built on Seljuk traditions after 1453, and those books are visible for all to see with their specific pages visible via Google Books. I am only reverting because one of them is from a forum the other a book description, and contradict the content of the six other references listed. That's all.

<dd>It matter because for academic precision. If the main influence was Byzantine and to a lesser degree Islamic Mamluk, then that means there is no logic to putting something else before those two. Those are not book sources: one of them is from a post in a forum, the other one a book summary - the other sources listed are the words of actual academics who have written on the specific subject, and there are six of them. Playing with the order is the real POV pushing since it goes against established academic concensus. That's all. Please show me one major Ottoman artefact that wasn't primarily influenced by Byzantine or Mamluk elements, see <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Mosque_b55c.html" title="Blue Mosque">Blue Mosque</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolmabahce_Palace_8bc3.html" title="Dolmabahce Palace">Dolmabahce Palace</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/r/Ciragan_Palace_1578.html" title="Ciragan Palace">Ciragan Palace</a>, the masterpieces of Ottomans, for example.

<p>There are two entries at Wikipedia, which have falsely created -- they are <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turco-Persian_3a45.html" title="Turco-Persian">Turco-Persian</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turko-Persian_Tradition_42f7.html" title="Turko-Persian Tradition">Turko-Persian Tradition</a>. Both entries are factitious. I have requested the entries to be deleted. My reasons are:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The term <b>Turko-Persian Tradition</b> (or <b>Turco-Persian</b>) does not exists academically and it is a factitious entry! Check the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a> to confirm -- The correct name for that culture is the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persianate.html" title="Persianate">Persianate</a> culture not the "Turko-Persian". Turkophones (mostly of mixed race and Persianized in culture) only spoke in Turkic dialects and were in the military. That is not enough participation in creating and forming the culture to deserve the name "Turko-Persian Tradition" – This is misinformation. All the elements in that area, which have to do with tradition and culture, were drawn from the Iranian culture (Persian, Kurdish, Azari, Baluchi, Tajik, Luri, Gilaki, Talishi, Mazandarani, etc.), and the Islamic faith, not much Turkic elements (like shamanism, yurts etc.) were incorporated in. That is what makes the name "Turko-Persian" an imaginary one and therefore the entry should be deleted.</i></dd>

<p>I find it ironic that you use aravand exclusively in describing the pictures, Arabs live on both sides of the river and they always called it shatt al arab <a href="../../../m/b/_/User%7EMB_30ac.html" title="User:MB">MB</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Azerbaijani, the Arabs have been present in Ahwaz, Linga, Abadan, and almost all of southern Iran since the Islamic conquests, and even much before that. This makes their presence in Iran date at least a millenia. This makes them as indigenous as Azeris, Kurds, Baluchs, Lurs, and even Persians. Here's a PDF file, <a href="http://www.ahwaz.org.uk/images/identity.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.ahwaz.org.uk/images/identity.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ahwaz.org.uk/images/identity.pdf</a> the lecturer asserts that the name changing of Arab cities to Persian names was a deliberate move to end all Arab presence from Iran by the Pahlavi regime. <a href="../../../m/b/_/User%7EMB_30ac.html" title="User:MB">MB</a></dd>

<dd>Actually majority of people living in Khuzestan are Lurs/Bakhtiars although there is a large. The majority of Arabs in Khuzestan came during the Safavid/Qajar era. The links from the site you provided is not reliable. As per name change, many cities had their name changed during the Arab conquest of Iran. As per the link you provided it has many historical errors since it is not written by historian. For example the name Khuzestan predates Aghlim-e-Ahvaz used by that author, since it is name used from Parthian times. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 19:34, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure, doost, anything you don't agree with, is simply not reliable. You keep pushing your POV and preach us about verifiability not truth, yet you come here and tell us it's not reliable? This speech was given in an Iranian university, you think nobody would speak up if it was unreliable? Check your facts, Aravand was only called that during the Pahlavi regime and the Arabs, although still a majority, lost great numbers in forced emigration (they were forced to run away into the western coasts of the Arabian Gulf) due to the Pahlavi regime's crimes against humanity committed by them. Not to mention the incessant terrorism from the Pahalavi regime in it's forced Persianization campaign, especially towards the Arabs. <a href="../../../m/b/_/User%7EMB_30ac.html" title="User:MB">MB</a>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually it is the other way around, since you can not bring any sources. Again you need to prove that the name aghlim-e-ahvaz was used before the parthian era! But you can't so your forced to write stuff that has no content in terms of evidence. Anyone can come and give a speech to a group of students. The fact is the name Khuzestan was not called Aghlim-e-Ahvaz before Khuzestan! Pre-Islamic sources (Parthian) have it Khuzestan(See Elam by D.Potts and the Ka'aba Zardosht inscription). Thus that guy does not know his history. Arvand rood is mentioned in the shahnameh (1000 years ago). As per reliability, you forget to mention that Arabian Gulf is a fake name madeup 50 years ago and there is not a single Arabic sources that has it. Thus it shows you fake history! as this is major mistake. Arvand rood is in the Shahnameh. As per terrorism, you forget arab slavery of blacks in sudan, saddams expelling of Iranians, his killings of shi'as and Kurds which are termed genocide, the treatment of shi'ites in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and etc. And there hasn't been any persianization campaign in Khuzestan, just many migrant Persian/Azeri workers in the oil industry. And there is a lot of native Persians way before that time where dialects exist: behbehan, shushtar, masjed soleymani.. etc plus the majority Luri/Bakhtiaris and even some Qashqai nomads. Note the guy you mentioned does not even have a doctorate. Once you find a single reliable source saying Khuzestan was called Aghlim-e-ahvaz before Khuzestan, then you can be taken credible. Talk does not substitute for evidence. Where is the evidence that Khuzestan was called Aghlim-e-Ahvaz before Khuzestan? Also your knowledge is lacking since we have at least 400,000 Arab refugees from Iraq in Khuzestan during Saddam era. I am sure if Iran was so bad, they would have migrated to Saudia Arabia! --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 22:06, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will try to check into very soon. However, I am still waiting for an actual debate in <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_architecture.html" title="Ottoman architecture">Ottoman architecture</a> - I spent a lot of time and tried to address all the concerns in the intro, and left many messages to the involved users + the article's talk page, but nobody said anything and blind reverts led to the article's protection... I would like to know how those sources implied that Persian influence was greater than Byzantine influence.. There was nothing in the sources or the the other five books that suggested anything close to Persian architecture being the most influential on Ottoman architecture. Anyways..

<p>Hey Azerbaijani,</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I don't think I can get involved in another dispute right now.

<p>Ok, but it doesn't really matter if these users haven't edited in weeks or months, because sockpuppetry in itself is not a violation of policy.

<p>I have seen that you often use accusations to promote your views. I looked at your talk page becasue I wanted to know why you disappeared from the Azerbaijan article's talk page, and I saw that instead of engaging in discussion (which you had often engaged in confrontational and accusatory fashion) you had reported that many users are actually one or two. Take me for an example! I am a new user. You know why I made an account? Becasue I saw such absurd and poor texts in the article about Azerbaijan. The same thing MAY happen with other people. When important articles are pushed to the edge of absurdity people get offended and get involved. I don't know about other users having suck puppets or something like that, but maybe you yourself think about your attitude toward other users and take their actions on good faith, and act on good faith yourself. Your username is "Azerbaijani" and I noticed that you are simply doing the opposite of a true Azerbaijani would do about his/her people. And unfortuantely you are doing these things without having neutral and reliable sources. Plese respect our homeland, Azerbaijan, and do not offend us! I am from Iran, but I am an Azerbaijani and so are those in the Republic of Azerbaijan. It is absurd to come up with various conspiracy theories and claim unfounded things simply becasue you want so. I hope you understand my point. THank you! <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 23:38, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Writing one's POV on the talk-page is not the same as to pushing for POV in an article. What exactly is POV that I have edited? What is POV that I have written? There are sock puppets on all sides of any article I guess, but not everyone is a sock puppet.

<p>Good job taking out some those edits by Babakexorramdin removing Persian language from various provinces. West Azerbaijan and Kermanshah province are still left. I am currently looking for sources for each province, though it seems silly that we should have to source information that is obvious simply because Persian is described as the main language in the country. He tried this at Mazandaran Province too, but I managed to find a source to remove it. If you find a source for any of this obvious information please add it, or link it to me so I can add it. For now, I am going to revert his edits at West Azerbaijan and Kermanshah. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 05:01, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whether you like it or not Persian is not a native langaueg, nor spoken on daily level by a substantial parts of the residents in these provinces? Just a question. Why werent you so disturbed when they had removed all non-Persian languages from the Iranian provinces pages? Why this selectivity? To be more clear: I am not a member of all these ethnic groups of Iran. I am an Iranian. But it is very wrong that some editors here (I do not say whom) think that Iran belongs to persian and the rests are minorities! Babakexorramdin 16:42, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reverted because you made your edits based off Behnam &amp; Kiumars' version, which was done largely without consensus. Firstly, there are way too many quotes, which makes the article look unencyclopedic. Also, what genetics? The section says "Further studies with Azeris in Iran may help determine", it doesn't say there have been no studies in Iran. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 04:36, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Azerbaijani. Thanks for the latest source you have provided in the talk page. Personally, I still support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Safavid_dynasty&amp;oldid=111437795" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Safavid_dynasty&amp;oldid=111437795" rel="nofollow">this</a> version of the intro.

<p>Maybe the intro should be slightly modified:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Safavids were a dynasty that ruled Iran from 1501 to 1722. They originated in North Western Iran and are considered by many as one of the greatest Iranian Empires since the Islamic conquest of Persia. A predominantly Azeri Turkic speaking family, probably of Kurdish origin, whose classical and cultural language was Persian, the Safavids established Shia Islam as the official religion of their kingdom. They also reasserted the original Persian cultural identity of the region, thus becomming the first native dynasty to establish an independent and united Iranian state after eight and a half centuries of rule by Arab, Turkic, and Mongol dynasties.</i></li>

<p>Well, I guess it doesn't make much of a difference between "empire" and "dynasty", but even the most minor things can be considered controversial in some people's eyes. That's why it's best if you try to solve your differences with Atabek at <a href="../../../s/a/f/Talk%7ESafavid_dynasty_8f5f.html" title="Talk:Safavid dynasty">Talk:Safavid dynasty</a>. As for Iranian Azerbaijan, I agree with you that it's less ambiguous, maybe as a compromise you could say "Azarbaijan"? Lastly, regarding Elsanaturk, you can go to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a> if you want and make a report similar to <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Parishan_reported_by_User:Artaxiad_.28Result:24_hours.29" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">this one</a>.

<dd>As I said, the other source implies they did so of free will - which is not backed up by any facts. On the other hands various news reports do state clearly they were forced to. You don't actually think they would have let themselves be used as propaganda pieces by the Iranian government, do you?

<dd>What are you reporting me for? You can't use a dispute tag because you don't like the source.

<dd>You have still not told me what you would be reporting me for. Also I have repeatedly used the talk page - I started a second section about it. Just because <i>you</i> do not believe a newspaper to be reliable does not mean you can dispute the entire section. As I said put some meaningful discussion with citations on its talk page. The current version does not use the newspaper story to assert this is the truth - it merely says the paper reported that. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 15:23, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
