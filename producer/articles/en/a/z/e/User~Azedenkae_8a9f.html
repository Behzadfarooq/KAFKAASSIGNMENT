<div class="thumbcaption">An illustration of Azedenkae by the Blood Knight</div>
<p><b>Description:</b><br />
Azedenkae has short, blue hair, with blue eyes. He is about 1 m 80, weighing 66 kg. Basically, from the outside, he looks like a human being, of course, within the limits of what people perceive 'normal' as. He usually wear whatever he grabs from his closet, which is either blue jeans, or grey pants. He either wears red, white or a black shirt, depending again, on what he grabs first. He never really do care much. His appearance could be really deceiving sometimes, because his emotions does not show a lot.<br /></p>
<p><b>Personality:</b><br />
After the fight with Susan, he had half-killed his good-side, making him even colder and more evil than before. However, due to his good-side merging with him in the last moment before the good-side truly died, he is more neutral than evil, but over-all on the evil side.<br />
<br />
There are two people when he meet however, would bring his good-side out, which is Serene and Tabitha. When is good-side emerges, he would be much more protective and caring, whilst normally, he would basically kill with only about 10% hesitation.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
- <i>Healing/Regrow</i> - Azedenkae can heal wounds very quickly, and Serene told him that this was due to him being able to control the placebo effect, which was the body healing itself subconsciously (although here its consciously). He can also regrow lost limbs, if he have enough materials in his body. If not, he would only have to eat more than normal, and, depending on the amount lost, may take a few days to a few weeks to heal completely.<br />
- <i>Ice Control</i> - He is able to lower his own temperature without stopping his metabolism, and since he is able to lower his body temperature, he could also freeze things around him. The water can be drawn from anywhere, nearby rivers, streams, even water vapour. However, he can only control the ice/water very well in a radius of 5 m. After that, 15 m is the maximum. More than 15 m, he can't control them even a little bit.<br />
- <i>Growth/Change</i> - He is able to change his DNA structure at will, although he rarely does that to his whole body, in case something would happen. Usually, he would just change his arm or hand to be able to photosynthesize and grow like a plant, so that he can attack an opponent, but otherwise, he would seldom use this power.<br />
<br />
<b>Weaknesses:</b><br />
-He is more specialized in melee attacks than ranged attacks, so in open spaces, where the opponent could run freely, he himself runs a high risk of losing... badly...<br />
-Also, since he can only control H20 (water) well, he can only make good ice weapons when there is sufficient water. Some other liquids he could freeze too, but not as good.<br />
-When turned on, his senses could be a weakness to him (Seeing something really disgusting really clearly due to good eyes, or everyone's voice cramming up his head due to people talking a lot, or smelling er... the thingy, which will make him vomit or worse, faint, etc. etc.)<br />
-His ice attacks could be melted quite easily by heat, but he can redo again, its just takes time to redo and stuff. If there is excess heat, or the heat controller is better than his power over coldness, he can't freeze stuff.<br />
-Like all other humans, he can get burnt and stuff, and stuff, and stuff.<br />
<br />
Other Abilities:<br />
- <i>Enhanced Senses</i> - Azedenkae can run continuously for a long time without tiring, but later will have to eat a lot to replace the lost materials. His senses are also enhanced, allowing him to seek out an opponent quite easily, making him fit for his job.<br />
<br />
<b>History:</b><br />
<i>Part 1: The Beginning</i><br />
Azedenkae was born into a very very rich family, whose parents were both owners of huge companies that made millions. Then one day, he heard that a bomb exploded in both companies at the same time, killing almost everyone. Although there is no confirmation that his parents were dead, he had never heard from them since. Therefore, at the age of 7, he inherited a third of his parent's money, his sister earning another third and the last third went to a woman named Mirielle that had been raising them until now.<br />
<br />
It seems that their parents had knew it all, because the moment the incidents happened, the woman had collected both of them, and drove them out of the city, and after 2 hours, they were in a small village, with a small house. At first both Azedenkae and Andreas were dissapointed, but when they were led into the basement under the house, they were not dissapointed anymore. As they spent the first day under the basement, the woman was sitting upstairs, watching the news about how a huge mansion in the city was just blown up minutes ago. She frowned, knowing what had just happened, and following the plan that she and Azedenkae's parents had discussed, she told the two that their parents were both dead. Being so little, they really didn't get the concept, and thought their parents had just gone to somewhere nice without them. After a while of argueing, the woman knew it is pointless to explain, and let them think what they think, which, she also knew, would had dire consequences.<br />
<br />
So, ever since then, they lived there, together, not really missing out on anything. Every weekday, the woman taught them subjects, and on Saturdays and Sundays, brought them to different places for entertainment, knowing that when Azadenkae reaches 15 and his sister reaches 17, she would need to remind them again, and tell them everything about their parents.<br />
<br />
But she did not succeed. At the age of 14, Azedenkae was more depressed than a normal teen. He was kind and all, but somehow very depressed. It turned out that he was being bullied by the neighbourhood kids. Mirielle noticed it, and went to their parents to talk. However, not only did they stop, they became even more annoying, until one day, after countless meetings between their parents and Mirielle, they were punished heavily by their parents. This made them very angry, and soon, they were going to do something that their parents forbid them to do a long time ago. Back when they were young, their parents told them that the boy next door lost his parents, and also told them what was said about Azedenkae's parents on TV, and told them to be careful with him, for he was very dangerous. Full of anger, the boys couldn't resist, and went to meet Azedenkae while he was treaming a few plants. The moment they came up to him, they started to reveal the secret. About how his parents tried to become super-humans by using chemicals to change genes, about how they kidnapped people to test the chemicals just to see if it works and finally, when they ran out of people to kidnap, they tested it on their children. Azedenkae had always loved his parents, even after 7 years since their dissapearance, he still love them, and the insult had sparked something in Azedenkae.<br />
<br />
With the pair of scissors in his hands, he forced it through one of the boys intestines, and then turned around to stab in another's heart. The first reactions of the boys were nothing, since they were just too fearful, but when the third boy got stabbed in the face, a mixture of blood, fluids and brain cells flew out, they just turned around and ran for their lives.<br />
<br />
About 10 seconds after the incident, Azedenkae realized what would happen, and ran away into the woods, swearing to never return again, and cursing his parents for being so cruel.<br />
<br />
It was also in the woods that he began to really calm down, and started testing his abilities. At first he didn't know what they were, but soon, after meeting a strange woman who called herself Serene, he began to learn about his abilities. Somehow, she had all the answers he wanted, and really cared about him. So, after 2 years of living with her, he had finally mastered almost all of his abilities, and then, on his birthday, she told him from then on he'll have to take care of himself. She'll still guard and take care of him in the house, but earning money and living outside is all him.<br />
<br />
Therefore, he had decided to become a 'mercenary', working for anyone who pay him enough money. If one work conflicts with the other, then he would do the one he accepts first, so basically, the first people to get to him will be able to use him against their opponents.<br />
<br />
<i>Part 2:</i><br />
Which was exactly what happened. Basically. Azedenkae was hired by the Brotherhood of Evil's boss, Zero, to attack the Titan's Tower. With the help of 10 ninja underlings and sudden attacks from other neutral characters, the ninjas he controlled managed to fight their way up, destroying everything in between. Azedenkae then fought in the living room, destroying most of it. Later, under his order, the ninjas went and destroyed the room further by setting it on fire, resulting in everything turning to ashes, including all the expensive machinery.<br />
<br />
Whilst that happened, Azedenkae helped Zero with capturing Rynfyre by stopping some of the members of the Teen Titans. He himself had a fight with Shaloth, a powerful titan. In the battle, he almost deliberately lost, due to him finding the job suddenly boring and pointless. He gave up on the fight, partly due to that, partly due to him knowing it would be really troublesome to go on. In the end, he sustained a massive injury, although it was healed quickly later.<br />
<br />
From then, Azedenkae hunted down Damien after accepting the job. He managed to successfully hunt Damien down and finished the job quickly, resulting in him finding some fun in life again. Azedenkae then returned to the tower to find a job from the titans, only to be rejected and suddenly rehired by Zero to cause more harm. However, later on he fell in love with one of the Titans, a girl named Tabitha, which made him change sides. But due to his injury from the titans themselves, Azedenkae couldn't do much except watch as Zero killed Wyndfyre, a Tamaranian.<br />
<br />
Due to this incident, Azedenkae suddenly felt responsible for everything that happened, and although he was now sort of accepted by the titans, he himself couldn't face the fact that he basically weakened them a lot and everything should be blamed on him. That is why he had ran away from the tower, into the city. There, he bought a diamond sword with cartosis weave. Afterwards, he went out and fought with a gang and after killing and eating a member of it, he ran away again.<br />
<br />
He came back to the tower without an actual purpose in mind. Here, he talked to a new girl and decided to look for Tabitha. On the way though, he met someone and decided to go back to the tower. From here, again, they left towards the BoE base where they launched an attack, but as it happened, there was a 'call' from Serene and Azedenkae had to leave.<br />
<br />
He came to Serene and Damien's place only to meet Susan, a person with a special power that can split 1 person into his/her good and bad side. Azedenkae's bad side mortally wounded Azedenkae's good side, but since he had healing powers, Azedenkae's good side was healing himself when they merged again. Due to merging, Azedenkae's good side died, making Azedenkae more evil than usual.<br /></p>
