<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article constantly vandalised by Armenians, paid or non-paid</span></h2>
<p>This article is obviously constantly vandalised by Armenians. They are pretending to be Iranians but they are Armenians and admins should not allow Armenian propaganda. This article is nothing but Armenian propaganda and misinformation. Azerbijan IS NOT as written here. The continuous Armenian vandalism shows what their civilisation is all about. They have created many account and pretend to be from Iran. Look at the economy of Armenia and it will be clear instead of workinh to make their country better they are paying people to spread misinformation. 80.97.82.93 19:24, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lets clarify/define our subject matters, as it is used in English.</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Azerbaijan</b> is the name of an independent country as well as the name of the northern part of Iran. Both are mostly populated by Azeri Turks! But also include minorities like Georgians, Lezgins, Kurds, Talishs and Armenians .</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Iran</b> is a country with many ethnic groups as well (Including Arabs, Kurds, Persians/Fars and , Turks ...)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Persian</b> is the English name for ethnic group whose native name is <b>Fars</b> in Iran.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The terms Persian (Fars) or Turk or Arab, are refereing to an ethnic group, based on language only(not race or citizentiop ). Ethnicity is based on language, which defines the identity, culture etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Turkish</b> (when not speaking of language)is a refrence for any citizen of Turkey, also name of Language and ethnic group mainly in Turkey.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Turk</b> is a broader name for people that live in todays Turkey, Azerbaijan, and northern part of Iran!</li>
<li><b>Iranian</b> is who ever who is citizen of Iran.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can say:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I am <b>an Azeri</b>/Azerbaijani, because I am a citizen of Azerbaijan or from northern part of Iran , and</li>
<li>I am <b>a Turk</b> in refrence to my language and ethnicity, but</li>
<li>I am <b>not Turkish</b> as I am not citizen of Turkey.</li>
<li>I am <b>an Iranian</b> as I am citizen of Iran.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>-So an Azerbaijani can be an Iranian when it comes to citizentip . So you can say: <b>X is an Iranian-Azeri.</b></p>
<p>-Or an Afghani can be Persian but not Iranian when we talk of ethnicity. So you can say: <b>Y is a Afghani-Persian</b>.</p>
<p>If you have different definitions of these terms and references please define them. <a href="../../../m/e/h/User%7EMehrdadd_0feb.html" title="User:Mehrdadd">Mehrdad</a> 12:42, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">If you want to know what Azeri's are ask Azeri's for the answer will be obviously what we and that is Azeri Turks</span></h2>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'd just like to state that the poor bunch of Pan-Persians foaming at the mouth are making total fool's of themselves.</p>
<p>As an Azeri Turk in diaspora thanks to the opressive Iranian regime I can openly state that my language is Turkish, I am a Turk, yet also an Iranian as in citizen. The reason I say this is because Iran does not recognise my language, provide's no education in my language, we are made to feel that as Turks we are not Iranians as to be Iranian you must speak Persian and abide by the Persian rules and culture.</p>
<p>For this reason I do not regard myself as an "equal" Iranian, me and millions like me are not allowed to speak the language of the people who ruled this land for 1000 years which is a real shame.</p>
<p>Turks have been in the region for over 2000 years, open your history books and read it, it is documented as far back to 500 BC.</p>
<p>The Khazar's and their ancestor's settled in the region in 100 AD, so the claim of no Turks being in the region prior to the Selcuks is a common Persian lie.</p>
<p>To see for yourselves about the linguistic state in Iran here is an objective source.</p>
<p><br />
<b>For Iran</b></p>
<p>Azerbaijani, South [azb] 23,500,000 in Iran (1997). Population includes 290,000 Afshar, 5,000 Aynallu, 7,500 Baharlu, 1,000 Moqaddam, 3,500 Nafar 1,000 Pishagchi, 3,000 Qajar, 2,000 Qaragozlu, 130,000 Shahsavani (1993). Population total all countries: 24,364,000.</p>

<p><br />
That;s almost 30 million Native Turkish speakers in Iran.</p>
<p>If there are any here who still try to deny we are Turks then tell us this in our own language, let's debate this in Turkish which is our language, oh but you can't can you because you are not Azeri, Qaskay or Turkmen.</p>
<p>It would be alot better if you could just accept the realities, we are not Persian, don't speak Persian, Azeri Turks of Iran are Iranian citizens, Azeri Turks of Azerbaijan are Azerbaijan citizen's and luckily have their beautiful language as the National one, they teach our fabulous language in schools, its the language of the state, of media, of national identity, there they can be what they are and speak their mind about who they are.</p>
<p>Shamefully this isn't the case in my country, even more disgracefull is when these Persian's start foaming at the mouth calling anyone who say's they are a Turk an agent from Turkey.</p>
<p>Please, stop the paranoia, were living inside Iran, not in Turkey, if you carry on fooling yourself otherwise very soon South Azerbaijan will be joining the Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran will have been destroyed by the Persians.</p>
<p>I have visited the Republic of Azerbaijan many time's, it make's me so proud and happy to see my nation living our and speaking our beautiful language, to see them proud and open about who they are, a place where being a Turk is a beatiful thing, hopefully one day the same will be said for Iran.</p>

it just shows , that my figures were right ,i said 20-22 millions azeris and eight to nine millions kurds but that souce seems to be pretty well it would mean , that today thre are about 25 millions azeris and 8 millions kurds in iran, considering population growth kurdish dialects <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Iran" class="external free" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Iran" rel="nofollow">http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Iran</a> Hawrami [hac] 22,948 in Iran Kurdish, Central [ckb] 3,250,000 in Iran Kurdish, Northern [kmr] 350,000 in Iran Kurdish, Southern [sdh] 3,000,000 in Iran (2000 Fattah).

<li><b>Guys, Ethnologue figures are wrong</b>, their sums do not add up. If you add up all their figures on different languages it adds up to 72.7 million people and that is 5.2 millions more than the population of Iran (that also includes 3-4 millions Afghan refugees and others).

I'm really sorry to read these oponions,what are you talking about? we are all Iranian/persian. have you forgotten that lots of goveners in the past and even now are turks(safavi dynasty, qajar dynasty and ...) but we all speak Persian in order to comminiucate, why are you trying to follow divid and control policy by Britain, they just try to make our country smaller and then control us widely. Please stop this racist policy and accept that we as an kurd,Lur,pars,Turk,Arab and even Afgan are all a nation IRANIAN/PERSIAN 213.207.238.78 10:29, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cite the study, its authors, when was done, who funded, who published -- there is not such credible scientific studies and it is generally easy to distinguish most ethnic Azerbaijanis from most ethnic Persians, for example. Often, there are anthropological differences, although I've never dwelled into details of such research. Of course, this doesn't mean that ethnic Azerbaijanis don't have Caucasian, Iranian, Semitic and other lineage, but then all ethnic Persians and other Iranians have also Turkic, Caucasian, Semitic and other lineages too. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 00:13, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let us speak about scientific facts to be consistent. Nex time when you claim something please be specific and give us the name, number, date and page numbers of the scientific journal. Or else you are funny. You may not like Turks. But you should not lie. Apart from Iran rest of the world says that Azeris are mostly of Turkish origin. Nowadays Iran has an Southern Azerbaijan problem and trying to claim that Azeris are Iranian. But this will not work. You can not meet scientific facts with emotional claims. In Azerbaijan there are of course dark coloured citizens resemble Iranians. But they are not majority.</p>

<li>I don't know if you are azeri or no, but me as an azeri no more know myself iranian...Iran as i remember was: "countries of Iran" till 90 years ago till it became one centralized country which south-azerbaijan was part of this union, but tanx no more, I've had enough.</li>

<p>The Azerbaijan page lacked references and quotes from the authoritative English-language sources, and the following were added: CIA World Factbook's succinct description, the 4 UN Security Council resolutions, the PACE resolution and the OIC resolution, along with the US Presidential Determination.

If you add these numbers up according the linquistic origin this what is comming up :
Turkic speaking people ( Azeri Turks, Turkmens, Avshars etc...) - 34.000.000!
Persian speaking people ( Persians and Lours ) - 33.000.000
Afgans - 1.000.000
Kurds - 4.000.000
Balujis - 3.500.000
Others ( Armenians, Jews, Talishs )- 500.000
  These are the statistics. Now tell me:
 Why should the official language of Iran should be Persian?
 Why Turks can not learn their native language in schools in Iran?
 Why Kurds can not learn their native language in Iran?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Figures of Iranian Azeris</span></h2>
<p>Where is this bull about 25 million Iranian Azeris coming from? Azeris constitute one-fourth of Iran's population...Iran's population is 70 million...25 million would only be accurate if Iran's population were 100 million, in which case one-fourth or 25 percent would be just that, 25 million. Do the math again...also, Azerbaijan Republic is not 8 million Azeris it is six and half million, because one and a half million Talish are not ethnic Azeris (I am even going as far as counting Lezgins as ethnic Azeris, which they are not)...Azerbaijan Republic has had one agenda since its foundation...to take over northern IRAN which it still refers to as "South Azerbaijan" as if it were a southern province of Azerbaijan Republic, and stir up ethnic strife in Iran. Iran's policy of supporting Armenia and keeping Azerbaijan Republic weak is right on the money...you don't let your sworn enemy get an inch. IRAN is with you ARMENIA! Long live Hayistan! Long live independent Talish-Mughan Republic! Long live Nagorno-Karabakh Republic/Armenia! Aliyev, you will see Tabriz the same day you see Stepanakert (Xankendi as you call it)...NEVER!</p>
<ul>
<li>My good friend, It is not Aliyev’s plan it is America’s plan. America fears that Northern Azeris may want to join Iran (the mother land) and they have been working hard on several plans in the last 10 years but as you can see Iran is still Iran and is getting stronger everyday with the help of all Iranians (Azeri and Fars and Kurds and the other 75 languages apparently spoken in Iran according to Ethnologue!). Iran was not build in a day and will not be destroyed in a day. <a href="../../../k/i/u/User%7EKiumars_2e7c.html" title="User:Kiumars">Kiumars</a> 08:31, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Ethnologue figures are wrong</b>, their sums do not add up.

<dd>To all the provocateurs: according to the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences' most recent estimate (2004), Azerbaijanis constitute up to 28% of Iranian population or, as they also mention, according to other calculations about 1/3 of the population. This does not include other Turkic peoples that are scattered in the south and north-east of the country, which is another 3-4%.

<p>I don't think that "Land of the Eternal Fire" is a motto as much as it is a nickname. A motto would be more like a phrase or a short list of words meant formally to describe the general motivation or intention of an entity (in this case a specfic country). Take the mottos of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> ("In God We Trust"), the <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_Republic_12a4.html" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a> ("Truth prevails!"), or <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> ("Peace at Home, Peace in the World") for example. By comparison, "Land of the Eternal Fire" is merely a literal meaning of a word ("Azerbaijan") and does not describe the general motivation or intention of the Republic of Azerbaijan. I'm removing it until somebody can find an actual motto for the country (if one even exists). -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 14:07, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Historical revisionist theory</span></h2>
<p>The theory that the name Azerbaijan has anything to do with Turkic is historical revisionism. Firstly, it does not explain why the term Azarbaijan, Azarpadegan, and Atropatene were used, thousands of years (Atropatene, Azarpadegan) and centuries (Azarbaijan) before the Turkic peoples even got there? Historical revisionism, ordered during the time of the Soviets (direct orders from Stalin), to do several things: a)making sure the history of Azerbaijan has nothing to do with Iran, b) rewrite the history of the territory and the newly formed republic. Secondly, the Az people the Turkic theory is referring to is a pure lie. There was only one Az people in the Near East/Eurasia, a people that had nothing to do with the region. Also, the name Azerbaijani was only invented in the 1890's by the Russians to distinguish Turkic peoples of Iranic descent from other Turkic peoples. Again, this does not explain the "Az" people reference. This theory is pure historical revisionism. I'm taking it out. Furthermore, the name Azerbaijan is the Turkified version of Azarbaijan, because the Turkic languages cannot prounce Azar, therefore, again, this shows that there is no way the name Azerbaijan was original.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 22:23, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1. I added a new sentence saying that the Republic was called Azerbaijan before, paraphrasing the sentence coming before it. 2. I removed two paragraphs. First of them (that the Bolsheviks kept the name because they wanted iran) refer to an obscure pan-Iranian web page and an ideologically motivated article, which cannot be neutral and is not. This is against the rules of Wikipedia. And the second one, claiming that Resulzade was regretting the choice of the name, is very selective. He was a politician and could have said something like that at one point. Yet he devoted his entire life to Azerbaijan, both in name and substance. The organizations he created in exile, the periodicals he published, all of them bear the name of Azerbaijan, mainly referring to today’s Republic of Azerbaijan. It was a misinformation to insert such a paragraph. And instead of adding pages from Resulzade’s life, I thought a better idea would be to remove it. Since coming out of context, that paragraph’s only aim is to further the claim of the person who inserted it to the page, that Azerbaijan is a fake/political name chosen for the Republic. Thanks.

<p>First of all, this page about the history of and modern Azerbaijan. There is page in Wiki called 'History of the name Azerbaijan" where the section under discussion should be moved. Then, the NPOV, reliability of sources can be discussed there.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Ali. I think that the name is not the most important issue about Azerbaijan. It is enough to provide a link to the <i>History of the name of Azerbaijan</i> article in the etimology section, where everyone can refer for more details about the name. That article reflects all existing views on the issue, which is impossible to fit in the format of this article, which provides only brief overview of the country. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 11:43, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Pan-Iranians,</p>
<p>One does not have to have a high level of IQ to see how selective you are in your choices of information from the pages of history and how you paraphrase them to fit the ultimate goal of yours: that the Republic of Azerbaijan is a fake entity. I really do not care even if we got the name 50 years ago, Resulzade was aplogizing for it, etc. What matters for us, people living in that land, is the well being of the people there, that is it. I am extremely amused by the fact that, Iranians, forgetting about putting their house into order, failing to create a decent society in such a culturally and economically rich area, ending up with one of the most ridiculously heart-breaking societal and political institutions in the entire world, still spend time and money to spoil other people's day by attacking their identity. Every identity emerged at one point in time. Every name emerged at one point in time. America? France? Turkey? Coming to the fore 1000 years ago or 100 years ago; why should that matter? Mind your own business guys.</p>
<p>And the point is that you do not have good faith. You have a political agenda in negating today's republic. That is, listen carefully please, you are not removing someting that in anyway touches Iran or falsifies anything any normal Iranian cares about, rather, you are ADDING things to this webpage to claim that Republic of Azerbaijan is fake in name and of course, by the same token, substance.</p>
<p>I will check Tadeusz Swietochowski's quote, i do not have the book with me now. So I leave it untouched. But please do not remove my citation from Velikhanli; I can send the book's copy or the translation thereof if you want to. And hey, I don't know Grandmaster, probably he is just a decent fellow guy. And our presence here is spontaneous; this is our country. That is very different from your artificially organized interventions. And that is why our natural determination will overwhelm any kind of fake stubbornness on your side. Thanks. Elnurso 19:08, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Save your time about the Tadeusz Swietochowski quote, your friend Grandmaster put that in there I believe.

So I suggest you stop removing such information just because it is not to your liking.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 19:43, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was indeed me who provided the quote from Swietochowski in response to claims of some of our Iranian friends that the territory north of Araks was never called Azerbaijan. Swietochowski says that the <i>northern part of Azerbaijan</i> was known at times (i.e. not always) as Albania and Arran, but it is one geographic area, stretching from the northern slopes of the Caucasus Mountains along the Caspian Sea to the Iranian plateau. I think he’s absolutely right. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 19:52, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Grandmaster,</p>
<p>Honestly I did paraphrase the sentence that is referenced to Swietochowski ragrding the name before. I didn't and still do not know whether it was an exact quote; that was one reason (please let me know if it is, i do not have the book with me right now). And secondly, the unprovoked spoilers created such a semantic context around the quotation that it looks as if it supports their irrelevant argument. But please keep an eye on it so that they do not play with the exact prhase. Take care and nice to talk to you. Elnurso 16:23, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The quote is accurate, but it does not support their point whatsoever. In fact, it shows that north of Araks was called Azerbaijan as well, while at certain periods in history it was called Albania or Arran/Shirvan. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 18:32, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just out of curiosity folks, this is an article about "Azerbaijan" which, whether some like it or not, is a recognised established sovereign state. This is not a forum for debating politics. So why are so many Iranians writing and editing Azerbaijan anyway?! I am Iranian myself and this is the first time I came across this article and I just noticed it is so obvious that the article has been edited by Iranians, but Iranians shouldn't be editing "Iranian Azerbaijan"? Besides, in the early 19th century many countries did not exist that exist now, and countries obviously, for obvious reasons chose a name that usually reflected the nationality of that country, not what that area had been called hundreds or thousands years ago. When Russians conquered north of the Aras there was nor province or administrative area called Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan was established as a province of Iran AFTER the wars with Russia. The reason for naming an area withing Iran Azerbaijan at that time was the ethnic mix of that area, i.e. Turks, so they chose an old name, Azerbaijan, which had never been clearly defined but it had historically been referred to somewhere between Lake Urmia and the Caspian sea. So, neither Iranian Azerbaijan nor the republic of Azerbaijan are exactly what historic Azerbaijan was, because there are no data avalailable to say exactl where historic Azerbaijan started and ended. Historic Azerbaijan may have not included the current provinces of West Azarbaijan and Zanjan that are mostly Azeri populated!!! 85.186.230.115 18:39, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Canada was created 200 years ago - fictional name, version of aboriginal area's name. So, what? Iran itself had different names - Persia, Parphia, Sassanid, etc. Should we start a battle on the page Iran about its name? And I mentioned above - this page about history and modern Azerbaijan. There is separate page -"History of name Azerbaijan" where all section should be moved. I don't mind to discuss various version there, and somehoe accomodate them.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 18:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">BIG FAULTS IN THE ARTICLE</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that there are political arguments here rather than other things and from reading the article it can be seen that it has been politicised in the text. Let's look at the following text:</p>
<p>With the collapse of Tsarist Russia in 1917, the Musavat ("Equality") Turkic Federalist Party, which had pan Turkic elements within it, met in Tbilisi on May 27, 1918 to create their own state, which they named Azerbaijan. According to some sources, the name Azerbaijan was adopted in order to claim north western Iran.[4][5] The Bolsheviks re-conquered the Caucasus and kept the name Azerbaijan, in hopes of later adding north western Iran into the Soviet Union.[6][7] Mohammad Amin Rasulzade, the leader of Musavat party, later admitted a mistake in choosing the name Azerbaijan for the state, saying that Albania (referring to Caucasian Azerbaijan) was different than Azerbaijan (referring to Iranian Azerbaijan). Rasulzade Also declared his eagerness to do "whatever is in his power to avoid any further discontent among Iranians".[8]</p>
<p>The references of this paragraph are from 1) a letter of Aremania to the UN in which the writer has some claims. Is this a source when writing an article about Azerbaijan?? To refer to a letter from a representative of a waring nation?? The other two sources are from a book and an article from Atabaki Touraj and other from N. Kawyani. These cannot be taken as reliable source becasue books and article, opposed to reliable and accepted scientific or scholarly institutions can have the sole purpose of politics. I am not against citing from them but in a neutral way, noit as declaratively as above: "which had pan Turkic elements within it" or "Mohammad Amin Rasulzade, the leader of Musavat party, later admitted a mistake in choosing the name Azerbaijan for the state, saying that Albania (referring to Caucasian Azerbaijan) was different than Azerbaijan (referring to Iranian Azerbaijan). Rasulzade Also declared his eagerness to do "whatever is in his power to avoid any further discontent among Iranians"." The reader understands that these are proved facts but they are not reliable so the texting of the article must be changed to be more neutral. Whoever reads this article clearly understands that the name Azerbaijan is wrong! Bm79 04:36, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About the name Azerbaijan</span></h2>
<p>Involved parties, please let's have a debate and solve the problem in a civilised manner. The article, as it suggest, is too mcuh politicising. We should offer different points of view in the article if the name is that important, in an impartial manner. At this moment the article is too much POV, politicised. This damages the article's credibility. We should solve the problem and remove the "neutrality dispute" tag. We are supposed to be civilised people, right? We are talking about Iran's old and strong civilisation, right? Then we shall be able to discuss one simple artile. Iranians and zerbijanis have a long history of brotherhood and separating them from each other is not correct, so let's unite and find a common ground to write a good article. Is it possible? It is ture that there is a Republic of Azerbaijan at this moment, but Iranians and those from the republic of Azerbijan shall also behave like civilised people rather than quarreling. Politics have devided us, but we can still be united. I invite my fellow people from th OLD great IRAN to come together and talk about the issues they do not agree aupo. I am sure we can find common ground. Thanks and looking forward. I am sure neither the Iranians nor the Azeris of the Republic are in bad faith but we (they) fail to cool down a bit.

<dd>My personal opinion is that all that stuff about the name should be moved to the article about the name, otherwise what’s the point of its existence? The etymology section should not repeat the history section, which it does now. The declaration of Azerbaijan’s independence is currently described twice, in two different sections. It should not be so. I think that it is enough to leave a link to the History of the name Azerbaijan in the etymology section, rather than duplicate the history section with Iranian POV interpretations. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 06:42, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atropates</span></h2>
<p>There is no reason to revert my edit that describes Atropates as a Persian. I sourced this to a page at livius.org that describes him as a Persian nobleman. I don't know why it is thought that by being satrap in Media makes him ethnically Median.

I don't know where the idea that he was "Iranian" comes from, unless Iranian peoples in general are meant. If so, the Persian description is only more specific.

<dd>They usually mix up Iranian and Persian because its basically the same or known as the same thing do you have any other references stating that he is "Persian"? Nareklm 06:52, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know they tend to mix them up, but I saw this source as giving it more specifically. I'll take a look for repeats of that notion. Are you still against having it in place of "Iranian", which could mean "Median" or "Persian" in this situation? Right now we have one fairly reliable source(livius.org) stating him as Persian, while none(that I can tell) stating him as an actual Mede. If it had simply called him a "Persian satrap", I would be more doubtful since it could be referring to employment as satrap under Persian empire. But it states him as a "Persian nobleman". Tell me if there is some reason to doubt the identification. Have you seen something identifying him with a different Iranian group? Of course, nothing will happen until protection ends, but it is good to get it worked out.

<dd>Well, I have thought of a solution. Just call him a "satrap of Media," not mentioning exactly which type of Iranian he was ethnically.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sources again</span></h2>
<p>All the sources in the disputed part of etymology section are not reliable. One of them is called <i>Letter dated 30 April 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Armenia to the United Nations</i> <a href="http://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/56/a5664.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/56/a5664.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. How this can be considered a reliable source? By the same token I can make edits to the article about Armenia using as reference letters of Azerbaijani government to UNO. The other 2 sources are nationalistic Iranian Faroukh and Reza, both extremely biased and prejudiced anti-Azerbaijani sources. How about citing neutral sources to support the claims made in that section? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 06:16, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is like describing the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> using only <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamist.html" title="Islamist">Islamist</a> sources. People who support the use of these sources need to explain why they should be used, because they do not appear reliable. Armenia is the closest Azerbaijan has to an enemy, while the other sources are from irredentist Iranians who happen to include Azerbaijan as part of their imagined Iranian super-state. It is in the interests of both of these groups to deem Azerbaijan as a somehow illegitimate state. Considering this is the page for that entire nation, it is understandable that people find use of these sources objectionable and demeaning, if not downright offensive. I suggest that such views only be expressed in the article devoted to the naming controversy, and that the section here only have a short, neutral statement simply explaining the proposed meanings for the name. There should be no mention of pan-Turkists and attempts to claim northwestern Iran, as placing emphasis on allegations is not usually appropriate for general articles about a nation. While it seems that defenders of these sources are taking a break while the page is locked as this unacceptable version, I hope that they are honorable enough to be open to discussion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 06:44, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wonder how this article has been accepted. I have noticed that there are many people who are constantly changing the articles about Azerbaijan and have no interest in discussion. It is visible that these articles have no intention of giving useful information about the country Azerbaijan but rather to give the impression that the country Azerbaijan if illegitimate. As long as Azerbaijan exists what is the point of an encyclopedia proving or not whether the country's name is from this or that or whether the country is legitimate or not? And of course the sources mentioned are absolutely unreliable. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 19:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have to prove that these sources are not reliable, since you are the one making the accusations. Whats wrong with a document submitted to the United Nations? You cannot claim that a source is not reliable due to nationality. Both Dr. Farrokh and Dr. Atabki are respected historians who work for Western Universities. Dr. Farrokh himself is half Iranian Azerbaijani. Neither of them are nationalists. Both, as far as I know, are against the current regime and neither of them have any goals of an Iranian super state, but rather protecting Iranian history from Pan Turkist attacks. Dr. Farrokh himself, in his online book, clearly says that he has nothing against Turks, nor the people of the Republic of Azerbaijan. He even goes as far as to call them brothers and sisters. However, when it comes to history, he is a specialist and when it comes to the name of Azerbaijan and the country in the Caucasus, they merely state the facts. <b>Again, you have to prove that the sources are not reliable with evidence</b>. Remember, the only reason that sources from the government of Azerbaijan are unacceptable is because the government openly supports historical revisionism. In 1988, the then president claimed that Armenia was a fictitious state created on Azerbaijani land. The president of Azerbaijani's website claims many non-Azerbaijani's to be Azerbaijani. Infact, I have even heard that the embassies of Azerbaijan (I forgot which one, but I'll try to find it) claim that Zoroastrianism was originally a Turkish religion. <b>So far, none of you have brought any evidence, all you have pulled out was the race card, and a sources reliability is not based on race or nationality</b>. Please dont waste any of our time if the race issue is the only thing you can bring up.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 21:21, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as the UN document goes, it had nothing to do with the fact that the representative for Armenia is ethnically Armenian. The problem is that the document is arguing in Armenia's favor about a conflict between the two countries, and part of this is arguing that Azerbaijan is somehow an illegitimate state. Have you read that document? It is no innocent work of scholarship; this document is just another part of their war. It is most unfair to rely so heavily upon the words of the enemy in describing a nation.</p>
<p><b>So, be careful before you accuse people of pulling "the race card".</b></p>
<p>Pan-Turkists have said some stupid things. While I am sure they would count as unreliable sources, this doesn't matter here, as they are not being used. I don't see what is so 'defensive' about the claim that the name Azerbaijan was chosen to claim northwestern Iran, but it is certainly controversial, in that citizens of the country find this description disagreeable. Considering that this is the main page for the entire nation, and that these views are not only controversial, but are also essentially fringe views in a fringe debate, I think it is more reasonable to not mention such things on this page. Perhaps on the page about the naming controversy the pan-Turkist and Iran 'defender' views can battle it out, but there is no good reason to mention it here. The fact that only certain sides receive representation only makes this worse.</p>
<p>I think it would be best to simply not mention controversial matter here, as this would probably be able to remove the neutrality tag much faster than any possible integration of opposing views for what is essentially a trivial debate in comparison to the description of the country as a whole. I hope you consider this proposal, as I think it would greatly reduce edit warring and disputes on this page. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 22:18, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The section has already been shortened considerably several times due to requests by Grandmaster and others as evident by the history. There is nothing controversial about this, its about the history of the name of Azerbaijan and how it applies to the country, it in no way is saying that the country is illegitimate, it merely questions the name used for it.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 22:22, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for Comment: Azerbaijan</span></h2>
<p>This is a dispute about the content of this article.</p>
<p>I see there are serious problems with this article and some interests that are not allowing this article be other than what they see fit. Please, some unbiased editors, do some serious editing! Maybe, just maybe, there are enemies of the state Azerbaijan who are absolutely determined on putting their view on this page.</p>
<p>First of all the article mentions some sources who question the name "Azerbaijan". The name is officially accepted by the UN. If there are disputes about the name that should be mentioned somewhere else, at some other article about the name, or the controversy around it, having an open place in which both sides of the story are told. What is the point of questioning the name of a country at the main article about that country? This is obviously not written by Azerbaijanis or unbiased editors.</p>
<p>Second, there are clearly and openly sources from, pay attention here, ARMENIA and IRAN who are mentioned in the article. Armenia has, agaist international law, occupied 16% or so of Azerbaijani territory. Iran has a very large area named Azerbaijan too and nationalist Iranians and Iranian authorities are not friendly toward Azerbaijan becasue they fear separatism in Iranian Azerbaijan. How can the article about Azerbaijan contain sources from Armenia and Iran? This is absurd. As someone else above mentioned then we can write about the USA using Marxist or Islamist, eventually Iranian sources who will question democracy and everything else in the US.</p>
<p>And the use of the phrase "pan-Turkist" in the article is also strange becasue Azerbaijan is a Turkic country so what is the point? If Pan-Turkism is mentioned as being something evil, then again the sources of the phrase must be viewed, whether they are biased or not. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 02:23, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pan-Iranist views like Pejman47 's are precisely the sort that threaten the neutrality of this article. Of course those certain Iranian academics call Azerbaijani people "brothers and sisters"! They believe that they are supposed to be Iranian, and that they would be had not the incompetent Shahs lost the land. I don't disagree, but as far as this article goes, the pan-Iranist view shouldn't receive as much emphasis as it does. I think the best solution is to relegate the discussion entirely to the article that is devoted to the discussion; that way, there will be no conflict on the main article for the nation. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 21:53, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please read what Wikipedia has to say about NPOV. So far, it seems I'm the only one that knows about this policy. As I explained above, its about the history of the name Azerbaijan and it is correctly placed in the section about the name. Also, it links to the main article where more information is presented (you fail to realize that this small section with a few sources is so because certain users pushed for it to be like this). Also, this in no way questions the legitimacy of any nation, but rather the name choices.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 02:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm commenting here briefly as I don't have much time. The sources in the name section at least are utter bunk. "milliondollarbabies.com" o___O Something like "According to Iranians Dr. <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveh_Farrokh_8964.html" title="Kaveh Farrokh">Kaveh Farrokh</a> and the Dr. Enayatollah Reza, the Bolsheviks re-conquered the Caucasus and kept the name Azerbaijan, in hopes of later adding north western Iran into the Soviet Union [8][9]." might be acceptable, but for assertions like this you really need one or more impartial academic publications stating it. e.g. Books or journal articles. Iranians, Armenian, Azerbaijani and Turkish sources should probably be excluded, and where they are included, <i>all</i> sides of the debate should be represented. That is, "According to X, Y, but according to A, B". - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 10:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I fully agree with that, but I also think that the article about the country is not the best place to discuss this. I support Ali's proposal to provide a link in this article to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_name_Azerbaijan_5c27.html" title="History of the name Azerbaijan">History of the name Azerbaijan</a>, where the issue is discussed in much detail. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 11:05, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that these facts are not theories invented by Dr. Farrokh and Dr. Atabaki (<b>Both of whom are professionals and respected members of the scholarly community</b>), they are based on substantial evidence, such as the <b>founder of the ADR himself admitting that it was a mistake to name the nation he founded Azerbaijan</b>. There are many other historians that agree with them (I will try and get their names). Grandmaster, you cannot keep saying it does not belong here because it is right under the section about the name and it is a <b>very significant part of the history of the Azerbaijan Republic</b>. It links to the main article which elaborates more on the issue.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 21:22, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Francis. Let me bring to your attention that Grandmaster has systematically tried to sabotage that section with continuous complaints. First it was too long, too wordy, not worded right, etc.. etc... (just look at the history of the article) and all his demands have been met and he keeps coming up with new ones. Now he wants to completely take it out of the article. May I remind you that the information is in the correct place, has been significantly reduced, and has the sources it has because it is not the main article (if you click on the main article, you will see more information). Dr. Atabaki and Dr. Farrokh are two well known and well respected historians who both work for western universities. Neither are nationalists, and <b>Dr. <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveh_Farrokh_8964.html" title="Kaveh Farrokh">Kaveh Farrokh</a> himself is half Azerbaijani (from Iran) half Ossetian and he was born in Greece</b>! Neither of them support any ideals based on nationalism. Everything they say are based on facts (you can read there books, everything is referenced). <b>Again, these are very respected historians in the field of Iranian history</b>.</i></dd>

<dd>Secondly, documents from the Republic of Azerbaijan cannot be compared to those of Armenia or any other nation. <b>The government of the Republic of Azerbaijan supports and is active in historical revisionism</b>. The Azerbaijani "historians", "academics", and even the government, claim some fantastic things, such as Napoleon was a Turk, that Turks have been living in the Middle East for 8 thousand years, and that <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> was a Turkic religion, among many many other things. The Azerbaijani president in 1988 even claimed that the nation of Armenia is a "fictitious nation founded on Azerbaijani land". This is ridiculous, as there are maps showing Armenia from the time of the ancient Greeks and Babylonians! Infact, it is the other way around, as Azerbaijan has <b>never</b> been the name for the land of the present day Republic of Azerbaijan. <b>The founder of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (which was established in 1918), admitted that he was mistaken in choosing the name Azerbaijan for his new nation</b>.</dd>

Notice that the information I am trying to keep in that section is very small, the majority is a quote that Grandmaster himself insists on having in there, instead of in the main article.</dd>

<dd>I can bring you two Soviet documents that attest to this, both of them were dispatched before the Soviets actually put their plan into effect and separated Iranian Azerbaijan from Iran in 1946. They describe how the Soviets would send agents into Iran to distort the Azeri's perception of their relation with Azerbaijan SSR, to start propaganda infiltrations to Iran, etc... The Soviets were also the first to introduce the term "Southern Azerbaijan" (referring to Iranian Azerbaijan, which is infact the only area legitimately using the term Azerbaijan, even today), which was part of their campaign of rewriting the history of the Cacuasus to remove Iran's ties with the region. So the statement "<i>According to Iranians Dr. Kaveh Farrokh and the Dr. Enayatollah Reza</i>" is incorrect, because <b>this is not their theory, this is fact</b>.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 23:19, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Um, in response to your "challenge", I suggest that you look at my statements regarding the UN document from the Armenian Representative arguing Armenia's side in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Simply put, it is a very biased source to use, but I suggest that you try to read my more extensive discussion from above. <b>Do you really need me to re-paste my previous arguments? Are you unable to simply read them from above?</b> I think you did, but you apparently ignored them. You brush off the problematic UN document with, "Whats wrong with a document submitted to the United Nations?". I had just described what was wrong with it, but you instead acted as if the very fact that it was submitted at the UN makes it a reliable, unbiased source. There is absolutely no logic whatsoever behind such a generalized treatment. The <i>content</i> and the <i>purpose</i>, in addition to its context and scholarly quality, determine its reliability. The document is an argument against Azerbaijan, and the author is the representative of Armenia, the main enemy of Azerbaijan. I have brought forth these ideas previously, but you failed to address them. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 22:46, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Regardless, Grandmaster is trying to get rid of the section as a whole, and that is unacceptable, and he is also bringing into question the reliability of historians. What about the Soviet documents I mentioned, are they baised too? The fact of the matter is that whining will not get anything done.

<dd>Well, your response to <i>me</i> is rather unintelligible, but from what I think I'm seeing, you are again avoiding discussion and distorting my position. Considering the nature, purpose, and context of the document, can it be considered a fair and reliable source regarding Azerbaijan? I have already presented my arguments, but you continue avoid them. In this instance, you try to dismiss them as "POV" versus evidence. How that is, you do not explain.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, if this is a personal dispute between you and Grandmaster, take it elsewhere. I am disputing the reliability of the sources used, and I propose that the topic be avoided entirely on this page as a solution that avoids taking a position. It is rather silly that rather than respond to me appropriately, you continue spouting against Grandmaster, regardless of whether or not he responds. In any case, respond to <i>me</i> when you respond to <i>me</i>, and leave your responses to Grandmaster for his statements.

<dd>If everything on Wikipedia was removed because one person disputes it then there would be no Wikipedia in the first place, so no, the section will not be removed becasue of one user who is making POV claims without evidence and whose complaints have all already been met anyway. Regarding the Armenian letter, yes, Armenia can use history in a letter about a disputed territory, and what Grandmaster was saying was that Iranian sources were unacceptable (again, his POV) so I brought up an Armenian source. The Armenian letter is in regards to Karabagh, and nothing they said in the portion I quoted was incorrect, all it says is that the name Azerbaijan was adopted in order to claim Northern Iran, and as you can clearly see, it says "according to some sources". Again, Grandmaster is blowing all of this up just so he can have the section removed entirely.

And also, you version of the quote says nothing about Soviets having anything to do with the name. It implies that it was selected so that Azerbaijani people in the North and South could unite by their own will in one state. Still, it is an opinion of one person (if the quote is correct) and cannot be presented as fact. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 19:58, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Grandmaster, this is getting ridiculous. First of all, what do Adil's comments have to do with anythign? secondly, no, the quote is as it is, do not put your spin on things. It says <i><b>The name Azerbaijan for the Republic of Azerbaijan (Soviet Azerbaijan) was selected on the assumption that the stationing of such as republic would lead to that entity Iranian to become one, this is the reason why the name Azerbaijan was selected</b></i>. Let me make that more clear, it says that the name Azerbaijan was chosen for Soviet Azerbaijan on the assumption that Irans territory would become one with it eventually, and that was why the name was selected. <b>This is clear, and it shows the Soviet intentions.</b><a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 20:09, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, it does not say that the Soviets chose the name. Check Adil's post, he provides the actual quote in Russian, it does not say Soviet Azerbaijan, it says Azerbaijan republic.

He acted unilaterally, counter to the entire discussion here that was supposed to resolve the issue, and even removed the "according to some sources" note that made the POV assertions seem a little milder. This "some sources" note is an entirely factual statement too, and quite generous considering the weak/non-existence defense of his sources that he has put up. To those who have capability to do such things, I recommend action be taken posthaste. We should not tolerate users who are not trying to improve the encyclopedia by working within the community guidelines. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 05:47, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The according to some sources was there because Grandmaster was saying the sources were not neutral. I presented a third party reliable source. If you want to argue against that, then you would be the one with the POV. I merely added a source. If you want to say "some sources", you could literally say that in every single Wikipedia article. How about we go around and put "according to some sources" all over Wikipedia? Its funny that you should accuse me of not trying to improve the encyclopaedia when I am the only one adding sources to it. I dont know why your here, but certainly, if you going to attack me for adding a solid source into this article, then I'm not the one you should be talking about.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 06:27, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The "some sources" comment was added because of the highly disputed content and applicability of the sentence, which appears to be giving undue weight to a fringe view. There are still issues with your sources, even the Barthold one, so I don't think you should act unilaterally. Grandmaster is not the only one who found the sources, and the section as a whole, contentious. Just because you insist that your sources are perfectly acceptable does not make them so. A bunch of users here find them problematic, and you have simply ignored or dodged concerns raised. I am here to improve the article by seeking neutrality; the questions is: why are <i>you</i> here, "Azerbaijani?" <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 18:38, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I will not justify Azerbaijani edit warring, but I don't see how deleting sources and forcing others in, justify the deletion of sources itself. Both Adil and Grandmaster are using this pretext to do just the same thing. The information about the Pan-Turanist ideology and the plan of union is not a fringe and is not only relevent but even a must to include in this article. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:22, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This conflict could be avoided here by simply relegating the topic to the page devoted to the topic. As the main page for this nation, it should probably just say what Azerbaijan is believed to mean, and mention that a controversy exists over the choice of name, but link to the main article for that topic. The details of views shouldn't be included, as this has led to a conflict over whether or not one view is getting too much weight. On the real article for the topic, people can mention the arguments and counterarguments. Then all of this mess would be left for that page, and the neutrality conflict can be avoided. Why preserve a conflict that can be avoided? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 23:35, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The problem is not with information, but with sources it is based on. A question for Fadix: do you think that you can present as fact info, based on the opinion of the embassy of Armenia? If so, is it OK if I will include information in the article about Armenia providing embassy of Azerbaijan as reference? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 16:35, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Quit with your accusations, you know why I deleted them. As for your question, of course not, my point was only on the Pan-Turanism stuff, which is documented. I have no interest to contribute to this article, I ended up here only because I was wondering on what this guy with the alias 'Azerbaijani' was contributing in and followed his contributions. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 20:51, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The "Pan-Turanism stuff" (?), in the geo-political and military terms implied by Fadix and Azerbaijani, is not supported by scholars, in fact, most note that any Pan-Turkic tendencies were purely cultural, linguistic and humanitarian in nature, and that Pan-Islamism played a far greater role in Musavat Party, and that was even admitted by the founders of ADR as "neo-Islamism". Similarly, Socialist agenda was extremely high, and indeed, there was even cooperation with Bolsheviks one way or another, even some ADR founders and Musavat members became Communist later -- or were Hummet party members before creation of Musavat in 1911. Meanwhile, for some time now there is a term "Azerbaijani nationalism", and Rasulzade, Musavat, ADR, etc., should be viewed primarily through that prism -- like all Armenian or Ossetian nationalist policies viewed as such, and not "Pan-Christian". So the historic events are not as simplistic as Fadix and user "Azerbaijani" would want us to believe. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 04:01, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User Eupator is unilaterally removing several fully cited sources, whilst adding back poorly cited one's, and does all this without participating in the extensive discussions on the Talk pages of this and other articles, such as History of the name of Azerbaijan, and Mamed Emin Rasulzade. This continuing vandalism ought to stop. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 18:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reverted the edit, telling him to use the talk page. Hence he is a given a chance.

<dd>Thanks, because it started to get ridiculous -- just because Eupator has a axe to grind doesn't give him a right to just revert page with fully cited references, whilst inserting poorly cited, translated and clearly disputed one's. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 18:42, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Repeated POV Vandalism by "Azerbaijani"</span></h2>
<p>"Azerbaijani", can you stop removing quotes to Tadeusz Swietochowski, a third-party scholar, and reinserting your own from Kaveh Farrokh or those from milliondollarbabies website. Further attempts will be reported to admins, third party arbitration with a request for locking of the page.</p>
<p>Also a note for you, I see you go out of your way trying to relentlessly prove that Musavat was pan-Turkic party. Yes it was, it's been announced as such by the founding fathers of this party almost 100 years ago, as the name of the party was Musavat Party of Turkic Federalists (meaning they wanted federalism in Russia in general, not necessariliy that of only Turkic peoples). Majority of Musavat leaders were inspired by the ideas of Alibey Huseynzade, Ahmed-bey Aghayev, and Ziya Gokalp, as they defined an independent non-religious national identity, which best described Caucasian Muslims. And the best one was, Azerbaijani Turks, because those spoke Turkic-language and the identity they had was the same as that of Iranian Azeri Turks just south of river Araxes, with many of whom they shared family ties.</p>
<p>So it's rather incomprehensible why are you trying to reinvent a wheel and present this as unknown fact, in every single page about Azerbaijan. You're actually making a compliment to Musavat leadership and to all truely Azerbaijani people in general. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 23:45, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You POV and OR assertions are getting tirings. Firstly, the length of that section was a compromise version, secondly, referenced information was removed. Furthermore, Swietochowski's opinion is represented in the article. Secondly, Wikipedia is a place where all facts are presented. Not everyone knows who or what the Musavat party is, that is why the information is said. That is the definition of an encyclopaedia. Thanks for admitting it was pan Turkist, so stop removing that information from the article! Also, I added two more sources, you cant complain anymore.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 23:50, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which encyclopedia? The references your included to defining Musavat as pan-Turkic are from milliondollarbabies.com written by some freelancer and from <a href="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/az%7Dmus.html" class="external free" title="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/az%7Dmus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/az%7Dmus.html</a> which is a amateur flag collection website. The definition of Musavat Turkic Federalist party was stated in a number of scholarly references, which you don't ever read or know, including Swietochowski, Firuz Kazemzade, and Musavat's own newspaper "Achik Soz". In fact you started using this title "Turkic Federalist Party", after myself and few others added official quotes to it on several websites. And there is nothing to "admit" here. Azerbaijanis are Turkic peoples, and there is nothing wrong in being pan-yourself. It's rather incomrehensible though what you're trying to prove with taking name "Azerbaijani". <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 00:02, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>about "there is nothing wrong in being pan-yourself", didn't you know that Pan-X implies "racism" and "territorial claim" and etc to other lands?!!--<a href="../../../p/e/j/User%7EPejman47_4bc1.html" title="User:Pejman47">Pejman47</a> 00:19, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, yes, indeed pan-Iranian means laying claims on territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan. I agree with that fully, and it's part of the ideology of Iranian state under any regime. Also, pan-Iranian emanates from the origin of the name Iran, which is "Aryanama", mystical land of original "white race". In Western world, the ideology was bit modified and became official ideology of the Nazi regime. So thank you for bringing up the issue, as it directly refers to pan-Iranism and its factual practice in World War II. It's not surprising in this regard, that Iran currently is the only country in the world to deny Holocaust, thus support Nazi purge of Jews during World War II, there is ideological basis for this.</dd>
<dd>Pan-Turanism (pan-Turkism) however is a mystical ideology which refers to linguistic and cultural unity of Turkic peoples from Eastern Europe to wall of China. It has never been implemented politically, neither such attempt was made, or could be made or aspired to be made by the state of size of Azerbaijan.

<dd>It is clear from Atabek's anti-Iranian diatribe that he doesn't really understand pan-Iranism. Apparently, he believes that Nazism was a modified version of an originally Iranian "white race" theory. Such ignorance is disgusting. Pan-Iranism doesn't have the racial purity, ubermensch, Atlantis, root race, destruction of semitic peoples, and other nutty ideas that characterized the German intellectual conclusions leading up to Nazism. Pan-Iranism aims to unify culturally or ethnically Iranian peoples, as well as a sort of "old empire" irredentism. I don't know what you mean by "mystical." While "mystical" may characterize Nazi beliefs, it doesn't seem to for pan-Iranism, and perhaps even pan-Turkism. Perhaps you mean "unrealistic?" In any case, thanks for revealing your blatant anti-Iranian views; it helps to know that sort of thing when users make questionable edits. Ex:"How does that edit improve the article? Oh, I see, it is because of his strong POV on the issue, not because he seeks to improve the article." Perhaps you should disavow from editing here; your POV may be an obstacle to neutrality. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 03:28, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Behnam, the main point in this discussion is not my POV of my own country, which is a subject of this page, but objectivity of the references I provided. Up to now, the references saying anything positive about Turkic-Azerbaijani connection are viciously removed by the Iranian user <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a>, exactly for the same opposite POV - anti-Azerbaijani-Turkic-pro-Iranian diatribe. I think this hostility which is needless between Iranian and Azerbaijani people in Wikipedia would lessen if each of us learned to respect others country, and its right to exist and define its own ideology and destiny independently. Yes, Musavat was pan-Turkic, now what? I provide valid scholarly references even confirming its name, yet Azerbaijani replaces it with milliondollarbabies.</b></dd>
<dd><b>I am sorry to having to link Iranism to Nazism (I wasn't the one organizing Holocaust conferences, Iranian president Ahmadinejad was), but in reality, trying to defame and take part of our Turkic connection away, attempting to portray pan-Turkic orientation of Musavat in negative light, seeing this as inferior yet non-existent danger to Iran, you only highlight the very much racist POV existing on Iranian side. Despite your anti-Turkic diatribes and viewing Azerbaijan as enemy, Azerbaijani Turks always respected Iranian culture, and immensely contributed to building what's now the country of Iran. And this is your respect to our culture, origin and independent country?</b></dd>
<dd><b>Similarly, what user <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> fails to understand that Musavat played a fundamental role in achieving independence of our nation from Russia (NOT Iran). It did so, along with scores of Azerbaijanis and Ottoman Turks who spilled blood for it on the battlefields. In this light, what ideology Musavat had is immaterial to the reality of Azerbaijan. And instead of highlighting pan-Islamic nature of Musavat, Iranian user <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> should be more concerned with the nature of regime that rules Iran, with which Musavat party or people of Republic of Azerbaijan had nothing to do.</b></dd>
<dd><b>Hope we will achieve some objectivity, consensus and cooperation, if Iranian user <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> puts away his POV and permits all references on Azerbaijani sites to be displayed and stops this terror of reference purging based on his biased single-sided view of history.

<dd>I know what you are talking about. In case you didn't notice, I too oppose "Azerbaijani"'s edits! I and others have been trying to persuade him to keep his poorly-sourced, controversial statements off of the page, but he has become only more unilateral and provocative. It has almost reached the point where disciplinary action ought to be taken. I don't advocate placing only the Azerbaijani view either; the problem should be avoided entirely by simply mentioning the etymology, and then stating that the controversy exists, but not elaborating the views. That way, the neutrality dispute does not have to exist on the nation's main page, which should only include basic, brief, and non-contentious facts about the nation. In sum, the details about the naming reasons have no place in this article.</dd>
<dd>Also, as a side note, I don't think Ahmadinejad's conference is an example of Nazi doctrine, but rather typical post-Israel Islamist rant. Ahmadinejad's government doesn't represent the Pan-Iranist parties or views anyway. In all, I think you are mistaken in treating Nazism and Pan-Iranism interchangably or implying a strong relationship between the two. Anyway, what do you think of the proposal to simply not mention the details of the controversy on this page, Atabek? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 06:34, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Atabek, the information about the founding of the Musavat party belongs on the main article. That is what the main articles are for, this is just a brief summarization of events. That is what Wikilinking does, it links subjects to the main article, if you notice you can click on <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musavat.html" title="Musavat">Musavat</a>, which takes you to the main article where it further expands solely on the parties foundation.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 00:28, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Azerbaijani, the information about the claimed nature of Musavat party (pan Turkist, pan Islamist) then also belongs to Musavat page, not to Azerbaijan page. Also the name of the party is Turkic DEMOCRATIC Party of Federalists "Musavat" (or as spelled in Russian, "Tyurskaya Demokraticheskaya Partiya Federalistov "Musavat"). The party's name was defined in Russian spelling, so follow the convention. You're selectively removing some references, that to the nature of Musavat party and adding intendedly biased quotes from other sources. For fairness, Kazemzadeh and M.D.Guseinov quotes must be included. Also, you have removed several quotes from Behnam's recent version. The problem has been reported to administrators for immediate attention. You have no right to make single-sided modifications removing scholarly references without consensus with all editors of the page. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 01:38, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, the part about pan Turkism and pan Islamism shows context and motive, which has to do with the summary. Basic information about the subject specifically belongs in its main page. <b>Notice how this summary does not include many of the things that are included in the main article about the history of the name Azerbaijan.</b> Its the same thing, we have main articles for a reason. Be reasonable, this really is not that big a deal, you are starting and edit war over nothing.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 01:39, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Azerbaijani, as I said, if other references to Musavat are removed, then pan-Turkism and pan-Islamism "stuff" should not be there either. You're selectively including one quote and removing the other. If we have main article about Musavat, which defines pan-Turkic and pan-Islamic orientation of it, no need to include it on Azerbaijan page. Alternatively, if you choose to include it, then be kind and include all of the info on Musavat. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 01:47, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You do not seem to understand that that summary is about things related to the history of the name Azerbaijan! When or who founded the Musavat party belongs in the main article which is about the Musavat party! The pan Turkist and pan Islamic references provide context and motive, and are not irrelevant to the section.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 01:56, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, if the history of name Azerbaijan is related to nature of Musavat, then all relevant references to nature of Musavat shall be included and not just summaries. And stop using "!" and "you don't seem to understand" in conversations, you're supposed to come up to consensus on this page, and so far we have <b>no consensus</b> until you agree to respect all scholarly references as opposed to amateur coin collection websites. Namely, Musavat page has sufficient evidence of the nature of this party, which you deem to defend. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 02:04, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well then you might as well bring everything from the Musavat page over here. Do you not understand what main articles are for? I have explained it many many times. The reason I say that you dont seem to understand is because you still do not know what main articles are for. Also, how are you going to tell me about consensus when you are the one going against consensus and making edits without regard as to whats going on in this talk page. Its also amusing how you are still criticizing the 6 sources, even though 4 of them are from books! Also "!" is part of English literature, you cannot dictate what I can and cannot use when I type.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 02:16, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Azerbaijani, you may wish to continue using (!) as much as you want. It is hopeless, and you MUST achieve consensus with everyone on this page. So my suggestion is we remove everything pertaining to nature of Musavat from this page, and leave only the title "Turkic Democratic Party of Federalists Musavat", and let the interested user click on the link and read about the nature of Musavat on Musavat page. Otherwise, the fact that "Musavat" was pan-Turkic or pan-Islamic has no relevance in judging Azerbaijan. Otherwise, let's include the nature of all other parties such as Hummat and Bolsheviks here. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 02:22, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Folks, this user <i>Azerbaijani</i> has been bothering some of my contributions too. The referenced material that I put on Musavat page immediately got his irked POV with highlighting "pan-Turkic" and "pan-Islamist", while I already included references in my article anyway. I would like to commend Behnam for his objectivity and tolerance, but I see now some Azeris are being completely thrown off by hostility and witch hunt of this Iranian user <i>Azerbaijani</i>. I have to say that in my first few days here, I suprisingly see more cooperation, consensus and understanding from even some radical Armenian users, than I do from this fella <i>Azerbaijani</i>. And the most fascinating part is that with his clear POV and obvious stubbornness, no one knows what he really wants from Republic of Azerbaijan, and behaves as if he has no other issue in the entire Wikipedia. I call all Iranians and Azerbaijanis to cooperate for consensus and objectivity of history. Let's put personal POV desires aside, respect each other. Let's remember that this is not a political forum, border division headquarters, frontline, or identity-imposing DNA experiments. People grow and be proud as who they're, and if you attempt to tell them they're not who they're, you will only get their disrespect and disgust. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETengri_d8c6.html" title="User:Tengri">Tengri</a> 11:40, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

While I agree that Azerbaijani has been aggressive and edit warring, you on the other hand should be indefinitely blocked from here. You have lied and still lie, it is obvious and doesn’t take much effort to know that Tengri and you are the same user. I knew this from the beginning, passed my own merging test which revealed this. Are you trying to insult the intelligence of the members here? You have claimed Khoikhoi that you used his computer(Tengri) and have claimed now and on the checkusers page that it was the otherway around. Please don’t dig the whole more than it already is. <b>Do you want to know why I ended up here; I have lied</b> when I have answered Grandmaster that it is when I followed the user Azerbaijani, I was actually investigating on you. The problem has always been that Tengri has been created minutes after the block Grandmaster had received and I have to admit I for a moment started doubting, but appears that Khoikhoi requested the test. There is no doubt that Dacy69 and Adil are the same user. What is left now is indeed to know if the two par users (total of 4) are the same and if Tabib is involved. Since he left on Jan 17, few days before the other user appear and made the changes on March article the way Tabib always wished. The interesting is that both Adil and Tabib work with Azerbaijani political parties and are recognized friends. In due time I will reveal the result of my investigations. I have simply enough of socks, which support eachothers and edit war this way to escape 3RR. Having said that, I leave this talkpage, don’t expect to be answered, as I don’t want to disturb it.

Something of note though, Adil answered the Pan Turanist thing on 4:01, followed 4:16 the other answer, and finally on 4:35 your answer. No comment here, but isen't it amazing that all those who I think are Adil sock, all appear to answer in the same given time frame, vote in the same interval of time, and all know French? Is suspect that the only way the link has been made between the two login was because you forgot using your open proxies. I am not accusing here, but simply suggesting.

I can't explain your "investigations" otherwise, as most of the edits are not a matter of voting, those are far more important. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 05:10, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fadix, don't overheat yourself in the hollow pursuit, your witch hunt against me (I'd be interested to find out which political party do I allegedly work for, among other weird allegations) is nothing new, and very typical of you and your friends, who, unlike myself and Tabib, hide behind virtual identities. Meanwhile, as stated, I am not afraid of putting my name forward, because I stand for my words and laugh at my junior opponents. Please continue your "investigations" and present them ASAP. If you want, I can give you my fingerprint to aid in your "investigations", and I am sure others harrassed by you and your types would gladly give you their fingerprint. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 04:16, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is getting a little nuts. Everybody just keep the sockpuppetry discussion away from here, and let's try to resolve the content issue. I propose a compromise where the details of the controversy are not mentioned on the nation's main page, since the details are contentious and inevitably lead to a neutrality tag. Besides, the controversy isn't the most significant thing about the nation, so it shouldn't receive so much coverage, regardless of the contentious material. Any objections or thoughts on this proposal? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 06:44, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Behnam, thanks for the voice of reason. As I mentioned in one of my comments above. The only meaningful solution is to remove pan-Turkist and pan-Islamist "tags" from Musavat's name as it already says Musavat Turkic Federalist Party, and let the user judge Musavat separately by reading Musavat page. Also Musavat's name should be updated to include the name Democratic, which was the official name per two references that I included and <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> kept removing. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 15:57, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I support the call by The Behnam and Atabek, indeed, as there are several articles/pages that are related, the info that has less to do with Azerbaijan per se should be removed. The name is derived from 2,300 year old Atropatena, which extended north of Araxes, and that's a fact supported by many, many scholars and chroniclers, all those quotes were already posted. Also, why would all Azerbaijanis in the north of Araxes be called "Azerbaijani Tatars" and "Azerbaijani Turks" since at least mid-19th century? This means that everyone knew that the geographic and political concept of "Azerbaijan" was not limited to south of Araxes, but extended to parts of Naxci, Arran and Mughan/Talish/Shirvan (i.e., north of Araxes). Denying this is futiless. From 3 sources presented by user Azerbaijani, 2 are invalidated immediately on the basis of being unsuitable for an encyclopedia, whilst the Bartol'd quote had been analysed and re-translated by me in the Talk page of the History of the name of Azerbaijan in great details. It's context is different, and Dr. Bartol'd was not speaking in definitive terms. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 16:46, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the idea is to just state the undisputed etymology, Atropatena, and then mention that a controversy exists over the choice of name, link to its main page, but <i>do not</i> include details from this controversy. The nation's main page shouldn't have neutrality disputes, and this one in particular is unnecessary. In any case, we have to wait for the others to respond to the proposal before it can be moved another step forward. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 18:12, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don’t think that there’s any controversy regarding the name of Azerbaijan. The name has never been officially protested by any country, and Iran recognized independent Azerbaijan both in 1918 and now. It’s just some people who try to create non-existent dispute about the name. I agree that the name info should be described in a special article created for that purpose and this one should only be linked to that article. It’s been suggested to do so by many people, including Ali Doostzade. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 18:26, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, the history of the name Azerbaijan is not only about its etymology. Taking out that <b>well referenced</b> section would show a double standard.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 19:09, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Of course. The info on the origin of the name should suffice, and the link to the article about he name should provide the more detailed info. This issue is being given an undue weight. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Undue_weight" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Undue_weight" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 19:12, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, the main articles is not solely about the etymology, therefore having a little bit more summarizing the main article is more beneficial and matches all the other sections on the article. Infact, I think many of the current sections need to be shortened significantly, wouldnt you agree? The first section is very short and concise and gets straight to the point, no double standards.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 21:45, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm just trying to get a concise survey of opinion regarding my proposal to see where consensus lies. You don't need to repeat your first post for this matter. And I'd like to remind you that the proposed removal isn't simply shortness for shortness's sake, but rather because the material is highly contentious, and doesn't need to present itself here anyway. The details in the other sections are fine because they are not disputed. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 22:00, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

You hit it right on the dot when you said you cannot have everything your way, exactly, you guys cannot, and referenced material is referenced material. I have continuously reminded all of you to see Wikipedia's policies of POV and OR. None of the sources used have been debunked in any way except through POV.

<dd>Well, my idea is to simply mention controversial material elsewhere, in case you did not realize this by now. Criticism of you sources is scattered throughout this page; considering that you are well able to read, I think you should if you missed them previously. I am tired of telling you to read our arguments; stop ignoring these things. Anyway, I recommend you go for my compromise, but if you decide to keep with this, I am afraid that consensus authorization may soon stop this for you. It's not like your material is being eliminated, but rather relocated to a location more appropriate for the controversy. The nation's main article is improved greatly by not including inflammatory fringe views, that, in light of the nation as a whole, don't deserve attention here in the first place. I hope you understand and consider the merits of my approach. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 01:26, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"The name Azerbaijan was adopted in order to claim north western Iran."</span></h2>
<p>This is what the article claims. It is a very very strong assertion. The sources are 1) a letter from the representative of Armenia to the UN! What?? Is this serious? 2) A kind of a political blog, written by an Iranian nationalist! Getting more interesting. 3) A probable Soviet quote.</p>
<p>Let's clear the issue about the name. The teritory of the Republic of Azerbaijan, prior to be taken from Iran, was a combination of semi-independent Khanates (Xanliq as they say in Azerbaijan), who were mostly populated by Azerbaijani Turks, as are (and were) other Khanates in the south of Aras. After the northern Khanates were conquered by Russia in 1815 and 1825 the southern Khanates were made into a province they called Azerbaijan by the Qajar leadership of Iran. So, it is true that the name Azerbaijan was given officially to the south of Aras by the Qajar, but we must keep in mind that there was no official province or state called Azerbaijan anyway before the Russian conquest of Qafqaz (the Caucasus) from Iran. There used to be some sort of an Azerbaijan, the name of a territory, sometimes a state, before or during the Islamic conquest of Iran. This article, due to strenuous efforts of Iranian nationalists and probably Armenians, has become a political joke and propaganda. The sources given are just some jokes. If some sources say the above mentioned phrase then it is much more appropriate to write "Some sources claim that the name "Azerbaijan" was chosen for this and that..." But the sources are simply biased. Can someone go to the article about Armenia and insert blogs and Azerbaijani letters as sources??!! If so, people need to do it. If not, who are the admins who are deciding which country's articles can be mocked or not??? <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 07:11, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

If you would follow those rules yourself then the nature of Musavat party would be irrelevant on Azerbaijan page. Because the ideology of this party did not become the defining ideology of the state: Republic of Azerbaijan.</dd>
<dd>And your argument about Azerbaijan being called this way to proclaim part of Iran is as irrational as saying United States of America was called this way in order to lay territorial claims on all neighboring countries on the American continent.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Voting?</span></h2>
<p>To stop this endless discussion with Azerbaijani, who obviously is not going to agree on anything, I would like to propose changing the contentious paragraph titled "Etymology and usage" to the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>With the collapse of Russian Empire in 1917, a group of Azerbaijani intellectuals, former members of Transcaucasian Seim as well as <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musavat.html" title="Musavat">Musavat</a> ("Equality") Turkic Democratic Federalist Party, met in Tbilisi on May 27, 1918 and proclaimed the establishment of the independent Republic of Azerbaijan. In 1920, Bolsheviks conquered the Caucasus, at which time Azerbaijan became a Soviet Socialist Republic.</i> The references to these are pretty much everyone, ranging from M. Smith to F. Kazemzade and many others.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think all contentious POV and sources thereof from iranchamber.com or from self-proclaimed scholar-"expert on Azerbaijan" Kaveh Farrokh in Rozaneh(?!) magazine should be moved to "<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_name_Azerbaijan_5c27.html" title="History of the name Azerbaijan">History of the name Azerbaijan</a>" page and discussed there. Main Azerbaijan page is no place to discuss either the contentious claims on either side or the nature of political party in Azerbaijan, not mentioning that Musavat already has a dedicated page. I guess if we agree, we should vote and present our objections, all, except Azerbaijani for now, as his position is clear.

The thing is, user Azerbaijani never read or seen the original quote in Bartol'd, he is only repeating what some Iranian websites state, specifically, an interview in Persian with an Iranian researcher, which means that Bartol'd quote got translated from Russian into Farsi and only then into English, and stripped of proper references, page numbers, and context. Bartol'd should be available in most large universities - even though its in Russian, anyone should be able to locate the volume number and page number that user Azerbaijani cites, and scan the page, so that we can check it, and see the context, and translate it correctly. But again, I discuss the problem with the quote in more details above. I am not against including the one quote by Bartol'd that has been verified, but only my translation should be used, not the one done by the Iranian newspaper that's not even from the original, but from a secondary translation. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 07:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, here are a few archival and academic references to add about the Pan-Islamist and Pan-Turkic/Pan-Turkism/Pan-Turanism labels that are being recklessly inserted by user Azerbaijani. I will let the sources speak for themselves. All translations from Russian are mine.</p>
<p>First, we should also not forget the role of the "Ittihad" party, the officially Pan-Islamist in ADR, which was in opposition to Musavat, and helped Bolshevik's to invade and occupy Azerbaijan, leading to the demise of ADR.</p>
<p>"However, all of this had nothing in common with the notorious Pan-Islamism, in which the leaders of Azerbaijani national movement have been accused of for decades by some unfaithful researchers. Islamic solidarity the leaders of our national movement understood only as collaboration and mutual assistance in joint struggle for common goals -- national liberation of Muslim nations from colonialism of the European powers."

<p>The authors of a 1931 book about the Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turkic labels noted: "[i]n the documents signed by Tsarist Minister of Internal Affairs Stolypin, in official decisions of "special councils", in large-volume cases at the gendarmerie [police], in one word, in all cases, when in former Russian empire one was dealing with a movement (agrarian, national-liberation, revolutionary, etc.) of Turkic-Tatar peoples in Russia, one generic prescription and standard form of definition was ready -- Pan-Islamism". Source: A.Arsharuni, Kh.Gabidullin. Sketches of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism in Russia. (In Russian). Moscow: 1931, p. 3.</p>
<p>"This is testified by the actions of some representatives of the clergy after the February revolution [Second Russian in 1917] against "Musavat" and even declaring the party as enemy of Islam. Speaking on this occassion at the I Convention of "Musavat" in October 1917, M.E.Rasulzade stated: "A person, when entering a mosque, should forget politics, the party, the idea, and pray only to God. Moreover, the clergy should not interfere ["zanimatsya"] in politics, and in political struggle the mosque should remain neutral". Source: A. Balayev.

<p>Here's another Rasulzade quote: "The historical experience had shown, that from one side, giving birth to the theocratic-clerical-reactionary movement, and from another side, preventing the appearance of national ideology in Muslim world, the Pan-Islamism is preventing the awakening of national identity of these nations, delays their progress, and, with this, interferes with their becoming independent nations. That is why, in all Muslim countries, the process of awakening of national identity should be strengthened, because the root of all progress, as well as the foundation of national independence, is only the existence of national "I"."

<p>In his own book, Rasulzade differentiated between "romantic Pan-Turanism" -- whose aim is creation of a unified Turkic state -- and simply "Turkism" or Pan-Turanism, which was a cultural, linguistic and humanitarian concept, not geo-political or military. (see: A. Balayev. Azerbaijani National Movement: from "Musavat" to the Popular Front. / Institute of History, Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences. In Russian. Baku: Elm, 1992, p. 7).</p>
<p>And as Rasulzade noted, "Azerbaijani political figures, in particular, members of Musavat, stood in opposition to the romantic Pan-Turanism, which was an utopia, that did not have any real basis." Source: A. Balayev. Azerbaijani National Movement: from "Musavat" to the Popular Front. / Institute of History, Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences. In Russian. Baku: Elm, 1992, p. 6, citing M.E.Rasulzade's article "About Pan-Turanism", Oxford, 1985, p. 71.</p>
<p>He further noted: "Romantic, political Pan-Turanism is no more, there is only "Turkism", which aims to achieve only real and, in particular, -- national goals". Source: A. Balayev.

Baku: Elm, 1992, p. 6, citing M.E.Rasulzade's article "About Pan-Turanism", Oxford, 1985, p. 79.</p>
<p>"In the opinion of M.E.Rasulzade, the idea of "romantic Pan-Turanism" have preserved its value only in the field of cultural issues, in the struggle for preservation of cultural heritage of Turkic people. Therefore, by declining both Pan-Islamism, and Pan-Turkism, the leaders of Azerbaijani national movement aimed for the creation of an independent national-political ideology, which would reflect the originality ["samobitnost'"] of the Azerbaijani nation, in which its interrelations with other Turkic nations would have been formulated too. They aimed to build relations between Turkic nations not on the basis of tribal affinity, but on the basis of the interests of each nation." Source: A. Balayev.

<p><br />
""Pan-Turkism" or "Pan-Turanism" was ostensibly a movement by Turks to establish hegemony over the world, or at least Eurasia. In fact, this "Pan" movement has no historical ideological precedent among Turks and has been documented to be a creation of the Westerners. Around the time of the occupation of Tashkent by Russian troops in 1865, the doctrine called or "Pan-Turkism" appeared in a work by Hungarian Orientalist Arminius Vambery. The premise of this notion was that since the overwhelming majority of the Central Asians spoke (and still speak) dialects of Turkish, share the same historical origins and history, "they could form a political entity stretching from the Altai Mountains in Eastern Asia to the Bosphorus," where the capital of the Ottoman Empire was located.89 This pseudo-doctrine was then attributed to the Turks themselves, and the Russians and Europeans claimed it was a revival of Chinggiz Khan's conquests, a threat not only to Russia, but the whole of Western civilization.90 In this tactic, attributing aggressive designs to the target, seemed to justify any action against Central Asia, a new "crusade" in the name of "self-defense."</p>
<p>After the Germans joined the Great Game, to undermine British control in Central Asia, Germans manipulated both "Pan- Turkism" and "Pan-Islamism."91 The Pan-Islamic Movement was an anti-colonial political movement of the late 19th century, and must be distinguished from the "orthodox" Islamic unity of all believers, the umma. Jamal Ad-Din al-Afghani (1839-1897) established the movement in its political form, striving to achieve the political unity of Muslims to fight against colonialism and the colonial powers. It was popular among Indian Muslims and in north Africa. However, the movement also served the colonial powers well. Painted as a reverse-Crusade --without necessarily using the terminology, but through graphic allusions-- the Colonial powers could mobilize both Western public opinion and secret international alliances to fight the "emerging threat." The Germans, after the death of al-Afghani, sought to make that threat as real as possible for the British in India.92 The manipulation of both "Pan"s would not die with the old century."</p>

<dd>I'm telling you, this annoying conflict will be resolved if you go with the compromise option that just stops details after Atropatena in the etymology section. They don't need to Azeribaijan embassy source for Atropatena, so it definitely will not be present in my proposed version. You see, if you are going to include sources that they have heavily disputed, they'll probably use disputable sources as well. If they haven't been able to stop you, you probably will not be able to stop them either. So, I think that stopping after Atropatena is the best solution to a conflict that, under current trends, has no end in sight. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 23:50, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

They cannot use original research and point of view and claim that they have debunked a source. I can bring you up the exact pages where the Azerbaijani government actually falsifies history, thus their government sources cannot be used at all. Where is there evidence debunking my sources? They never posted any.

<dd><i>The most ancient Azerbaijani States maintained political, economic and cultural ties with Shumer and Akkad, were part of the overall region of the Mesopotamian civilization and were ruled by the dynasties of Turkic origin. The Turkic-speaking peoples that inhabited the territory of Azerbaijan from the ancient times were fire-worshippers and professed one of the world's oldest religions - Zoroastrianism. The name of the state originates from the present-day form of the Turkic word combination meaning “land, noblemen who keep the fire”.</i></dd>

<dd>That is incredibly stupid "history", though it actually <i>could</i> be used if we were addressing the Azerbaijani government's views, but that is aside from the point. My point is that its best not to get into the matter <i>here</i>, on the nation's main page, since there is nothing about this(aside from Atropatena) that hasn't been disputed. Whether you acknowledge it or not, I'm telling you, people here <i>have</i> addressed your sources, and they will keep acting as if they did even if you don't see it. Also, they claim that they are merely quoting a source <i>posted</i> at the Azerbaijani government website. You should probably then respond to the content instead of trying to write it off because it is from the Azeri government. Honestly, I think you are better off seeking compromise, but its up to you. This isn't going anywhere positive. Anyway, I have schoolwork, so I won't respond for a time, but anyway keep things cool-headed here and search for a workable resolution that satisfies both parties, if possible. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 00:11, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

The quote you brought above is not included on Wikipedia page, so I don't understand what your argument is? The sources you brought are clearly biased, as Kaveh Farrokh is clearly an Iranian nationalist and has very little to do with serious research on Azerbaijan. At least not to the extent of resources that your removed, such as Firuz Kazemzadeh, M. G. Smith, Mirza Davud Guseinov. Rozaneh Magazine is not Oxford University Press, neither it is archived newspaper of 1920s. Milliondollarbabies numismat site is even more laughable reference, and insult to intelligence of Wiki users. I brought the segment shown above, in fact Adil's edit contained even more on Etymology of name Azerbaijan. So no one understands what you want.

<dd>Not sure what user Azerbaijani wants, and what is the relevance of some quote from some embassy site and how this all relates to this page and this discussion, as no one ever raised any of those questions. Let's stick to Musavat - Rasulzade - ADR - Atropatena/Azerbaijan extending north of Araxes. On all of this, myself and others have presented overwhelmingly more well-sourced and reliable references and quotes, hence the scholarly portion of the debate is complete. Meanwhile, user Azerbaijani has been unable to verify anything about the Bartol'd or Atabaki quotes, so that we had to call AliDoostzadeh to help him, which he will with Atabaki quotes perhaps in a week time -- but Bartol'd is still user Azerbaijani's responsibility. I have been able to verify only one of the three presented Bartol'd quotes, and provided the fuller context and improved translation, so one quote is OK to use in the "History of the name Azerbaijan" page, but not the other two quotes attributed to Bartol'd and undoubtedly misquoted and taken out of context. Meanwhile, it is disturbing that user Azerbaijani takes out well-sourced and fully-reference and appropriate quotes and sources that were added by myself and other users, such as Atabek. That's unacceptable and in complete contradiction to Wiki rules. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 06:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear The Behnam, Grandmaster, AdilBaguirov, Dacy69, Ulvi and others. I would like to ask everyone to help stop the user <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a>, so as we can continue on with our useful and scholarly contributions. I have already reported the problem to admins and will be reporting it daily everywhere, starting from with Vandalism page. <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> is persistently vandalizing all sites related to Azerbaijan inserting obsessive POV about pan-Turkism. His efforts clearly are indicative of clear bias based on personal views, which he is not willing to compromise as it's clear from this discussion and many other pages he edits. As Wikipedia is not supposed to be OR of a certain person with beliefs but rather NPOV, which is clearly not the case with current Azerbaijan page, the only way for all of us standing against <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a>'s irrational arguments is to continue reporting the problem to administrators, until this is resolved. I personally have access to tons of information, which I am willing to contribute to Wikipedia daily, and I do right now with <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musavat.html" title="Musavat">Musavat</a> page. But it's really tiresome to deal with constant reverts and POV of a single user unable to define what he wants from Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis.

<dd>Perhaps you should start an incident page for this. He definitely has a disruptive editing pattern and pretends that we don't raise objections to his sources, instead claiming that we never "debunk" him. He doesn't take advice, shows no sign of being willing to work through disagreements with others to improve the article, doesn't seek compromise, doesn't value consensus, and so on. If you start a formal proceeding, make sure to include a lot of "diff" links to ease the analysis of his edits. I have some calc to do, but I'll try to stay involved with whatever is made of this. Also, I made an incident report for Pejman47 because of his disruptive editing pattern; this is somewhat related so maybe y'all could take a look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#User:Pejman47_.26_Disruptive_Editing" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#User:Pejman47_.26_Disruptive_Editing" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.

This is a POV dispute, there are two sides to every POV dispute, you can't just dismiss the other side by making constant personal attacks and accusations or by fishing to get them blocked or banned.

<p>Several issues are discussed many times - first, there is separate page about the history of the name Azerbaijan. Secondly, user Azerbaijani gives a view of Rasulzade who was one of many leaders of Azerbaijan national movement. He formally was not even head of state, chair of parliament or minister. I don`t think we can construct on this assumption, and particularly, on the page related to the history of Azerbaijan. It is relevant to discuss on the separate page. Every time when the page is unprotected he introduces his paragraph. I think we should refer to arbitrage and get professional opinion(s) of wikipedia admins and experts in the field on that. We can discuss alternate opinions on the name of Azerbaijan but it should be on the page which was already and specially created for that matter. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 00:50, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, the crux of the matter is that user Azerbaijani seems interested not in the complete picture, but only whatever he thinks suits his agenda. It's OK, sometimes, to emphasize one thing over another, however, it is not OK to misquote (lack of page numbers, full bibliographic citations, date of the letters, the REAL source of those quotes (e.g., an Iranian newspaper) etc), mistranslate, take out of context, leave out such important details (and sometimes even falsify them) as to whether it was an article or just a private letter, whether the letter was to a government official or just to a friend, whether it was done in 1918-1920 (at height of power), or in 1924 or later in exile, whether he was a Pan-Turkist/Pan-Islamist or instead was just an Azerbaijani nationalist, etc. Myself and others involved, who found themselves victims of user Azerbaijani's activities, have presented OVERWHELMINGLY more evidence and sources showing the real state of affairs with the subjects involved. Hence, if any of the user Azerbaijani's sources are to be put into Wiki articles, then so should be all other sources present by myself and others -- especially since we actually read and have those sources, and we cite them properly, in full accordance with bibliographic standards such as MLA. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 06:41, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't understand why the admins are standing idle and tolerating the actions of some members who are intently against some ideology, country or people! Maybe some admins are of the same opinion themselves. For example on this specific article I have seen people from Azerbaijan trying so hard to come to terms and bring arguments about things they see wrong in the article while non-Azerbaijanis have been intent on sabotaging the article for their purpose. Let's make one thing clear! Sources must be neutral. Dear admins, pay attention here, is it OK for me to bring various blogs or letters from the Iranian and North Korean and Al Qaeda members to describe as sources in order to describe the USA???? Let's be serious people! What is this? The sources mentioned in the article about Azerbaijan are from the enemies of the mere existence of Azerbaijan. I am from Iran. I am an Iranian Azerbaijani but I identify myself as an Azerbaijani and the Azerbaijanis are my people. The north of the Aras are and have always been the same people as the people from the south of the Aras. What did you want them to name their country? Did they need to ask someone's permission to name their country? Did they need to ask Persians' permission to name their country according to their ethnicity? Does Azerbaijan belong to the Persians? Azerbaijan belongs to the people of Azerbaijan and that is something normal to state. And those who are Azerbaijani would normally name their country Azerbaijan. What is the fuss about this? Why do non-Azerbaijanis want to write about Azerbaijan? And it is interesting that they shamelessly disguise themselves as Azerbaijanis! And the attitudes of the admins are outrageous to allow such mockery to take place! <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 13:34, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One more thing for the antagonisers, some Persians and some Armenians! Do the Persians seriously know who built Iran? The Safavid and the Qajar who have built Iran, for good or bad, have been from Azerbaijan. The people of Azerbaijan have shaped the history of Iran, including the Persians, and now the modern Persian nationalists are trying so hard to forfeit the identity of the people of Azerbaijan so that it becomes nothing but Persian. Whatever the intention, the admins must be careful not to allow all this mockery to go on. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 13:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay guys, can you all please stop attacking each other and being uncivil? You are not particularly helping Wikipedia by arguing over user conduct. Why not concentrate on the actual article this discussion page is for discussing?

<dd>Yuser31415 &gt; I see that you are not an admin, but isn't it also the Wikipedia community's duty to keep an eye on articles so that they are as close to accuracy as possible? For God'a sake this is an article about a country!! And one or a handful of non-Azerbaijani users are vandalising the article. It is not about attacking each other. I am actually quite new but what I read in the article (which is about the Republic of Azerbaijan, and I am an Azerbaijani from Iran) was clearly edited in a way to question the legitimacy of the name of Azerbaijan, the Azerbaijani people's identity, and also the history of the country, so that it looks like a joke! And some users are absolutely intent on mocking this article, and others about Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis and one of them (the most vocal and most impotant one) is none but the above-mentioned user. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoazir_d479.html" title="User:Roazir">Roazir</a> 22:50, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Though Azerbaijani thinks that the users opposed to his version of the article are really just one or two people <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yuser31415&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105215616" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yuser31415&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105215616" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, this has only been proven in the case of Tengri. Pejman47 has been accused of being a sockpuppet of Azerbaijani <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKhoikhoi&amp;diff=103300416&amp;oldid=103243600" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKhoikhoi&amp;diff=103300416&amp;oldid=103243600" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.

<dd>Well, there already have been plenty of arguments put out, even if Azerbaijani chooses not to recognize this. I'm just trying to sum up who stands where, and it seems that the majority of the involved favor the 'Against' arguments. By the way, I was just summarizing accusations of 'sockpuppet', not making the accusation myself, so please read more carefully and avoid ill-considered accusations.

<dd>As I already noted, but you apparently did not grasp, this note is merely to show that the "Against" view is considered most sound by the editors here. I am not saying that people did not present arguments; this has happened, but at this point, a few certain editors are ignoring and refusing to acknowledge the other side, hiding instead behind trivial accusations of NPA and AGF violations. There is even one who gravely misinterprets a summary of other peoples' accusations as 'slander'. My guess is that these people have run out of effective arguments, and are now resorting to asymmetrical tactics. <b>Hey, if this thing is meaningless, why does it bother you so?</b> In any case, your accusation that I am repeating slander and accusations is ill-considered; I am merely summarizing what has been said, as this is of importance to the list I provided. I am amused by the double standard applied when you only point out Pejman, even while I bring up a massive accusation that at least a half-dozen users are sockpuppets for the other side of the dispute. In any case, saying that I am repeating slander is false. I am glad that you have been willing to compromise before, but I hope that you will see that there will be no end to this dispute until the issue is rid of altogether. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 05:39, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I believe the new user (it is kind of odd to see all these new users in edit wars) who said: <i>One more thing for the antagonisers, some Persians and some Armenians!</i> .. this sort of language does not help. I have never seen an Iranian Azerbaijani actually say such a thing and I believe this new person is probably an old user. Why not name the people that are antagonisers according him? Most or all are Azerbaijanis. I think it is best to discuss the article in a civilized manner. I think both users Atabek and Azerbaijani are actually wrong since they are discussing the nature of the Musavite party in this article. Both have good sources that can be used in a Musavite related article (without deletion of one or another) and push of POV. There is a lot of aggressive users and user Azerbaijani is only one of them. There is absolutely no reason to ban such a user. I think the best compromise is to put the musavite stuff in its own article. The history of the name of Azerbaijan is another article. The reason the history of the name Azerbaijan was created was exactly for this reason so that other articles would not be cluttered. After the current dispute in Safavids is done (user Atabek should have actually made comments on the discussion page since the concensus on Safavid article was reached after much compromise when this user was not registered and despite my respect for this user, I think starting edit war on that article when previous concensus was reached by many many users was not helpful), I am going to work on that article. On the current discussion I do not see Francis, Clevandar and many others name. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 06:16, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To clarify about those users, I took the views expressed on the entire page into account. Those users expressed views against the Musavat mentions, and other disputed content, so they fit into the "Against" category. So you also promote the relegation of the disputed content to article created for that very purpose? That is good. At what point will anything get done? The people supporting the disputed content are definitely a minority; how long do must everyone else tolerate their reverts before their editing can be considered disruptive and be halted? How can a page progress if here are a few die-hard reverters? I hope people agree to the relegation instead of having this drag on forever. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 06:46, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well I am out of this discussion, since I can not take sides with some of the writings here either. I do not think personal attacks are warranted as they simply degenerate any useful discussion. Do you agree that the first step is to stop the personal attacks? As per the r.v. war , what I noticed was that both sides were including their viewpoint on the nature of mussavite. (who started first or last is one issue but it is fact that both sides are putting their viewpoint on mussavites). Thus I made the suggestion (not demand) that the discussion takes place in the relavent articles (mussavites, history of the name Azerbaijan). That was my suggestion. But to actually threaten to ban the users is something I do not support. I think it is reasonable that both sides of the arguments on mussavites and the history of the name Azerbaijan take their viewpoint to the relavent articles. But I do not think personal attack, and threatening of banning is the right way to proceed. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 07:11, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are out, or do you support simply not talking about Musavat here? I thought the latter of you. So, if the discussion were removed from the article, what do you think should be done if users on either side continue to re-add the content? Thanks for help. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 07:15, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I support having the political and philosophical nature of Mussavites in their own article. But banning users is too extreme of measure. Similarly the issue of naming of Azerbaijan (which is locked right now, but that one will be easily resolved simply by adding historical sources). Indeed, I have tried to make reasonable compromises in some other wikipedia entries so everyone is happy in the end. But at the same time I do not think the current atmosphere created right now (specially with additional racist statements) is a conducive one. Thus I can not really support any list where some of the users on that list make blatant racist statements. Also calling others vandals and suck-puppets when there are clearly not is not helpful (do you agree?). So my first suggestion is to have constructive diplomatic behavior without personal attacks and ethnic labeling. This way I think all the users will easily be convinced. Without such a necessary step, nothing else usually is solved. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 07:30, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I suggest letting Ali edit the article (it seems that he doens't have a POV in this topic) I will agree with the version of Ali. But it must be accepted as a <b>lasting compromise</b> (that is: if some months later, the other party comes and puts their POV about "mussavites" in article, the stroy will be restarted) and I am not Sockpuppet of anybody! So, I support unlocking the page and letting Ali edit it (only Ali!); and I support his version--<a href="../../../p/e/j/User%7EPejman47_4bc1.html" title="User:Pejman47">Pejman47</a> 10:54, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If there is no talk of musavat and the naming aside from the Atropatena etymology, I am willing to revert any additions, though I cannot see why people would make the change after a compromise is reached. If you look at some of the discussions from about even the Azeri users agreed to not mention it, though at the side they tried to mention it in their own way, which was disappointing. In any case, just don't talk about the reasons for the naming and there should be no real problem with this article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 17:05, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I am an Azeri from Iran, like some of other users. I saw problems with the nature of this article. It is poor on information, rich in controversy. And from what I read on this talk page I do not understand WHY non-Azerbaijanis are so keen on editing this article? Just a curiosity. I am also from Iran and I think it is best that Azerbaijan citizens write this article USING BALANCED AND UNBIASED sources, not Azerbaijani, Iranian, Aremniana, Russian or Turkish sources. This is my suggestion, becasue Azerbaijan is a country just in the middle of many powers and conflicting ideologies. 193.239.195.125 13:31, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
