<p>I'd just like to mention that under Canadian law a "whole wheat bun" must be at least 60% whole wheat flour, the buns we use at A&amp;W are only 40%, therefore we call them "wheat buns", and drop the whole so we don't get ourselves sued</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Should it be mentioned that far more people know about the root beer, instead of the restaurant? (Would this be true?)

<p>I cut half this ****** thing out; for a start I don't know how much applies outside Canada, and even if it does, it was tediously longwinded, describing every ******* minor variant (separate entries for "Bacon 'n' Egger", "Sausage 'n' Egger") and even portion sizes. It took up half the **** article on its own, and that was for just one country! #$^#$^#$^#$!!!!!</p>
<p>(At this stage Fourohfour's expletive-censoring machine blows up).</p>
<p>It's still horribly long, and probably needs cut back further. The article should note the major products sold throughout the world, as well as notable special cases. However, adding this much unimportant detail is a prime example of Wikipedia "fact bloat".</p>
<p>Really, I know I'm getting annoyed and mean-spirited about this, but can't people stop and think whether adding such bloat really benefits the article?</p>

I think the Canadian menu needs to be removed entirely to show some balance or perhaps a seperate A&amp;W menu items artical needs to be created and include the menues from all the countries it serves. Other restraunt articals don't include a menu (that I've seen0 and they only mention certain products (Monster Buger for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardee%27s.html" title="Hardee's">Hardee's</a>, Big Mac for <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a>, ect...) that are high profile menu items.</p>

<p>I'm NetStormer, the one who made all that long winded "bloat". I can see your obvious frustration, but as a fairly new person to this site, I just wanted to make sure that it was <b>complete</b>. I do see that a lot of it could have been toned down.</p>
<p>The only reason it was completed like that is because I work in an A&amp;W restaurant, and I know exactly how everything is made. I now realize that completeness doesn't mean every trivial detail.</p>

<dd>Hi. Sorry for being such a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/git" class="extiw" title="wikt:git">git</a> about it; particularly as you're a newbie. To some extent, this expressed my frustration with other articles as well. My general annoyance was that some articles have a tendency to build up masses of minor and semi-inconsequential details which hide the woods from the trees.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, as you can probably see by going through my edit history, I'm just as capable of being as longwinded as some of the things that annoy me. Oops...&#160;:-/</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Whilst I still think the list could have been shorter and more concisely-expressed, I've nothing against it in principle, and this seems like a good starting point for a list of relatively common A&amp;W items.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A list of the current length would probably be fine if it could cover A&amp;W worldwide, dropping some of the more minor details, and intelligently merging the new stuff (instead of just adding new entries). That needs people who know about them to put them in, so it's probably fine just now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyhow, having ranted above... if people wanted a "complete" (up to a point) list, it could be created as a separate article if necessary.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I moved NetStormer's new list to a separate article pretty much "as is". As a list, it's fine, but I still feel long lists (i.e. reference) are better kept separate from the body of the article. If it was going to be separate anyway, having its own article at least gives it space to grow (since others will probably wish to add to it) whilst keeping the parent at reasonable size.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, I assume that the menu mentioned in the list is Canadian (Netstormer is Canadian, poutine is *definitely* Canadian!) <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 13:56, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been unable to find a KFC in Ashton-Under-Lyne, I'm hoping (and praying) that someone sheds some light on the whereabouts of an A&amp;W restaurant nearby... Thanks in advance</p>

<dd>Hi, I posted the listing of the Ashton-Under-Lyne A&amp;W. The restaurant itself is actually coupled with the KFC on Ashton Moss, near the Cineworld movie theatre. They sometimes run out of rootbeer but when they have it in, it is delicious. There is a picture of the restaurant on <a href="http://www.root-beer.co.uk/forum" class="external free" title="http://www.root-beer.co.uk/forum" rel="nofollow">http://www.root-beer.co.uk/forum</a>. You may see me in there, as it is also free refills.</dd>

<p>A&amp;W Restaurants are also in Indonesia. Unfortunatly I have no further information about the amount or when the first restaurant opened. But it would be nice if someone could add it to the main article.</p>
<ul>
<li>Worked in Indonesia for one year (2006), A&amp;W is actually extremely popular there. Coming from Malaysia, I was surprise to note that they have more A&amp;W restaurants than KFC and McDonalds (both have relatively few restaurants in Jakarta). Menu quite different too (they have rice). Anyway, had stopped going to A&amp;W in Indonesia after some guy (local Indo terrorist) tried to blow up one of their restaurant in east Jakarta.

<p>I was thinking, that maybe for the menu section, we could make a new page for it. On it, we could possibly put a list of the burgers (like we have now) as well as a chart for availablilty in different countries. I know what the canadian restaurants have, but I've no clue about the American ones nor any that are overseas.

<dl>
<dd>No... I don't believe so... There was a pop up box that said "this article is flagged for deletion, and will be deleted in 7 days, blah, blah, blah" type of thing... What I did with that page is I included everything that we had on the menu portion itself, and added an "availability chart" that took up WAY too much room. I'm not bummed out that it's been deleted...

<dd>Me again... just so you know Fourohfour... I went back into the history and copied the text for the menu from before I moved it to the new article.

<dd>No surprise that the page was AfDed and rejected again. In the face of such clear consensus, I'm not about to start making a fuss about it. Personally I still feel that it would be better as a separate list, rather than something which is likely to grow into a major appendage to the main article.</dd>
<dd>Nevertheless, I've separated it from the main body of the article, and moved it into a more appropriate reference/appendix-type position, leaving a link behind. I hope this is a good compromise between flow/readability and still having the information easily available to those who want it. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 10:45, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just surfed on in and saw the 'needs a worldwide view' tag, and I have to disagree. This article covers many, many countries. It does have a bit more on the A&amp;W restaurant chain in Canada, but I think if it's been nearly three months and it hasn't changed, then how different can the other restaurants in the chain be? It IS a CHAIN, after all!</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Canadian A&amp;W was spun off from the rest of the chain years ago and is no longer affiliated with the US/international A&amp;W. (On the other hand, Kentucky Fried Chicken actually started as a separate chain in Canada and was merged into the US one in the 80s, but I digress...) Although, given that the Canadian A&amp;W has maintained its market share in its country far more than the original has in the US and elsewhere, I'm not sure if the "worldwide view" tag is justified. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 03:17, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm the main one working on this article, and living in Canada of all places, That's where I get all my information. I unfortunately don't have any sources to speak of in the US or across seas. So as it stands, Canada is in fact going to be the most reported on. I'm sorry if this doesn't reflect this "worldview" that the one tag is asking for, and I'm also sorry that this article is so Canada intensive, but it's going to have to stay that way until either I can find some time to do intensive research, or until other people from other countries step up and do a bit of editing.</p>
<p>All I'm trying to do is make sure that this page is completed to the best of my knowledge. Seeing as my knowledge is limited to the Canadian chain of A&amp;W, I do find that it's fairly complete. I would appreciate any and all help that <b>anyone</b> is willing to give.</p>
<p>Granted, it may be a big request, but some people who're complaining about how this article has too much information on Canada and not enough about other countries, most likely live in the US. What's to keep you from adding your two cents in? If you don't want to take the time to make room for all your info, then I'm asking you, to please e-mail me the information, and I'll make sure that I add it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>My e-mail is therrienjustin@yahoo.com, and please include "wikipedia" in the subject so my junk-mail filter will sort it.

<dd>I don't have a problem with your Canadian-centric work; the article isn't solely your responsibility, and you shouldn't feel that it is. The tag is understandable, but so long as you're not assuming that Canadian information is applicable in every country (nor are presenting it as such, which you aren't), there's nothing wrong with your contribution. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 14:55, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you feel that the menu itself isn't noteworthy enough, then why keep the link to go down to that section, and why keep the Canadian Menu History (or evolution, whatever I called it)????? Explain yourself please. If you're going to remove something, have a good reason besides "No other restaurant does that" because you are mistaken. Also, I'm putting the menu back on until you can come up with a better reason the menu shouldn't be there.<a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetStormer_996d.html" title="User:NetStormer">NetStormer</a> 06:39, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What makes those menu items so noticabele. I mean, wow, it is so notable that a <b>fast food chain</b> sells, wow, <b>hamburgers</b>. /sarcasm You have totally removed the balance in this article. If I had more time, I'd delete more of it, and try to add something that wasn't germainder to just the 5 million Canadians.--<a href="../../../b/e/d/User%7EBedford_bc5c.html" title="User:Bedford">Bedford</a> 07:15, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know this is two months late, but for somebody that purportedly has an IQ in the genius level (I got this from the multiple userboxes that aren't germaine to <i>anything</i>), you may want to a) be able to count (5 million Canadians?), b) not make up words (germainder?) and c) search wikipedia (no other restaurant has an article on their menu?) And, by the way, I assume the eTantrum you threw when you were wholly proven wrong is an inherited condition of "confederate honor". <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 05:59, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>In one part of the paragraph on the UAE, it's stated that there's "quite a few" A&amp;Ws. Few sentences over, that's become "only a few". Which is it? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 05:50, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
