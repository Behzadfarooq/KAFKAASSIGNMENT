<dd>The only thing i really don't like about it is that afd3 thing. It's not hard, but i did have some problems the first time i nominated an article for vfd. I dunno how much clearer it could get.

<dd>Hi. I really don't understand: why don't you like the afd3 template? Perhaps if you explain your reasons more clearly we can work out something that makes everybody happy. As far as I can see, the instructions are about as simple as they can possibly be: all the user has to do is cut and paste three lines of text from the instructions, into the designated pages, replacing <i>PageName</i> with the name of the page. What could be simpler or clearer? There is no need to understand what {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd3_1f05.html" title="Template:Afd3">afd3</a>}} is or how it works. Perhaps the instructions could be explained more clearly? I don't see how replacing the afd3 line with a longer and more complicated-looking string helps. The direct string is no clearer or more intuitive—a transclusion link is, if anything, less likely to be familiar to a new user than a template. Perhaps I'm missing something. How do you see it?--<a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrleffler_03c1.html" title="User:Srleffler">Srleffler</a> 06:35, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we wait until the TfD process is done before changing the instructions?

<dd>I just took a stab at trying to simplify and clarify the instructions. My goal is that an editor should not have to understand how templates, subpages, etc. work in order to nominate a page for AfD. Someone should be able to come to this page and simply follow the steps listed, and it should <i>work</i>. This is sort of separate from the afd3 vote, in that the third step could just as well be the transclusion link preferred by some. I think it's clearer having three "afd_" templates, but to each his/her own.--<a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrleffler_03c1.html" title="User:Srleffler">Srleffler</a> 07:13, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>In step 3 it says to add a notice (via template subst) to the deletion log page. I did that and my notice was there.

<dd>let me give you my perspective on this. As someone who was not familiar with the AfD process until yesterday, I took these three steps very slowly, carefully and literally to make sure I did not do anything wrong at each step. The second step says what to put in the edit summary, but the third step does not. It would be much easier on the noob if you left nothing to chance and told them what to put in the edit line on the third step. I am not going to fall on my sword over this one, but I think it's a good idea <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 18:05, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My point exactly, I agree completely. Although I had expressed my views in many AfDs, the one I listed recently was a first for me, and having everything spelt out step by step reduces chances for error. I found the suggestion helpful. I commented elsewhere about being confused about the page that the <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">User:AllyUnion</a> bot maintains, for a bit I thought it was referring to the step three page. Anything that reduces confusion for new or infrequent users is goodness, IMHO. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 18:22, 16 January 2006 (UTC) (actually remembered to sign this time!!)</dd>

<dd>When people come to this template looking for how to do things, it is because they think that maybe something needs deleting and want to foster the dsicussion on one or more articles and need help with that... While I agree the process is complex, I guess I don't agree that removing information is a good idea, whether it be about a simpler process, or about things that people have to take into account when it's a more complex process such as listing for a subsequent time, or listing multiple articles. I'm not sure I agree that is "instruction creep". As for <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> being proposed, I predict "not for long", as it seems to be going well so far near as I can tell. Once it's not proposed but instead accepted (assuming...), will you still oppose its inclusion? I disagree with your reversion, but I'll not revert you back until and unless other people chime in on this discussion, though... and certainly not today.

<dd>I second Srleffler's objection. When <i><b>I</b></i> came here long ago, it was to find <i>simplified</i> instructions on how to use the incredibly complex, ponderously documented deletion process (which I'd spent quite some time reading) <i>just</i> to nominate an article — nothing more. I was <i>very</i> glad that someone took the time to create a how-to page that didn't cause me to run screaming, never again to dare to suggest a deletion. And I was hardly a novice wikian at the time. I <i>still</i> find it so handy that I keep it bookmarked. We shouldn't muck with something that works, especially when the detailed information can already be found elsewhere. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 01:01, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I concede the problems with multiple articles and renoms. The first is presumably covered by "See also: How to list multiple related pages for deletion" link just after the color-coded section. I've just made the obvious corresponding clarification in the first sentence of the page with "To list a <i>single</i> article". I confess that the renomination issue is a bit harder to discuss concisely. We might add a line in the existing instructions to refer the nominator to more specific instructions (in a separate article, so as not to clutter "3 steps") in the rare cases where step 1 produces a blue link for "this article's entry" in the AfD header. (It should explain how to back out of or continue with the operation already in progress.) ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 02:58, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the wording change you just did (emphasising "a single") probably addresses a fair bit of it right there... They may not know where to go but at least they'll know that maybe this doesn't fit. Well done. I put "for the first time" in too, and maybe that will get 80% of the edge cases for just a few more words.

<p>(Pardon the indent reset, but it was getting ridiculous.) I don't think "for the first time" helps, because new AfD'ers won't be aware of what this phrase implies — that articles sometimes get recreated or renominated — and won't realize this until they've saved (or hopefully previewed) the step-1 edit. (And <i>that</i> they won't realize unless we point it out to them.) If I were coming into this page fresh, I might shrug off the phrase "list a single article for the first time" as needless verbosity ("of course it's the first time I've listed it!"). I think we need to replace the step-1 text:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Save the page. <small>(If the article has been nominated for deletion before, use {{subst:afdx}} instead of {{subst:afd1}}. See Template Talk:afdx.)</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>with something like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Preview the page. An light-blue AfD notice will appear at the top. If the words "<b>this article's entry</b>" in the box are <b><font color="red">red</font></b>, save the page and proceed to Step 2. <small>(If the phrase is <b><font color="blue">blue</font></b>, the article has been nominated for deletion before, so use {{subst:afdx}} instead of {{subst:afd1}}. See Template Talk:afdx.)</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not terribly happy with how cumbersome this explanation becomes, which is why I didn't suggest it earlier. But we need to make it easy to notice an existing AfD page and direct attention elsewhere or adapt the process (simply) to accomodate the situation. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 05:04, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can't create an article's deletion vote page without being logged in. Since the quality of a delete proposal is self-evident by the wording of the proposal (and the awareness of the process for deletion), proposing an AfD seems like a good candidate to be a feature which doesn't require logging in...</p>
<p>The article that led me to encounter this issue is Peter Ogilvy. I've looked around for evidence of a policy about proposing a deletion without logging in and couldn't find any (apologies if I've missed it). Meanwhile, for now I'll just mark Mr. Ogilvy as a <a href="../../../h/o/a/Wikipedia%7EHoaxes_ebc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Hoaxes">suspected hoax</a>. 66.167.136.6 12:33, 21 March 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p><i>If you like, you can begin your "reason" with '''Delete'''. This will count as</i> your <i>vote in the deletion poll.</i></p>
<p>I removed the above text from Step 2 because it's redundant. There's no specific reason to either encourage or discourage people from beginning their nomination with "Delete" (although I can't see why one would want to do that), and as this practice is not prohibited by either convention or policy, there's no reason to tell the nominator "If you like..." It's just instruction creep on an already rather long page. And of course, AfD (for the umpteenth time) is not a vote or a poll. It's a discussion with elements of strawpolling. That's why we moved Votes for Deletion to Articles for Deletion. So the second sentence is not only redundant, it's downright misleading. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 16:15, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am not sure how to handle this instance: I created a redirect, which turned out to be technically incorrect <a href="../../../f/i/o/Fioravanti_%28cola%29.html" title="Fioravanti (cola)">Fioravanti_(cola)</a> (Fioravanti is not a cola; it is a soft drink). I have a correct redirect in place <a href="../../../f/i/o/Fioravanti_%28soft_drink%29.html" title="Fioravanti (soft drink)">Fioravanti_(soft_drink)</a>, and I felt the incorrect redirector should be deleted. But it turns out that the behavior of a redirect page is different than a regular wiki page, so I can't proceed with step number two in the instructions <a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfD_in_3_steps_6702.html" title="Template:AfD in 3 steps">how to list an article for deletion</a>.</p>
<p>So my question is this: should my incorrect redirect remain where it will do little harm, or should there be extra instructions to handle the deletion of redirect pages?</p>

<p>I don't see the point in having this text in a template, which is inside the AfD footer template. It makes this text multiple steps removed from the main <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a> article and its talk page, which makes it hard as hell for anyone to discuss changes in this text or get it changed.

<dd>The answer to that is to look at the number of users who link to the template, or transclude it (see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Template%7EAfD_in_3_steps_b0ce.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:AfD in 3 steps">Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:AfD in 3 steps</a>). It means users can find the 3 steps quickly without wading through the rest of the article. It also means that if you watch this template (as I do), any change to the system can be seen immediately. <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> is edited frequently, and I do not have time to review every change to that page. – <a href="../../../t/i/v/User%7ETivedshambo_1e23.html" title="User:Tivedshambo">Tivedshambo</a> <small><a href="../../../t/i/v/User_talk%7ETivedshambo_577d.html" title="User talk:Tivedshambo">(talk)</a></small> 20:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When creating the deletion debate page, the instructions said "Please use an edit summary such as Creating deletion discussion page for <a href="../../../p/a/g/PageName_474b.html" title="PageName">PageName</a> because ... replacing PageName with the name of the page you are proposing for deletion and providing reasons for deletion".</p>
<p>This means that one would basically be putting the entirety of one's first edit into the edit summary. An edit summary should be a summary of an edit, not the entire edit, and there is absolutely no reason to put so much into this particular edit summary anyway. I removed the bits about "providing reasons for deletion", as these simply don't need to go in the summary. The AfD process is tedious enough without adding additional pointless steps. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 14:16, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
