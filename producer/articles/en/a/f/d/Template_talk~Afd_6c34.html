<dl>
<dd>Part of this discussion has been archived. Its conclusion have led to the following template. Some of the reasoning that went into this template is listed below.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The current template:</p>
<div class="boilerplate metadata" id="vfd" style="margin: 0 5%; padding: 0 7px 7px 7px; background: #EDF1F1; border: 1px solid #999999; text-align: left; font-size:95%;">
<p><b>This article is being considered for deletion in accordance with Wikipedia's <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a><a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">.</a></b><br />
Please vote on and discuss the matter. See <b><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Afd_337f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Afd">this article's entry</a></b> on the Articles for Deletion page.<br /></p>
You are welcome to edit this article, but please do not blank, merge, or move this article, or remove this notice while the discussion is in progress. For more information, read the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Guide to Deletion</a>.</div>
<ul>
<li>This template should be included on pages using the <b>{{subst:vfd}}</b> tag, to prevent strain on the servers. This will cause the code of the template, as it is then, to be included in the code of the article.</li>
<li>This template does not have full functionality on talk pages, but really should not be used on talk pages.</li>
<li>Consensus on this template seem to be that the template should be as small as possible, and should include only the bare minimum of information. The template exists to warn readers and editors alike that the page they are reading is currently under heavy scrutiny. Additional text has been suggested and been removed many times.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>The first line is in bold, as it contains the primary point of the template.</li>
<li>The template features a hidden link. The period behind the words deletion policy links to [[Template:vfd]]. It’s purpose is to make the ‘what links here’ function work, so people can find articles that have been tagged by this template.</li>
<li>The wording ‘is being considered’ as opposed to wording like ‘is being nominated for’ is used, so as not to imply that ‘’voting’’ (as opposed to discussion) is the primary means of deciding whether or not to delete the page.</li>
<li>The wording ‘Please vote on and discuss the matter.’, as opposed to ‘Please discuss and vote on the matter’ is used, though not through consensus. One side felt discussing should precede voting, while the other side feels the flow of the second suggestion doesn’t flow smoothly, as though it reads: ‘Please discuss (on) and vote on the matter.’.</li>
<li>The link 'this article’s entry' links directly to its entry. A red link then means that such an entry has not been created, and thus, no votes have been cast.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>When adding the template to a page, please create an entry on the VFD page, and justify your vote. If the template is included without a vote, the impression is that the template may have been added erroneously.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The link 'This article’s entry' is in bold, to catch the eye.</li>
<li>The template invites editing (it’s obviously better to create a good article than to delete a bad one).</li>
<li>‘, but please do not blank, merge, or move this article, nor remove this notice, while the discussion is in progress.’ – Previous versions the the template included a warning against ‘defacing this template’, because apparently, many people would deface the templates on individual pages. This warning was protested against, as it was unique to this template and did not <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>, and it was subsequently removed.</li>
<li>The link to the 'Guide to ‘’Votes for Deletion’’' links to that guide, which explains voting etiquette. The link is partially italic for clarification.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>The font of the template has been reduced in size, to 95%. This does not seem to reduce readability (as &lt;small&gt;-tags do) but does reduce the bulk to the template.</li>
<li>The background colour of the template is now a rather heavy gray, to accommodate LCD-screens, which render very light colours as white.</li>
</ul>

<p>When Grue reverted the template, he broke the only link to the deletion discussion in at least one article: sometimes users apply {{vfd}} instead of {{subst:vfd}}.</p>
<p>So for instance, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Maths_debate_b1e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Maths debate">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Maths debate</a> was a redlink and <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPages_for_deletion_Maths_debate_ad19.html" title="Wikipedia:Pages for deletion/Maths debate">Wikipedia:Pages_for_deletion/Maths_debate</a> was the bluelink.</p>
<p>As a result, when the template was reverted, the deletion discussion from the article view was hidden, which is bad.</p>
<p>So now, some of the subpages are in <b>Wikipedia:Votes for Deletion/*</b> and others are in <b>Wikipedia:Pages for Deletion/*</b>.</p>
<p>Any version of the template that doesn't link to both areas, for now, is likely to hide discussions that have already started --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysidia_50b2.html" title="User talk:Mysidia">talk</a>) 07:49, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>One possible issue, though... the label <b>For older debates, see here instead.</b> sounds like a message providing a link to a list of <b>Previous Vfds</b> for an article: in the long run this labelling could be bothersome. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysidia_50b2.html" title="User talk:Mysidia">talk</a>) 17:37, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Good point. Of course, it wasn't intended for long-term, just for the gradual change. But if you have a better wording, please speak up? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:20, August 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I noticed the change. A lot of vfd discussions now end up on "pages for deletion"-subpages instead of "votes for deletion" subpages. Anyone trying to fix links may inadvertedly hide the actual discussion.

<li>It is lenghty and 4 days old! Do you really think that is enough to gather the community opinion? Even an article gets a 5 days discussion before being deleted. Although I do not oppose the renaming (it is pointles but looks harmless) I belive this renaming was hasty, you are now ranaming the renamed page! I consider that this was quite disrespectful towards the community. The least I expect from you now is to work very, very hard to set things straight fast, without causing too much disruption. <a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabla_d282.html" title="User:Nabla">Nabla</a> 02:02:46, 2005-08-29 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a> has <i>not</i> been renamed yet, let alone renamed a second time. Discussion on that is proceeding. I, for one, am currently waiting to see whether the compromise of splitting off <a href="../../../n/f/d/WP%7ENFD_3660.html" title="WP:NFD">WP:NFD</a> helps to achieve consensus on the new name for WP:VFD, as prior discussion has indicated it might.

<li>My point precisely. VfD has not been renamed and discussion is still going on. So why change the links target?

<li>Allow me to put my total disgust at the link change. Now we have <i>two</i> VfD spaces we'll bloody well have to check to see if a VfD was done.

<dd>I agree. I am all for the name change, but this process is going too fast! causing problems and pissing off editors, and creating ill-will. We need to have some perspective.

<dd>An improvement, yes. But seeing as the plan is to move all the VfD pages anyway, why not move them all to AfD first leaving redirects, and <b>then</b> start changing templates.

<p>It would be really keen if we could put a big, red, blinking warning notice on the template page that it's used with subst, so the usual includeonly/noinclude jiggery-pokery breaks it.

<p>The deletion process is somewhat confusing. I constantly find myself having to refer to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#How_to_list_pages_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">How to list pages for deletion</a> to remind myself of what exactly I need to type in <b>{{subst:afd}}</b>, <b>{{subst:afd2 | pg=PageName | text=Reason why the page should be deleted}}</b>, and <b>{{subst:afd3 | pg=PageName}}</b>. I'm a fairly experienced Wikipedia edit. I can only imagine how much more confusing it is for a newbie on here. The box from the <b>Afd</b> template placed on a page marked for deletion gives links to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a>, but neither of these pages gives the information needed to figure out exactly what to do to post an article for deletion. It's only after finding the right link in the Guide to Deletion that I am able to find the correct steps. It's surprisingly very non intuitive. I think the steps to deletion or a link to that section should be placed prominently atop the Guide to Deletion. —<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrim_2417.html" title="User:Brim">Brim</a> 22:17, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's probably just as well. If stuff needs deleting, most likely it'll get deleted. If the afd stuff is too confusing, just stick a {{delete}} tag on it and this more or less guarantees that somebody else more experienced will take a look, and if he agrees he'll either delete it or do the afd stuff. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:55, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't find any prior discussion in the talk page archives, but if you poke through the template's history, you'll find that icons have been several times in the past, and usually reverted out fairly quickly. I don't think it's of much benefit myself, as the icon is pretty generic, and anything more specific like a trashcan wouldn't be very civil. I can name two drawbacks off the top of my head - <a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">Template:vfd</a> occasionally goes through spurts of heavy vandalism, and uploading an image over an old one can be hard to notice right away (it doesn't show up in watchlists, and there are both client- and server-side caches to worry about); and {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} is fairly heavily used (currently <a href="../../../p/a/g/Category%7EPages_for_deletion_31dc.html" title="Category:Pages for deletion">Category:Pages for deletion</a> has 837 articles), so there are image-server performance problems to be wary of. <small>(Oh, and your icon placement is badly misaligned on non-monobook skins.)</small> —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 03:28, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

I can remember to start with {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} by myself. Yeah, it looks a little ugly, but so what?

<p>OK, please take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Afd&amp;oldid=30682821" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Afd&amp;oldid=30682821" rel="nofollow">this dynamic version</a>. I've tested it in IE, Firefox, Opera, and Konqueror (which uses the same engine as Safari) and it works without glitches. The double border is due to a hack making use of the fact that on pages with two navigation boxes, they are hidden by default. This could be fixed by changing the scripts in <a href="../../../m/o/n/MediaWiki%7EMonobook.js_362e.html" title="MediaWiki:Monobook.js">MediaWiki:Monobook.js</a> to support navigation boxes that are hidden by default.

<p>I for one really want the 'maintenence use only' back. It greatly speeds up (and reduces the likelyhood of errors in) the AfD listing process by creating all the text for you, it was a great idea. I have noticed a LOT less daily AfD page format screwups during the time that section was there.

<p>I have spread this new thingy to all of the other deletion templates that previously used the old "maintenance use only" thingy. In addition, I see that the dropdown problem has been partially solved with the log link's restoration, it wasn't on most of the others, but I spread that, too. --<b><a href="../../../w/c/q/User%7EWcquidditch_76ce.html" title="User:Wcquidditch"><font color="red">WC</font><i><font color="#999933">Quidditch</font></i></a></b> <big><a href="../../../w/c/q/User_talk%7EWcquidditch_f9ed.html" title="User talk:Wcquidditch"><font color="red">☎</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wcquidditch_9906.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wcquidditch"><font color="#999933">✎</font></a></big> 16:18, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've read all the past discussions about using subst: on this template. I was in support of subst: myself a long, long time ago. But it seems to me that virtually all the arguments there are left are weak at best:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Reduces server strain" - hardly. We have thousands of pages tagged with NPOV, Cleanup, Stub notices, navigation bars, infoboxes -- all of them not using subst:. The AfD pages are not in any way special here. Server strain would be an issue if the template was edited daily. This is not the case.</li>
<li>"Could be vandalized" - true for all templates. Can be protected if necessary.</li>
<li>"Links break when not using subst:" - this was always a misunderstanding.</li>
<li>"Makes text editable for special cases" - sure, but special cases are special cases. There's nothing preventing anyone from using subst: when there's a need to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, here are the downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text is virtually impossible to filter or predictably detect for <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia%7EMirrors_and_forks_fe2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks">article mirrors</a>, as it may change from one subst:ed version to the next.</li>
<li>With complex layout, it clutters up the article page considerably. We want articles to be edited while they are listed for deletion.</li>
<li>It looks ugly and confusing - violates the principle of least astonishment.</li>
<li>The text is inconsistent from one nominated page to the next. Updates to the template are virtually impossible to apply without a bot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking through the past discussions, it seems mostly like one discussion always referred to the previous one: "This has been policy! See here .." Well, maybe it has been policy - but there's no convincing argument for it as far as I can see. Let's finally change the policy and stop recommending the use of subst where it is clearly not beneficial.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 06:27, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur. I read the above links and most of them were just back pointers. One argument you didn't address is that moved pages can be fixed by editing the AFD notice text. But actually in this case it is better practice to create a new AFD page that redirects to the old one because makes it more obvious in the future that the article was AFDed, and it doesn't break Cryptic's AFD bot. Support for non-substed AFD tags might need to be added to the bot, but recognizing a tag is <i>much</i> easier than recognizing its transcluded content. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_26.html" title="February 26">02-26</a> 04:49Z</small></i></span></dd>

<dd>With that sig you have the nerve to talk about clutter?&#160;;-) The previous "layout" was a bunch of wikitext thrown into the template with no explanation why it was there. This violates pretty much every rule of usability, as a regular user seeing their page listed for deletion is confronted with a bunch of linenoise for no discernible reason. Yes, you have to click "Show" to copy and paste the text you need - on the positive side, however, you now have a more detailed explanation of what you actually need to do. As for clutter, if you mean the wiki text, this can be avoided by not using subst -- see above.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 13:26, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think my biggest problem with it is the focus the current banner gives to the "How to list a page for deletion" section. Say what you will about the previous version with the maintenance text, the text itself was fairly unobtrusive. The current replacement is exceptionally obtrusive (again, IMO), and immediately draws the focus of the eye towards it, away from what should be the meat of the banner, which is the "This page is up for deletion" bits. If there were a way to make the "How to list a page for deletion" portion less obtrusive and eye-catching, I would be less vexed by the change.</dd>

Also, with the previous version, there were two bolded wikilinks in the message: the article's entry on AfD and the deletion policy. I kept clicking on the Deletion Policy when I was trying to quickly get to the article's AfD entry. I think that my newer version, which makes only the first part of the first sentence bolded, will increase usability. -- <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_9302.html" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 18:22, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The [show]/[hide] button is magically created by the "NavFrame" divs, and inserted into the "NavHead" div.

<dd>Weird... I tested it in my sandbox before I made the change and I successfully used it myself on a few articles (see Lambert - The Blue Robot With Style and Lilly Greenough, both of which subst'ed the page name correctly). Why would it work for me and not for you? I wonder if anyone else has experienced this problem. As for the larger issue of people moving pages, it happens not too infrequently and oftentimes they forget to change the link. Anything that reduces complexity IMHO is good. <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color: #33C;">howch</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0F0"><i>e</i></span></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C">ng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 07:24, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I reinstated the &lt;includeonly&gt;subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt; trick. I also added a message to the top that appears only if you use {{afd}} instead of {{subst:afd}}. I see two benefits to having the PAGENAME substituted: 1) If the page gets moved, the AFD link doesn't break, and 2) Once the article is deleted, admins looking in <a href="../../../u/n/d/Special%7EUndelete_d491.html" title="Special:Undelete">Special:Undelete</a> will see a working link to the AFD discussion page.

<dd>I've gone through <a href="../../../p/a/g/Category%7EPages_for_deletion_31dc.html" title="Category:Pages for deletion">Category:Pages for deletion</a> and substed the template wherever it was just transcluded (as of about an hour ago). I've also removed the self-link, so that in a week or so, once all the articles that were already substed with the old version are resolved and the template removed or deleted, Whatlinkshere will be able to find articles where it needs to be substed. I'll check it the hard way about once a day or so until then. (Can you tell I'm in favor of this? I'm certainly tired of leaving two or three snippy "please fix the redlinks when you move articles on afd" talk messages every day.) —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 16:08, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've made it so that the template now takes an optional parameter that will take the place of {{PAGENAME}}. This should be useful for when bundling a number of articles into a single AfD.</p>

<dd>On the other hand, it's a pain to have to hunt down where the current nomination instructions are to find the next 2 templates you need to do an AfD, not everyone has them memorized (I don't), and besides, it's 2006... forcing people to memorize exact syntax or hunt through instruction manuals should be long dead by now. Perhaps a return to the older style, where the two templates were mentioned "for maintenence use" in tiny text, so people who wanted them could get them. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 13:35, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I <b>agree</b> with Tony Sidaway. The purpose of this template is to alert the reader that the article has been submitted for afd, and to direct them to the discussion. There is no need for an instruction manual here, since editors don't generally see an article up for afd and then immediately run off and submit another one.

<dd>In reply to w.marsh, I certainly don't ask people to memorize the instructions.

<dd>I do (anecdotally) recall that malformed AfDs became much less common once the instructions appeared on the actual template.

<dd>Useless? Hardly. I did my first afd with zero problems, and there were no instructions on the afd template at that time, just a link. Thousands and thousands of editors have done afds without the instructions on the template. It makes no sense to me to put the instructions on a template that many will read, but only one will be actually following. A link will suffice, and more concise. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 10:28, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It does seem like a very well intentioned addition to the process to reduce errors, however, it is not needed, and in its current state where it is not supported by all skins particularly, it is hindering the process significantly. I do not see how hard it is for someone who actually wants to propose something for deletion to follow manual instructions. If they make an error it is a simple edit to fix it. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#009000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnsell_90fe.html" title="User talk:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 12:00, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But it makes it much more tedius and error-prone. Wikipedia requires way too much exact syntax and instruction hunting as it is, anything that helps bring us out of the stone age even a little bit is good, in my opinion. The pregenerated afd2 and afd3 templates should stay on the afd1 template, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe the drop-down could be a lot shorter, just 2-3 lines, so even if it does display in full it won't be particularly bigger than the normal afd box? --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 13:10, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even without this unnecessary clutter, the afd template is ridiculously large. Two or three extra lines? I still don't see why the instructions can't be on a separate page. Do we <i>want</i> to make it easier for people who aren't even able to do basic editing to to go around listing pages for deletion? If we want to do so, why is this so important than it excuses making <i>articles</i> much, much more difficult to read by imposing a simply massive template at their head? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 13:20, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That seems reasonable.

<dd>Coming late to the discussion, I would. It certainly is convenient when going on New Page patrol, and the links, when clicked, contain a pre-filled version of the template.

<dd>I woudl like to see this much smaller, too.

So I'm not sure that a significant improvemnt is possible, without some radical reinventing of the template. Which is possible, but I'm not sure how one might go about that. That said, at least going back a ways would squelch all the unreadable conditionals stuff. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 13:52, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that's a good choice, I think. Perhaps with an addition of a link to the current instructions, wherever they have been moved to. (And that "<a href="../../../m/a/i/Wikipedia%7EMaintenance_5144.html" title="Wikipedia:Maintenance">Wikipedia:Maintenance</a>" link is odd.) I think the phrasing could be de-flabbed a bit, in the manner of my edit to the template a minute ago, but that's not important really. My only concern is that we might break someone's helpful bot somewhere if we don't check; but then this thread has been around enough that they'd have spotted it. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 14:18, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One query I have is the relevance of the Maintenance link. It is really just for the nominator, however, you probably don't want to say Nominator use only. Sounds suspicious to me. Calling it Official use only is also not the right term as anyone is welcome to use the templates if in good faith they are sure something needs deletion. Possibly "Initial use only:"... although I am not sure about that either. The page BTW that is linked to almost looks like a collaboration point for efforts to expand the encyclopedia.

<dd>Well, the "blanking" is terminology from the existing page. I didn't want to go too crazy with the wording changes, to increase the chances of community approval. I understand your point about jargon, but I think there's also value in conciseness. As someone far too prone to verbiage, I always think my writing is better when it's tighter. — <b><a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">WCityMike</a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">T</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">C</a>)</sup> <span style="color:black; background-color:#FFFF99;">&#160;<b><small>⇓ plz reply <u>HERE</u> &#160;(<a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html#How_to_keep_a_two-way_conversation_readable" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">why?</a>)&#160;⇓</small></b>&#160;</span> 02:04, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll also say this in response: I think the verb "to blank" is fairly jargon-free. If I go up to someone entirely uninvolved with Wikipedia and ask them to "blank your mind," they're going to understand I'm saying "wipe your mind clear." Similarly, "blanking a page" conveys to a total stranger "clearing a page of content," which is what it is.</dd>

<p>Splash recently altered the {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} notice — and based on his edits, I'd like to propose an alteration to the AfD template as it stands, that essentially incorporates two wording changes to combat the two most common problems with AfD nominations: the first being vandalizing removal of the notice from the page, and the second being an editor taking the nomination personally. However, the additions don't add an immense amount of verbiage to the template. My suggested changes can be viewed at User:WCityMike/ProposedNewAFD. Hopefully, this'll be as useful as the {{<a href="../../../s/p/o/Template%7ESpoiler_6a46.html" title="Template:Spoiler">spoiler</a>}} spacing fix I suggested.&#160;;-) —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:46, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to object to the new design. I feel it's too wordy and heavy-handed, and I don't really think that bad-faith removals of AfD notices is that big of a problem honestly.

<dd>Yes, I am, and I frequently list articles there as well.

I've never really seen it as all that big of a problem, and I don't think putting a big angry warning would prevent it even if it were a problem.

<p>There is a much better proposal several sections up to go back to a conditionals-free version above. All the proposals in the section immediately above are very sort "pleady" and "cuddly" and excessively wordy. Whereas, the cut back version I wrote the other day cuts out all the fluff, conveys the information that needs to be conveyed and does so perfectly politely. However, it retains the horrible-looking and lengthy conditionals code, and as I said, the section a couple up about ditching it is a good one. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 04:26, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Then I come along into the discussion and see the page, do a bit of fixing up and ultimately remove the afd-list part of the template as it is now useless after he finished the nomination. I removed it because it takes up too much space on the page considering it doesn't hide at all on my Cologne blue skin, as I detailed above in the unnecessary material section. He goes and reverts with no reason other than removing material from the template. I reverted it giving a full reason why it is 1) totally unneeded and 2) ugly. He thought he would have fun with his new admin privileges though and use rollback without a real reason why he is not just being a process fanatic to keep it there. Anyway, to cut a long story short (well kinda). The message didn't get across and he actually had the nerve to warn me about 3RR which I thought was a bit more of a joke than I could deal with right now just having finished a 3 hour exam.</p>

<p>Please stop wheel warring. There are people who definitely think that the appearance of the {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd-list_f9fa.html" title="Template:Afd-list">afd-list</a>}} template inside this template is annoying because the hiding mechanism does not work on all templates. This is why a compromise has been made with the single line having the equivalent information. Lets face it, if you don't know how to use the "Maintenance" links you probably shouldn't be nominating. However, there are some who think that even the single line is too much. Why? Well, lets discuss this instead of edit warring about it. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 10:52, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought we <i>had</i> been discussing it for a month or so, and that consensus was to keep the maintenance language, but not the full instructions so long as they don't stay hidden properly for non-monobook people.

<dd>As I've said above, it's very annoying to have to check some other page, hunt down the directions (which knowing Wikipedia, could have been moved), manually insert the page names, etc. to list an AfD. Before this stuff was on the template, we saw way more malformed AfDs... and it certainly was a big pain to list AfDs even if you knew what you were doing. I think the benefits vastly outweigh the annoyance, and I'm not even sure how many people are bothered by the text in the first place. We should be making Wikipedia easier, not harder... it already requires an ungodly ammount of instruction hunting and exact syntax for a website in 2006. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 22:17, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>does not help one learn how to list AfDs or how to not malformat them. At most, it tells people that one should use subst, which is not even necessary. It is irrelevant that there exist two other afd templates, afd2 and afd3 when the user has chosen to use the simple afd template.</p>
<p>You may be referring to the 'log' link, but that is just confusing.

<dd>The other version would actually show people how to list the AfD, but that annoyed some people because it didn't display properly for some. Anyway, the text still serves a purpose for those of us who don't want to remember and have to type yet another string of exact syntax so much.

<dd>Huh? It pre-formats both of them with the arguments all filled out, rather than forcing someone to look up what arguments are needed and fill them in manually. You can't just use template:afd at every step, as far as I know. We are on the same page, right? When someone uses template:afd, presumably they're about to use afd2 on the subpage, and afd3 on the log page.

<p>I have spent extended periods on AfD and New pages. There are increasing examples of the AfD template being removed. Usually this is by new editors. Often, this is not deliberate vandalism but a failure to appreciate the seriousness of removing the tempate. I suspect that many users do not read the template thoroughly and miss the implications of the phrase "but please do not blank it or remove this notice during the discussion". I think that it would be helpful to such new users to toughen the wording to make its importance clearer. I do not think this should cause upset but any mild upset would be inconsequent to the problems misunderstandings bring.</p>
<p>I should like to suggest that this phrase be replaced by the following, in bold:</p>
<p>"Editors are not permitted to remove this template until this discussion has been closed. Such unauthorised removal would be viewed as a serious breach of Wikipedia procedures".</p>
<p>I should welcome views and possible alternative wordings. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 22:56, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree with this wording, it is way too strong, makes it look as if removing that note is committing a crime. And using bold is not good either.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I really think we should be nicer on newbies than that. Just put the note back and write to them saying not to remove it again. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 15:13, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with the present wording is that it is not working. In consequence, because newbies do not appreciate the implications of blanking the template, they get badly bitten. I agree with your view as to how to deal with newbies but many editors are not so gentle. The key point is that wording in a template is a generalised instruction not aimed at an individual. We are therefore not being either nice or nasty. Surely you would agree that a toughening of the wording is worth it if it saves a newbie from being savaged? The point about <b>bold</b> is so that it stands out and will help newbies spot it.</dd>

<dd>Your reworded message is still a "you are being commiting a crime" kind of thing. Come on, a newbie writes his/her first virging article, a smart ass comes along and afd's it, and of course the newbie gets pissed off. I don't think a stronger wording is appropriate, and I doubt it will help much.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In other words, there is a price to pay for having an encyclopedia anybody can edit, and there are always new people coming along, some better/smarter than others. I still believe one'd rather put back the template if removed and write a gentle message to the newbie rather than emplyoing dictatorial language. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 23:56, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At the same time, the current wording "please do not blank it or remove this notice during the discussion" is way too weak. How about: "the article must not be blanked and this notice nor removed until the discussion is closed?", leaving out the "criminal" part? BTW, I think there should be a suggestion for the case in which the author realizes that the article does not belong to here (something like: "if you realize that the article should be deleted, just place {{db-author}} after this notice.

<dd>This sounds acceptable, as long as it is not in bold.

<p>The code in the template which checks if the template has been substituted or not, and adds <tt>&lt;div style="display:none;"&gt;</tt> if it has not, breaks the preview of deleted revisions at <a href="../../../u/n/d/Special%7EUndelete_d491.html" title="Special:Undelete">Special:Undelete</a>, even when the template has been correctly substituted in the deleted revision.

<p>I'm trying to replace the redlink in the second row with a temporary link to preload the discussion, but there might be a coding error, so I autoreverted. Can anyone look this over:</p>

<p>Supposedly the "Click this" redlink (3rd variable in the #ifexist bracket should be replaced with the "You may share" line (2nd variable) as soon as the discussion is created, but for some reason it didn't work.

<dd>There was some disagreement about the preloaded-debate link when it was added (it was reverted by someone who wanted to use the older method of copying-and-pasting the Afd2 text that appears at the bottom of the template); the current version is a compromise solution added at the same time as <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDC_ad9f.html" title="WP:AFDC">WP:AFDC</a> that makes both the preload and copy-afd2 methods possible. This change would remove the old copy-afd2 method and so might infuriate people who still use it. Apart from that, it looks pretty good, except that it would make a symmetrical mass nomination (where the debate page name is different from all the article names) harder to do (because the preload method doesn't work in such cases). There is also the confusion for new users that would be created due to the #ifexist not changing until the article page was edited or purged; there would be a 'create a discussion page' link even after the page had been created, until the next edit or purge (and how many new users know about purging a page). This is probably the 'browser cache' problem that trialsanderrors is referring to (I think it's a server rather than a browser cache problem, which would be quite hard to correct without some sort of purge backlink from Afd2, which would complicate the process rather than simplifying it). So: technically correct, but probably a bad idea anyway. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 12:56, 12 January 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</dd>

<dd>Hm. I'm not sure, but putting the two links so close together might cause confusion (newcomers might ask "which link do I click?"). But in general, a link like that might be helpful.

<p>I wanted to propose <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucasbfr_Sandbox_7390.html" title="User:Lucasbfr/Sandbox">this version</a> of AfD. The difference is that the last link, to the log, automatically adds the {subst:afd3|pg=Lucasbfr/Sandbox}} text at the bottom of the list (of course that changes with the page you put the AfD template on&#160;;). The idea is just to ease the AfD listing, maybe less people will forget the 3rd step. Tell me if you find any issue but I think I have the exact same behavior than the current AfD template. -- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucasbfr_3ae6.html" title="User:Lucasbfr">lucasbfr</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucasbfr_039f.html" title="User talk:Lucasbfr"><font color="darkblue">talk</font></a></sup> 08:38, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The template does not currently automatically click on submit since I didn't want to force that kind of behavior.

<dd>Autoedit doesn't work for anyone who doesn't use popups (or Lupin's autoedit separately), so this isn't portable (it's a feature of popups IIRC, not anywhere in the MediaWiki namespace). --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 08:49, 30 January 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)
