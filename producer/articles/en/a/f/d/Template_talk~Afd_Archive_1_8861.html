<dd>Can anyone tell me why is there a link in the full stop to this template in the first place? It just looks weird and not really necessary, so can it be removed or something? <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecfan_7eb4.html" title="User:Secfan">Secfan</a> 15:05, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is intended to be a "hidden" link - unobtrusive to most users, but useful for those who realize that the template itself may need editing or updating. Without that hidden link, it can be very difficult to find the template since it does not come up through the search engine. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 21:34, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<dd>OK, thanks for your response, its just that most other templates I've seen don't have such link there. And are there lists of Wikipedia templates so that they can be more easily accessed? <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecfan_7eb4.html" title="User:Secfan">Secfan</a> 13:03, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<dd>The link in the full stop is there to allow you to use <i>what links here</i> from <a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_41cd.html" title="Template:Vfd">template:vfd</a> when the message has been adding using {{subst:whatever}} rather than just {{whatever}}. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 02:51, Jul 29, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>The full stop link would not be obvious for new users, and experienced users are already going to know about Template:vfd. I think we should either have an "edit" link, or not have it at all.

<dl>
<dd>It's not there to help you edit the template since the template does not need to be easily editable. It is so "what links here" works. That won't work without a hidden link. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 10:15, Aug 21, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Then why can't we make a link that is <i>really</i> hidden, where you can't even tell it's there? There's no good reason why you shouldn't make it an "edit" link. And doesn't this only happen when you use subst: instead of msg:? Tell people to use msg: and you'll be fine.</dd>

<li>Anchor linking doesn't often work. Changed standards, inconsistency(single/double hyphen vs. dash), stray white space.</li>
<li>Linking right to the sub-page typically saves on &gt;500kb bandwidth because you don't need to pull down the whole page (which gets quite large).</li>
<li>Saves time, no hunting through the long page.</li>

<dd>Well, we really shouldn't be deleting user pages, but it appears that this happens with everything outside the main namespace, it seems that {{PAGENAME}} takes the title without the namespace, so we would have to make a seperate template for VfDing outside the main namespace. How about [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/User:{{PAGENAME}}|its entry on that page]] as {{UserVfd}} or something. Not that we really delete a lot of user pages here, but you might need a similar solution for something in the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENamespace_6ef8.html" title="Wikipedia:Namespace">Wikipedia:Namespace</a>. <a href="../../../3/3/4/User%7E33451.html" title="User:33451"></a> — <a href="../../../3/3/4/User%7E33451.html" title="User:33451">Tasty Sandwich</a> | <a href="../../../3/3/4/User_talk%7E33451.html" title="User talk:33451">Talk</a> 14:14, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seconded. I also don't like how there are <i>two</i> links to the same discussion. First, it's potentially confusing to the reader. Second, it creates more work when co-listing multiple pages for deletion under the same discussion, or when listing anything outside of the main article namespace. In such cases, Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/{{PAGENAME}} has to be changed to point to the correct discussion: why make us do it twice? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">•&#160;Benc</a><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenc_b8ae.html" title="User talk:Benc">&#160;•</a> 06:57, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../a/l/t/Wikipedia%7EAlternative_outlets_c328.html" title="Wikipedia:Alternative outlets">Alternative outlets for rejected articles</a></span></h2>
<p>I propose to add the link, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Wikipedia%7EAlternative_outlets_c328.html" title="Wikipedia:Alternative outlets">Alternative outlets for rejected articles</a> at the end of the VfD template text.</p>
<p>It's been bruited around a bit in the mailing list and at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_5926.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia_talk:Votes for deletion</a> and nobody seems to have a big problem with the idea of putting such a link in the text.</p>
<p>Certain inclusionists assert that Wikipedia has a narrow view and that they <i>seriously</i> see as valuable the articles that Wikipedia deletes and are <i>seriously</i> willing to include them in their own sites. I think they are silly, but don't see why we shouldn't accommodate them. And it also provides a sop to rejectees, although when they actually take a look at JnanaBase, they... well, let me say that you have to admire the audacity of NSK's vision.</p>
<p>Of various alternatives, this one is the most workable, because it doesn't require Wikipedians other than contributors of articles to do anything, pose any burdens on sysops, or require software changes. Potential rejectees, here is a list of places that say they want your material; do what you like.</p>
<p>I've been trying to think of a shorter phrase than "Alternative outlets for rejected articles" but haven't come up with one so far. It doesn't need to be crystal clear; it just has to be a piece of language that a contributor, whose article has been posted on VfD, will be likely to click on.</p>
<p>I'm a newbie at procedure here; I take it that I leave it here for three days and look for objections before being <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">bold</a>?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wording update</span></h2>
<p>Fix for some poor wording in the existing template:</p>
<p><br />
<i>"A request has been made on Wikipedia for this article to be deleted. This request is being discussed to form a consensus whether the article meets Wikipedia standards."</i></p>
<p>is more descriptively accurate than:</p>
<p><i>"This page has been listed for deletion. Please see this page's entry on the votes for deletion page for justifications and discussions."</i></p>
<p>since the wording "listed for deletion" is more likely to sound like some kind of formal deletion action by senior admins, and which is "listed" rather than merely "requested", to non-Wiki-ists. It also clarifies that a consensus is still to be formed.</p>
<p><br />
and:</p>
<p><i>"If you feel deletion is not justified by Wikipedia deletion policy you may vote against its deletion."</i></p>
<p>is more accurate than:</p>
<p><i>"If you don't want the page deleted, read the deletion policy and vote against its deletion."</i></p>
<p>which implies it is the personal wishes which are important, and not Wikipedia criteria.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Protect against page moves?</span></h2>
<p>If a page with a Vfd notice is moved, the link to the Vfd page breaks. This happened to List of people named bill, for instance.</p>
<p>That's because the Vfd notice uses {{PAGENAME}}, and the pagename obviously changes after a page move.</p>
<p>I tried changing Template:Vfd from using {{PAGENAME}} to using {{subst:PAGENAME}} but that didn't work... that just hardcoded "Vfd" as the pagename.</p>

<dd>I know its longer, but I think its clear none-the-less. The template should only really tell you that you <i>can</i> vote for or against and <i>where</i> you can do it. More advanced things like <i>how</i> you can vote and what other detailed options you have should be left for the VfD page.

<p>I notice that this has been commented because it was "too cluttered, and hard to read". I disagree: it emphasizes the important text at the top, is perfectly easy to read (text much smaller than this is on many other templates and whatnot), and reduces the size of this already bloated notice. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 17:25, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why don't we need the link here? I personally, when listing pages, always use two browser tabs and use the two links to bring up VfD and the subpage. This is adding about a minute and a half (loading VfD) to my time... I realise it's not <b>needed</b>, but it is useful...

<li>The logic of that escapes me. You are complaining that loading <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> is slow, therefore you should ... have a hyperlink to <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> so that you can click on it to load it. That makes no sense. Furthermore, the whole point of not having a hyperlink from the notice to <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> (which is explained at <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_Deletion_c576.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Guide to Votes for Deletion">Wikipedia talk:Guide to Votes for Deletion</a>, which you really should have read since it explains the changes just made <i>as pointed out immediately above on this very talk page</i>) is to stop everyone seeing a VFD notice (including all of the VFD novices) from loading up <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> unnecessarily too, with the comcomitant increase in load with all of that transclusion, when what they <i>actually need</i> to load up are the page with the particular discussion on, a page that explains what they are looking at, and the deletion policy — exactly the three hyperlinks on the notice with the modifications described above. And, as has also been pointed out, if they want to look at other discussions, there's always the link to <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> right at the top of the individual discussion page that they can follow. Similarly, nominators only need to load up the discussion page and the per-day page. They don't need to load up <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> either (if they are familiar enough with the instructions on how to make a nomination). This way, the only hits on <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> are from the people who <i>really do</i> want to see the full transcluded list. When you realised that <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> took so long to load, and when you saw a section of this very talk page entitled "Easing server load", what did you think that it could have been about? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:04, 2005 Mar 12 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whoa, whoa. I'm sorry if I've annoyed you... I was saying that I found the new system a little more difficult to use. In that case, if loading the whole VFD page is too much, how about only the particular date page? Not having the link is not a problem, per se, but does slow listing down, which is a problem when RC patrolling. I found the rationale for removing the link on the page you quoted as less than clear. I don't see the need for the above rant though. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">Smoddy</a> <a href="../../../s/m/o/User_talk%7ESmoddy_5430.html" title="User talk:Smoddy">(t)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Smoddy_689b.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Smoddy">(e)</a> <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_Greece_gallery_5c68.html" title="User:Smoddy/Greece gallery">(g)</a> 14:16, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with Smoddy: the VFD link is useful, which ought to trump any worries about server load (and even that should become less of a problem in the near future). — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 15:43, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Message box format</span></h2>
<p>There has been a quiet revert war going on recently about a proposed switch to a message box format instead of the traditional format. I can't comment on the technical advantages or disadvantages of each but I want to put my vote in for the traditional view. I'm not sure why this happens but the message box version conflicts with the script that a few of us are running which suppresses the closed discussions on VfD/Old. (The header and footer which are added to the closed discussion have code which the script recognizes. See <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_Old_cb5f.html#Suppressing_closed_discussions" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/Old">Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/Old#Suppressing closed discussions</a> for more.) That script is very useful for finding and closing discussions on the Old pages.

<p>I made 2 changes to the template: I removed the unnecessary &lt;br&gt; to make the template a bit more compact. Also, I removed the notice not to deface the notice, as it was quite silly and caused the text to break to a new line and take up a bit more space on the page than necessary. If I have stepped on any toes, my apologies. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 19:18, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I've restored the request not to deface the notice. It's not silly at all. Furthermore: Not everyone's web browser windows are the same width and resolution as yours. Removing a word because "it caused the text to break to a new line" is daft. If the exact placements of things within your web browser's window is your reason for continually fiddling with this notice, please stop. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:45, 2005 May 9 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, but having a notice that says "don't deface this notice" is utterly silly. Why don't we just put a notice on every single page that says "Don't deface this page". It's totally pointless. And I realize that everyone's window sizes are different, I just meant that it's better to be more concise so that the notice takes up less screen real estate. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 06:27, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're wrong. It's not silly at all. I suggest that you familiarize yourself with how the VFD notice is actually applied (At the very least read what is written on this very page.) and some of the things that are frequently done to it by novices before being bold again. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:14, 2005 May 11 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'd like to stress that the appearance and content of this template have been discussed a great deal on this page, consensus being that it should be as small, clean, and concise as possible, including no more nor less than the vital information. Drastic changes should be reasoned carefully, and preferably discussed here first, especially since it is common to use <tt>{{subst:vfd}}</tt> (meaning that, once inserted, the template's appearance is not automatically updated). — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 22:27, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
