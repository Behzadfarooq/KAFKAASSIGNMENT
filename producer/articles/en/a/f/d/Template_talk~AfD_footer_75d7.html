<li>Yeah, that was me. I think it was the comma <i>and</i> the parens; it's certainly not the first time it has happened. My objective was to show the difference between the first replacement and the last two, and more explicitly remove special characters. You can actually have a few other characters in the name, but the instructions are long enough as they are. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrockert_5ba4.html" title="User:Brockert">Ben Brockert</a> 02:46, May 11, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think it should be "Discussion". "Add to this discussion" implies that by clicking on the link you will be editing the discussion page, which (sadly) you will not. Until we can fix that bug, then it should just say what it links to instead of implying an action. In either case, whenever this footer is modified, <a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">Template:vfd</a> should be modified accordingly so that the "on that page" link can go to the correct anchor.

<dd>I changed it to "add to this discussion" because so many people were still putting their comments on the main page. I was guessing that readers were misinterpreting the "discussion" link as a link to the article's discussion (Talk) page. It seems to work because I have to move fewer comments off the main page when we say "add to this discussion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a></dd>

<p>Is there any reason why this footer advocates the use of {{subst:vfd}} instead of {{vfd}}? I thought we were moving towards templates, and I would have changed it myself, but I figured there might be an database implementation consideration why this was better for a highly used template like vfd. Can anyone say which is better? I'd rather have the template, because our vfd anchor format changes so frequently. - <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 20:34, Jun 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>(Added bcz (not knowing already mentioned) i promised to when i changed it back to subst, and bcz it may help prevent the next well-intentioned breaking of the system.)</p>
<p>Because only 5 expansions of the same template get done per page. (I think true even if they're in subst format, but with subst the restriction only comes into play if you nominate 6 or more pages in the <i>same edit</i> -- since a subst expansion permanently becomes text (and ceases to be a subst) when it's saved.)</p>

<p>I don't really like the misleading "Add to this discussion" so how's this instead?</p>

<p>It needs work, but it's a start. Right now I think having "Add to this discussion" in the title is too misleading, and besides this will reduce one click.

<dd>Personally, I will do it either way. But as a reminder of recent history, that's basically the template that we had under WikiMedia and many people fought against it. They said repeatedly on the old VfD talk page that it was too much code and/or too confusing. A couple of us were constantly moving things from the main page into the template format. The wording may not be perfect with the current format but at least most people are using it. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 21:17, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Took out the "Alternate Method" section because everyone seems to have adopted the primary approach by now.</dd>
</dl>
<p>is false, and that that appearance results from people, including me, who have been converting Alternate-Method quasi-templates to main-Method ones. One lower-bound measure of the frequency of that scenario is the number of quasi-templates that lack the comment, or have a hand written comment that differs in wording from this template's wording of the corresponding day and time. A precise measure would, i think, entail looking at a random sample of VfD-history-provided file compares via the "last" links.<br />
I'm restoring the Alternate Method instructions, pending further argument, especially in light of a VfD summary reading</p>

<p>I don't know enough about the ads issue to put that back w/o further discussion, but it seems to me letting an ad use us to build up five days worth of "linked from WP" points w/Google may be a sufficient incentive to make this spam worth while.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, the disabled URL's text can be pasted into your browser's address pane, so disabling is not a significant barrier to research.</p>

<p>The old VfD footer contained erroneous links to "/VfD" that had to be manually rewritten. I've fixed it up so that the code will be correct when copied and pasted (e.g., <code>{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Page name}}</code> instead of <code>{{Page name/VfD}}</code>.)

<p>On 19 Sep 04, Guanaco removed the {{subst:vfd warning}} line from these instructions. I believe that the warning has been successful at reducing the number of edits to the main VfD page. What was the downside of that instruction and is it worth the increased maintenance of monitoring the VfD page for misapplied comments? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 02:01, 21 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>That template doubled the amount of wikitext on VfD and greatly increased the amount of HTML generated.

<p>Every once in a while, someone will take quite a bit of time in getting every step accomplished, which can be confusing, such as when one sees the subst:vfd header on a page, but it doesn't yet link to anything, or such as when everything is linked, but the nominator takes their time in writing their reason for wishing to delete a page. I'd like to add something like this to the bottom of the footer:</p>
<hr />
<p><i>Note:</i> In order to ensure that too much time does not elaspe between steps 1 and 8, it is recommended that you create a copy-and-paste template for yourself, in which you have made the above substitutions (replacing "PageName" with the article's name) and have pre-written your reason for wishing the page to be deleted. This is an example:</p>
<pre>
{{subst:vfd}}                                    paste at the top of the article page
{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Nonsense}}        paste below the last heading on this page
===[[Nonsense]]===                               paste to Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Nonsense
I think this page is utter nonsense...           ...along with your already-written reason
~~~~                                             ...and the infamous 4 tildes.

<p>I can't say I object, but I don't think it comes up enough to be a serious concern. And shouldn't it be four tildes?

<p>I'm not going to be bold here because this is a rather crucial piece of text. I'm wondering: shouldn't you <i>first</i> create the VfD subpage, and <i>then</i> update VfD with the link? If you do it the other way around, people who are watching VfD might just get a broken link when they go to the page, and won't see when the actual entry is present (as that's a new article). This wastes crucial time.</p>
<p>I propose this is shuffled around to produce the following:</p>
<p><b>To list a page named <i>PageName</i> for deletion:</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>(wherever <i>PageName</i> occurs below, use the name of the page to be deleted instead.)</dd>

<p>This doesn't seem right to me. Some things are obvious deletes, like vanity articles, and a simple assertion that this is the case is all that's needed; no other action, such a redirect, even makes any sense for many of these. Yes, there are some misfires, but that's what VfD is about - attempting to determine if articles should be kept or deleted. - <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedWordSmith_c15a.html" title="User:RedWordSmith">RedWordSmith</a> 03:30, Dec 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds like an inclusionist ploy to discount one-word judgements as inherently invalid. As an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/inclusionism" class="extiw" title="m:inclusionism">inclusionist</a> myself, I would have hoped for a more subtle approach. Arguing why, even if something particular <i>is</i> "vanity", it should still remain, for example. Let's face it—on inclusionists rests the burden of convincing the deletionists why they should not all follow their gut and rake up the <b>Delete</b> votes; forcing them to use a language that doesn't contain any of the "bad words" is like <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">Newspeak</a>. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 02:18, 2004 Dec 11 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know much about the above. What i do know is, if someone's going to say "I want to have article X deleted", they should at least say why, more than just "It sucks" or "its X" or "its Y". A bit of thought and more than a word chosen from <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> is in order.

<dd>If someone is going to post a request for deletion and ask others to vote, they at least can be reminded by VfD that part of ANY wiki page is the need to think carefully about the grounds for it, and cite them. If it was any other article, they'd be asked to add NPOV information or support their views stated, and not just be considered okay to say "It's X" (ie, "I think it's X") or support a page with spurious reasoning. I can't see that applies any less here. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> 04:34, Dec 11, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely agree with you. The problem is, most others do not (they may agree on paper, but will not give up their summary rulings in practice). Wiki is about consensus; if the majority of VfD voters think such quickshots are valid enough, then you and I can try to open a discussion and change policy, but we can't just step in and mess with the templates to reflect our wishes. Wikipedia is not consistent, and neither are Wikipedians. If you want to talk this out and get people to agree (as they obviously do not <i>now</i>) go to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_5926.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion</a> and state your case there, citing appropriate earlier decisions and precedents elsewhere if you want. Write explicit policy and open a vote on it if you have to. Making a <b>bold</b> change to "remind" people how they "should" be doing things is usually less productive. Again, I agree with your plan, just not its execution. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 12:58, 2004 Dec 11 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As the title is "votes for <i>deletion</i>" (not votes for merging, votes for tranwikiing, or test cases for deletion), it seems to me that absent any other statement any nomination should be read as a vote in favor <b>deletion</b>.

<dd>I would think so, too, but I know of at least one closer who doesn't count the nomination as a delete vote unless it's explicitly spelled out; I can't recall who it is. Maybe it would be easier to change the instructions for closers to assume it's a delete unless otherwise noted. Although, if otherwise noted, why would it be on VfD?

<dd>The admin you are thinking of might be AllyUnion, the nominator, which is one reason why I think this is a little more important than it first appears; it has meant the difference between keeping and deleting a few articles. I agree with most of the comments below, though I think most, if not all, of dbenbenn's are pretty clear delete votes, even if not strong ones Keep in mind the nominator can change their vote if (in the Jarvis Family mentioned below, for example) the article is rewritten so it does establish notability. I suppose the admin can use thier judgement when looking at votes that, for example, are phrased as genuine questions (GRider has been doing alot of that the past few days), but not when the question is obviously facetious (e.g. "Do we really need shit like this spoiling wikipedia's reputation as a legitimate encyclopedia?"). The cases of genuine ambiguity are pretty rare it seems to me (I might have to except the recent noms of GRider, however), and it might be best to ask the nominator in cases of real ambiguity when it means the difference between a keep or a delete. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:21, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In a spirit of scientific inquiry, I decided to count how many nominations did not (in my opinion) necessarily imply a vote to delete. I looked at February 12, the oldest day currently listed on VfD. Of 66 nominations, I counted about 26 where the nominator didn't have an opinion, or that opinion was not to delete. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/e/p/Hepa.html" title="Hepa">Hepa</a>. "How is this article useful???" (No opinion expressed.)</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/n/Janice_Dean_eab2.html" title="Janice Dean">Janice Dean</a>. "I'm not sure that this news announcer is notable." (Nominator is also not sure she <i>isn't</i> notable.)</li>
<li>Jarvis Family. "doesnt establish notability." (That's a reason to clean it up. Non-notability hasn't been established, either.)</li>
<li>Binilnilium. "do we really want ... in the wikipedia?" (Question, not statement.)</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/o/m/Somewhere_I_Belong_5878.html" title="Somewhere I Belong">Somewhere I Belong</a>. "at the very least belongs as a section on the album page." (That is, merge.)</li>
<li><a href="../../../h/a/b/Habbo_rares.html" title="Habbo rares">Habbo rares</a>. "Doesn't seem notable." (Not quite the same as "not notable.")</li>
<li><a href="../../../y/e/n/Yeniche.html" title="Yeniche">Yeniche</a>. "Vanity?"</li>
<li>A.Dellfina &amp; T.Dellacroix. "A real issue with notability. Also seems like an advertisement." (Does this mean the article <i>is</i> a real issue with notability, or that is <i>has</i> a real issue with notability?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that many of these I <i>would</i> count as "delete" votes. I'm just pointing out that many nominations aren't totally clear. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 15:18, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>These are basically examples of the many different ways that people say "This article is not notable. It should be deleted." Some people don't express this as explicitly as others, but I believe that every nomination is an implicit vote for deletion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 16:11, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The reason I ask if the text should be added is that, granted, implicitly the nominator's vote is delete, but not all the lines are clear. I believe, there are rare instances where the content is to be moved elsewhere, like BJAODN, and the article to be deleted permanently. There are instances where a VfD might be nominated for Renaming, as one can see from <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_phrases_e459.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion phrases">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion phrases</a>. Also, there are rare instances where an article might be nominated for <b>Transwiki</b> and the article should be deleted entirely. It is far better for the nominator to be explicit, so that it is clear what should be the course of action. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 03:02, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For what it's worth, I also recall a particular user claiming that the nominator's opinion didn't count. Perhaps a rephrasing would help? What do you think of this:</dd>
<dd>"Under the section, describe, in accordance with our deletion policy, why the page should be deleted <b>and clearly write what action you think should be taken for the nominated article to assist others in determining consensus.</b>...<i>"</i></dd>
<dd>I've sometimes explicitly put a <b>delete</b> in my nominations, and sometimes I haven't; but if it were standard practice, it could make "vote counting" a little easier at a minimum. I have no objection to a change along these lines. - <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedWordSmith_c15a.html" title="User:RedWordSmith">RedWordSmith</a> 05:48, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no objections either, <i>however</i>, I'm sure many seasoned VfD users would not notice such a change, at least for a while, and will probably maintain their habit of assuming their delete vote in implicit, and expecting it will be counted (by most admins at least) as such. If this change means that will <i>not</i> count nominations as delete votes unless explicitly stated I think it must be made widely known, to more than just the people who read this page or who would notice the addition of a single sentence to the guidelines and realize it's full importance. Basically, I think this is a good guideline, but still I maintain nominations should be considered delete votes in all but the most truly ambiguous circumstances. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 05:58, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A recent nomination, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_55_bar_905e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/55 bar">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/55 bar</a>, was nominated by the user for transwiki. I don't think it's safe to fully assume all nominations as delete, especially when they were nominated for transwiking. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:47, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've always said that if the nominator specifically says they are not voting to delete then it should not be counted as such, but in other cases it generally should be. Besides, transwikying generally involves deletion from WP following the transwiki, so such a vote is still a delete vote, just a different sort of one. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 06:59, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Seems to me that rather than putting {{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Bellybutton}} when listing Bellybutton for deletion, we could just put {{/Bellybutton}}. Is there some possible problem with that I've not considered? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 19:02, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, in the event of moves, vandalism, etc, we want the full title. Besides, {{subst:vfd3|Bellybutton}} already saves you typing. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:49, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been frustrated with VfD for a long while (since I last actively contributed), and recently TimStarling, a very long-standing Wikipedian, mentioned that he "tried" to add an article to VfD the other day and found the process unfriendly. So I took my energies out on improving this template, using color to replace an excess of <b>bold</b> and <i><b>italics</b></i>. It's really just a 3-step process; hopefully this is now clear (and less intimidating). I hope it's useful! Feel free to tweak the specific text; I tried to capture ths spirit of the instructions while cutting down the text to the minimum necessary to make a point. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">sj</a> 06:38, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Per <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_Oct_2005_e0c8.html#afd2_change" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/Oct 2005">this discussion</a>, I've made a small modification to step II, namely suggesting that the nominating party include the first "vote" (entry? outcome suggestion? I know vote isn't quite right) below the afd2 line, so that it's clear what they are suggesting the outcome be. In the future, I'd like to revisit this to see if it's appropriate to change the text to-be-pasted so that it includes the first 'vote' immediately below the afd2 line. I know that not all nominations are implicit deletes, but the nominating editor could change that text as suggested. Just a thought to mull. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 16:39, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> has removed the text I added back in September without discussion or consensus. I worked to gather consensus before adding it, and I feel that her removal of the text without explanation (other than "removing completely inappropriate text") is unfortunate. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion&amp;diff=27625394&amp;oldid=27622500" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion&amp;diff=27625394&amp;oldid=27622500" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, Kelly incorrectly states that I made the proposal, got two objections, then implemented anyhow. This is simply not true. As seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Votes_for_deletion/Oct_2005#afd2_change" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Votes_for_deletion/Oct_2005#afd2_change" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I made proposal <b>A</b> (which was to modify the afd2 template to automatically insert the <b>Delete</b> vote). There were two very well thought out objections, and working with the objectors, we came up with an alternative (to instead suggest in <a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfD_footer_abd7.html" title="Template:AfD footer">Template:AfD footer</a> instructions that the nominator consider placing the first vote). I proposed it, and <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> said "Go for it!". Once again, I'm working to gather consensus on the issue, and just putting a note in here in case you've come wondering what's happening with the text in the article.

<p>There is a minor problem with the step 3 of the template. The template says "If you used template {{subst:afdx}} instead of {{subst:afd1}}, use "PageName (2nd nomination)" instead of "PageName" for a second nomination". This is not correct. You must use "PageName (2nd nomination)" if you have used {{subst:AfDx|2nd}} and "PageName (second nomination)" if you have used {{subst:AfDx|second}} in step 1. Can the template be changed to reflect this? A user had a lot of problems with a listing at AfD because of this. I did not change it myself because of a large number of articles linked to this template.- <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 10:30, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
