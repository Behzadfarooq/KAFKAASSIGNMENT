<li>That's a good idea. I rarely get to keep up with AfD because of the clumsiness of the current system. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 12:53, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Great idea. Once AfD is categorized we will then ban anyone who has touched the subject from voting on it. We might just --<a href="../../../s/h/l/User%7EShlomke_975f.html" title="User:Shlomke">Shlomke</a> 05:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)--<a href="../../../s/h/l/User%7EShlomke_975f.html" title="User:Shlomke">Shlomke</a> 05:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)be able to defeat groupthink like that. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 13:13, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I like the idea of categorization, but for exactly the opposite reason. I think, for example, that people who are part of the Wikiproject Bridges should have their voices respected more, not less, when the topic touches on their area of expertise.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 14:30, 24 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, categorization is geared to involve more experts and nonexperts alike. I am strongly opposed to the suggestion that those involved in nominated articles (often the experts) be "banned" from participation. There are common sense limits to how far WP:OWN should be taken, as a social experiment, versus WP:ENC. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 00:12, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This touches at a much wider issue at wikipedia, and that is between objective experts at one hand and fans at the other hand. How to separate those? Especially with no mechanism to distinguish who are experts and who are not? It could also refers to a wider issue, do some editors have more to say than others (along whatever line of division)? Just some rambling, I think most of the time it works fine. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 17:00, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This was ironic. Out of 140 or so deletion candidates each day not more than five are contested, and the contested ones invariably involve entrenched loyalties. - Dr Zak
<dl>
<dd>Once it is broken down by category more people can put the list <i>they</i> care about on their watch list. I don't care about deletion in games. I do care about deletion in science. The way it is set up now, there is too much noise for me to waste my time filtering it out. Maybe others feel likewise. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 15:49, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not going to happen Shlomke, you'd need specific categories for banning, but we need broad categories for listing sanity. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffBurdges_be5a.html" title="User:JeffBurdges">JeffBurdges</a> 10:51, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Support, it makes sense, AfD is such a cluterred mess as such that is impossible to read them all and of course we don't like talk page spam so this seems like an excellent solution to the said problem -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 14:03, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Support. I recommend using the article's own categorization if an appropriate one exists at the bottom of the article (like living person). I also recommend one or more deletion reason categories for stuff we know should be deleted and that reason is judged a more important identifyer. Examples: it's not even a good enough article to appropriatly fit into a category; the person initially suggesting a delete knows exactly why he wants it deleted but that is unrelated to the article topic; the article claims to be about one thing but really exists to push a point of view (at least that's what the deleter thinks). <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 14:46, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Support. I think it would be convenient if AfDs could be double listed by placing appropriate tags - once on the main AfD page and once on the specific category's AfD page. This would solve concerns about balkanization, and would encourage input from specific groups of editors as well as from the community at large. This shouldn't be too difficult, either. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a><sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">Talk</a></sup> 15:48, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Support. The whole AfD process is just crying out for some rational organization by subject area. Such a measure I think would both ease participation for editors frustated by the huge daily lists of topics they are unknowledgable about or uninterested in, as well as facilitate the development of more basic standards on what is considered notable in the different subject areas.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 20:28, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Support as long as we still have a page with the general listing, it is nice to be able to browse the AfDs and comment on ones that one might not otherwise have interest in. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:37, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. My above support is tentatively dependent on this, as well. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a><sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">Talk</a></sup> 03:04, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is the plan, along the lines of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_History_and_geography_5e1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/History and geography">Requests for comment/History and geography</a> and so on, in relation to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_All_8adc.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/All">Requests for comment/All</a>. The master list (and respective archives) page/s need not be categorized, though, thus its current chronological order can be retained. This proposal is intended as a counterpart to, not replacement for, the current system. Those who prefer the old system should not notice a difference, except in the nomination stage where a category would be specified (a prerequisite for the new model to work). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 03:46, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Support. It will make it easier, not only for the editors who discuss stuff, but also for the closing admins in cases where expert knowledge is required to make a sensible decision when it is either not conclusive, or the votes have been stacked or whatever makes it difficult. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 03:11, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Support. AfD has as El C says become inaccessible to all but a few <del>monomaniacs</del> <del>diehards</del> people with an exceptional interest in this particular corner of the wiki namespace. The present system worked at one time, but the growth of Wikipedia has utterly obsoleted it. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:10, 25 May 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li>Supportish. It might be worth examining what happens in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_Current_activity_dad4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics/Current activity">Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics/Current activity</a>, basically this page allows us to quickly see mathematical articles on AfD as well as various other criteria such as articles which are Needing verification. The way this works is: a bot cross references AfD articles with those in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mathematics_articles.html" title="List of mathematics articles">List of mathematics articles</a> and each day updates the current activity page. List of mathematics articles is also created by a bot, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathbot_604f.html" title="User:Mathbot">User:Mathbot</a>. This bot basically uses a list of all mathematical categories and places all articles in those categories in the list. A similar system could be used for other projects without having to remove the global list of all AfD articles. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 20:59, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Follow up to own comment. Just install <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/DynamicPageList2" class="extiw" title="meta:DynamicPageList2">meta:DynamicPageList2</a> which is used on wikinews, then it become a cakewalk for any project to find the intersection of AfD and the project specific categories, allowing each wikiproject to list related AfD's. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 22:47, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Strong Support. Simple categorization of Afds is a great idea. Why didn't I think of this? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 21:00, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Support. I like this idea, it allows flexibility while browsing AfDs which I agree will encourage more people to do so. Right now the sheer number of AfDs per day can be overwhelming. I'd really like to see El C's "exceedingly simple guidelines, including a 'when uncertain' clauses" mentioned below in response to Mel Etitis.

<li><b>Support</b>. Counting on the fact that interested people and experts don't notice an AFD about something in their field (allegedly to avoid "POV-clique-breeding") and on random passers-by to have an entry "righteously" kept or deleted are the worst reasons for opposing this. POV-pushers will be able to push their POV anyway, and those who feel strongly about subjects probably watch these articles and comment on its AFD anyway. It's the interested but non-watching group of people who will benefit from this. Actually, this should be no big deal. The important thing is to avoid categories that are too specific, and keep it broad. As proposed, all AFDs should remain listed like they are now, so that there is absolutely no loss in functionality from the current situation. <b>Additional comment:</b> Why not be bold with this and test it during an evaluative period?

But I don't see why it <i>has</i> to be more complicated than writing out {{fair use as|<small>AfD category</small>}} versus {{fairuse}}. I think the current "AfD clique" (those with the time &amp; patience to browse the entire list) tends to represent within it the "cliques" (intellectual currents) in Wikipedia at large. The proposal is only geared to expand participation, by offering those without the time and patience to browse the entire list, a filtered view of this master list.

<ol>
<li>Articles don't neatly divide into such categories, and it can be a real pain to decide where to put them sometimes.</li>
<li>Fewer editors will see what's up for AfD, unless they're prepared to go through all the categories (which most are not), and this means that:</li>
<li>AfDs will be seen and discussed by a sub-set of editors — those interested in the area. This can often lead to skewed results, with different criteria (or interpretations of criteria) being applied to different subject areas. This is already a serious problem in parts of Wikipedia; categorising the RfC process exacerbated it, and I fear that this would take things further. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 08:29, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Indeed, articles do not divide neatly into such categories. For that reason, I've always disliked Wikipedia article categories. (On that note I agree with Larry Sanger, who, I believe, has opposed article categories from the start.) Still, since AfD is just a matter of the interal functioning of Wikipedia, and is not a part of the encyclopedia, article content standards are not undermined if if an editor includes an article in a wrong or murky category on AfD... Your third point raises a serious problem. I'll have to give my support here some more thought. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 08:49, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It seems that concerns #2 and #3 would be addressed by the planned double-listing that would keep all AfDs on the main page, as well as on subject pages. Concern #1 could be solved by tags that allow users to list an AfD under multiple subjects (with the voting only occurring on one page). <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a><sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">Talk</a></sup> 16:59, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see that double listing solves 2 or 3; the point of the proposal is presumably that a significant number of editors would only use the categorised version (otherwise why go the trouble of changing the system?) — the fact that they <i>could</i> look at the complete list doesn't affect the fact that they <i>won't</i>. The argument is that a large number of editors will participate in AfDs who don't at present, but are there any figures on editors not participating because of the all-in-one list? Did participation in RfCs go up? (My informal impression is that it went down.) --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 21:55, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I doubt that most people who already watch the AfD page would participate less or even watch the main AfD page less. I don't have any idea how we could get reliable figures about increased participation, but I certainly get the <i>impression</i> that currently alienated/apathetic people would participate much more in AfDs if only they had less video games and vanity bios (etc.) to look through before they could get to matters of interest. Setting up broad categorization would encourage more varied participation by adding participants to the current group of AfD aficionados. Anyway, I think that AfD is potentially much more attractive to most editors than is RfC. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a><sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">Talk</a></sup> 03:09, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Double-listing solves the visibility problem in #2 but does not address the self-selection bias inherent in #3. I'd like to remind everyone that we've experimented with categorization before. That experiment eventually died out. I don't consider it to have been a success. What makes this proposal different? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 17:38, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It makes it different in that not a single person here was part of that experiment, including Jimbo. Many of us would like to be part of AfD and are tired of being excluded from it by virtue of its rather gross inaccessability. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 18:25, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, it is almost a dead cert that the categories will spread like a bad rash. We've already had some, um, intersting results created at AfD by things like FooWatch making it impossible to have meaningful discussions on Foos. We're still having a bun-fight over the perceived "vote-stacking" potential of the evil little boxes. How is a category like Catholic deletion or Counter strike deletion going to do anything but re-create those problems? We <i>need</i> wide input on deletion discussions. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 09:51, 26 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To me, that argument reads as a straw man, since it employs extremely narrow categories that would never exist under this proposal. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 11:51, 26 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We have solid evidence that category proliferation has occurred in other circumstances within Wikipedia. It appears that there is consensus even among the supporters of the proposal that such proliferation would not be a good thing in this situation. Yet so far no one has suggested how category proliferation will be prevented or controlled. It's not a straw-man - it's a reasonable request for you to refine the proposal. Will you use technological controls to prevent further fragmentation? Or will you rely on policy language to prevent someone from <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">being bold</a> and setting up their own categorization?

<li>What about consensus and common sense. I'm pretty sure that not many people would endorse the creation of a Counterstrike category. I think the proposal is very clear that the categorisation should be broad.

<ul>
<li>Since there is no way to obtain such evidence, there of course isn't going to be any. But it is obvious that numerous editors avoid AfD because of the hassle involved in looking through the morass of listings. And the proposal sounds pretty darn simple to me. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a><sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">Talk</a></sup> 01:17, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong oppose</b> - one of things about AFD is that you're not supposed to comment on articles about subjects that you feel strongly about. If people just browse categories about their interests, you will find that many articles which probably should have been deleted were voted to be kept by fans of the subject of that article. —<b><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">M</a><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_Esperanza_c07a.html" title="User:Mets501/Esperanza"><font color="green"><i>e</i></font></a><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">ts501</a></b><small><sup><a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a></sup></small> 23:12, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Categorization would tend to bring more input from people who are more <i>informed</i> about specific subject groups. Under the current system, articles are unfortunately deleted when they probably should be kept, and articles are kept when they probably should be deleted. Google shouldn't supplant human knowledge and input. And an interest in "society and culture" (or whatever) doesn't mean a desire to indiscriminately keep bad or non-notable articles. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a><sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">Talk</a></sup> 01:17, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong oppose</b> At the moment, all those stupid areas of crap, such as articles on Star Trek fan fiction, and StarCraft guides, that shouldn't be on Wikipedia, get kept because the loons who make these pages spam any AFD votes and the admin just closes it as no consensus, which solves nothing. Breaking this down into categories will just further encourage such behaviour, and so we will have a wonderfully high standard of notability, verifiablility and scholarship applied to maths, geography sections and the like, and every godawful unsourced, original research gobs of vomitry related to Star Wars, porn stars, and Islamic terrorists will be block kept (sort of like Mets501 said). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">Proto</font></span></span></a><font color="#555555"><b>||</b></font><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">type</font></span></span></a></small> 11:29, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>It seems unlikely that such broad categorization would make the problem worse.

<li><b><strike>Strong</strike> oppose</b>. Categorising AfDs will inevitably lead to interest groups focussing on articles in their area with only the most ardent outside that group prepared to browse through a list.

Withdrawing these articles from plain and obvious view cannot but inflate this problem. We don't categorise RfA as it is important that this is visable to anyone interested not simply to those with the inclination to follow multiple links.

<li><b>Ambiguous</b> - categorising will assist those of us who are better 'qualified' with respect to certain articles e.g. people on the ground for geographical bits and pieces or national figures, or people who practice in a particular discipline.

<p>I want these categories to be very broad. This I think will help alleviate the concerns expressed by Mel regarding categories becoming dominated by narrow interests groups and currents.

<li>Frequently at AtD (and almost always uncontested) are groups and clubs (gaming clans, myspace bands, pub sports teams etcetera). Those could to with a category just to keep them out of the way of more "interesting" categories</li>
<li>Often at AfD are webcomics, authors, books with low circulation and radio presenters with only local or otherwise limited notability. Those should be grouped together. Maybe people will settle on a standard. What irks people is different standards applied to different foos.</li>
<li>Political concepts, political figures and historical events attract controversy. Has an article deliberately been forked to avoid policing, does the title present a viewpoint and so on? It's probably worth having a category for that to keep related debates together</li>

<li>Going through a day's AfD (painful!) my conclusion is that "biographies" is useful as a wrapup category for people that don't readily fit into any of the other categories, that is people that aren't politicians, scientists or media personalities. Listing of people on AfD usually aren't controversial, the people listed are the usual unremarkable lot of unsuccessful political candidates, aspiring band members, pseudoscientific cranks and guys with their 15 minues of fame on Dah Web. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 16:23, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, though religion itself is fairly broad.

<dd>I think we should be pragmatic. Start with really wide categories, and it it shows that they are to broad (compared to what we have now it is much narrower anyway), there is always space to subdivide.

<li><b>Comment</b> Wise man once say "Fools talk of vices, ordinary people talk of other people, the wise talk about ideas." The primary criteria for categorization ought to be firstly wether or not an article would fit as a page in a textbook. If no, then is it about people, persons,</li>
</ul>
<p>groups, or movements? If no, Then its pretty much got to be about distractions, entertainments, vices, etc. Thats a dimensional set of factors in that the other categories listed above could be multiplied together to form a sort of category matrix. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 20:50, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Isn't computers a little narrow? Wouldn't it be best to have a general technology section? Likely merged with the science since medicine is already there.</p>
<p>Also games is to vague if listed with computers anyway. Games could be split into existing sections acording to the type of game: drinking &amp; card games go in culture, computer games go in media, etc. Or even better: sports could be expanded to include all games (computer, cards, etc.). Effectively games &amp; sports would be low brow culture (vaguely like Prometheuspan's vices), and art &amp; society would be high brow culture (vaguely like Prometheuspan's ideas).</p>
<p>If we're going to have a seperate biographies category, we might also expand media to include books. OTOH, you could merge media with sports &amp; games if your going for low brow, like TV, with media. But I find the books biographies analogy more important.</p>
<p>So maybe the topics should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art, culture and society</li>
<li>Biographies</li>
<li>Books, movies, music, and other media</li>
<li>Companies, products and transport</li>
<li>Games and sports</li>
<li>Politics, history and geography</li>
<li>Science, technology, and medicine</li>

<p>P.S. I expect this will be implemented by the lister so categories are not exclusive. For example, a game known for its graphics may be listed under both games and media. A lister can always just improperly list one under General and let another person fix the categorization.</p>

<p>A lot of effort has gone into this, but it looks a lot like a very theoretical debate about categorizing general content. In truth it's more a question of <b>how can we sort random crap</b>? For example, geography, history and math might make up the majority of our articles, but are a tiny minority at AfD. The odd hoax geographic location, some <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> in math or history, perhaps the occasional <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>... but not much really. Generally notability isn't contested in these cases and verifiability is often straightforward. There's a big cleanup queue for horrendous geographic and historical articles, but because their <i>subjects</i> aren't in doubt they don't tend to arrive at AfD. On the flip side, a seriously disproportionate amount of bands and living people biographies do come here. So what kind of rubbish does AfD mainly filter?</p>
<p>I did some research, based on a sample of 100 nominations. I could have kept going but basically my results showed no new trends than when I was at 30. I didn't detect any instances of this being skewed by a particular series of nominations. 100 nominations is around 10-20% of the ongoing AfD load at any times, so it's not that bad a sample. Here's what happened when I bunched them up into the smallest categories I found reasonable:</p>
<p><map name="716db6c18681092cd1ba80782b01ddfa"></map><img usemap="#716db6c18681092cd1ba80782b01ddfa" src="../../../upload/timeline/716db6c18681092cd1ba80782b01ddfa.png" /></p>
<p>This is very light on most technical and academic areas. I also noted the reasoning in debates:</p>
<p><map name="e34efbc07dee141f1614a1440f124d6f" id="e34efbc07dee141f1614a1440f124d6f"></map><img usemap="#e34efbc07dee141f1614a1440f124d6f" src="../../../upload/timeline/e34efbc07dee141f1614a1440f124d6f.png" /></p>
<p>In many ways this was a more revealing way to sort. Many <i>debates requiring expert technical or academic opinion</i> were contested on V or NOR grounds (is a result or term obscure but notable, or just OR? Is a subfield of study academically recognized?), while debates about <i>how should WP sort information</i> were often category vs list issues. There was also debate about certain <i>content forks</i>, though it can be hard to tell a merger debate from a deletion one. The <i>Wikipedia is not...</i> debates discussed what general classes of subject WP should include, while the <i>nn</i> debates focussed on how important a subject had to be within those classes to be included. Many of the notability debates were very one-sided, though a few really needed subject-specific expertise. There were a lot of instances that were just delete vote pile-ons that should by rights have been prodded or csd'd. Similarly, 5% of nominations were dull and pointless debates about articles that were (sometimes hideously) malformed, and for various reasons hadn't gone through, or couldn't go through, alternative deletion routes.</p>
<p>In fact, I think the main conclusion that can be drawn from both graphs is something most editors are well aware of. <b>Despite <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, and despite <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>, AfD remains primarily our chief <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruftisement</a>-whacking center.</b> That's not necessarily a criticism - it whacks it well and good, and even some "obvious" cases are sufficiently subjective (someone could feasilbly disagree: implicitly, the creator thought it was worth putting into WP) that it's worth, in the absense of objectivity, to invoke collective rather than individual subjectivity. But this does mean that classifying AfD is akin to sorting the contents of your neighbours' trashcan after they've emptied their cat litter [the stuff that survives CSD or prod] into it, in the quiet confidence you'll find a few glass bottles worth recycling, and with a 1 in 10,000 chance of recovering that missing ring you reckon their cat might have swallowed.</p>
<p>Judging from the data, these seem fine:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Biographies:</b> agree, decent size, and should explicitly exclude bands (they're decided the same way, no need to split them up)</li>
<li><b>Books, movies, music, and other media:</b> also agree, but be aware that this will probably be dominated by flash animations, webcomics, music. I'd also suggested putting in TV characters or minor presenters too.</li>
<li><b>Games and sports</b>: spot on, quite sizable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Could do with a little bit of rearranging perhaps?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Science, technology and medicine:</b> strongly <i>disagree</i> about including social science. There's not usually heavy traffic for social sciences, and splitting between history/historiography and "the rest" would fragment it even further.</li>
<li><strike><b>Companies, products, and transport</b></strike> <b>Organizations and products</b>: may as well combine corps and other organizations, judging from the numbers (bands excluded as an "organization"). Transportation is tangential and liable to get swamped, and since it is likely to need expert attention (e.g. is a certain class of road in a certain country so notable that individual roads require articles?) it's perhaps not a good idea to leave it marooned and alone in the heart of Spamtisement Country.</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably needs more extensive rearrangement:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Art, culture and society</b> - "the Arts", as represented, at AfD tend to be ... painful, and this would be an odd mix with some of the cultural and social topics (List of Purgolian characters in Starscape:Era 4 to Criticisms of criticisms of criticisms of Islam?). I'd suggest some splitting up. Also it's odd to have social things here with the exception of social science at science with the further exception of history/historiography elsewhere...</li>
<li><b>Politics, history and geography</b> - probably not feasible due to insufficient nominations?</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggested alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Indiscernible or unclassifiable topic</b> - for the really rubbish and really weird. There's actually enough of this stuff that its own category would be good.</li>
<li><b>Fiction and the Arts</b> - there's a lot of cross-over on AFD. Fictional characters, plots and items, indeed entire fictional realms, have a cross-over with the associated writers who often end up here. Artists are rarer but similar criteria are likely to apply.</li>
<li><b>Society related</b> - almost but not quite a catch-all; something to cover social science, history, beliefs, crime, education, history, hobbies, the military, sex...</li>
<li><b>Places and transportation</b> - a significant type of -cruft that appears at AFD is "placecruft" or "localcruft". People often write articles about their local street, roads, mall, random buidings - in essence, "schoolcruft" is just a particular genre of localcruft. I think that places ought to get their own category in the same way that suspected biocruft should. There's a degree of overlap between places and transportation (bridge, roads, and other transportation infrastructure) and since places and transportation are inherently related, I think this is a comfortable match.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these categories, I would expect roughly the following relative frequencies, based on my sample:</p>
<p><map name="e8eb7c93b8455b2b544916c23094d76f" id="e8eb7c93b8455b2b544916c23094d76f"></map><img usemap="#e8eb7c93b8455b2b544916c23094d76f" src="../../../upload/timeline/e8eb7c93b8455b2b544916c23094d76f.png" /></p>
<p>To me this seems pretty well- balanced. None of the smaller categories seem to fit especially well into the others without bloating them, while of the larger categories, none predominate. All of these would be usefully browsable in size.

<p>Kim informs me that regretfuly he was unable to recruit the aid of a developer. <s>He also suggested to me the possibility that my recent criticisms of certain IRC-related practices might prove a hindrence (since I'm the original author of this proposal) to finding ones.</s> Let's try to organize in finding ways to have developers looking into this now, so that when we're finished the drafting process, it could be implemented. So, if we're unable to find developers through the normal channels or whatever means we have at our disposal, we could appeal to Jimbo directly to find us some. Or I could misuse my foundation wiki priveliges and appeal for help there. That'd be funny!

<p>The number of articles on AfD has been going up at an exponential rate, as wikipedia increases in size and popularity at an exponential rate. 9 months or so ago, we were getting close to 200 AfD's per day, and to solve this overload Proposed Deletion was put in place. This took a huge load off AfD... temporarily, but now we've doubled in size again, 200 articles a day are being Prodded, half of them being deleted this way, and AfD is back nearing 200 a day. Within another year we'll be up to 300 or 400 articles a day on AfD. Clearly this is not going to work. Already, 15 or 20 AfD's per day have to be relisted because of not getting enough responses to form a consensus.</p>
<p>One monster massive page with 300 or 400 or 500 AfD's simply is unworkable, there will be no choice but to break these down into categories, as this likely is the only way to make the whole thing more manageable and to get more people involved in the process, and obviously more people will be needed as the number of articles AfD'd continues to rise. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 02:52, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this category feature is great. I have been moving items into the appropriate categories. I am not sure where is the best place to raise this, but could an additional category be created for langunage. I have been putting those entries that deal with WP:NEO and dictionary definitions into the Society topics because nothing else fits. Also, is there any ranking or preference for entries that could fit into two or more categories, ie an online flash game could be in Web (W) or Games (G)?

<p>The main concern people had with this proposal was the danger of more and more new categories being added, eventually leading to highly specific subcategories like "star trek" or "webcomics", which might then make it highly difficult to delete any article in certain categories, as dozens of people come pouring out of the woodwork to vote keep on any webcomic/babylon V/wrestling/etc. article. As many people voted keep with the caveat that the number of categories needed to remain small, and most of the Oppose votes were opposed to this policy for this very reason, I believe we need to make it clear that new categories should not be added. This would never have become policy if there were going to be a hundred categories, so category creep needs to be forbidden from the outset. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 13:30, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I (and several other closing admins, see <a href="../../../g/a/y/User_talk%7EGay_Cdn_e245.html" title="User talk:Gay Cdn">User talk:Gay Cdn</a>) have run into the issue of not removing the {{<a href="../../../r/e/m/Template%7EREMOVE_THIS_TEMPLATE_WHEN_CLOSING_THIS_AfD_2b6b.html" title="Template:REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE WHEN CLOSING THIS AfD">REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE WHEN CLOSING THIS AfD</a>}} template after the recent implementation. One of the problems which arises is that if one clicks on the "edit" link off of, say, the Afd page <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2006_September_9_c99a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 September 9">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 September 9</a>, this template doesn't show up at all. For example, just picking a AfD discussion off random of that page, one finds that clicking on that link (or dragging it into another tab) brings up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Opening_logos_of_the_MGM_cartoon_department&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Opening_logos_of_the_MGM_cartoon_department&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and of course the notice is contained in Section 0 since it's ahead of the article name, at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Opening_logos_of_the_MGM_cartoon_department&amp;action=edit&amp;section=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Opening_logos_of_the_MGM_cartoon_department&amp;action=edit&amp;section=0" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. As for now, the only fix I can figure out is to click on the edit link, then in the new opened window, click "project page" and then "edit page" again, and then the template shows up. This seems like a problem to me, and it has caught a fair number of fellow admins off guard as well.</p>
<p>I can see two fixes for this, the first is for the REMOVE template to appear somewhere below the article name. Putting it right below makes it slightly more complicated for the admin to close but might be the best solution here, as putting it at the bottom guarantees it will be accidentally changed by commenters. The second fix is to somehow modify the code so that the edit button on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2006_September_9_c99a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 September 9">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 September 9</a> brings up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Opening_logos_of_the_MGM_cartoon_department&amp;action=edit" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Opening_logos_of_the_MGM_cartoon_department&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, but I don't know if this is even technically possible or there are global reasons why this change breaks something.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a great idea and I'm glad it's being added, but this feature of the implementation seems to be a bug to me. So I propose the following question: Is there any way to fix this?</p>

<p>The tag was changed from "proposed" to "guideline" to "policy". I reverted it back to "guideline" but I'm not happy with even that. The text on the "guideline" tag reads "It has general acceptance among editors and is considered a standard that all users should follow."</p>
<p>The vote above shows that there is NOT "general acceptance among editors" and therefore this doesn't even qualify as a guideline.</p>
<p>I say this even though I voted to support and I really like this idea. It has increased my participation in AfD dramatically.</p>

Omitting it will lead to low participation rates and so it is in the interest of most nominators to categorize the AfD so as to get the maximum participation.</dd>

<dd>Well, textually, the oppose section appears to be greater than it is due to the sheer volume of discussion in that section, whereas most support votes are a single line (or word). At any rate, so long as it remains part of the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html#How_to_list_pages_for_deletion" title="WP:AfD">AfD nomination steps</a> and so long as the <a href="../../../a/f/d/Category%7EAfD_debates_%28Not_yet_sorted%29_0e40.html" title="Category:AfD debates (Not yet sorted)">unsorted cat</a> remains in relative proportion, I don't really care about the semantics, not to mention intend on delisting anything. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 08:56, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The policy vs. guideline argument is probably irrelevant, as this is a <i>process</i>; there isn't a policy tag on <a href="../../../d/p/r/WP%7EDPR_0351.html" title="WP:DPR">WP:DPR</a> or <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, and there shouldn't be one here. That doesn't imply a lack of consensus, just that it's not the sort of thing that gets a policy/guideline tag. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 10:51, 27 September 2006 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</dd>

<p>Current the AfD debates on scholars tend to attract a good deal of one-sided automatic votes from people who don't think anyone less than Plato is notable. Some of this is covered under science, but the most difficult ones are non-Science; in the last few days I've seen a Professor of law at Oxford nominated on the grounds that it did not assert notability. If people from a subject area or who cared about things like this more generally would know, there could be a more informed discussion either way. This would also apply to those who have access to Web of Science or Scopus or other expensive service.

<p>Why are some of the various deletion categories listed as subcategories of each other?

<dd>It's because the pages listed in the categories are transcluding AfDs, which in turn contain the category. When creating the system, I decided not to suppress this behaviour, because it was potentially useful (for instance, it may point users interested in a particular AfD cat to deletion-sorting pages that might interest them; it has for me at least once), but if this is deemed desirable, the logs and deletion-sorting pages could be removed from the category by making yet more changes to {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd2_d3bd.html" title="Template:Afd2">afd2</a>}}. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 09:01, 30 January 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</dd>
