<p>I made 2 changes to the template: I removed the unnecessary &lt;br&gt; to make the template a bit more compact. Also, I removed the notice not to deface the notice, as it was quite silly and caused the text to break to a new line and take up a bit more space on the page than necessary. If I have stepped on any toes, my apologies. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 19:18, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I've restored the request not to deface the notice. It's not silly at all. Furthermore: Not everyone's web browser windows are the same width and resolution as yours. Removing a word because "it caused the text to break to a new line" is daft. If the exact placements of things within your web browser's window is your reason for continually fiddling with this notice, please stop. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:45, 2005 May 9 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, but having a notice that says "don't deface this notice" is utterly silly. Why don't we just put a notice on every single page that says "Don't deface this page". It's totally pointless. And I realize that everyone's window sizes are different, I just meant that it's better to be more concise so that the notice takes up less screen real estate. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 06:27, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're wrong. It's not silly at all. I suggest that you familiarize yourself with how the VFD notice is actually applied (At the very least read what is written on this very page.) and some of the things that are frequently done to it by novices before being bold again. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:14, 2005 May 11 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'd like to stress that the appearance and content of this template have been discussed a great deal on this page, consensus being that it should be as small, clean, and concise as possible, including no more nor less than the vital information. Drastic changes should be reasoned carefully, and preferably discussed here first, especially since it is common to use <tt>{{subst:vfd}}</tt> (meaning that, once inserted, the template's appearance is not automatically updated). — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 22:27, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have a problem with the current background colour, in that there is no background colour. Not on my laptop screen, anyway. I find this white block of text ugly. Also, 'or deface this notice'? Is that a real problem? Is that not a rather obvious suggestion?</p>

<li>Wrong. He hasn't. Perhaps you're mistaking him for someone else. This section? Are you perhaps thinking of me? Kaldari? Dan? As for edit history, the only relevant he said was: <i>"on the contrary, the previous text is much clearer; discussion comes before voting"</i>. As I said before, I find 'Please vote on and discuss' to run more smoothly than 'Please discuss and vote on'. Two opposing opinions. What makes Rdsmith4's opinion so great?

<li>In fact I have, and am doing so right now. Sorry for the confusion - I sign as "Dan". Uncle G expresses my opinion well, but it is no more than my opinion.

<p>All other issues aside, I feel strongly that the admonition against defacing the VfD notice is inappropriate.

<li>History has, however, proven that we need such an admonition here. The clause was only added after long experience with notices that <i>had</i> been defaced or modified inappropriately. Yes, we should <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> but not the to point of denying reality or experience. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 15:06, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree. Stick with the original, simpler form. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 22:01, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

I am guessing that the proposal was supposed to be a way around the problem of renominated articles conflicting with an already archived decision. We need to preserve the old discussion. The <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Maintenance_69a0.html#Renominations" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Maintenance">current workaround</a> for renominated articles is ... clumsy. I'm not sure however that this was the most effective or least intrusive way to achieve the goal. We should discuss it some before making the change. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:12, 15 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A slightly less clumsy method, perhaps, is to rename any existing [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/{{PAGENAME}}]] to a sub-page of itself such as [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/{{PAGENAME}}/First]], and then edit the resultant redirect as the new nomination. No hand-editing of the VFD notice required, and you also get a link from the old sub-page to the current sub-page for free (and a link on the new nomination page, that you can edit into a "For a previous VFD discussion see X" note, for free, too). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:13, 2005 May 16 (UTC)

<li>It was my idea, when I was perusing vfd since because the templates are created in a subdirectory of vfd they link back there and not to the day subpage of vfd which is, to say the least, annoying. I hadn't yet fathomed the problem with repeated vfd's, but the fact that my change solves that too makes me wonder why I was reverted. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 23:41, 15 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your change stops the link from pointing to where the sub-pages actually are, and causes things to break the next day after a sub-page is created. On a more general note: Having the ability to have a separate VFD discussion sub-page for an article <i>every day</i> is needless overkill. The (purported) simplification that it provides for the small minority of renominations is far outweighed by the complexity that introduces across the board. And since the link to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a> at the top of all VFD sub-pages brings you to hyperlinks to the per-day pages <i>anyway</i>, there's not really a great deal of benefit to be gained in terms of ease of use in the first place. Furthermore: Bear in mind that there are now four separate ways of viewing current VFD discussions that people can choose from. Altering naming conventions to suit your own viewing method of choice has ramifications for those who use the other viewing methods. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:13, 2005 May 16 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Making such sweeping changes should perhaps have been discussed. On a more practical note, perhaps closed discussions should be moved manually to a "Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Deleted articles/{{PAGENAME}}" section, after deletion. Of course, that would only work for articles that are renominated once. /Once deleted, /Twice deleted etc might be better. And it wouldn't address the problem <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> brought up. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User%7EEc5618_0777.html" title="User:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 00:03, May 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, the date has to be substituted for it to work and so it wouldn't have worked. I didn't realize this. I'm not sure if this can be fixed, but I'll look into it, What four ways of viewing vfd are there? -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 12:23, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Let me explain the reasoning for the subpage day to day naming scheme. The reason why it was placed under /Log/&lt;insert date here&gt; was that in the event, however likely or unlikely it was, that the page <a href="../../../l/o/g/Log.html" title="Log">Log</a> was nominated for deletion.

<p>I remember being confused, the first time I came across this template, as to where one went to discuss and vote. Even today, "vote on and discuss" is separated from "See this page," which does not seem to follow standard Web interface, let alone proper wikipractice. I suggest we link the vote page to "vote on and discuss." This would have the additional benefit of tightening the text.</p>

<p>At the moment, there is a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_reform_5862.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion reform">discussion</a> going on about a reform of the VfD process. A part of this proposed reform is to have a separate deletion category for each day. I just realized that this is very easy to implement in the current system: change the <b>[[:Category:Pages on votes for deletion]]</b> in the VfD template to <b>[[Category:Pages on votes for deletion {{CURRENTYEAR}}-{{CURRENTMONTH}}-{{CURRENTDAY}}]]</b>. Would this be possible/useful? It will mean that the links to the VfD categories on the nominated articles will be redlinks, as the categories by date do not actually exist, but the only consequence of this is that the link to the category wil be red. Which is perhaps even an advantage.</p>
<p>I propose to make this change. It will mean that the single category <a href="../../../p/a/g/Category%7EPages_on_votes_for_deletion_21dc.html" title="Category:Pages on votes for deletion">Category:Pages on votes for deletion</a> would no longer be used. I cannot imagine anyone using this category at the moment: it's huge. But if you are, please let me know how.</p>
<p>I should point out that one of the reasons I'm proposing this change is that I want to show that these categories (e.g. Category:Pages on votes for deletion 2005-08-3) would not be a satisfactory replacement for the currect daily VfD pages (such as <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Log_2005_August_3_b615.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 August 3">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 August 3</a>). <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugene van der Pijll</a> 22:11, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a nice idea, but unfeasible. Doing this would cause the category to just become the current date each time the page was viewed/edited (not sure which).

<dd>Option two: just put todays date in this template, and update it each day. Probably should be done by a bot.

<p>About a third of the entries on VfD contain no encyclopedic content, but would make good redirects. VfD explicitly encourages you to do redirection instead of VfD, but that seems to be unfashionable. The best way to deal with some of these is to simply make them redirects, instead of having an administrator spend time deleting. But the wording of the template encourages evey possible improving edit, except this one. Therefore <b>I propose to remove the word <i>merge</i> from the template.</b></p>
<p>It would be possible to add; <i>Merges and redirects should be noted on the VfD page</i> or something of the sort. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 02:10, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If the page is merged or redirected, won't the link on VfD automatically fall through to the object of the redirect, which is not the page being discussed for deletion? Talk about confusing!!! <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A West</a> 17:36, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Two possibilities:
<ol>
<li>Make the redirect, but <b>leave the VfD notice</b>. The redirect will not work until the {vfd} tag is removed, but that's a trivial part of closing. This would answer the concerns about vandalism of the notice which inspired the present wording. (see above).
<ul>
<li>As I understood the archived discussion, there was clear consensus: any action that removes the page content (i.e. blanking or redirect or the redirect following merge) is <i>ipso facto</i> vandalism.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A West</a> 19:07, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make into full redirect and remove the tag, but post a link to the <b>preceeding version</b> of the srticle on the VfD discussion page.
<ul>
<li>And if someone wants to improve the original article, we now have "two versions" on top of a VfD. That will streamline everything! <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A West</a> 19:02, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>Pick one, or permit both. I don't much care which, but VfD itself should be edited accordingly.<a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 18:20, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I pick neither. The proper remedy is to vote <b>speedy keep</b>, and explain that you volunteer to merge/redirect/whatever after the vote closes. Then watch the page and when the VfD tag comes off, be bold.

<dd>What Peter asked is what I came here to ask. There are three steps and three templates to be used in the deletion process. The first step is to place {{vfd}} on the article page. The second step is to place {{vfd2}} (plus the explanation etc.) on the article's VfD subpage. The third step is to place {{vfd3}} on that day's page on VfD.</dd>

<dd>The places to do the first two steps are easily accessed from the article. The third step can't be accessed directly from the template.

<dd>I was going to be bold and do it myself, but it seems from the talk page that the aim is to keep the template as empty as possible. Is that a fair assessment? I think the link could still be added without cluttering up the template (perhaps linking part of "on the Votes for Deletion page"?) However I'd be happier hearing from someone with more knowledge of the history of the template, rather than just rushing in and making the changes myself. I may yet summon up the courage to be bold in the next few days though! <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithD_2f0d.html" title="User:KeithD">KeithD</a> <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithD_fbd8.html" title="User talk:KeithD">(talk)</a> 15:38, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
