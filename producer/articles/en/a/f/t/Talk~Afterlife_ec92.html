<dd>I think they're distinct topics. 'Afterlife' should address what happens to an individual when they die, if anything. 'Eschatology' should describe what a religion thinks will happen at or near the end of time, or the end of the current age. I think it means study of last things. Sure there may be some overlap, but there needn't be that much. --<a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a></dd>

<dd>Wetman, it is indeed tiresome to read proofs. And even in a believer it can ignite <a href="../../../o/d/i/Odium_theologicum.html" title="Odium theologicum">Odium theologicum</a>. Citing proof texts to support a particular POV is fruitless. But making available facts is most fruitful. Of course I am interested in what a Buddhist or a Catholic believes about life and afterlife, but I am equally and simultaneously interested in getting some NPOV facts to help me ascertain whether it is just so much speculation, or whether it is a synthesis of real experiences. We do need evidences and factual proofs--not as lined up by partisans to shore up their theology, but as aids in sifting the ludicrous from the impressive. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawstom_bf47.html" title="User:Hawstom">Tom (hawstom)</a> 18:02, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had a hard time myself feeling intuitive about <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatology.html" title="Eschatology">Eschatology</a> being used as a superset for <a href="../../../a/f/t/Afterlife.html" title="Afterlife">Afterlife</a>. But it is so described here, and apparently eschatologists do include afterlife within the purview of their studies. I do think we should not try to indicate that the connection is any more that a tenuous one. My core question is whether <a href="../../../a/f/t/Afterlife.html" title="Afterlife">Afterlife</a> is the right article under which to organize all such articles.

If this article can refer to <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underworld.html" title="Underworld">Underworld</a>, then this article can trim the specific religions and become more strictly an explanation of modern generic concepts of afterlife, its beliefs and skepticisms.

<p>The pink elephant that is being avoided here, perhaps out of diplomacy, is the immense body of tradition and testimony on the afterlife from all times, places, faiths, and cultures. In some article there ought to be a discussion, based of course on the scientific methods of good scholarship, on what the preponderance of evidence indicates regarding afterlife, eternity, or heaven. If necessary, the focus could be on more recent testimony, with comparison to ancient and recent traditions to round out a likely picture of an actual experience and realm that has been experienced and described repeatedly for millenia. On television tonight, I heard the outrageous statement from Bill Moyer that "we have no firsthand accounts of what death is like." Wikipedia should address that ostrich mindset, not as a matter of faith, but of science. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawstom_bf47.html" title="User:Hawstom">Hawstom</a> 07:08, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe that humanities believe in the afterlife is solely fed by hope, by believing that there is life beyond death, one can deal with it a whole lot better. For example: losing a loved one is a painful experience which is made less painful through the belief that one day you may see them again in the 'afterlife', the saying 'he/she is in a better place is often used when someone dies. Not only does a belief in an 'afterlife' make the death of a loved one easierr to cope with, it also helps us deal with our own death. The idea of there being a heaven and hell might also exist to make the afterlife seem more real, by associating it with a set of rules and regulations it also gives people a skeleton in which people can base how they live they life, without relegions which distinguish right from wrong, crime and immoral would occur alot more often as more people would believe that their acts will not affect them in the 'afterlife'.

<dd>I think there are two views of afterlife: either it is a DIFFERENT life as in heaven or hell, as in the western tradition, or it is another NORMAL life, as in the reincarnation. Those two views should be separated. Maybe the paragraph ordering is not right, but I think presenting both views separated is a good starting point for this article. I have not had too much time to research in this subject, but this is a colaborative project, so anyone can edit the page and add more information: go ahead and do it if you want. My recommendation is just to keep these two sub-topics separated. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChato_d41e.html" title="User:Chato">ChaTo</a> 27 Apr 2004.</dd>

<p>I got rid of much of this section, and put the relevant parts in other sections. It still reads like someone's blog, not an encyclopedia article. I think this article needs to be reworked, so that it systematically <i>describes</i> the concept of the afterlife as manifested in history, instead of arguing for and against it.

<p>The whole section <b>Related studies</b> is going, for three reasons related to the three small paragraphs (sentences) in it:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>In philosophy, the study of views of the afterlife is a concern of Eschatology, which deals with the soul, the resurrection of the dead, the messianic era, and the end of the world.</i> No, eschatology is studied as a separate field in no philosophy dept. of which I am aware, though it is often a topic in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_religion.html" title="Philosophy of religion">Philosophy of religion</a> as well as philosophical theology. This is simply inaccurate. Eschatology is the purview of theology depts., where it is accorded greater or lesser status depending on the type of theology taught there, which gets us far from the topic at hand. It could be changed to "In theology..." but the issue of religion is discussed elsewhere in the article, quite NPOV I might add, well done. Besides, strictly speaking the field of eschatology deals with what happens at the <i>end of history</i> (Christian second coming of Christ, Buddhism's Maitreya the Buddha of the Future, etc), while afterlife deals with what comes after death for <i>individual sentient subjects</i>. Yet another reason these statements are just wrong.</li>
<li><i>The question of whether there is life after death is closely related to the mind-body problem, and like that problem is one of the classic problems of so-called rational psychology and hence of one (now largely outdated) notion of the scope of metaphysics.</i> The first part of this is right, but the mind-body issue comes up elsewhere in the article. The second half of the sentence, besides being a grammatical monster, points us toward a non-existant link, and the issue of an afterlife isn't really something psychologists today deal with much (as my wife the therapist reminds me). Also, the statement about metaphysics is garbled; what is outdated, metaphysics <i>qua</i> metaphysics (really? My dept. hadn't heard that), or considering the afterlife within the field of metaphysics? Again, simply untrue (even avowadly non-theistic philosophers often use considerations of an afterlife as a thought experiment, or as the object of <i>why</i> they aren't theistic in the first place, see Anthony Flew for a great and well-respected example). So this whole part here is a mess.</li>
<li><i>The later works of Emanuel Swedenborg present one of the most comprehensive and systematic descriptions of the spiritual world, including heaven and hell.</i> This is 100% accurate - and 100% irrelevant to the article. Yes, Swedenborg does offer these theories, as do virtually all other theologically-incined philosophers and religious leaders. So why mention only Swedenborg? No, I'm afraid that however much we like him, we can't just hold up Swedenborg's thoughts on this (which, I notice, were not detailed here) to the exclusion of others.</li>
</ul>
<p>So all in all, the <b>Related studies</b> section fails the test of accuracy and relevance, so I am going to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a> and edit it out. Takes nothing away from an otherwise nice article. Yes, there are other studies, but this is not the way to list them. And listing them, I should think, would either play into the percieved Christian POV others see here (the mind-body problem is a particularly Western problem - thanks a lot, Descartes - and as such has an indelible stamp of Western religiosity on it, so I dont' see the POV, but whatever), or take the article too far from its main topic. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgaledth_ec02.html" title="User:Morgaledth">Morgaledth</a> 02:38, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In brief, there are several common concepts of a future life. In each of them either the person, or some essential component that defines that person (variously called the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a> or <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit.html" title="Spirit">spirit</a>) persists in continuing existence:</p>
<ul>
<li>People live on this earth, and then live in some kind of afterlife for the rest of eternity - variously called <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">heaven</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradise.html" title="Paradise">paradise</a>) or <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">hell</a>, or the Kingdom of the Dead, or some higher plane, or similar. They do not return to earth as such.</li>
<li>People die, but will return to the earth or are revived in some final <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day_of_Judgement_5fe7.html" title="Day of Judgement">Judgement</a>, or at some final battle (eg the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norse_mythology.html" title="Norse mythology">Norse</a> <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragnarok.html" title="Ragnarok">Ragnarok</a>). They may go to heaven or hell at that time, or live again and repopulate the earth. This is often called an <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalyptic.html" title="Apocalyptic">apocalyptic</a> vision of the future.</li>
<li>People die, and are returned to this or another existence continually, their form upon return being of a 'higher' or 'lower' kind depending upon the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtue.html" title="Virtue">virtue</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral.html" title="Moral">moral</a> quality) of their present life. This is often called <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmigration.html" title="Transmigration">Transmigration</a>.</li>
<li>People die, go through <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plane_%28cosmology%29.html" title="Plane (cosmology)">inner planes</a> and return, rebirth, (usually or often) as new human beings. Strictly, it is this which is known as <b>reincarnation</b> (also called "rebirth"). In many versions, eventually there is the potential to escape the cycle, e.g. by joining <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment_%28concept%29.html" title="Enlightenment (concept)">enlightenment</a>, some kind of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-realization.html" title="Self-realization">self-realization</a>, a <a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_again.html" title="Born again">spiritual rebirth</a>, entering a spiritual realm, etc. (There is some confusion, in general society, between reincarnation and transmigration; see below for comparison)</li>

<p>I can't find a page anywhere that recounts the history of views about the afterlife as they have changed over time. This page seems like the right place. Other pages (Heaven, Christian Eschatology, etc.) are too narrow in scope for a treatment of afterlife beliefs over millennia and across continents.

<p>If science were to prove that the Afterlife existed. What would be the consequence to humanity? Would violence skyrocket? Would suicide and abortion rates increase? How would it help or possibly discredit religion and the existence of God?</p>
<p>Input from Paladin_Hammer on the questions propsed: Nothing would really change with the common person. Think of the publics response to scientific theories/proof in the past 100 years. No theory, or piece of evidence, has ever been given close attention until its use has been proven usefull/harmfull. Think of atoms. For hundreds of years scientist said they existed, yet it wasn't until the hiroshima bomb was dropped or the public knew about it that any ever gave the atom serious thought. So unless scientist found "heaven" or could really "speak to the dead", or had an available use for this research, no one would care.</p>

<p>"Some conceptions of the afterlife are not overtly religious. Certain scientific fields developed in the 20th and 21st centuries, that were previously either unknown or purely theoretical, support interesting speculation and questions regarding the afterlife.</p>
<p>Is consciousness a sole result of the specific configuration of matter of a living brain, or do some forms of consciousness or experience remain present in the matter and energy that used to be a living brain? If the latter is true, even in part, then it is not certain that the subjective experience of a being's consciousness ends at the time of death, which could be interpreted as a form of afterlife."</p>
<p>Many theories actuallt closely tie into this idea. I'm new so I can't exactly link it yet, but the "Conscious Matter" thoery supports this idea. Also, modern cognitive science isn't limiting itself to Newtonian Mechanics in its search for the questions regarding consciousness as Beland suggests, one theory suggests that the brain itself doesn't give rise to consciousness, rather that the EEG's of the brain do! (link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_theories_of_consciousness" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_theories_of_consciousness" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_theories_of_consciousness</a> )Orch-Or rely's on small self-assembling protiens called "microtubules". Here is one that exactly states that conscoiusness is rooted in elementary particles! (link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind#Conscious_matter" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind#Conscious_matter" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind#Conscious_matter</a> )</p>
<p>Thus, to claim that there is not a scientific idea of a sort of 'afterlife' is false. While some of these theories may not be the afterlife in the classical sense (i.e. soul karma, heaven/hell, ghosts), they non-the-less leave us pondering. So it'sm only fair that we state that their are scientific ideas of an afterlife experince.</p>
<p>"These claims do however, lead interesting theories regarding consciousness, and possibly, an afterlife." I added this because when looking into the many theories that have been purposed regarding the possibilty of an "afterlife", it seems that the scientific community is really divided on it. Some appear to maintain that "it cannot possibly be real", while others seem more interested in the "what if-" ideas. I'm going to edit this in the future. Please don't edit until I've figured out the "linking" system here on wikipedia.</p>

<p>Can I congratulate you on using BC. May I point out that the modern 4 yearly leap year calendar was introduced on 26th Februay 1BC, (whilst jesus was probably born 4BC). BC is a very convenient term for "before calendar" and indicates that dates are open to dispute simply because the calendar was changeable. AS for B.C.E. I'm not sure why anyone would prefer "before christian era" with "before christ". But most of all - please keep BC, I regularly read articles with BCE/CE and for example I have occaisionally confused dates such as "48CE" with "4BCE". <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 16:14, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
