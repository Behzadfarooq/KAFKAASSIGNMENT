<p>This article needs some cleaning. There seems to be a chunk missing here: "Veteran rapper Rakim signed with the label Legal troubles forced Truth Hurts to leave the label, and Rakim's highly anticipated comeback album, shelved due to production conflict, also forced his departure."</p>
<p>I didn't change it because I'm not sure whats supposed to go there. Also, Rakim is mentioned twice as formerly being in Aftermath</p>

<p>It should be noted that while Aftermath "shares" *some* of its artists with Shady and G-Unit Records -- neither of those imprints operate exclusively through it. They are divisions of Interscope Records, proper, and some of their relases do not not go through Aftermath (ex: D12).</p>
<p>Listen, Raekwon is <b>officially signed to Aftermath Entertainment</b>. This has been confirmed by aftermathmusic.com, sohh.com, and hiphopgame.com, and xxlmag.com. These are all reliable sources. Don't delete his name from the Aftermath roster. He is signed, just as much as G.A.G.E and Ortiz!</p>
<dl>
<dd>If this is true why is Shady Records artists on this page and not G-Unit because Shady is part of the Aftermath family. Throwd Off Click out of Houston should be looked at by one of these great record labels. These young men can be a great investment to some one.</dd>

<p>Keep all opinions and all other uncomfirmed statements toward 50 Cent, The Game, The Black Wall Street, G-Unit, Shady Records and as well as Aftermath Entertainment to the talk page. These opinions and bad grammar mistakes make the article look bad and not resourcable. As far as I concerned, I still see Shyne is still on Def Jam, Charlie Baltimore is still a part of Murder Inc, G-Unit is under Aftermath Entertainment, and your facts are not to be added unless you find the right source such as Aftermath Music, AllHipHop, SOHH, Aftermath Entertainment, MTV, BET, etc....

<p>Black Wall Street is not distributed through either Interscope or Aftermath. They dont even have a distribution deal. Furthurmore, Shady Records and G-Unit Records are not distributed through Aftermath. Not to mention that all of these labels have their own pages with the same roster information. Linking to thse labels would be appropriate but to list all of these artists as if they were part of Aftermath Entertainment is ridiculous. A list of former artists is also a nessecisity to provide a history of the label.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I got another question about the Aftermath/Interscope setup. The way it is, is Aftermath just for show and Eminem and Dre are essentially signed to Interscope, or is there a difference between "owned by Interscope" and "distributed through Interscope"? I'm curious because there was a similar setup with Roc-a-Fella/Def Jam but Def Jam eventually bought Roc, leading me to believe there might be some difference. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">Stoned Trey</a> 07:33, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mike Elizondo doesn't have anything to do with G. Malone, besides some degrees of seperation through The Game. You must be thinking of someone else. Mike Elizondo recently confirmed that he and Dre were in the process of recording Detox. I'm readding him to the producers list. But changing the brief bio, because it was poorly written.</p>
<p>Also, I strongly disagree with these people saying Aftermath Entertainment is a "vanity label." People claiming that it's "just for show" for Eminem and Dr. Dre are mistaking. Aftermath is to Interscope what Death Row was to Interscope. Dr. Dre started the label with a handful of artists, before he even heard of Eminem. Jimmy Iovine has a lot of say in the company, because he runs the parent label. But Aftermath is a seperate entity. There is also a group in Houston Texas called T.O.C a.k.a Throwd Off Click that needs to be picked up by one of these great labels www.ghetorancho.com. They are free agents they have no manger</p>

<p>I don't get it. How can 50 and Game be still signed to the same label, still be produced by the same producers, and still be beefing? Either the entire G-Unot movement and the whole 50-against-the-world shtick is a massive wool over our eyes, or hell, I don't know.

<dd>They are beefing and they are the same label. It's not that complicated a situation to understand.

<p>We can't assume that these albums will come out on the day. Busta Rhymes, The Game, Stat Quo and others are slated to be released in 2006. But if there are any changes to the album date, the internet will provide that. The Big Bang is slated to come out in May. So therefore, The Game's album The Doctor's Advocate is slated to come out on June 6, 2006. That depends on the situation with Busta Rhymes album. I highly doubt the album will be released on that day. People can't assume that these albums come out on the day. The (Game's) debut album was pushed back four times before it's release in 2005. It prevented any oversight between Eminem and 50 Cent's releases.</p>
<p>There are a lot of rumors going around that Bone Thugs N Harmony has signed with Aftermath &amp; Interscope Records. THIS IS NOT TRUE, and that's straight from manager of the group, Steve Lobel.</p>
<p>The BG has signed to Atlantic Records. This is also squashes the so-called G-Unit South issue. G-Unit West, G-Unit Soul, and other so-called G-Unit vanity labels. Just petty rumors.</p>
<p>Mobb Deep are semi-affliated with Aftermath. But they are not signed to the label. Only G-Unit.</p>
<p>Bone Thugs N Harmony is not signed to Aftermath.</p>

<p>Seems like certain members are too quick to assume external links added by Wiki users are commercial advertising. Here is my message in response to Dan:</p>
<p>Hey Dan, please do not remove links to my Game resource sites. The pictures contained within the gallery and the content on the site such as lyrics are beneficial to users interested in the Game and this is not advertising but serving the purpose of leading users to other resources where they can find more information along with other content that would not be presented in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It's frustrating having to undo changes when I check to see the links once again removed.</p>
<p>Cheers, Tony</p>
<p>Hope others can understand and refrain from repeatedly removing the links I add.</p>
<p>EDIT: apologies Dan, it's the Aftermath links I'm referring too, not 'The Game' links I mentioned. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.139.48.88 (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.139.48.88.html" title="User talk:86.139.48.88">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.139.48.88_a49f.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.139.48.88">contribs</a>) 22:51, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I understand that they can be seen as spam but that is your perception and I am adding the links as it is proven that these are of great help to wiki users and I've come to realize that the majority of Wiki editors will not accept that sites other then those that are official can be helpful. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.137.170.55 (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.137.170.55.html" title="User talk:86.137.170.55">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.137.170.55_eae0.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.137.170.55">contribs</a>) 15:11, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><b>Note:</b> This discussion has become circular. Unless new points are raised or comments are added by other parties, I will not add anything further, and will treat further link insertions as simple vandalism (spamming). --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:39, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What happened to innocent till proven guilty? The links are helpful to many visitors (who have personally told me) so that is clear evidence that you are wrongly removing the links which are far from spam (I do not sell any products, the only text advert links present do not cover hosting costs so I do not make money from it). I'm here to help people, you seem to be doing the opposite. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.139.51.186 (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.139.51.186.html" title="User talk:86.139.51.186">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.139.51.186_d4cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.139.51.186">contribs</a>) 17:38, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
