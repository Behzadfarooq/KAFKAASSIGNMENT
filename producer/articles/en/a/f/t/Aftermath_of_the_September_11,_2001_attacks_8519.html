<p>This article talks about the <b>aftermath of the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>.</b></p>
<p>The attacks defined the first term of President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> and led to what he has called the <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Terrorism_c7b1.html" title="War on Terrorism">War on Terrorism</a></i>, or war against terrorism. The accuracy of describing it as a "war" and the political motivations and consequences are the topic of strenuous debate. The U.S. government increased military operations, economic measures and political pressure on groups it accused of being terrorists, as well as on governments and countries accused of sheltering them. October 2001 saw the first military action initiated by the U.S. Under this policy, the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._invasion_of_Afghanistan_dfd5.html" title="U.S. invasion of Afghanistan">U.S. invaded Afghanistan</a> in order to remove the oppresive <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a> regime (which harboured <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a>) and to capture <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> forces. The invasion was supported by a large number of countries. Prior to the invasion, the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a> had refused to hand over bin Laden without being shown evidence of his connection to the attacks. While the primary objective of capturing bin Laden has failed so far, the invasion did succeed in uprooting the extremely oppresive Taliban from power, enabling the implementation of a government cooperative and supportive in the search for bin Laden and the general "War on Terrorism". The U.S. government has also asserted that the U.S. invasion of Iraq is connected to 9/11. For example, President Bush said "The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terrorism that began on September the 11, 2001..." <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/05/20030501-15.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/05/20030501-15.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and Vice President Dick Cheney suggested that Iraq was involved in the September 11 attack during a "Meet the Press" interview: Iraq is "the geographic base of the terrorists who had us under assault now for many years, but most especially on 9-11" (Knight-Ridder October 3, 2003, archived at <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1003-08.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1003-08.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). Also, the U.S. government has continued to maintain that the war on Iraq is critical to the American "War on Terrorism". "In the war on terrorism, Iraq is now the central front..." said President Bush on December 14, 2005 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051214-1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051214-1.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Because the attacks on the United States were judged to be within the parameters of the North Atlantic Treaty Orginazation, <a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_bffc.html" title="NATO">NATO</a> declared section 5 of the military alliance to be met, making the US war on terror the first time since its inception that NATO would actually participate in a "hot" war.</p>

<p>The September 11 attacks also precipitated a focus on domestic security issues and the creation of a new cabinet-level federal agency, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security_be2d.html" title="United States Department of Homeland Security">Department of Homeland Security</a>. The <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act_9b8d.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act">USA PATRIOT Act</a> of 2001 was passed soon after the attacks, giving law enforcement agencies sweeping search and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surveillance.html" title="Surveillance">surveillance</a> powers over U.S citizens. This led to the creation in 2002 of the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_Awareness_Office_1d83.html" title="Information Awareness Office">Information Awareness Office</a> (IAO), led by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Poindexter_9680.html" title="John Poindexter">John Poindexter</a>. The IAO has initiated a program called Total Information Awareness, amended in May 2003 to Terrorist Information Awareness (TIA), with the aim of developing technology that would enable it to collect and process massive amounts of information about every individual in the United States, and trace patterns of behavior that could help predict terrorist activities. The information the IAO would gather includes <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> activity, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_card.html" title="Credit card">credit card</a> purchase histories, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline.html" title="Airline">airline</a> ticket purchases, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">car</a> rentals, medical records, <a href="../../../e/d/u/Educational.html" title="Educational">educational</a> transcripts, driver's licenses, utility bills, <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">tax</a> returns, and other available data. Critics of the IAO believe it goes too far in the sacrifice of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_liberties.html" title="Civil liberties">civil liberties</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privacy.html" title="Privacy">privacy</a>, putting in place an <a href="../../../o/r/w/Orwellian.html" title="Orwellian">Orwellian</a> infrastructure prone to abuse. Many major events the United States has hosted since September 11, 2001 have been designated <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Special_Security_Event_f921.html" title="National Special Security Event">National Special Security Events</a> (NSSE), because of concerns of terrorism. <a href="../../../m/p/d/MPDC_8432.html" title="MPDC">MPDC</a> Chief <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Ramsey_ceaf.html" title="Charles Ramsey">Charles Ramsey</a> made the point clear before the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Ronald_Reagan_3ce7.html" title="Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan">state funeral of former U.S. president Ronald Reagan</a>: "In a post 9/11 world we have to be very concerned about that and aware of the potential for something to happen."</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the United States and other countries around the world were placed on a high state of alert against potential follow-up attacks. Civilian air travel across the U.S. and Canada was — for the first time ever — almost completely suspended for three days (as part of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Yellow_Ribbon_9c0c.html" title="Operation Yellow Ribbon">Operation Yellow Ribbon</a>), with numerous locations and events affected by <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closings_and_cancellations_following_the_September_11%2C_2001_attacks_d20a.html" title="Closings and cancellations following the September 11, 2001 attacks">closures, postponements, cancellations, and evacuations</a>. Other countries imposed similar security restrictions. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, for instance, civilian aircraft were forbidden to fly over <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> for several days after the attacks.</p>

<p>The attacks had major <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_political_effects_arising_from_the_September_11%2C_2001_attacks_baa4.html" title="World political effects arising from the September 11, 2001 attacks">world-wide political effects</a>. Many other countries introduced tough anti-terrorism legislation and took action to cut off terrorist finances, including the freezing of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_account.html" title="Bank account">bank accounts</a> suspected of being used to fund terrorism. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies stepped up cooperation to arrest terrorist suspects and break up suspected terrorist cells around the world.</p>
<p>The attack prompted numerous <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attack_memorials_and_services.html" title="September 11, 2001 attack memorials and services">memorials and services</a> all over the world. In <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, 200,000 <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germans</a> marched to show their solidarity with America.

In the immediate aftermath, support for the United States' right to defend itself was expressed across the world, and by <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_Security_Council_53d3.html" title="UN Security Council">Security Council</a> Resolution 1368 <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/io/rls/othr/2001/4899.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/p/io/rls/othr/2001/4899.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Reaction to the attacks in the Muslim world was mixed. The great majority of Muslim political and religious leaders condemned the attacks — virtually the only significant exception was <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, then president of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>.

<p>Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, George W. Bush's job approval rating soared to 86% <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">September 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, the president spoke before a the nation and a joint-session of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">Congress</a>, regarding the events of that day, the intervening nine days of rescue and recovery efforts, and his intent in response to those events. In the speech, he characterized the speech itself as being akin to the President's customary State of the Union address.</p>
<p>The attacks also had immediate and overwhelming effects upon the United States population. People began rallying around the popularized phrase, "United We Stand," in hopes of being resilient and keeping the American spirit alive in the face of a devastating attack. Many people joined together to help the victims. Gratitude toward uniformed public-safety workers, and especially toward firefighters, was widely expressed in light of both the drama of the risks taken on the scene and the high death toll among the workers. Many people paid tribute to the police officers and fire fighters by wearing NYPD and FDNY hats. The number of casualties among the emergency service personnel was unprecedented. The highly visible role played by <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudy_Giuliani_d5f0.html" title="Rudy Giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, the Mayor of New York City, won him high praise nationally and in New York City. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> He was named <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person_of_the_Year_e4e7.html" title="Person of the Year">Person of the Year</a> by <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/TIME_346f.html" title="TIME">Time</a></i> magazine for 2001, and at times had a higher profile in the U.S. than President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>.</p>
<p>New York City bore the brunt of the attacks. Blood donations saw a surge in the weeks after 9/11. According to a report by the <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_the_American_Medical_Association_e204.html" title="Journal of the American Medical Association">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>, "...the number of blood donations in the weeks after the September 11, 2001, attacks was markedly greater than in the corresponding weeks of 2000 (2.5 times greater in the first week after the attacks; 1.3–1.4 times greater in the second to fourth weeks after the attack)."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Kennel_Club_Dog_Show_cfcc.html" title="Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show">Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show</a> that took place in February 2002, a touching tribute was paid to the search and rescue dogs who not only assisted in locating survivors and bodies from the rubble, but were also inside the World Trade Center buildings before they collapsed.</p>
<p>Other major public reactions to the attacks were a surge in <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingoism.html" title="Jingoism">jingoism</a> and flag-waving not seen since World War II, and an unprecedented level of respect, sympathy, and admiration for New York City and New Yorkers as a group by Americans from other parts of the U.S. Some criticized this particular reaction, noting that not everyone who died was from New York (for example, some of the passengers on the planes), and that the <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington%2C_Virginia_fc7c.html" title="Arlington, Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a> community also suffered in the attacks. This focus on New York led to the attack on the Pentagon being colloquially referred to as "the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_The_Brady_Bunch_9293.html#Jan_Brady" title="Characters of The Brady Bunch">Jan Brady</a> of 9/11".</p>
<p>There were some incidents of harassment and hate crimes against Middle Easterners and other, "Middle Eastern-looking" people, particularly <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhs.html" title="Sikhs">Sikhs</a>, due to the fact that Sikh males usually wear <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbans.html" title="Turbans">turbans</a>, stereotypically associated with Muslims in the United States. A total of nine people were murdered within the United States as part of retaliation. <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balbir_Singh_Sodhi_bd78.html" title="Balbir Singh Sodhi">Balbir Singh Sodhi</a>, one of the first victims of this <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backlash.html" title="Backlash">backlash</a>, was shot dead on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a>. He, like others, was a <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikh</a> who was mistaken for a Muslim.</p>

<p>The attacks had significant economic repercussions for the United States and world markets. The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Stock_Exchange_a4c5.html" title="New York Stock Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a>, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Stock_Exchange_3c97.html" title="American Stock Exchange">American Stock Exchange</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASDAQ_7dfd.html" title="NASDAQ">NASDAQ</a> did not open on September 11 and remained closed until <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_17.html" title="September 17">September 17</a>. New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) facilities and remote data processing sites were not damaged by the attack, but member firms, customers and markets were unable to communicate due to major damage to the telephone exchange facility near the World Trade Center. When the stock markets reopened on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_17.html" title="September 17">September 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, after the longest closure since the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, the <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average_ca80.html" title="Dow Jones Industrial Average">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> (“DJIA”) stock market index fell 684 points, or 7.1%, to 8920, its biggest-ever one-day point decline. By the end of the week, the DJIA had fallen 1369.7 points (14.3%), its largest one-week point drop in history. U.S. stocks lost $1.2 trillion in value for the week.</p>
<p>The attacks led to decreased travel, and <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">as of 2006</a>, the U.S. <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline.html" title="Airline">airline</a> industry has not fully recovered.</p>

<p>The pulverized concrete which filled the streets with voluminous dust has led through time to serious lung and cardiovascular disorders. These are covered in a recent article, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/13/nyregion/13symptoms.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/13/nyregion/13symptoms.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" rel="nofollow">Tracing Lung Ailments That Rose With 9/11 Dust, May 13, 2006.</a> Although at the time of the tower collapses the EPA advised that there was no danger from air contamination, it has subsequently come to light that toxic fumes were very much in evidence. In February 2006, under pressure from New York's congressional delegation, the Bush administration appointed Dr. John Howard, the director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), to coordinate the screening and treatment of the rescue personnel who were exposed to toxic fumes at Ground Zero.<a href="http://www.911ea.org/Front_Page.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.911ea.org/Front_Page.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<p>The attack on the World Trade Center led to huge insurance claims, with many insurance companies throughout the world having to disclose the impact of the attack in their <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financial_statements.html" title="Financial statements">financial statements</a>.

The insurers, Swiss Reinsurance Co. and others, initially argued successfully that the attacks in New York were one incident and that Silverstein was only entitled to $3.5 billion. In <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2004.html" title="December 2004">December 2004</a>, a federal jury decided that the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center was, for insurance purposes, two occurrences, which means that Silverstein stands to collect up to $4.6 billion. <a href="http://dir.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/09/01/rich_stevens/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dir.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/09/01/rich_stevens/index.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<p>The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the "9/11 Commission") investigated these rumors and found that although some unusual (and initially seemingly suspicious) trading activity did occur in the days prior to September 11, it was all coincidentally innocuous and not the result of insider trading by parties with foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks:</p>
<p>Highly publicized allegations of insider trading in advance of 9/11 generally rest on reports of unusual pre-9/11 trading activity in companies whose stock plummeted after the attacks. Some unusual trading did in fact occur, but each such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation. For example, the volume of put options — instruments that pay off only when a stock drops in price — surged in the parent companies of United Airlines on September 6 and American Airlines on September 10 — highly suspicious trading on its face. Yet, further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11. A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, which recommended these trades. The SEC and FBI, aided by other agencies and the securities industry, devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue, including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments. These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous.</p>

It took weeks simply to put out the fires burning in the rubble of the WTC, and the clean-up was not completed until May 2002. Many relief funds were immediately set up to assist victims of the attacks. The task of providing <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financial_assistance_following_the_September_11%2C_2001_attacks_0e07.html" title="Financial assistance following the September 11, 2001 attacks">financial assistance</a> to the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivors_of_the_September_11%2C_2001_attacks_e0a6.html" title="Survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks">survivors</a> and the families of victims is still ongoing.</p>
<p>A small number of survivors and surprisingly few intact victims' remains were found in the rubble of the WTC. The forces unleashed by the towers' disintegration were so great that many of those trapped in the buildings were pulverized in the collapse. Some victims had to be identified by a few scraps of flesh or individual teeth. Most bodies were never found, presumably because the heat of the fires incinerated them. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_18.html" title="January 18">January 18</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, the last hospitalized survivor of the World Trade Center attack was released from the hospital.

<p>Over 1.5 million tons of debris produced by the collapse of the WTC posed unique problems for the cleanup effort. A fully occupied skyscraper had never collapsed before, and the environmental and health consequences of such an event were unknown. About 100 tons of <a href="../../../a/s/b/Asbestos.html" title="Asbestos">asbestos</a> used in the construction of the WTC had not yet been fully removed <a href="http://asbnyc.cjb.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://asbnyc.cjb.net/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. The attacks released dense clouds of dust containing pulverized cement, glass fibers, asbestos, and other airborne contaminants.</p>
<p>By 2004, nearly half of more than 1,000 screened rescue-and-recovery workers and volunteers reported new and persistent respiratory problems, and more than half reported persistent psychological symptoms. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r040909.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r040909.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> Because of the long latency period between exposure and development of asbestos-related diseases, exposed <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> residents, especially rescue-and-recovery workers, may suffer future adverse health effects.

<p>The attacks were regarded by some as particularly disturbing to children, in part because of the frequency with which the images were replayed on television. Many schools closed early, especially those with children whose parents worked in Washington, D.C. and NYC.
