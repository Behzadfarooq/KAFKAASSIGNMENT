<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pageant pages</span></h2>
<p>Hi Brian&#160;:) Just a note as well as a welcome - it's neat to see someone else putting some effort (and thought) into pageant pages. No big deal about the Miss USA template... one thing that's good about wikipedia is that people will always keep an eye on pages that interest them and collaborating as a group we can all help to improve things.</p>
<p>I was thinking about starting a <a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWikiproject_8329.html" title="WP:Wikiproject">wikiproject</a> dedicated to improving pageant-related articles, as there are a few others on here (<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Thivierr</a> (who goes by the name of Rob) and <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoey80_5d25.html" title="User:Joey80">Joey80</a> being two I have had good dealings with in the past (as well as the ever-helpful <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a>)). If you might be interested in joining such a project you can check out the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_List_of_proposed_projects_4bea.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject/List of proposed projects">List of proposed projects</a>, and if you would like more information (or if you ever need help) feel free to <a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater">leave me a message</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WP Conventions</span></h2>
<p>Hello and thanks for the welcome message! Also, a quick question. I'm doing a little housecleaning and am too new to know your/the community's preferences. If I see a name to clarify, I don't know if it is best to create a redirect or to use a piped link. Example: for Eurlyne/Arlene Howell, I think I actually did both. Now I have noticed that Erica Marie Commeau (Miss Maine USA 2005) has a page without her middle name, but don't know if it is better to pipe or create a redirect. I would appreciate some direction. Thanks!!!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Brian... when it comes to full names (as in the example above) its probably best just to get rid of the middle name (this can get tricky in pageantry where names are often used in full where they are not used in full in common usage). As for Erica Commeau... that was probably my fault! What you did with Eurlyne/Arlene Howell was perfect -- just what I would have done had I picked up on it. There's no hard and fast rule but I'd say that if you can prevent a redirect by piping... go for it (or simply by chopping out the middle name as suggested).</dd>
<dd>Finally, one other thing, don't forget to sign off with four tildes (~~~~) when you reply on talk pages so your name and the date are stamped&#160;:) -- <font color="red">P</font><font color="#FF7518">a</font><font color="#FFBF00">g</font><a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><font color="blue">a</font><font color="indigo">n</font><font color="#8B00FF">t</font><font color="#8B00FF">U</font><font color="indigo">p</font><font color="blue">d</font><font color="green">a</font><font color="#FFBF00">t</font><font color="#FF7518">e</font><font color="red">r</font> 02:14, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Redirects</span></h2>
<p>I have copied the below from Wikipedia:Help_desk and was hoping to get some additional help here.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello, I have a few questions about redirects. These can be best represented by these 2 examples which I can then extrapolate to similar circumstances.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For the redirect page from <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Brack_b0f1.html" title="Kenny Brack">Kenny Brack</a> to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Br%C3%A4ck_1e86.html" title="Kenny Bräck">Kenny Bräck</a>, is it appropriate for me to add {{R from title without diacritics}} and also to update pages which currently use this link to point directly to the redirect target?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For the redirect page from <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Hornish_Jr._2bc8.html" title="Sam Hornish Jr.">Sam Hornish Jr.</a> to <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Hornish%2C_Jr._6da9.html" title="Sam Hornish, Jr.">Sam Hornish, Jr.</a>, I have the same basic question, but I do not know the correct redirect template to use. Is it appropriate for me to add one at your suggestion and also to update pages which currently use this link to point directly to the redirect target?</dd>

<dd>I think all of your questions are answered at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">Wikipedia:Redirect</a>. The short version is: yes, no, <a href="../../../r/_/f/Template%7ER_from_alternate_spelling_b1a4.html" title="Template:R from alternate spelling">R from alternate spelling</a>, and no. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 04:27, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK. So, I looked at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">Wikipedia:Redirect</a> and it seems to imply that pages should not be updated unless they are <a href="../../../u/n/p/Category%7EUnprintworthy_redirects_8f15.html" title="Category:Unprintworthy redirects">unprintworthy redirects</a>, but if I am seeing correctly, both <a href="../../../r/_/f/Template%7ER_from_title_without_diacritics_10ca.html" title="Template:R from title without diacritics">R from title without diacritics</a> and <a href="../../../r/_/f/Template%7ER_from_alternate_spelling_b1a4.html" title="Template:R from alternate spelling">R from alternate spelling</a> are unprintworthy and on the template page for R from title without diacritics, it says "Other pages using this link should be updated to replace text with the redirect target ". Could you please clarify?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Generally, you should not fix links to redirects unless their they are to a misspelling or other unprintworthy redirect. This means, for example, you should fix a link to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsfot.html" title="Microsfot">Microsfot</a>, but not one to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Corporation_a5fa.html" title="Microsoft Corporation">Microsoft Corporation</a> (both redirect to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>). - <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETangotango_2487.html" title="User:Tangotango">Tangot</a><font color="green">a</font><a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETangotango_e3e5.html" title="User talk:Tangotango">ngo</a> 14:21, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just wanted to say you're doing a great job adding all the IRL articles that I've been too lazy to get to. I created the category IRL drivers and started populating it and at the time only maybe 40-50 driver articles existed. Later I created all the IRL season articles for seasons 1996-2003. I find it amazing that wikipedia is coming close to having a nearly complete guide to IRL history considering that less than a year ago it was a disorganized smattering of articles. -<a href="../../../d/r/d/User%7EDrdisque_8d32.html" title="User:Drdisque">Drdisque</a> 05:57, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for saying Hi. Your note motivated me to create a user page for myself to show some of my history. I've noticed that you often find an article that I have created soon afterwards and make some edits on it. I am curious, how do you know it is there? Do you have a method for knowing when an article gets created or do you just know your pages so well that you can spot when a link changes from Red to Blue? I do have several that I've created that you haven't edited, perhaps because you haven't seen them, or perhaps because you had nothing to add, but I do keep track of all of them, so if you want a list, just let me know.--<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> 19:51, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All of the IRL seasons are in my watchlist and as you go back in time through them you commonly edit them. When you do I know you've been editting and check your contributions list to see what else you've been up to. I have seen every article in Category:IRL drivers, including all your new ones. The ones I haven't editted are ones where I don't have anything to add, usually because I don't know what the guy is up to these days. -<a href="../../../d/r/d/User%7EDrdisque_8d32.html" title="User:Drdisque">Drdisque</a> 03:34, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Brian, thanks for giving me a heads up on WP Fields. Since the speedy delete didn't go through, this time I nominated it for deletion using AfD, and you can view the voting page <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_WP_Fields_4c60.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WP Fields">here</a>. I'm not an administrator, so there's not much more I can do at this point. However, there is conclusive evidence that this article is a hoax, so I'm confident it will get deleted in a few days. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 17:43, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">On "co" label</span></h2>
<p>I agree with you, but I've known necessity in the modern racing world to explain the nature of the 500, wherein the car is winning entry, rather than, necessarily, the driver. If one starts and the other finishes the race, they would be co-winners...instead of just one or the other, and then edits coming in due to people thinking they know the "true winner, instead of this being incorrect," etc. A lot of that could be possible on wikipedia, at least so far as I've seen on several pages. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChr.K._7208.html" title="User:Chr.K.">Chr.K.</a> 06:05, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That context helps some, thanks. I thought that I had addressed it in the body of the article (if that stub I created can be called a body), but I can see how your note makes it more clear than I had done.

<p>I would find that constructive. On the whole, my methodology is to try to educate those who don't understand "classical" auto racing, i.e. open-wheel and sportscar, and how things have developed much the same way as the English distance system has, i.e. catch-as-catch-can...and to concentrate information, when in list form, for ease of use for some who want this or that kind of info in particular, even if it's being repeated in the same article. On the pole-winners of the Race for instance, there's the primary list of the winners themselves, but lower, there's a list of each year that there was a new one. All those little times people need to ask Donald whether this or that has happened, or how many new of "this and that" there have been, I for one would like to make a permanent list for perusal. Anyway...yes, it should probably be mentioned that Corum, Boyer, Davis and Rose are thus far the only co-winners of the event...and for that matter that Corum and Davis won without leading a lap, something that made it into the <i>Indianapolis 500 Chronicle</i> as a backstory piece. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChr.K._7208.html" title="User:Chr.K.">Chr.K.</a> 05:22, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: User talk page restore</span></h2>
<p>An excellent question. The page in question wasn't restored by an administrator; rather, it was re-created with the same template by the user. I'm not certain what the proper action is here. I actually think that user talk pages should <i>not</i> be deleted when users leave Wikipedia. You might contact the original deleting administrator to let him know the page has been restored and ask why it was deleted in the first place. In general, you should nominated user pages on <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_06ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion">Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion</a>, but in this case I'd probably check with the involved administrators for assistance. I don't feel strongly about it either way, which is why I haven't touched the page, but I don't know all the facts, either.

<p>I apologize; I was away from Wikipedia for a couple days. Good job on finding the copying-and-pasting—we always have to be vigilant for copyright violations. The copyright holder has two options. One, he may add a notice to the site of publication, releasing the contents under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. Or, (and it sounds like this will be preferable), he may send an e-mail to <i>permissions at wikimedia dot org</i> from the appropriate domain. To be honest, I am not certain what happens next, but I assume that whoever handles that e-mail address would make a note on the talk page or something. If you don't hear from them in a few days, perhaps you could try e-mailing them yourself. See the third paragraph of <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> for more information (well, actually, there isn't really any more information there, but it's where you can confirm what I'm telling you).

<p>Hello, taking a look at the article in question I would say that the image is not being used in a manner that's fair use, because the image isn't being used to illustrate discussion about the album itself.</p>
<p>To get rid of the image, just remove the image from the article, leaving a descriptive edit summary (e.g. "Removing image that is not fair use in this context"). If people object (which they usually don't), discuss the removal on the talk page and/or the discussion page for <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>.</p>

<p>Hi Brian! Thanks for your message, thats fantastic news! I've just approved you for the new VP v1.3 which is not yet out but we are giving selected users the beta download. If you'd like to try simply download these 3 files; <a href="https://freepository.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?file=VandalProof%20130.exe&amp;rev=1.1&amp;cvsroot=/fp1/64sXQiWV5P0l2VandalProof&amp;where=VandalProof/VandalProof_130.exe" class="external autonumber" title="https://freepository.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?file=VandalProof%20130.exe&amp;rev=1.1&amp;cvsroot=/fp1/64sXQiWV5P0l2VandalProof&amp;where=VandalProof/VandalProof_130.exe" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> , <a href="https://freepository.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?file=RCPrefs.txt&amp;rev=1.1&amp;cvsroot=/fp1/64sXQiWV5P0l2VandalProof&amp;where=VandalProof/RCPrefs.txt" class="external autonumber" title="https://freepository.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?file=RCPrefs.txt&amp;rev=1.1&amp;cvsroot=/fp1/64sXQiWV5P0l2VandalProof&amp;where=VandalProof/RCPrefs.txt" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="https://freepository.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?file=Badwords.txt&amp;rev=1.1&amp;cvsroot=/fp1/64sXQiWV5P0l2VandalProof&amp;where=VandalProof/Badwords.txt" class="external autonumber" title="https://freepository.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?file=Badwords.txt&amp;rev=1.1&amp;cvsroot=/fp1/64sXQiWV5P0l2VandalProof&amp;where=VandalProof/Badwords.txt" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and place them in the folder you have your current version in. If you use firefox you may need to rename the first file and add <i>.exe</i> to the end as it cuts it off for some reason. Thanks again, and let me know what you think (it is a little different - but MUCH faster!)

<dd>Oops, my bad. Found the problem, the link is actually VandalProof 130.exe with a space rather than an underscore - problem is that wikipedia will automatically show that incorrectly due to the space so I inserted the underscore so the link didn't break. Hang on - try this; <b><a href="https://freepository.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?file=VandalProof%20130.exe&amp;rev=1.1&amp;cvsroot=/fp1/64sXQiWV5P0l2VandalProof&amp;where=VandalProof/VandalProof%20130.exe" class="external free" title="https://freepository.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?file=VandalProof%20130.exe&amp;rev=1.1&amp;cvsroot=/fp1/64sXQiWV5P0l2VandalProof&amp;where=VandalProof/VandalProof%20130.exe" rel="nofollow">https://freepository.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?file=VandalProof%20130.exe&amp;rev=1.1&amp;cvsroot=/fp1/64sXQiWV5P0l2VandalProof&amp;where=VandalProof/VandalProof%20130.exe</a></b> - hopefully will work!

<p>Hi Brian! Thanks for the heads up! Like you, I don't know if this is purposeful disruption or just inexperience, so I have reverted the blanking and left a "please don't do that again" message. —<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 21:21, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi -- I was also trying to revert that same vandalism; if you take a look at the page history you'll see I did not initiate that addition. I'm using VandalProof, and it appears it's not correctly reverting this page with the edit conflict -- it reverted the edit after the displayed one. You can also take a look at the talk page of the other editor, <a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">User talk:Tmopkisn</a>, where I've left a note asking him if he is going to complete the revert. I'd appreciate it if you would remove the test1 template from my talk page, if you agree I wasn't vandalizing. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 23:43, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem. As you can see, with all of us working fast, I also was removing it at the same time you were asking. Note, I also put a nice edit summary there so no one should question you. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> (<a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">Talk</a>) 23:46, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It seems since my name change (yes I know I'm still using "GIen" however take a look at my contributions - all 300 of them - they've all been transferred to my "new" user name - which hasnt been given sysop rights nor even exist - long story) Anyway, I had to add you manually... hopefully it worked.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">re: San Diego Chargers</span></h2>
<p>Actually, it was <i><b>I</b></i> who protected that article due to the edit war. It seems that the dispute is between two registered users and a bunch of <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol_c410.html#IP_address_allocation" title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">dynamic IP addresses</a> over a paragraph about the upcoming 2006 season. So far I have basically ignored the talk page; they just seem to be venting. Of course, actually blocking those IP addresses are futile because they are dynamic; those users can basically get a new, fresh IP just by logging in and logging out of their respective <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_service_provider.html" title="Internet service provider">ISPs</a>.</p>
<p>As far as additional administrative action, I know that one of the registered users tried to evade the protection by creating a duplicate page called "San Diego Chargerss", and this ultimately led to him removing warning messages on his talk page about it (see <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html#User:Ohnoitsjamie" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI#User:Ohnoitsjamie</a>).</p>
<p>Quite frankly, unless I see some sort of resolution between the parties, I am just sitting on it until the 2006 season actually starts and the paragraph becomes obsolete. If you would like some other admin to help out, be my guest. I have considered other options such as <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>, but by the time either one has run its course, the 2006 season will already be in progress.

<li>Of course, I might unprotected it for a little while after the opening September 11 game against the Raiders concludes. A number of other users may want to update it, and that new content also may make that disputed paragraph obsolete. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 01:25, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
