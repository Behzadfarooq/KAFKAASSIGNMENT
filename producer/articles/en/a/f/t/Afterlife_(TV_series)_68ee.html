<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/t/Afterlife_%28TV_series%29_68ee.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>The main characters of the series are the psychic, Alison Mundy (played by <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesley_Sharp_a76b.html" title="Lesley Sharp">Lesley Sharp</a>) and the academic who becomes involved with her due to his sceptical interest in the paranormal, Dr Robert Bridge (<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Lincoln_22df.html" title="Andrew Lincoln">Andrew Lincoln</a>). Set in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, each of the six one-hour episodes of the first series sees Alison become involved in the appearance of a spirit and attempting to discover why it has come back to haunt the living. Robert becomes involved in the first episode, when Alison first moves to Bristol and her activities inadvertently result in the suicide of one of his students.</p>
<p>Following this, Robert decides to study Alison for a book. Alison's interest in Robert stems from her ability to see the spirit of his young son, whom Robert cannot see. Throughout the series a recurring theme is Alison's attempt to have Robert fully come to terms with the death of his son so that the boy's spirit can be eased and he can fully move on. In the first series it was claimed that Alison's powers came to her after she was seriously injured in a train crash several years before. The other survivors of the train crash seek her out to contact their own lost loved ones in the final episode of the first series, almost causing Alison's own death. However, this explanation for Alison's powers was later contradicted in the second series, where it was established that she had had these powers since she was little, the first 'ghost' she saw was her grandfather.</p>
<p>During the second series, Robert is diagnosed with cancer. He dies in the season finale, after having spent much of the series helping Alison to overcome mental problems brought about by the ghost of her mother. He also reconciles her with her father.</p>
<p>The programme was created by experienced television scriptwriter <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Volk_f831.html" title="Stephen Volk">Stephen Volk</a>, much of whose previous work had involved the paranormal, most famously the 1992 <i>Screen One</i> play <i><a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghostwatch.html" title="Ghostwatch">Ghostwatch</a></i> for <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_One_5f6f.html" title="BBC One">BBC One</a>. Volk also wrote five of the six episodes of the first series, the exception being the fifth episode which was scripted by Charlie Fletcher. The <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_producer.html" title="Television producer">producer</a> was Murray Ferguson, and the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_director.html" title="Television director">directors</a> were Maurice Phillips (episodes 1 &amp; 2), Charles Beeson (episodes 3 &amp; 6) and Martyn Friend (episodes 4 &amp; 5).</p>
<p>Volk had originally conceived the series during the mid-1990s according to <i><a href="../../../s/f/x/SFX_magazine_59a8.html" title="SFX magazine">SFX</a></i> magazine, when "ITV was fleetingly interested in producing a homegrown supernatural series because of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_X-Files_4e17.html" title="The X-Files">The X-Files</a>'</i> success [in the UK]."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_SFX01"><sup><a href="#endnote_SFX01" title="">1</a></sup></span> The series remained unmade until Clerkenwell Films became interested, as did Lesley Sharp, the actress being very keen to star in the series. "She absolutely loved it and actually pestered ITV relentlessly, asking 'When are you gonna commission this series?' Eventually they did,"<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_SFX01"><sup><a href="#endnote_SFX01" title="">1</a></sup></span> Volk told <i>SFX</i>.</p>
<p>Following the success of the first series, a second run was commissioned, beginning on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_16.html" title="September 16">September 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> on <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV1_cc0b.html" title="ITV1">ITV1</a> in the UK.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_SFX02"><sup><a href="#endnote_SFX02" title="">2</a></sup></span> The first run has been released on <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> in the UK, including <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_commentary_%28DVD%29_187f.html" title="Audio commentary (DVD)">audio commentaries</a> from the cast and crew. The first series began a repeat run on ITV1 in the UK on Sunday evenings from 9pm from <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_23.html" title="July 23">July 23</a>, although this was quickly abandoned and the repeats moved across to the <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_television.html" title="Digital television">digital television</a> channel <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV3_ef4a.html" title="ITV3">ITV3</a>.</p>

<p>Previewing the first episode as one of "Today's Choices" for its day of transmission in the <i><a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Times_2a4f.html" title="Radio Times">Radio Times</a></i> listings magazine, television critic Alison Graham praised <i>Afterlife</i> as "[A] highly-promising mystery series... a taut and snappy spine-tingler, even if it does use some old-hat shocker techniques such as creaking floorboards, darkness, inexplicable noises and unexpected taps on the shoulder."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_RT01"><sup><a href="#endnote_RT01" title="">3</a></sup></span> Reviewing the same episode for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> newspaper two days after its broadcast, critic <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Smith_fa76.html" title="Rupert Smith">Rupert Smith</a> was also impressed: "What looked like being a deeply depressing hour was instantly enlivened by the appearance of Lesley Sharp, who has become in recent years television's favourite Everywoman... At last I can put my hand on my heart and give an unqualified cheer to a new primetime British drama series. Afterlife was scary without being over-gruesome, it kept a straight face while gleefully narrating a plot of pure old-fashioned hokum, and it starred actors who are constantly, entirely watchable... <i>Afterlife</i> took the best bits of <i>The X-Files</i>, <i><a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Creek_f883.html" title="Jonathan Creek">Jonathan Creek</a></i> and, yes, <i><a href="../../../m/o/s/Most_Haunted_af70.html" title="Most Haunted">Most Haunted</a></i>, and turned them into terrific television."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Guardian01"><sup><a href="#endnote_Guardian01" title="">4</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The response remained positive through to the end of the series, with all subsequent episodes also being included in "Today's Choices" in the <i>Radio Times</i>. Previewing the sixth episode, Alison Graham was again positive, describing the series as a whole as having been "[A] consistently high-quality supernatural drama."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_RT02"><sup><a href="#endnote_RT02" title="">5</a></sup></span></p>
<p><i>Afterlife</i> was also a success for ITV1 in terms of viewing figures. The first episode garnered an overnight average rating of 5.7 million, 25% of the total television audience for the time, winning its timeslot with nearly two million more viewers than the nearest competition on at the same time.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_viewers01"><sup><a href="#endnote_viewers01" title="">6</a></sup></span> The second episode improved to 6.2 million viewers, 29% of the available audience and again two million higher than its nearest competition on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_One_5f6f.html" title="BBC One">BBC One</a>.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_viewers02"><sup><a href="#endnote_viewers02" title="">7</a></sup></span> Episode three garnered 5.4 million and a 25% share, which was identical to that gained by the BBC One competition (an edition of the semi-regular <i><a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_the_Nation_f98c.html" title="Test the Nation">Test the Nation</a></i> interactive quiz series).<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_viewers03"><sup><a href="#endnote_viewers03" title="">8</a></sup></span> Viewing figures remained strong through to the final episode of the first series, which concluded the run by again winning its slot by two million viewers, with 5.8 million and a 28% audience share.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_viewers04"><sup><a href="#endnote_viewers04" title="">9</a></sup></span></p>
