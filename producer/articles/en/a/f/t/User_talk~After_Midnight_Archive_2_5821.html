<ul>
<li>Typo? Oh noooooo. Where? No, sorry, there isn't any way to change an edit summary, I'm afraid. The only way (that I can think of) would be do undelete the article and re-delete it with a corrected summary... my thought on this is Oh nooooooo, damn. I really don't want to do that for all the 100 or so articles already deleted... per (1), I don't think that it's allowed to have talk pages for deleted articles... actually its a good idea, but unfortunately orphaned talk pages get deleted on sight as part of general cleanup. Per (2), hmmmmm it would be allowed to do that, although it would be quite a list, and I'm not sure what good would be done by linking to deleted articles. I did put a note at the top of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_October_2_in_baseball_9b2b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/October 2 in baseball">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/October 2 in baseball</a> pointing to the baseball wiki. Yes I agree that there should be a pointer to the articles on the baseball wiki... ah I see that there is a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Baseball_14a2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Baseball">Wikipedia:WikiProject Baseball</a>... perhaps they would know the best solution. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 14:09, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, yeah the link to the AfD discussion is in the page history... but only admins can see that. It is also in the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log|deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log|deletion" rel="nofollow">log</a>], but that is obscure... OK, I think what you are saying is, re-create the article and have it consist of just a link to the corresponding article in the baseball wiki, and protect if from further editing... that, however, is not possible for a couple of reasons, one being that articles are not allowed to consist soley of a link or links, the second being that pages are not allowed to be permanently protected. As far as #1, whether I will or no, the orphaned talk page would be detected and deleted automatically by robots... Here're a couple of suggestions:
<ol>
<li>On the Wikipedia date pages (e.g. <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">October 2</a> etc.), at the bottom under External links, add a link called say Dates in baseball and link it to a page in the baseball wiki which lists all dates (this could be done by just including the template use there which includes all the link; I'm sure the baseball wiki don't have a rule about articles not consisting soley of links. Then make October 2 in baseball a link to <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">October 2</a>, etc. The problem here is, the person would have to know to scroll down in <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">October 2</a> to the External links section (redirects cannot go directly to section in an article). So I don't know how good that would be. It would be a bit of work but not overwhelming.</li>
<li>Here's a <i>possible</i> solution. Make an article Dates in baseball, which contains links to each date on the baseball wiki, and make all our "(date) in baseball" articles redirects to that article... problem is, articles are not supposed to consist solely of links... would it be possible, I wonder, to create text for the article (e.g., "Throughout the year, baseball activity is governed by various impotant dates ... Opening day, usually around XYZ, is XYZ... the waiver trading deadline on XYZ means XYZ... etc., talking about the September expansion of the roster to 40 players, the deadline for players on the roster to be eligible for post-season play, and so forth. This would actually be a kind of ploy to allow the article to exist, its main purpose being to contain the list of links to the baseball wiki. Whether such an article could survive an AfD I don't know, would depend partly on how well it is written. (I don't know enough baseball to be able to write it myself). To find out before doing all the work, one could write the article (but not do all the work of listing the dates and making the redirect), then listing it as an <i>advisor</i> AfD: "Here is an article I am making, I am putting it up for AfD hoping it will survive, but I want to know before I do all the work". Once an article has survived AfD, if it gets a true Keep consensus, it gets a Kept tag on the talk page and is more or less immune, at least for a while.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Your #2 (editing the AfD discussion) would also work... Yes if you want to, go ahead and do it, I'll back you up. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 15:52, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I do, however, appreciate your thoughtfulness and it is also good to know about the translations page.

<p>thank you I was testing a new approach to category handling and wrote a few scripts I was debugging. Here's what happened: On August 27, a CFD decided that "Category:Users currently away from Wikipedia" would be renamed into "Category:Wikipedians who are not currently active" (see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_August_27_672f.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 August 27">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 August 27</a>. And so the bot went and performed the changes. But such entry had already the new tag, so when bot did the renaming, the entry ended up with a duplicated tag (my bot isn't smart yet to detect that, it only performed the action I commanded it to do (the renaming). -- <small><a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrini_c4b2.html" title="User talk:Drini">Drini</a></small> 16:32, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was just my monobook, actually. Admins get a rollback link next to the top contrib on every page. I've got a monobook skin that gives me a "revert all" link. It's got a lot of other admin stuff. If you'd like, you can try my monobook, but a lot of stuff won't work. Actually, though, I used to use VP a lot. If you're an admin some cool extra menus get enabled (but I never really use it). <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="OrangeRed">alpha</font><font color="black"><b>Chimp</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp">(talk)</a></sup> 03:18, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just wondering if you have any idea why typing "Evolutionary Philosophy" in the search box automatically opens "Evolutionary philosophy"? It won't let me create a redirect page; it gets there without one. Evolutionary philosophy is the article page; Evolutionary Philosophy doesn't exist. Any thoughts?<font color="#FF6600">—</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 05:36, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I assume that when you are typing it in the search box that you are pressing "enter" instead of clicking on Search. Pressing "enter" will default to as if you had clicked on "Go", even if you do it from <a href="../../../s/e/a/Special%7ESearch_a8e5.html" title="Special:Search">Special:Search</a> where these is no "go" button visible. The "Go" action will work regardless of case, try typing any proper name (or even “wp:cfd”) in all lower case to see an example. As a result you get to the page even though your case doesn't match. I think that this is probably intentional to make it easier to go to articles without having to always capitalize the words precisely. As far as creating your redirect, you will note that when you put the link on my page, you got a red-link, so you can always use that to get into edit mode. (I would create it for you, but I think you would prefer to "see the evidence"). Also, note that if you do search for "Evolutionary Philosophy" and click on the search button, you will get a message at the top of the page which says "You searched for Evolutionary Philosophy..." and it also has a red-link. The other unasked question that you may have is, why doesn't the "Evolutionary philosophy" article show up on the search as a result for "Evolutionary Philosophy". The answer to this would be that the article is probably too new to be updated in the search index yet. I'm not sure how long that takes, but it could be several days or even weeks. I hope all this helps, and please feel free to drop by anytime if I can ever help again.

<p>(Smacking self on forehead) Doh! Of <i>course</i> I was using the Enter key, doesn't everyone? (And the answer is: "No"—but that's another story involving recalcitrant students who'd rather do it the hard way.) I'm glad to know that Wikipedia is at least <i>that</i> user-friendly when using the "Go" button. I did go ahead and create the redirect page to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I was told (I think it's in my talk page archives somewhere) that in order for deleted pages to stop showing up on searches depended on whether or not the page is <i>searched</i> for between search index updates. I'm wondering if the same would be true for new pages: whether or not they're searched for, not the age of the page.* It seems more likely (and logical, which decreases the chances of this being true) that the page is included in whatever "dump" for new pages (from <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">newpages</a>, I would hope) it gets when updating the index.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly (which is more and more doubtful) I was also told that Wikipedia basically uses a version of the Google search engine, and trying to control what it returns in search results is fairly futile.** I received all this information—or something very like it, my memory isn't what it once was—when I was trying to get redirect pages deleted that pointed to deleted pages. Basically, I was told it would be a waste of time because of the aforementioned characteristics of the search engine.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and the invite. I saw that you live in Delaware now, but have you spent much time in the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_south.html" title="Old south">South</a>? If not, somewhere, someone in your life taught you to be as gracious as true Southerners <i>tend</i> to be. (Qualifying as a true Southerner, however, is an entirely different story. Just because you are born in the South doesn't make you a Southerner—if your cat had kittens in the oven, it wouldn't make them biscuits.)</p>
<p>On a completely different topic, had you ever done electronic typesetting, you would have found it impossible to put two spaces after periods. It was a hard and fast rule learned in typing class, but it wasn't possible in "real" typesetting, at least on the Mergenthaler Linotronic system I used. (<a href="../../../l/i/n/Linotype.html" title="Linotype">Linotype</a> used to manufacture a computerized <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phototypesetting.html" title="Phototypesetting">phototypesetting</a> system; once desktop publishing became the rule rather than the exception, that ceased.) The system also prevented the user from leaving spaces between em or en dashes and the words they connected. Both of these are still standards today; take a look at published books. (Another thing that changed greatly from using a typewriter was replacing <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underline.html" title="Underline">underlining</a> characters with italics; underlining was the only option available on the typewriters and was always meant to indicate italics.</p>
<p>By the way, am I the only editor who uses lots of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitext.html" title="Wikitext">wikilinks</a> on talk pages? (<a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetorical_question.html" title="Rhetorical question">rhetorical question</a>)</p>
<p>Lastly, you may have noticed that I <i>do</i> go on—a Southern trait that I seem to have learned quite well. Brevity may be the soul of wit; I might learn how it works someday.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the compliment. I did spend my college years in the Old South. Many people in Delaware consider themselves to live in the South as they are below the Mason-Dixon line, but my experience here has been that northern Delaware more closely emulates life in Philadelphia and the rest of the Northeast. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 18:13, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm...well, I understand your confusion; I'm not sure what should be done, either.

You could leave a note on the article's talk page as well. If you don't get a satisfactory reply, tagging the article or asking on the village pump might be good next steps.

<p>I noticed you nominated these two categories for discussion/deletion: [[Category:Anti-gay rights politicians]] &amp; [[Category:Anti-gay rights media personalities]]. I think this category would fall under the same reasoning, but I haven't yet figured out the nomination process: [[Category:Anti-gay marriage politicians]].

<dd>Yes, I actually only nominated Category:Anti-gay rights media personalities and another user quickly added the other one to my nomination (which I guess is neither here nor there). At any rate, if you would like to nominate a category for deletion, you should be able to by following the instructions here: <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_Howto_ed58.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Howto">Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Howto</a>.
