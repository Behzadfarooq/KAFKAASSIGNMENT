<dd>Keeping it going is what is tricky... I started with the easiest ones where information was available on state websites but soon ran out of steam... then added some lists from the Miss AMerica website... but of course they only run till 1997... then created some stub pages to save red links!

<dd>Right now I am just making a few quick edits, but I did notice the format on that one and at least one other (North Dakota). I will take care of both of them as I continue to go through the states alphabetically as I get more time in another editing session. I think that I've finished the "I"'s so Kansas will be my next project. I've noticed you following along after me with the awards/etc where I didn't have them. Also, thanks for cleaning the names up after me. I've been (as you probably noticed) taking the name verbatim from the state web site in most cases, since I don't have all the detail for the maiden/common names. I hope you don't mind and feel free to keep it up. I've got a pretty good system of getting things into tables, so I am trying to concentrate there first and I appreciate that you are correcting/adding details as necessary. BTW, I am a "team player", so if you have any preferences of how I might do something, please feel free to express that to me. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 22:51, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I think the way we've been working has actually been really good... I discovered first hand that I can't do everything without losing interest quickly, but once the tables are set up its easy for me to whip through and add placements etc which is the sort of thing I like! You keep doing what you're doing and I'll come in afterwards and finish them off&#160;:) PS have you considered joining <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Beauty_Pageants_1979.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Beauty Pageants">WikiProject Beauty Pageants</a>? -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 22:59, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When I was creating the missing <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_America_0381.html" title="Miss America">Miss America</a> articles, I created <a href="../../../b/e/b/BeBe_Shopp_2aae.html" title="BeBe Shopp">BeBe Shopp</a> for 1948. I noticed today that you created <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Minnesota_1801.html" title="Miss Minnesota">Miss Minnesota</a> with Beatrice Shopp. Do you have any opinion about which of these should be the article vs. the redirect? I would consider you to know better than I regarding which name is used more commonly when referring to her.</p>

I came across it working on <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Michigan_e3bd.html" title="Miss Michigan">Miss Michigan</a>, and didn't know if it just had some typos or if there was more that was wrong with it.

<dd>When it comes to articles like Ann Penelope Marston (and I love when blue links pop up and they are actually about the girl in question!) the best thing to do, if you can be bothered, is to whip through them, make sure the pageant name is correctly linked (sometimes they get the America/USA titles mixed up etc) and yes, it is good to add the Miss America delegates cat.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tables</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I was starting to look at the Miss USA state pageant articles and was thinking about adding tables on them to mirror what we have in the Miss America state pageant articles. Miss America state articles have columns for 1) Year, 2) Name, 3) Hometown, 4) Local Title, 5) Placement at Miss America, 6) Special scholarships at Miss America, and 7) Notes. For Miss USA state articles, I would picture only 5 columns: 1) Year, 2) Name, 3) Placement at Miss America, 4) Special awards at Miss USA and 5) Notes, since I don't think that hometown and local title information is particularly available. I've gone ahead and done this at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_California_USA_2cf3.html" title="Miss California USA">Miss California USA</a>, but haven't done any of the others yet, and won't until I get your feedback. Please let me know what you think, or if you hate it, just revert me, please. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 05:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Funny you said this because I was just thinking of doing the same thing! It all looks great, although I think it would be good to include hometowns... all hometowns for those 2000-2006 are available on <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/pageantupdate/photoarchives/miss/2000/fashion" class="external text" title="http://www.freewebs.com/pageantupdate/photoarchives/miss/2000/fashion" rel="nofollow">my website</a> (start on this page then use the arrows to move forward) and hometowns for all delegates are available on state websites for WY, CO, SD, MN, TX... and dating back to the nineties for NC, SC, LA.

<dd>One final thing... what would you think about adding a section for previous pageant experience? It would only work dating back to 2000ish but using abbreviations to detail previous Miss USA state pageants they'd competed in. For example, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candice_Sanders_ffdd.html" title="Candice Sanders">Candice Sanders</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_California_USA_2cf3.html" title="Miss California USA">Miss California USA</a> 2003 was first runner-up at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Tennessee_USA_2aee.html" title="Miss Tennessee USA">Miss Tennessee USA</a> 2001-2. I have all the relevant info on my website so it would be relatively easy to add in. Whether it's encyclopaedic enough?

I know in the past you weren't nuts about table creation, and I can crank them out pretty well, so if you want, I can create the tables with the extra columns and you can maybe add in the data from the external sites? (It is faster for me to not have to switch windows so much to copy the other data) Or, you can work from the front of the alphabet and I can work backwards from the end until we meet in the middle.

I'm more inclined to doing them because my "love" is the Miss USA system (I have less time for Miss America&#160;:P).

Also, when the invited user category reference is returned, your user page will not appear, sine it seems you object to this. --<a href="../../../l/m/b/User%7ELmbstl_3b5b.html" title="User:Lmbstl">Lmbstl</a> 13:14, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In general, I believe that it is disruptive to place users' pages or users' talk pages into categories, but I imagine that may be disputed. I did suspect that you were using it to see who was invited. That's why I put the note in my edit comment that you can still see who was invited by clicking on the "What links here" (the backlink) from the template, which will then show you every page which has it included (transcluded). I believe that it is a bit more elegant of a solution and does not disrupt users who don't want their pages categorized. The only other alternative I could think of was to nowiki your template on my page or to delete it, and I don't like to redact other users' posting to my pages except in extreme circumstances. I hope you understand, but please let me know if you wish to discuss further. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 13:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS: The template was also behaving oddly where the picture was moving in the text and the text was sometimes overlaying the picture, but I fixed the template so that it doesn't do that any more in my other edit to your template, so that is no longer an issue for me. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 13:21, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for fixing the image alignment, by the way. As for the category, I realize it isn't the most elegant solution, but it is the most easily accessible. I will look into including an internal link ot the "what links here" area. Problem is, the category organizes the user names quite nicely. I am going to restore it for now, but if I get any more complaints I will remove it competely.

<dd>I think it looks good. I wasn't really thinking that it didn't have an article, since there wasn't one for 2006 either. I was going to tape the event and use it for info afterwards, but they took CMT off my cable service, so I guess I can forget about that idea.... As far as the platform, I agree that the table is pretty full as it is. If you wanted, you could maybe make 2 tables, one for their "before pageant info" like the platform and prior experience, and a 2nd one for their awards and placements? --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 23:23, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! Well I started with "pageant contestant" but about a week ago I changed to "pageant titleholder"! (I figured "titleholder" sounded more notable than "contestant"). As many of the dabbed articles won't ever get created (well at least not in the short term&#160;:P) I wouldn't bother going back and changing them... but if you are creating dabs "pageant titleholder" is probably good. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 03:15, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please read the material at <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. Blogs and fansites are discouraged as external links. There have been a large number of fansites added to this article over the last several months; which is official? Each claims that they are the official fansite for Lukas Rossi. If you feel that yours is unique, then you should make a case for it on the talk page of the article and solicit consensus for this from other editors. Also, it shows bad faith when you remove links to valid websites, such as the official Rockstar show page, and replace it with your own, so that is not a good way to start. I'll revert this one last time and agree to not remove it again once you seek and gain consensus on the articles talk page. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 04:25, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made an error on the line edit just a few minutes ago (CBS) and am on right now trying to correct it (I have made many attempts to find my way around here). It was not intentional. I own the trademark for "The Rossi Posse" which is the well known name of Lukas Rossi's fan group. In addition, I own copyright to the name "The Rossi Posse" and "therossiposse.com". Our site features many items that wouldn't be appropriate under wikipedia guidelines to post in the content area--exclusive photographs, concert reviews, original content directly related to Lukas Rossi, original biography, catalog, and links to all media articles. It is more frequently updated and contains more information about Lukas Rossi than the two sites that are currently listed. I can understand you not wanting the listing to be over-run by fansites. However, this is the only fan site that has legal authorization to call themselves "Rossi Posse", the official fan group of Lukas Rossi (you will find notations to "Rossi Posse" in several media articles).04:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)Monkeyhq, January 30 11:36 est</p>

<dd>OK. I'm trying to understand your position. I'll still suggest that you try to gain consensus. Also, if your website is truly notable, you may be able to actually make a reference to it within the body of the article, which would then justify an external link at the bottom.
