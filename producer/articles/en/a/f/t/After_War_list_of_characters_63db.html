<dl>
<dt>Garrod Ran</dt>
<dd>The main character of the series, and a 15-year-old hot-headed boy who is skilled at Mobile Suit operation and espionage. He was originally hired to rescue Tiffa Adill from the Vulture ship Freeden but upon realising his employer only wanted to exploit her later becomes part of its crew. For much of the series, he nurses a fairly obvious crush on Tiffa but does not act, fearing that the Tiffa would be unnerved by his advances, since she was denied most of her childhood. His love for her is what drives him to pilot the <a href="../../../g/x/-/GX-9900_Gundam_X_c93d.html" title="GX-9900 Gundam X">GX-9900 Gundam X</a>, the <a href="../../../g/x/-/GX-9900-DV_Gundam_X_Divider_8c8e.html" title="GX-9900-DV Gundam X Divider">GX-9900-DV Gundam X Divider</a>, and later the <a href="../../../g/x/-/GX-9901-DX_Gundam_Double_X_67e7.html" title="GX-9901-DX Gundam Double X">GX-9901-DX Gundam Double X</a>.</dd>
<dt>Tiffa Adill</dt>
<dd>A mysterious <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtype.html" title="Newtype">Newtype</a> girl who demonstrates <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clairvoyance.html" title="Clairvoyance">clairvoyance</a> throughout the series. She is "rescued" by Garrod from the <i>Freeden</i> but later joins the crew together with Garrod. She is very quiet and shy due to the horrible things she has seen, and is a frequent target for kidnapping due to her abilities. Thanks to Garrod and the <i>Freeden</i> crew she begins to open up, and eventually falls in love with Garrod. Although she has paranormal abilities, she has never once considered herself a Newtype.</dd>
<dt>Jamil Neate</dt>
<dd>The captain of the <i>Freeden</i>, a Vulture ship. He was once a Newtype pilot of the old United Nations Earth who piloted a <a href="../../../g/x/-/GX-9900_Gundam_X_c93d.html" title="GX-9900 Gundam X">Gundam X</a> in the 7th Space War, and it was also him who fired the fatal shot which changed history. Now he searches the Earth for Newtypes to rescue and protect. It seems that he has had feelings for a fellow Newtype named Lucille Lilliant for many years, and at the end of the series he gets together with his advisor Sala Tyrrell.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Techs Farzenbarg</dt>
<dd>The <i>Freeden</i> physician, versed in a variety of knowledge, from psychology to 20th century European poetry. His other interests are equally varied, and include coffee and billiards—he is a skilled player, but sometimes sneaks into the rec room for private practice sessions. After the crew parted ways, he continues to practice medicine in field hospitals, skillfully keeping soldiers of both sides from one another's throats.</dd>
<dt>Roybea Loy</dt>
<dd>The pilot of the <a href="../../../g/t/-/GT-9600_Gundam_Leopard_7e2b.html" title="GT-9600 Gundam Leopard">GT-9600 Gundam Leopard</a> and its upgraded form <a href="../../../g/t/-/GT-9600-D_Gundam_Leopard_Destroy_20fe.html" title="GT-9600-D Gundam Leopard Destroy">GT-9600-D Gundam Leopard Destroy</a>. At the beginning he was only hired to do one job for the <i>Freeden</i> but later takes a more permanent position as one of her defenders. He's pretty much a ladies man who does, however, care for each lover he has had. He acquired his Gundam on a bet from a woman he considered his true love. He has a crush on Sala, who firmly rejects his advances. He and Ennil El eventually become a couple and are last seen in Witz's hometown.</dd>
<dt>Toniya Malme</dt>
<dd>She is the bridge operator in charge of communications. In contrast to her crewmate Sala, she is a free-spirited woman who is fashion-conscious and sensitive. She quickly becomes friends with Ennil El at Saint's Island, and although she invites her to join the <i>Freeden</i>, it would take some time for Ennil to join forces. Before the final battle near the lunar base, Witz proposed to her; at the end of the series she accompanies him to his hometown.</dd>
<dt>Shingo Mori</dt>
<dd>The <i>Freeden</i> helmsman, who can also be found working in supply procurement, salvaging, guard duty, and trade negotiations. It is said that he is able to pilot even a spacecraft simply by reading the manual<a href="http://www.gundam-x.net/library/chara/24.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gundam-x.net/library/chara/24.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
<dt>Kid Salsamille</dt>
<dd>The <i>Freeden</i> chief mechanic, and a (self-styled) technical genius at the age of 12. He strives for high quality and professionalism in his work, and will push himself to work beyond exhaustion. He also has an impulsive side; specifically, he can hardly resist tinkering with Mobile Suits and other large mechs. His grand ideas, however, led to the powerful upgrades for the <i>Freeden</i> Gundam complement. At the series' close, he, along with Shingo, Paula, and his two subordinates Lokoko and Nine open a repair shop and salvage yard called "Freeden III".</dd>
<dt>Witz Sou</dt>
<dd>The pilot of the <a href="../../../g/w/-/GW-9800_Gundam_Airmaster_5a63.html" title="GW-9800 Gundam Airmaster">GW-9800 Gundam Airmaster</a> and its upgraded form <a href="../../../g/w/-/GW-9800-B_Gundam_Airmaster_Burst_a530.html" title="GW-9800-B Gundam Airmaster Burst">GW-9800-B Gundam Airmaster Burst</a>. Like Roybea, he initially had a one-time contract with the Freeden but finally also joins the crew. Later in the series it is revealed that he uses the money gained from his work as a mercenary to support his family. He returns home at the end of the series with his new fiancée Toniya, Roybea and Ennil.</dd>
<dt>Sala Tyrrell</dt>
<dd>She is the bridge operator in charge of the sensors and hangar, and second-in-command to Jamil. She has a straightforward, by-the-book attitude that projects a rather stern image, particularly when Tiffa was brought aboard, as Jamil often focused his attention on the girl. She does, however, grow to become fond of Tiffa when she sees her abilities help protect the <i>Freeden</i> from danger.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Shagia Frost</dt>
<dd>The elder of the twin Frost brothers, working for the New United Nations Earth as a spy. He pilots the <a href="../../../n/r/x/NRX-0013_Gundam_Virsago_54ef.html" title="NRX-0013 Gundam Virsago">NRX-0013 Gundam Virsago</a> and its upgraded form <a href="../../../n/r/x/NRX-0013-CB_Gundam_Virsago_Chest_Break_5bc8.html" title="NRX-0013-CB Gundam Virsago Chest Break">NRX-0013-CB Gundam Virsago Chest Break</a>. He has been under the care of the UNE Newtype Laboratory from his youth, and while he trained with recognized Newtypes, his telepathic ability was not compatible with the Flash System, and so the lab designated him as "Category F" along with his brother Olba. As a result, he made it his personal mission to eliminate any Newtype candidate that the UNE government ordered him to find, in revenge against the people who would not recognize his power. Cold and ruthless, he is also deeply committed to his cause, and will stop at nothing for its success.</dd>
<dt>Olba Frost</dt>
<dd>The younger of the twin Frost brothers, also working for the New United Nations Earth. He pilots the <a href="../../../n/r/x/NRX-0015_Gundam_Ashtaron_aa73.html" title="NRX-0015 Gundam Ashtaron">NRX-0015 Gundam Ashtaron</a> and its upgraded form <a href="../../../n/r/x/NRX-0015-HC_Gundam_Ashtaron_Hermit_Crab_9e6f.html" title="NRX-0015-HC Gundam Ashtaron Hermit Crab">NRX-0015-HC Gundam Ashtaron Hermit Crab</a>. Although he tries to assume the same attitude of his brother, he is at times a bloodthirsty Mobile Suit rider, obsessed with his sense of superiority. He deeply respects his brother Shagia, and will usually obey his orders even if his emotions get the better of him.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Fixx Bloodman</dt>
<dd>The leader of newly-formed New United Nations Earth. Although he says he doesn’t want to repeat the mistakes of the past he is only interested in war. The Frost brothers work for him but in truth he is manipulated by them.</dd>
<dt>Aimzat Kartral</dt>
<dd>The UNE Intelligence Minister who is the Frost brothers' superior at the start of the series. He deeply believes that Newtypes are the way to greater power for humanity, and has tried to further this view among his superiors in the UNE Reconstruction Committee.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Lancerow Dowell</dt>
<dd>An officer and Mobile Suit ace in the SRA during the 7th Space War, he was the arch-rival of Jamil Neate. After meeting Tiffa, he tried, to no avail, to persuade SRA President Zaider Rasso not to use certain superweapons against the resistance group Satyricon. Zaider's stubbornness, along with the death of his friend Nichol Fafas, caused him to question his involvement in the war.</dd>
<dt>Zaider Rasso</dt>
<dd>The president of the SRA and also the leader of Newtypism, a cult that forwards the view that all space-born people are Newtypes. His target is to conquer Earth and for this he tries to contact D.O.M.E. in the lunar base, because he knows the ultimate secret of Newtypes.</dd>
<dt>Nichola Fafas</dt>
<dd>A SRA officer who kidnaps Tiffa and brings her to the colonies. He is a friend of Lancerow Dowell and like him he begins to question Zaider’s motives. Because of this, he is arrested and executed for sedition.</dd>

<dt>Paula Cis</dt>
<dd>Paula is a member of the space colony resistance group "Satyricon", and the pilot of the <a href="../../../g/s/-/GS-9900_G-Falcon_9e18.html" title="GS-9900 G-Falcon">GS-9900 G-Falcon</a>. She is a loudmouthed, tomboyish orphan, and one of the first children born after the colony drop that ended the 7th Space War. She is the only person her age in Satyricon, and as such, she takes an immediate liking to Garrod when he is brought to the asteroid base. When Garrod accepts the rebels' offer to repair the Double X, she makes him her partner, as the G-Falcon has the ability to dock with most Gundam-type Mobile Suits.</dd>
<dt>Carris Nautilus</dt>
<dd>An artificial Newtype whose goal is to bring peace to a united world. For this goal he assists Nomoa Long in his attempt to use the mobile armor Patulia. Because he is an artificial Newtype, he regularly suffers from the condition called the "Synapse Syndrome", where he experiences pain akin to a terrible death. Initially he defeated Garrod with the RMSN-008 Bertigo, severely damaging the Gundam X, but later falling to the upgraded Divider and a recovered Garrod. After the New United Nations Earth is established, he joins an anti-UNE militia in the North American continent, later intercepting a convoy carrying the <i>Freeden</i> Gundams and rescuing the Vulture crew.</dd>
<dt>Ennil El</dt>
<dd>The daughter of deceased SRA Major General Nada El. She and her father were stranded on Earth at the end of the war and after he died, she developed a hatred of those living on the planet. She became a mercenary and had numerous run-ins with the <i>Freeden</i> crew, at one point assisting in the Patulia project. She develops feelings for Garrod, though he never returns them. After the Patulia is destroyed, she wanders into Saint's Island where she opens a restaurant called "Lilac" and attracts the eye of Miles Goodman. But she finds that she could not escape her violent past, and ends up leaving after learning her new friend Toniya is a <i>Freeden</i> crew member. Eventually she joins the <i>Freeden</i>, and at the end of the series she travels to Witz's hometown together with Roybea.</dd>
<dt>D.O.M.E.</dt>
<dd>The mysterious entity which exists in the lunar base with the satellite system. He is the first Newtype and later reveals the truth about himself and Newtypes to the Freeden crew and the leaders of New United Nations Earth and the Space Revolutionary Army.</dd>
<dt>Nomoa Long, AKA Professor Dorat</dt>
<dd>Mayor of Fort Severn. He was actually a leader of the SRA infiltration plot called "Operation Lilac", in which a team of Newtypes with RMSN-008 Bertigos and the Mobile Armor Patulia assault major UNE targets on the Earth. The plan had failed however, and with only one Bertigo and the Patulia at his disposal, he spent fifteen years perfecting the artificial Newtype technology in the hope of one day exacting his revenge on the Earth.</dd>
<dt>Fong Alternative</dt>
<dd>Director of the Alternative laboratory, where Tiffa Adill was found by Jamil Neate. He is exploitative, as demonstrated by his attitude toward Tiffa, and by his willingness to dispose of his mercenaries, the Frost brothers, with the SRA Mobile Armor <a href="../../../m/a/-/MA-06_Grandine_5d82.html" title="MA-06 Grandine">MA-06 Grandine</a>.</dd>

<ul>
<li>Garrod is considered one of the best pilots among all the Gundam series, due to his defeating Newtype pilots despite being an Oldtype. He is also quite resourceful, having disarmed and captured a mobile suit that attacked a town he happened to be in with nothing more than a flash grenade, a magnetic grapple, and a gun.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Garrod and Tiffa have two character songs each.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the SD Gundam G Generation series of games, Tiffa has incredibly high Newtype stats (surpassing even that of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judau_Ashta_cda5.html" title="Judau Ashta">Judau Ashta</a>, the most powerful Newtype of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Century_fda9.html" title="Universal Century">Universal Century</a>), but predictably virtually no fighting ability.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Olba Frost's <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seiyuu.html" title="Seiyuu">seiyuu</a> stated in an interview that after using "Nii-san" (Older brother) so many times, he's developed an aversion to the word.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jamil Neate and Lancerow Dowell's rivalry mirrors that of the Newtype aces <a href="../../../a/m/u/Amuro_Ray_e69f.html" title="Amuro Ray">Amuro Ray</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Char_Aznable_2ecd.html" title="Char Aznable">Char Aznable</a>. Their final battle is similar to the final clash of the original Gundam series between the <a href="../../../r/x/-/RX-78_Gundam_08d0.html#RX-78-2_Gundam" title="RX-78 Gundam">Gundam</a> and the <a href="../../../z/e/o/Zeong.html" title="Zeong">Zeong</a>.</li>
