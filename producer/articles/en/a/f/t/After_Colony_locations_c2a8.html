After the arrival of its pilot, <a href="../../../h/e/e/Heero_Yuy_2fd7.html" title="Heero Yuy">Heero Yuy</a>, he and Zechs engaged in a duel, as Zechs desired to finish the fight in Siberia that was interrupted by OZ. However, Heero chose to use <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trowa_Barton_3821.html" title="Trowa Barton">Trowa Barton</a>'s <a href="../../../x/x/x/XXXG-01H_Gundam_Heavyarms_86d6.html" title="XXXG-01H Gundam Heavyarms">XXXG-01H Gundam Heavyarms</a> instead, feeling that using Wing would make him feel beholden to Zechs. The duel raged over the frozen ground, only to be interrupted by <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relena_Peacecraft_2d98.html" title="Relena Peacecraft">Relena Darlian</a>, who was seeking Heero in order to give him an important message. The duel was abruptly brought to an end when OZ's assault force arrived, and Zechs took off to fight them in order to give the Gundam Pilots and his younger sister the chance to escape.</p>

<p>A breakaway nation formed within <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, the Bundt Republic was lead by an Alliance general who was mainly interested in his own power. Initially, Bundt resisted OZ following the events of Operation Daybreak, but with repeated troubles from rebels, as well as the discovery of a Gundam supporting them, Bundt asked his top aides to consider asking OZ for help. Though his aides rejected the idea, Bundt went ahead with it, hoping to get in with OZ by handing them a Gundam. However, Bundt was slain in the subsequent attack; it is never stated on-screen, but it is assumed that the nation collapsed back into China afterwards.</p>

Though Noin hated war, she taught soldiers out of her love of space, and tried to instill that love in all of her trainees as well. Shortly after Operation Meteor was launched, Gundam Pilot <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chang_Wufei_d739.html" title="Chang Wufei">Chang Wufei</a> killed the latest graduating class by bombing the barracks at night. Enraged at herself for being unable to do anything to stop Chang, Noin left the base to join Zechs in the frontlines against the Gundams. After her departure, the base was apparently converted into a supply depot. Zechs temporarily used Lake Victoria as his base while he was reconstructing <a href="../../../x/x/x/XXXG-01W_Wing_Gundam_c6f7.html" title="XXXG-01W Wing Gundam">Wing Gundam</a>, but with increased pressure from Romefeller investigators, he moved the operation to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antarctica.html" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>.</p>

<p>A major Alliance base, primarily noted for the presence of the Noventa Cannon, a very powerful wide-area saturation beam cannon emplacement.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/t/After_Colony_locations_c2a8.html" title="Edit section: Sanc Kingdom">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sanc Kingdom</span></h3>
<p>A <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Europe_9480.html" title="Northern Europe">Northern European</a> nation, the Sanc Kingdom became famous in the late AC 100s when the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_family.html" title="Royal family">ruling family</a>, the Peacecrafts, declared their nation a pacifist state following the teachings of colonial leader Heero Yuy. The Alliance judged the Sanc Kingdom to be a threat to their dominance, an attack was staged in AC 182, leading to the kingdom's dissolution and the deaths of King Peacecraft and his wife Katrina. For years, the individual cities of the former Sanc Kingdom existed, though were not formally recognized as a nation. Thirteen years after the nation's fall, the Peacecrafts' lost daughter <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relena_Peacecraft_2d98.html" title="Relena Peacecraft">Relena</a> returned and formally revived the nation, once more espousing total <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifism</a>. The leaders of many nations sent their children to the kingdom to learn of its philosophies, of which its princess was still a student (at her own admission). However, one policy would become the nation's undoing; reaching out to all peoples, Relena declared the kingdom a neutral nation in the growing conflict and invited anyone who wanted to escape the war to join her. The presence of several former Alliance and Treize Faction soldiers (as well as Gundam Pilots <a href="../../../h/e/e/Heero_Yuy_2fd7.html" title="Heero Yuy">Heero Yuy</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quatre_Raberba_Winner_9ae5.html" title="Quatre Raberba Winner">Quatre Raberba Winner</a>) gave the Romefeller Foundation the excuse it needed to stage an invasion, this time using their deadly new <a href="../../../a/f/t/After_Colony_technology_c342.html" title="After Colony technology">mobile dolls</a>. Rather than seeing her people suffer again, Relena voluntarily dissolved the nation and gave herself over to Romefeller.</p>

When the gang's leader Solo became ill, the orphan stole some of the vaccine, but returned too late to save his friend's life.

Later that year, the gang was broken up by the Alliance, and its members were sent to the Maxwell Church for adoption. All the children except Duo were adopted; the youth lived at the church, supported by Father Maxwell and Sister Helen. A year later, though, a group of anti-Alliance rebels holed up in the church.

When OZ began making peaceful overtures to the colonies, MO-V signed on almost immediately, though its use was debated until OZ Prize reconnaissance discovered that the colony had built powerful new Gundam-type mobile suits called G-Units. Upon learning this, the Romefeller Foundation ordered Prize to capture the G-Units, forbidding any regular members of OZ from investigating. The colony's government negotiated with Prize to allow the evacuation of its civilians; however, an attack by OZ ace Valder Farkill destroyed all the civilian shuttles.
