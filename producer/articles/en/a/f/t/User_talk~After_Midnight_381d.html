<p>I've been watching you work away at the Miss America articles and titleholders and am very impressed and pleased someone is willing to work on them... my bent is more Miss USA &amp; Teen USA and whilst I did a bit of work on the Miss America state articles they were definitely in need of some tlc!

<dd>Keeping it going is what is tricky... I started with the easiest ones where information was available on state websites but soon ran out of steam... then added some lists from the Miss AMerica website... but of course they only run till 1997... then created some stub pages to save red links! Anyway good luck...

<p>I have no idea whether you can be bothered but it might be worth pulling this article into the table format used for other states...

<dd>Right now I am just making a few quick edits, but I did notice the format on that one and at least one other (North Dakota). I will take care of both of them as I continue to go through the states alphabetically as I get more time in another editing session. I think that I've finished the "I"'s so Kansas will be my next project. I've noticed you following along after me with the awards/etc where I didn't have them. Also, thanks for cleaning the names up after me. I've been (as you probably noticed) taking the name verbatim from the state web site in most cases, since I don't have all the detail for the maiden/common names. I hope you don't mind and feel free to keep it up. I've got a pretty good system of getting things into tables, so I am trying to concentrate there first and I appreciate that you are correcting/adding details as necessary. BTW, I am a "team player", so if you have any preferences of how I might do something, please feel free to express that to me. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><strong class="selflink">0001</strong></small></sup> 22:51, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I think the way we've been working has actually been really good... I discovered first hand that I can't do everything without losing interest quickly, but once the tables are set up its easy for me to whip through and add placements etc which is the sort of thing I like! You keep doing what you're doing and I'll come in afterwards and finish them off&#160;:) PS have you considered joining <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Beauty_Pageants_1979.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Beauty Pageants">WikiProject Beauty Pageants</a>? -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 22:59, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

After I've gotten to the end of the alphabet (and created the states which are currently redlinks), I'll go back and put the template on all of them using <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a>. If I forget to later, just remind me. Also, since it is pretty easy with AWB, I can add it to other articles for you as well, when the time comes. I imagine it will be pretty easy for me to make a list, assuming that all the articles are in one of your WP Categories. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><strong class="selflink">0001</strong></small></sup> 02:26, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When I was creating the missing <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_America_0381.html" title="Miss America">Miss America</a> articles, I created <a href="../../../b/e/b/BeBe_Shopp_2aae.html" title="BeBe Shopp">BeBe Shopp</a> for 1948. I noticed today that you created <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Minnesota_1801.html" title="Miss Minnesota">Miss Minnesota</a> with Beatrice Shopp. Do you have any opinion about which of these should be the article vs. the redirect? I would consider you to know better than I regarding which name is used more commonly when referring to her.</p>
<p>Also, you may want to take a look at the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Penelope_Marston_f91d.html" title="Ann Penelope Marston">Ann Penelope Marston</a> article. I came across it working on <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Michigan_e3bd.html" title="Miss Michigan">Miss Michigan</a>, and didn't know if it just had some typos or if there was more that was wrong with it.

<dd>When it comes to articles like Ann Penelope Marston (and I love when blue links pop up and they are actually about the girl in question!) the best thing to do, if you can be bothered, is to whip through them, make sure the pageant name is correctly linked (sometimes they get the America/USA titles mixed up etc) and yes, it is good to add the Miss America delegates cat.

<p>Hi. I was starting to look at the Miss USA state pageant articles and was thinking about adding tables on them to mirror what we have in the Miss America state pageant articles. Miss America state articles have columns for 1) Year, 2) Name, 3) Hometown, 4) Local Title, 5) Placement at Miss America, 6) Special scholarships at Miss America, and 7) Notes. For Miss USA state articles, I would picture only 5 columns: 1) Year, 2) Name, 3) Placement at Miss America, 4) Special awards at Miss USA and 5) Notes, since I don't think that hometown and local title information is particularly available. I've gone ahead and done this at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_California_USA_2cf3.html" title="Miss California USA">Miss California USA</a>, but haven't done any of the others yet, and won't until I get your feedback. Please let me know what you think, or if you hate it, just revert me, please. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><strong class="selflink">0001</strong></small></sup> 05:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Funny you said this because I was just thinking of doing the same thing! It all looks great, although I think it would be good to include hometowns... all hometowns for those 2000-2006 are available on <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/pageantupdate/photoarchives/miss/2000/fashion" class="external text" title="http://www.freewebs.com/pageantupdate/photoarchives/miss/2000/fashion" rel="nofollow">my website</a> (start on this page then use the arrows to move forward) and hometowns for all delegates are available on state websites for WY, CO, SD, MN, TX... and dating back to the nineties for NC, SC, LA.

<dd>One final thing... what would you think about adding a section for previous pageant experience? It would only work dating back to 2000ish but using abbreviations to detail previous Miss USA state pageants they'd competed in. For example, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candice_Sanders_ffdd.html" title="Candice Sanders">Candice Sanders</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_California_USA_2cf3.html" title="Miss California USA">Miss California USA</a> 2003 was first runner-up at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Tennessee_USA_2aee.html" title="Miss Tennessee USA">Miss Tennessee USA</a> 2001-2. I have all the relevant info on my website so it would be relatively easy to add in. Whether it's encyclopaedic enough?

<dd>OK. I'll add a column for Hometown when I get back online later today or tomorrow. I'm not sure about having another column for the previous experience, especially if we don't have it for more than a few years back. I've made the Notes column pretty wide, what do you think of putting it over there with the crossovers and other notes?

<dd>Yes, I noticed the age with the hometown on California. I hadn't looked at the other states, yet; I'll check them out now. I know in the past you weren't nuts about table creation, and I can crank them out pretty well, so if you want, I can create the tables with the extra columns and you can maybe add in the data from the external sites? (It is faster for me to not have to switch windows so much to copy the other data) Or, you can work from the front of the alphabet and I can work backwards from the end until we meet in the middle.

<dd>Good idea with the prod on New Orleans USA... totally agree. As for hte Miss USA tables... I'm more inclined to doing them because my "love" is the Miss USA system (I have less time for Miss America&#160;:P).

<p>The category reference you deleted from the templete served a purpose. Including the user pages allows project participants to see who has been invited already. In general, the function of the WUSTL WikiProject category system is to make all project pages available and visible in a heirarchical fashion. Although it was not majorly disruptive, I am wondering why you chose to remove the category reference as you did. Did it cause any interference or problems? If not, I would like to return it to the template. Kindly, <a href="../../../l/m/b/User%7ELmbstl_3b5b.html" title="User:Lmbstl">Lmbstl</a> 13:08, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>PS-- I added nowiki codes to my original post above, in case the template was somehow behaving undesirably. Also, when the invited user category reference is returned, your user page will not appear, sine it seems you object to this. --<a href="../../../l/m/b/User%7ELmbstl_3b5b.html" title="User:Lmbstl">Lmbstl</a> 13:14, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In general, I believe that it is disruptive to place users' pages or users' talk pages into categories, but I imagine that may be disputed. I did suspect that you were using it to see who was invited. That's why I put the note in my edit comment that you can still see who was invited by clicking on the "What links here" (the backlink) from the template, which will then show you every page which has it included (transcluded). I believe that it is a bit more elegant of a solution and does not disrupt users who don't want their pages categorized. The only other alternative I could think of was to nowiki your template on my page or to delete it, and I don't like to redact other users' posting to my pages except in extreme circumstances. I hope you understand, but please let me know if you wish to discuss further. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><strong class="selflink">0001</strong></small></sup> 13:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for fixing the image alignment, by the way. As for the category, I realize it isn't the most elegant solution, but it is the most easily accessible. I will look into including an internal link ot the "what links here" area. Problem is, the category organizes the user names quite nicely. I am going to restore it for now, but if I get any more complaints I will remove it competely.

<dd>I think it looks good. I wasn't really thinking that it didn't have an article, since there wasn't one for 2006 either. I was going to tape the event and use it for info afterwards, but they took CMT off my cable service, so I guess I can forget about that idea.... As far as the platform, I agree that the table is pretty full as it is. If you wanted, you could maybe make 2 tables, one for their "before pageant info" like the platform and prior experience, and a 2nd one for their awards and placements? --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><strong class="selflink">0001</strong></small></sup> 23:23, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! Well I started with "pageant contestant" but about a week ago I changed to "pageant titleholder"! (I figured "titleholder" sounded more notable than "contestant"). As many of the dabbed articles won't ever get created (well at least not in the short term&#160;:P) I wouldn't bother going back and changing them... but if you are creating dabs "pageant titleholder" is probably good. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 03:15, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please read the material at <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. Blogs and fansites are discouraged as external linls. There have been a large number of fansites added to this article over the last several months; which is official? Each claims that they are the official fansite for Lukas Rossi. If you feel that yours is unique, then you should make a case for it on the talk page of the article and solicit consensus for this from other editors. Also, it shows bad faith when you remove links to valid websites, such as the official Rockstar show page, and replace it with your own, so that is not a good way to start. I'll revert this one last time and agree to not remove it again once you seek and gain consensus on the articles talk page. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><strong class="selflink">0001</strong></small></sup> 04:25, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made an error on the line edit just a few minutes ago (CBS) and am on right now trying to correct it (I have made many attempts to find my way around here). It was not intentional. I own the trademark for "The Rossi Posse" which is the well known name of Lukas Rossi's fan group. In addition, I own copyright to the name "The Rossi Posse" and "therossiposse.com". Our site features many items that wouldn't be appropriate under wikipedia guidelines to post in the content area--exclusive photographs, concert reviews, original content directly related to Lukas Rossi, original biography, catalog, and links to all media articles. It is more frequently updated and contains more information about Lukas Rossi than the two sites that are currently listed. I can understand you not wanting the listing to be over-run by fansites. However, this is the only fan site that has legal authorization to call themselves "Rossi Posse", the official fan group of Lukas Rossi (you will find notations to "Rossi Posse" in several media articles).04:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)Monkeyhq, January 30 11:36 est</p>

<dd>OK. I'm trying to understand your position. I'll still suggest that you try to gain consensus. Also, if your website is truly notable, you may be able to actually make a reference to it within the body of the article, which would then justify an external link at the bottom.

<p>Hmmm. Recently I’ve been piping the wikilinks to the Miss USA year articles to save space in the table (eg) <b>[[Miss USA 2006|Top 10]]</b> instead of <b>Top 10 at [[Miss USA 2006]]</b>. I was going to continue doing that as I went through the hometown lists, but I just realised you’ve gone to the effort to go through the rest and add the long versions…</p>

<dd>I just did Miss America 2007, Miss Teen for 2005 &amp; 2006, and Miss USA for 2000 &amp; 2001. First off, let me say I still have over halfway to go, so I have no problem reversing course. So don't factor in what I already did, I have no problem going back and making the change.
<ul>
<li>I think that for Miss America it should stay in, because people get confused (I think) about how the state pageant is dated a year earlier than the national pageant.</li>
<li>As far as the Miss USA and Teen USA go, I was just being consistent, but you are right, it does save space to pipe it. The piping standard says to not make "unexpected pipes", but I think that this is OK. If you would prefer pipes, I can be equally happy with that.</li>
<li>Another option that you could consider (except for Miss America) is that we could change it back to a regular text link and then pipe the year link in the left column. This way, every state pageant would have links to all of the national pageants (only for blue ones - I would leave the red alone), even if that state didn't place.</li>
<li>One other thing that I struggle with is Finalist vs. Semi-finalist vs. Top Ten vs. Top 10. Naturally, over the years, the quantities have changes, so I think that we should consider using Top 10 or Top 15 where appropriate instead of finalist/semi-finalist. Do you agree?</li>
</ul>

<dd>Honestly, I would love to know how you can work so quickly! As for your suggestion... I love the idea to wiki the year rather than the placement... sounds great! I will go back and correct any I have changed if you haven't already. Good idea to leave Miss America... even I find it confusing. As for top 10 v top 15 v semi-finalist etc... don't worry about that, leave it as-is and I will fix them later using the Pageant Almanac. In the long run I will have "Top 12"/"Top 10"/whatever as it is more precise and informative. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 22:52, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Do exactly what you did, but preview instead of saving. In the preview you will still get the red link that you can click on and create the article.</li>
<li>Do a similar thing, but do it in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/WP%7ESandbox_e5a9.html" title="WP:Sandbox">WP:Sandbox</a></li>

<dd>Aargh, maybe you spoke too soon. I just spent several hours filling in all the blanks. Many of the states weren't tagged yet, so I had to go back through everything and add them by hand. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><strong class="selflink">0001</strong></small></sup> 22:19, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another thought I had was perhaps creating a category for some of the states with many related wiki articles... Texas and Virginia for example, with the new cat being Category:Miss Virginia USA &amp; Teen USA or something similar. I actually successfully nominated for deletion Category:Miss Virginia USA and Teen USA separately a few months back because the cats were small and I didn't expect them to grow, but I was thinking more recently that a combined cat might be a useful way of joining the bio and state articles together. What do you think? Another option is simply "Virginia pageantry" and the like and also linking in any associated Miss Virginia (America)articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One other thing I'm doing is continuing to create articles like <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_USA_1999_aae9.html" title="Miss USA 1999">Miss USA 1999</a>, but I'd hold off wikilinking them in until I've got a few more done, perhaps to 1995? Anyway do you prefer the table style (see <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Teen_USA_2005_6150.html" title="Miss Teen USA 2005">Miss Teen USA 2005</a>) or the list style (<a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_USA_1999_aae9.html" title="Miss USA 1999">Miss USA 1999</a>)? The table style is good in that it presents more information but I like the cleaner list version. Let me know what you think.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You might have noticed my little referencing habit... I just discovered we have access to the "Factiva" database through uni and I have been having heaps of fun looking back through old articles. I've found some really interesting stuff (see <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Minnesota_USA_f8b8.html" title="Miss Minnesota USA">Miss Minnesota USA</a> for the case of the theiving beauty queens, for example) and it's just interesting to see what states have the most articles.</dd>

<dd>I'm going to try to respond to all the rest of this at once....
<ul>
<li>I'm afraid that the additional categories may lead to some overcategorization. All the state delegates are on the corresponding articles, I would probably be more in favor of making it easier to navigate among the state articles (Miss Virginia, Miss Virginia USA, Miss Virginia Teen USA) via a navigational box. I would be happy to try to design one if you want. I would make it a template that would use a parameter, so that each one doesn't need to be created individually.</li>
<li>I'll hold off on the wikilinking until you get some more done, so I don't update each article for every year. I'll look for you to get to 1995, if you think of stopping before you get there, just let me know.</li>
<li>I agree that the list is cleaner, and the additional detail can be found in other places. If you put the same detail in too many places, it just means that you have to update it in more places if it changes or a correction comes along.</li>
<li>That stuff going on over in Minnesota is crazy... lol</li>

<dd>It's always great to get a second opinion :) Thanks for the offer of a navigational box, I think that sounds fantastic. Perhaps one that linked the Miss &amp; Teen articles but also the Miss America state pageant? Will leave it up to you. I also prefer the list and have continued to use that style (it doesn't take as long :P). I just completed <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_USA_f31f.html" title="Miss USA">Miss USA</a> 1998 and got part-way through 1997 (will return to that soon). I was really pleased with the 1998 article because I was able to find some really great sources. Will use Factiva to go back and try to source the others.

It could probably look better, but I'm still learning that side of things, at any rate it is a start. I'll let you take a look at it before I add it to the other articles. I've set it up to work pretty simply, so you can change the format as much as you want and the data should remain the same. Please feel free to make MAJOR improvements.

<dd>Thanks! I've played around a wee bit... changed the colour scheme so it matches other templates and also played with the headings... the one thing I wasn't too sure about was the way that the heading and the article name looked exactly the same so have tried using italics to differentiate a bit more... you're welcome to revert back if you don't like it. I had one thought... is it worth at this time creating an article for each of the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_America%27s_Outstanding_Teen_0a03.html" title="Miss America's Outstanding Teen">Miss America's Outstanding Teen</a> state pageants? Because if were were looking at doing that at some point that should also go on the template. I started with Alabama, didn't mind many sources and <s>didn't find easy ways of finding the state lists</s> so gave up... but when I went back to Factiva I realised that some of the girls/state pageants had attracted some press coverage. I guess the pageant is still in its infancy so notability could be an issue but in my opinion I think it would be worth setting up articles for each now. Besides... we just got the first <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shalane_Larango_533d.html" title="Shalane Larango">MAOTeen/Miss Teen USA crossover</a> this year. Anyway I'll have a look at creating an article for one or two, let you have a look at them, and see what you think. The issue with MAOTeen is that it was preceded by a number of unofficial teen pageants: I think the articles should just cover the previous two official state titleholders. Anyway... I've been babballing again!

<dd>OK, I've changed to it add the new set of articles, and put the Teen's below the Miss's. I started to try to create an if statement to figure out if the MAOT article existed and then select one of two templates with either 3 or 4 articles, but figured that you will probably create all of the new MAOT articles so quickly, that if would be obsolete soon. With this in mind, I think we can just put up with the redlinks for a short time, if you don't mind. I'll start to add them to all the articles. Since I'm not going to subst them, if we make more changes to the template, if will just update the pages dynamically. P.S.

Over time, we may need to figure out how to add some info about some of the prceeding pageants. For example, if you go to the official site for Oklahoma's teen, it mentions the old pageant which was won in 2004 by the currect Miss America; but we can build all this up over time. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><strong class="selflink">0001</strong></small></sup> 04:02, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! I just noticed that someone has been putting infobox-type things on the Miss Universe year pages (see <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Universe_2006_b5f2.html" title="Miss Universe 2006">Miss Universe 2006</a>). I think this is a GREAT idea but I think an actual template needs to be created (and there is some obvious formatting issues) and then subst-ed onto each page. Any chance you know how to do this? What do you think of the template fields? I think it's pretty good, not too sure about having withdraws/returns/newbies etc but I guess it's informative. Anyway see what you think... -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 22:16, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. That a curious one. For starters, I'm not sure that the copyrighted image is fair-use in an infobox like that. You have more image experience, what do you think? As far as the infobox itself, I'm starting to get OK with formatting and variables, so I think that I could give it a go. I don't think that I would subst it, I would make it like {{<a href="../../../p/a/g/Template%7EPageant_titleholder_bio_1209.html" title="Template:Pageant titleholder bio">Pageant titleholder bio</a>}} in that the variables would be specified in the template call. Let me know what you think about that and the image and then I'll try to get started. I could call it {{<a href="../../../b/e/a/Template%7EBeauty_pageant_9340.html" title="Template:Beauty pageant">Beauty pageant</a>}} and it could possibly be used other pageants (like Miss USA xxxx, Miss Teen xxxx, ....) as well. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><strong class="selflink">0001</strong></small></sup> 00:59, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the logo shouldn't be used... and also that basing the new infobox on "Pageant titleholder bio" sounds like a great idea. It definitely needs to have the pageant title (e.g. "Miss Universe 2006") in bold at the top, which the current template seems to lack.

<dd>Ok well I think it looks great. I guess the one thing that looks a bit funny is the "represented" bit... esp for USA. Perhaps rather than linking <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Kentucky_USA_845e.html" title="Miss Kentucky USA">Miss Kentucky USA</a> straight out we could pipe link it with "Kentucky"? One other thing... do we really need the "placements" field...? I'm not so sure. One thing I think it <i>does need</i> is an "Awards" field (Congeniality &amp; Photogenic only). Anyway info we need for this (apart from number of delegates) is practically all available on Pageant Almanac so it should be easy to fill in! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater">PageantUpdater</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater">contribs</a>) 02:46, 11 March 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>Are you saying that you don't like the word "represented" or the way it displays? Piping the link works just fine, so go ahead and do that if you want. The placements is there since it was on the original. If you lave any field blank (or just exclude it) then it won't show up, but it will still be there for other pageants that may want it.

<dd>It's looking good. One thing I'd suggest is changing "interval acts" to "entertainment". What do you think about Congeniality &amp; Photogenic? I initially thought it was a good idea but now aren't so sure. Could it be possible to put a bold heading "Awards" on the left and then have Congeniality and Photogenic under hat as they are now but not in bold? -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 05:03, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just woke up, and I see that you made the change for entertainment, but not for the awards. Please let me know if you decided that you like it as is, or if you just wanted me to try my magic to make it do what you want. I think that I know what to do for that, but I won't be able to do anything for the next few hours.

<p>I noticed you changed my date of birth, I assume you retrieved that date of birth from IMDB. I am in a lawsuit with them for this reason, I wrote an older DOB in 1995 on my PLAYBOY data sheet and this spiraled into a mess Ive been slowly fixing. If you like you can email me at countessleon@aol.com and I can send you a copy of my ID to prove this if you need. Thanks in advance Priscilla</p>

<p>Hello; First, I apologize for not having accompanied my edits with edit summaries. In Egypt, last name are insignificant, because they change with time. For instance, if your name is FIRST MIDDLE LAST, your son or daughter who has X as first name, will be called X FIRST MIDDLE. Thus, with time, your last name disappears and, 3 generations later, even your 1st name will disappear. Your grandson or grand-daughter will have your first name as their last name. This is why Egyptian names are categorized on a first name basis. Thanks for your understanding. --<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELanternix_d4bd.html" title="User:Lanternix">Lanternix</a> 18:14, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, cool. Thank you. I always find it interesting how some people respond to messages on other people's talk pages. I know that "anyone" can do "anything" on a wiki, and I understand how someone can easily respond to another person's question when it is factual in nature, but I am often surprised when someone feels qualified to offer an opinion on behalf of someone else (unless the people involved have an established relationship or one is off-wiki for extended time). --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><strong class="selflink">0001</strong></small></sup> 15:46, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I see your point, those wikiproject reactions weren't very nice and smell of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWNership</a>.

<p>Hi! It's sure taken me a while but I've finally completed the Miss USA year articles up to 1995... would you be able to wikilink them in?</p>
<p>I think I'm going to work on completing the Teen articles next, particulary 2002 since it's just made history as the first Teen group to have 2 Miss USAs! -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 07:48, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem. I'll try to get it soon, but I am traveling and not sure I can do it until I get back to my scripts on my home PC in a couple days. BTW, did you get to look at that Alaska thing? --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><strong class="selflink">0001</strong></small></sup> 07:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for reminding me... just looked it up... according to an AP article I pulled up "Kristina Christopher-Taylor" was definitely the name of Miss Alaska 1985. According to Pageantopolis, "Kim Christopher-Taylor" was Miss Alaska USA 1986. So perhaps sisters? -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 07:57, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OK, thanks. That pretty much eliminates vandalism. If we get any reference for a family relationship we can always note it later. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><strong class="selflink">0001</strong></small></sup> 07:59, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Saw in your userpage that you are an advanced mathematician. Was wondering if, by any chance, your field of expertise happens to be lambda calculus. I work in that field, so it would be good to be acquainted with others in the same field of expertise. :) --<span style="background-color: #Fda;"><i><a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoumyasch_cb30.html" title="User:Soumyasch"><font color="#FF6633">soum</font></a></i> <a href="../../../s/o/u/User_talk%7ESoumyasch_8605.html" title="User talk:Soumyasch">(0_o)</a></span> 07:51, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
