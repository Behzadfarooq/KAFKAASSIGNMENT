<p>Prime Minister Qarase announced on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">4 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> that the government would establish a "<a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconciliation_and_Unity_Commission_%28Fiji%29_ea7d.html" title="Reconciliation and Unity Commission (Fiji)">Reconciliation and Unity Commission</a>" empowered to recommend <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty.html" title="Amnesty">amnesty</a> for persons involved in the coup, provided that their motive had been "political" and that they had not done so with "criminal intent." <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leader_of_the_Opposition_54c2.html" title="Leader of the Opposition">Opposition Leader</a> Chaudhry condemned the proposed Commission, alleging that it would be a cover for pardoning members of the present government who were implicated in the coup. Chaudhry insisted that one set of rules should apply to everyone, regardless of their position in society, and regardless of their motives for having broken the law. He was supported by <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Alliance_Party_of_Fiji_b186.html" title="National Alliance Party of Fiji">National Alliance Party</a> president <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratu.html" title="Ratu">Ratu</a> <a href="../../../e/p/e/Epeli_Ganilau_bc3a.html" title="Epeli Ganilau">Epeli Ganilau</a> and by <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Peoples_Party_%28Fiji%29_46e4.html" title="United Peoples Party (Fiji)">United Peoples Party</a> leader <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Beddoes_7efe.html" title="Mick Beddoes">Mick Beddoes</a>. Ganilau said that the notion that politically motivated crimes could be justified was <i>"insulting to the intelligence of ordinary people,"</i> and that it represented a naive and uncaring attitude toward the hurt suffered by many during the 2000 coup. <i>"The intention to bring a closure to investigations and litigation regarding the 2000 coup would be a severe interference of politics into the work of law enforcement in this country,"</i> Ganilau said. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">18 May</a>, he added that he saw "nothing reconciliatory about the bill," which he believed to be aimed at legalizing the Muanikau Accord, which had been proposed by George Speight in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>. <i>"To use the word reconciliation is a gross violation of the rights of everyone in this nation,"</i> he said. Beddoes, for his part, called the proposal a recipe for disaster which would licence any would-be political activist who wanted to engage in coups, to do so. He accused the government of kow-towing to its junior <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition.html" title="Coalition">coalition</a> partner, the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Alliance_%28Fiji%29_b328.html" title="Conservative Alliance (Fiji)">Conservative Alliance</a>, on which it depends for its parliamentary majority, in order to keep them on board until the next <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_election_of_2006.html" title="Fiji election of 2006">parliamentary election</a>, expected for <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_3.html" title="May 3">3 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Ridgeway_d6f5.html" title="Peter Ridgeway">Peter Ridgeway</a>, resigned in protest against political interference in the judicial system, namely the early release of prisoners. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_20.html" title="June 20">20 June</a>, he was ordered to leave Fiji and return to his native <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> after Prime Minister Qarase vetoed a two-month extension of his contract. Ridgeway had been responsible for a number of high-profile prosecutions, and opposition politicians thought that his dismissal and expulsion were politically motivated.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_Radio_Australia_0a19.html" title="ABC Radio Australia">ABC Radio Australia</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney-General_of_Fiji_8f73.html" title="Attorney-General of Fiji">Attorney-General</a> <a href="../../../q/o/r/Qoriniasi_Bale_d85b.html" title="Qoriniasi Bale">Qoriniasi Bale</a> said that it was the government's prerogative to decide on the employment of foreign workers in the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_service.html" title="Civil service">civil service</a>. Ridgeway's contract had been for a fixed term and had already expired. <i>"It was subject to renewal at the option of the employer,"</i> Bale said. <i>"It is not at his option or the option of any other person who may support him or whatever else."</i> He denied that there was anything sinister about refusing Ridgeway the requested two-month contract extension to complete cases he had been working on.</p>
<p>Ridgeway's expulsion was condemned by <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leader_of_the_Opposition_%28Fiji%29_e0ca.html" title="Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)">Opposition Leader</a> <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahendra_Chaudhry_d70a.html" title="Mahendra Chaudhry">Mahendra Chaudhry</a> and by <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Peoples_Party_%28Fiji%29_46e4.html" title="United Peoples Party (Fiji)">United Peoples Party</a> leader <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Beddoes_7efe.html" title="Mick Beddoes">Mick Beddoes</a>, who claimed that the decision motivated by Ridgeway's prosecution of persons close to the government. He said that "two very prominent figures" were among those being pursued by Ridgeway; he did not name them, but one is believed to be former Prime Minister <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitiveni_Rabuka_05d1.html" title="Sitiveni Rabuka">Sitiveni Rabuka</a>. Beddoes predicted that these cases would <i>"now gather dust."</i></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">23 June</a>, Police Commissioner <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Hughes_%28police%29_eaec.html" title="Andrew Hughes (police)">Andrew Hughes</a> said he hoped that Ridgeway's expulsion would not affect the investigations and prosecutions underway. The Australian <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Commission_50c1.html" title="High Commission">High Commission</a> in <a href="../../../s/u/v/Suva.html" title="Suva">Suva</a> also said that it had been in touch with Fiji's Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the matter. It did not give details. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Foreign_Ministers_of_Fiji_1db2.html" title="List of Foreign Ministers of Fiji">Foreign Minister</a> <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaliopate_Tavola_6cd4.html" title="Kaliopate Tavola">Kaliopate Tavola</a> was "too busy" to comment at the immediately, but later said that he had discussed the affair with Australia's <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Commissioner_2c7a.html" title="High Commissioner">High Commissioner</a>, Jennifer Rawlins. Relations with Australia, he said, would have to go on despite the "unfortunate" circumstances surrounding the dismissal of Ridgeway in what he called <i>"a one-off situation."</i> He did not believe the controversy would tarnish Fiji's image.</p>
<p>The Military commander, Commodore Bainimarama, reacted angrily to Ridgeway's expulsion, saying on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_25.html" title="June 25">25 June</a> that it would seriously hinder investigations, which would have to start all over again. Ridgeway himself concurred. <i>"There is nobody in the DPP’s office who has the knowledge of the coup cases that I do,"</i> he said. <i>"And the reason for that is obvious: I have had an instrumental role in each and every coup case; I know it backwards. Nobody knows it as well as I do. For somebody to read into those sort of cases would be a six months job."</i></p>
<p>Bainimarama further alleged that Ridgeway was <i>"almost closing in on"</i> some major perpetrators of the coup when he was ordered to leave.</p>
