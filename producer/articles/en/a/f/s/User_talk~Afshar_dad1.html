<p>Do you have an image you can release under the [GFDL] of the setup of your experiment that looks like the setup <a href="http://wiz.cath.vt.edu/exper/kcramer/blogpix/Ashargraphic.jpg" class="external text" title="http://wiz.cath.vt.edu/exper/kcramer/blogpix/Ashargraphic.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>? If not, I can make something that looks similiar in <a href="../../../g/i/m/GIMP_b6ef.html" title="GIMP">The Gimp</a> on Wednesday or Thursday. I think this page will work a lot better with pictures, but we can't just steal stuff from web pages here on the Wikipedia.</p>
<p>By the way, you are being very civilized about some of the conflicts. I have minimized the information on multiple pages, since it was multiple copies of the same thing; things like that means it's time to merge on the Wikipedia. The list is on <a href="../../../a/f/s/Talk%7EAfshar_experiment_13df.html" title="Talk:Afshar experiment">Talk:Afshar experiment</a>. The only page where I <i>completely</i> removed any reference to your experiment is on <a href="../../../n/i/e/Niels_Bohr_303e.html" title="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>, for the same reason we don't say on the <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> page "Einstein's special theory of relativity violates Newtonian mechanics at high velocities" <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamboy_e9bc.html" title="User:Samboy">Samboy</a> 11:09, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/0/6/206e60d2e3f6f527cf00358b731c17a5.png" alt="V\approx 0" /></dd>
</dl>
In order to argue that there is any interference, the effects of the wires must first be seen. This effect is very small even if the wires are placed at the interference <i>maxima</i>, and the visibility is therefore also small. Shahriar Afshar, on the other hand, argues that the visibility is close to 100 percent. Effectively, he uses one set of photons to measure the "which way information", and another, tiny set of photons to study "interference", which is not correct. According to Halperin and Motl, the Principle of Complementarity, as well as all other important postulates of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, are preserved. The results of this experiment agree with quantum mechanics and all of its mainstream interpretations; in fact, classical <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electromagnetism.html" title="Electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a> is sufficient to explain the observations, they say.</blockquote>

Dear Cdang, please REMOVE the analogy you have suggested. The photon is not like a whirlpool and I do not have the time right now to explain how the wave-particle duality can be popularized. But I promise to write something when I get the time. In the meantime I would appreciate if you place your analogy back HERE, so the uninitiated don't get more confused. Thanks! --<a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 00:25, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The other analogy has been removed. I would love if you could write your popularized version. Both this and <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonon.html" title="Phonon">phonon</a> need some down-to-earthing... Everyone says "these things are quantum weirdness!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Based on one of your recent edits, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Afshar_experiment&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31993464" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Afshar_experiment&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31993464" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, it apears that you are using a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a> or are impersonating User:Physicsmonk. This is more or less frowned upon in Wikipedia, and the use of this to cast double votes or make inappropriate edits might get you banned. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 20:55, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dear Linas, You can't call anyone who supports my work a sockpuppet! User:Physicsmonkis certainly not a sockpuppet either, he is the Boston colleague I mentioned in my e-mail. I asked him to set up an account as you had suggested. He told me about the recent events with Monroe requesting a deletion and then you reinstating Monroe's attempt which I mistakenly understood as your own view. Sorry if I got confused on your vote! At any rate, User:Physicsmonk told me that for some reason he could not post his vote on the Wiki deletion page, which is what I did for him by copying and pasting his response to User:Hmonroe into the vote page. As you can see, I have not voted on the deletion issue myself as I deem that not to be ethical. I hope this clarifies the situation. BTW/ I have posted the e-mail I sent you a few days agao but was left unanswered in your talk page. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 21:15, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Linas, the IP you mentioned belongs to the colleague User:Physicsmonk with whom I worked and used his computer last year before I had set up my own Wiki account. After my recent discussions with you I asked him to obtain an account as well, which is exactly what he has done. He retracted the anonymous vote after he realized I had posted his vote for him (see below for the reason). Please stop these unsubstantiated remarks. Frankly, I am starting to think that Hunter Monroe is in fact your sockpuppet?! <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 23:18, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Afshar, responding to your comments on my talk page. It's not really helpful to try to argue the correctness of your ideas on Wikipedia. It's not the right forum to be trying to promote your own ideas. As you can see from the "votes for deletion" page, a number of those voting to keep were convinced after reading the article that the results themselves are something new and unexpected, disproving quantum mechanics. Surely you would agree that the article is misleading if it gives this impression. As a side note, I have enough understanding of quantum mechanics myself that I'm not likely to be convinced by your arguments. --<a href="../../../r/e/u/User%7EReuben_aaa3.html" title="User:Reuben">Reuben</a> 18:28, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>About removing the AFD tag from Afshar experiment. Sorry to give you the impression that I am in control of anything. I am not an admin. I believe an admin has to count the votes, deal with the page accordingly, remove tag, archive disscussion, whatever. I left a note on the AfD page, maybe that will remind someone. Don't forget wikipedia ia all amateurs, a certain slack is to be expected. I suppose a message to somewhere on the Community Portal page maybe in order, I'm not exactly sure to whom.

<p>Dear Prof. Afshar,</p>
<p>The article Incompletness of quantum physics could use some help.</p>
<p>In particular it would be helful if the article could be extended to report on the following published work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carlo Rovelli. "Relational quantum mechanics" <i>International Journal of Theoretical Physics</i> <b>35</b> 1637-1678. 1996.</li>
<li>Federico Laudisa and Carlo Rovelli. "Relational Quantum Mechanic" <i>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> (Fall 2005 Edition).</li>
</ul>
<p>The results in Incompletness of quantum physics are important in computer science. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Carl_Hewitt_Workshop_944e.html#The_use_of_indeterminacy" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Carl Hewitt/Workshop">Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Carl_Hewitt/Workshop#The_use_of_indeterminacy</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Carl_Hewitt_Workshop_d23d.html#Aggressive_autobiographical_editing" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Carl Hewitt/Workshop">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Carl_Hewitt/Workshop#Aggressive_autobiographical_editing</a>.</p>

Remarks like "spiteful non-entity" to Danko certainly count as a personal attack. Also, it does not help to say "Please check the facts before you make erroneous statements." to Stifle, after both Linas and I have already challenged him. I understand your frustration that <a href="../../../a/f/s/Afshar_experiment.html" title="Afshar experiment">Afshar experiment</a> got nominated for deletion again, but it is not a big deal. I've been around for long enough to know that the article won't be deleted, but your vociferous defense is counterproductive. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 13:49, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the advice. But don't you think something is fundamentally wrong with a system where a known crackpot (or worse, an ill-wisher) can attack and bring chaos to serious topics of which he knows nothing? FYI/Danko is a Pharmacology student in Japan. If you look at my weblog, you would realize that for months in 2005 I patiently tired to explain the basics to him, but he kept changing his story after every error was exposed. I'm done talking and if he is not stopped I'm done with Wikipedia. I do not have time to constantly monitor what goes on here.--<a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 16:56, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is indeed a problem. However, it is very hard to resolve this issue without damaging the openness of Wikipedia and the ease with which people can edit it, and the latter is essential to Wikipedia's success. The downside is that continuous monitoring is needed. There are some ways to stop disruptive editors, as mentioned in <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution</a> and, for extreme cases, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_69c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking">Wikipedia:Blocking</a>, but editors are given quite a bit of leeway here. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 18:02, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Dear S. Afshar I have a suggestion for you: after a brief discussion with linas and after reading and reading again your WP page I accepted the fact that the first part presenting the experiment is mot so bad that I expected. Perhaps indeed the best choice would be that after this first section you write some theoretical explanations justifying your thought. This part should clearly precise that this is Your point of view (at least in one sentence at the beginning). At the end of the article the serie of links must be presented as other potential interpretations of your results. If you think that this is a good idea let me know <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrezet_d217.html" title="User:Drezet">Drezet</a> 24 january 2006</p>

<p>About your email about your problems with Certain User, if you can't work it out with him, the next step may be requesting mediation, or last step, Request for Arbitration. Look a Village Pump for what to do. Look at some of the current csses to se how it works. Let me mention though that there is a rule against legal threats against other users; that would not be favorable to you. Also, a content dispute, per se, is not a wiki-crime, there has to be breaking of other rules. Accusations of fraud may be "attacking a user". May I suggest keeping your responses on the scientific level, his attacks are scientifically based, he claims. Does he have credibility that you need worry about his charges?

If you feel that you have a case in law and wish to pursue it, you will be blocked from editing Wikipedia under the provisions of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_legal_threats_370c.html" title="Wikipedia:No legal threats">the legal-threats policy</a> until the case has concluded its course. If you wish to continue editing Wikipedia, you must cease all legal threats. This is hardline because we do not wish to see Wikipedians sueing each other whilst squabbling on talk pages. Fine, I hope you understand that.

As Wikipedia is a collaborative exercise, resolution is necessary. Unfortunately. the more you argue, the mor likely you are to get angry, make personal comments and be blocked from editing yourself.

<dd>Dear Afshar, I have written to <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_2055.html#SUGGESTION.21" title="User talk:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko</a> with the conclusion that unsubstantiated claims have no place on Wikipedia (you can see my reasoning on his talk page). I hope that he sees that such an argument is pointless here. It would probably be best if you refrained from making personal comments to or about Danko, which may simply reignite the issue. I advise you to continue to be circumspect about the article, realising the complications that arise from editing something that is so personally associated with you. I hope that Danko will agree that Wikipeida is not a forum for his claims. However, if he insists on continuing to make them, we may have to refer the issue to the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_committee_389d.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration committee">Arbitration committee</a>, who have greater scope than I in enforcing solutions to disputes. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 11:53, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Professor Afshar I can perfectly understand your irritation at Danko, he also gets on my nerves. His arguments are wrong, his understanding of physics is poor and he is rather paranoid to boot. But I can't help it if he answers to my posts!</p>
<p>On the other hand I think I provided some important insight as to understanding why the results of your experiments are in perfect agreement with QM under any interpretation. I hold it that the clue to a clear understanding of the whole thing is Huygens principle, that shows that in only one pinhole is open, in the presence of the grid some amount (small in square amplitude, not so small in amplitude) of light reaches the image of the *other one*. Recovery of 100% when both pinholes are open is through positive interference between that light and what now arrives from the "right" pinhole. This means in particular that this is not an unambiguous "welcher weg" situation. I submit that an amplitude coming from the "wrong pinhole", even if its effect is precisely to *destroy* the effect of part (diffracted part as opposed to direct part) of what comes from the first one, is nevertheless "real", and in the same sense that in a dark fringe amplitude of opposite signs coming from both holes "exist" though they cancel each other. Consider a simple minded Young slits experiement. Take a a point near, but not exactly at the center of a dark fringe. The small amount of light that does get there, where does it come from? From both holes at the same time, with amplitudes that are almost but not quite opposite. By extension this is also true at the exact center of the fringe. Saying that nothing gets there is wrong. Amplitude come there from both holes but they exactly cancel. So the cancellation of the 6% loss in your experiement when both holes are open does not mean that the first hole does not scatter, but that the second one scatters the opposite amplitude. This is a different statement, and it shows that one cannot describe the process as "unambiguous welcher weg".</p>
<p>Now I developed my arguments in the posts you moved. Do you consider my interventions as unsuitable "per se" in the discussion page of your experiment, or only usuitabe because of Danko's comments? Do you mind if I copy them (just mine, not Danko's) and put them back?</p>
<p>I dont want to antagonize you, nor do I want to encourage Danko, but I think my analyssis is important and I'd like to put it back in connection with your article, not just in my personal page! <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfredr_551a.html" title="User:Alfredr">Alfredr</a> 22:58, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Afshar, calm down. I will not post on the talk page of your pet article, and <b>you have noticed my absence for quite a long period - I have been focused on molecular biology, not physics</b>. I was brough to your article by irrelevant to your study search, and I was curious to find out that some people have editted the main article! So I wanted to get their replies WHY they have editted the main article. Basicly their critique seens to approach the questions that I have asked you many times, and if you were a little bit more communicative you should notice that if you look the problem from the density matrix perspective you will see your error and you better withdraw your work. It is your own choice so I am not the person who will be cause for your failure. My advice is to accept your error in more civilized way and go ahead with doing some serious physics. I have not touched the main article, and I will not touch also the disussion section. I will use the talk pages of the registered users. I hope this will satisfy your quest.

<ul>
<li>Question: do you have some useful edits in Wikipedia except for promoting your interpretation of complementarity? A friendly advice is that you contribute something else that you know, but is NOT for self-promotion. Have you thought of doing something useful for others without putting your name behind? For example you can try editing on some topic well-known in physics but not covered in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 07:47, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Excuse my ignorance, but how do half silvered mirrors work? Surely if you fire a stream of photons at a half silvered mirror, the photon must "choose" one of two paths to take. Does the path taken depend in microscopic deviations of the incident vector and position, or is it independent of this? In otherwords, is it a quantum effect or not? <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 00:10, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Afshar, I don't know whether you realize or not, but my work is much more than you expect right now. One of the striking things, that I also bust Unruh's reasoning and show he is wrong. Indeed I agree with you on all those things that your opponents disagree - yes, the interference is there. Alas, the which way is completely erased even IF there is no grid. This is your overlook, and you really had the chance to contribute substantially to the theory of lens action. However you have missed already this opportunity, because my paper clarifies all this. Here is how somebody who called me ignorant not long ago, now has changed his position completely (surprizingly for me).</p>
<p><i>"Danko's argument is extremely interesting. The axiomatic definition of V is no longer the same thing as an emperical definition of 'V' as might have otherwise been assumed. One can not math consistently say A and B. One must say A or B. And the argument for math consistency is an extremely powerful one. The prinicple requires (correction: it imposes) a limit on the inferential meaning of the "which way" observable, ie. in spite of the observable, not because of it. While the observables originally "forced" the principle into play it is now the principle which "forces" the observables into question (correction: into play). Which is almost a relief. Bohr's interpretational crutch, "there is no quantum world" is possibly incorrect. There is a lot more to be explored in relation to this question. --Carl A Looper 20:24, 21 November 2006 (UTC)"</i></p>

<p>I have no opinion on any of the edit conflicts that are going on involving you and other users. I don't understand any of this fancy-shmancy science. However, a word of advice: try to keep your comments as concise as possible. You tend to leave enormous paragraphs of text on talk pages, and while I appreciate that you are trying to eloquently make a point or state a case, other editors (particularly non-scientists) tend to blanche at having to read so much text. Just food for thought. I'm leaving this on Danko Georgiev's talk page too. If you ever find yourself in a conflict that reaches wikipedia bureaucracy, like mediation or arbitration, admins simply will not read it all!

<p>I have asked <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer">User:Seicer</a> to apologize for the above posting, and his rather rude, inflamed commentary on the Afshar experiment talk page. In the meanwhile, let me apologize on his behalf.

<p>While daydreaming on the topic of controversies, I thought of the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanbury-Brown_and_Twiss_effect_a57c.html" title="Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect">Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect</a>. It strikes me that your experiment has some similarities to that one; and not just in that its controversial. Perhaps the resemblance I notice is trivial; in that effect, photodetected photons behaved classically, even as they were photodetected one at a time; this seemed quite counter-intuitive. Given that your experiment behaves classically (I beleive you've heard me make my shallow "it behaves just like water waves" argument) up until the point that a photon must be detected, I see a vague similarity to the HB-T effect. Wonder if you've given this thought? <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 02:55, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have responded to your comments (and will continue to do so) at <a href="../../../a/f/s/Afshar_experiment.html" title="Afshar experiment">Afshar experiment</a>. My goal right now is to get at the heart of the dispute so we can move forward.

<p>Would you accept impartial mediation for the <a href="../../../a/f/s/Afshar_experiment.html" title="Afshar experiment">afshar experiment</a> article?

<dd>I have already been acting as an impartial mediator and have been involved in trying to sort out the article for a long time now. I had a break for a while, but recently saw an opportunity to achive the goal and I have made what I feel is important progress. But I have no problem with someone else having a go. I would recommend however that you familiarise yourself with the current situation first. We have just had confirmation that a simple description of the experiment which I put forward to Afshar does represent what Afshar claims. Thus as a starting point we should make use of this. I mention this fact because this achievement, which I consider significant to fixing the article, has just been achieved today. The point of having a nice short summary that anyone can understand is to make sure that the article is inteligible the everyday reader. I actually belive that up till now the article has actually been confusing to everyday reader and expert alike.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have in fact made fixing the article a mission of mine for a while now, and I am happy that it looks like it can now be achieved. Unfortunately, as you will see in the talk page, there has been much confusion and misinformation. I have been personally attacked for seeking clarity, because to some people I appear to have been asking stupid questions. In fact I have been asking questions to resolve the confusion. My plan was to now take the confirmed claims made by Afhsar and put them in the article. Then a debate should ensue about the relevance of various critiques *to the actual claims of Afshar*. At present this does not appear to be the case. Additionally, critiques should come from proper sources, and some people have been using the page to publish their own research. Although I work by the philosophy of it does not matter who edits as long as policy is adhered to, in my opinion critiques have been applied from people who are not of equivalent stature to Afhsar or the more notable criticisers such as Unruh, and who have biased perspectives, and who have perhaps been pushing other agendas.</dd>

<dd>You may have assumed, when you came to the page, that I was one of the trouble makers. But in fact I hope you will see on review of the current page at least, that I have been steering things in a helpful direction. You can be sure of my support, however, as it does not matter who does it, as long as it gets done, and do let me know if I can be of help.
