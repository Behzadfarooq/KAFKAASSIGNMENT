<p>The following point is missing it's counterpoint:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Niels Bohr stated "an adequate tool for a complementary way of description is offered precisely by the quantum-mechanical formalism"[11]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the photons in the experiment obey the precise mathematical laws of quantum mechanics (the formalism), how can Bohr's principle of complementarity be violated by the experiment?[13][14][15]</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The counterpoint, if I recall, was something like this (somewhat elaborated):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The experiment's obedience to the formalism can simply throw into question Bohr's claim that the formalism is an "adequate tool for a complementarity way of description". There is no great logical flaw here. Bohr may be just wrong. Basically, if the formalism is not violated by the experiment, yet complementarity is (if it is), then Bohr's claim is just incorrect.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If this counterpoint is to remain removed then the original point should also be removed as the structure of the ongoing debate section is meant to be, and remains introduced as having a point/counterpoint structure.</p>

<dd>Yes I agree with this, it has been my position since I first entered into this debate. Either there should be both points or neither.

<dd>I agree with Afshar. For anyone who recalls the origin of this section it was on the insistence of one editor, that certain points be made (in direct conflict with the opinion of other editors) that necessitated, as an alternative solution, the addition of the counterpoints. If the counterpoints are subsequently removed, so too should be the original points. I vote we just remove the whole section. It's hardly representative of the wider debate.

<dd><b>Do NOT delete</b>. The segment explicitly states that Bohr says the PC is tight to mathematial formalism. See my comment below on Afshar view of PC vs. HUR. If Bohr says that one first must disprove the math formalism, you cannot attribute some "wrong interpretation" to Bohr. Bohr is not alive to defend himself, so this quotation is sufficiently explicit. So from this quoation follows that Afshar MUST disprove the formalism, if he does not so, then he don't have rights to claim he has disproved Bohr. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 08:00, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do not, and cannot, have any opinion in this, as I am neutral. But it does seem (though I am not an expert) that the "counterpoint" does not directly refute Bohr's point, rather, it establishes conditions under which Bohr's claim could be shown to be false. This is a neutral, independent observation, and I support neither side. <a href="../../../s/d/i/User%7ESdirrim_3c1d.html" title="User:Sdirrim">Sdirrim</a> 17:03, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the first statement basically says "Complementarity is an essential part of the formalism, and since the experiement obeys the formalismn, it can't violate complementarity". The second statement says (or should say) that complementarity can be violated by an experiment that otherwise obeys the formalism. The second statement is correct and not the first, because if an experiment was found that showed a violation, the whole of the quantum mechanical formalism is not rendered invalid by it. Bohr simply presented an argument that suggested that because we can never observe complementarity being violated, we never need to face that paradox and have to try to explain it. In short Bohr was saying "there is nothing to see here, lets move on". His basis for this is the idea that what you can't observe does not matter. If you cannot observe a paradox, there is no paradox. Afshar's experiment may in fact show that it is possible to observe the paradox. If this is true, then the formalism is still valid, but only up to a point. It means that it is incomplete because it can not explain the paradox although it can adequately explain most other experimental observations. The first statement by itself is meaningless. It is in effect saying "Because Bohr was right it is impossible for complementarity to be violated." This is not a sensible thing to have in the article, in my opinion. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 00:55, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The formalism may very well be wrong as well, but such is not addressed by the experiment. Complementarity can still fail without the formalism failing. There is nothing in the formalism that requires complementarity be correct.

<dd>Well that's one definition of complementarity one could use, and if correct, the principle of complementarity would be redundant.

<dd>Can I suggest that a lot of effort has been put into a mathematical definition of complementarity which is very important work, but there are aspects of Bohr's principle which have yet to be defined in mathematical terms - if ever they can. Bohr's principle appears to emerge out of a failure to experimentally reproduce a particular kind of paradox - one implied by quantum theory. It is arguably, in such a failure that Bohr sees the substance of the principle. That there is something about the physical world (rather than the theory per se) that stops us "concluding a paradox". But what was the paradox? For that you need to look at the experiments proposed by Einstein in relation to the quantum theory. What was Einstein hoping to achieve? He was hoping to acheive something akin to what Afshar does acheive. I don't know how this is not so bleeding obvious. That said, we can't rely on Bohr to qualify his principle in response to Afshar's experiment - for obvious reasons. So instead we turn back to the quantum theory (the formalism) for some defense of complementarity. But it's not from the formalism that complementarity can be re-derived. It comes out of left field, as a postulate if you like - (supposedly logical) - that the physical world does not permit a high contrast paradox such as the one Afshar's experiment (and the formalism) might otherwise imply. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 00:58, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The non-commutation used in the unitary time evolution using the Schrödinger equation and the Hamiltonian is the result of the QM formalism (Fourier transforms) and embodied in Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (HUP) relations which <b>are NOT</b> the same as Bohr's Principle of Complementarity BPC. Fromulation of BPC was derived by a number of investigators such as Greenberger and Yasin, Englert and others in different ways (some using HUP, and some avoiding it completely), and is embodied in the Greenberger-Yasin inequality (V^2+K^2&lt;=1)--which for some strange reason has been called the Englert-Greenberger relation in Wikipeida, but that's another topic that needs correction. At any rate, the BPC deals not with the <b>deterministic</b> wavefunction time evolution process (as opposed to HUP), it rather deals with the measurement process addressed in the <b>measurement</b> theory that involves <b>non-deterministic</b> events such as the collapse of the wavefunction etc. My experiment violates NOT the deterministic QM formalism, it rather violates the BPC embodied in Greenberger-Yasin inequality.

<dd>Dear Afshar, your point is clear on the duality relation, but it is not shared by a lot of physicists. Indeed Qureshi, Reitzner, and me, have all shown that you do math error in calculating the which way "distiguishability" to be 1, as indeed it is zero. All of those 3 papers as far as I know are currently in process of peer-reviewing. Concerning the complementarity principle and HUR, while the duality relation has been shown to be independent on Heisenberg's inequalities, it is still the case that violation of complementarity will violate the HUR. The explanation is as above - you violate PC by inconsistent mathematics, and hence in inconsistent model everything is provable, including that HUR are not valid. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 07:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The thing I do not understand is how can it be said that which way "distiguishability" to be 0, when all photons not scattered by the wires appear to come from one hole or the other. The claim that distiguishability is 0 seems counter to experimental evidence, regardless of what the mathematics says. As I have argued previously, if we accept that distiguishability is 0 then this means that just because a photon appears to have come from a hole it does not mean that it did go through that hole. Through other arguments I have already presented this would mean that the only logical conclusion would be that photons do not travel in the classical sense of travelling at all, and that even with only one hole open, we still could not say that the photon went through the open hole. If it is appropriate for the article to have these mathematical "proofs" surely we need to also point out how this relates to what is actually observed? And do not these proofs also invalidate the application of complementarity because such application can have no meaning if which-way information has no meaning? This has been my question for a long time now, and I am still waiting for an answer. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 11:16, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First off, I just want to say that I have <b>no clue</b> as to what you are talking about. I am not versed in this field, and the technical discussion is over my head. However, I can (an will) address the OR argument. From <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>: "Original research refers to material that is not <i>attributable</i> to a reliable, published source. This includes unpublished facts, arguments, ideas, statements, and <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologisms.html" title="Neologisms">neologisms</a>; and any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position." As it stands right now, Danko, your 'claim' is not "attributable to a reliable, published source". If you can reference reliable, published sources for your claim, then your claim will not be considered to be OR. However, claims based on unpublished works are considered to be OR. Therefore, your unpublished papers are not valid references for the article. This is not to say, however, that your works are somehow inferior or worthless. They are just invalid for the purposes of Wikipedia referencing. If Afshar's references are not published yet, then his claims could be considered to be OR also. <a href="../../../s/d/i/User%7ESdirrim_3c1d.html" title="User:Sdirrim">Sdirrim</a> 19:06, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If a violation of complementarity throws the formalism into question, (as it might) it just means we might be able to see some violation of the formalism in the Afshar experiment. But if we don't - there are three possible reasons why - not just one. Either the suggested "knock on" effect is incorrect, or this effect has yet to be found, or the said violation of complementarity is incorrect. Three logical possibilitys.

<p>HUP does not explicitly deny nor confirm the identity one might otherwise assign the wave function and/or the path function of BPC. But BPC does. BPC suggests that one can not decouple the propertys of a wave function from it's identity - ie. that a measurement on it's propertys is a measurement on it's identity. In the Afshar experiment this is shown not to be the case. One can make a measurement on the identity of the wave function without making a measurement on it's propertys. Furthermore, one can make a measurement on the propertys of the path function without disrupting a measurement on the wave function's identity. Decoupling the path function from it's identity has not appear acheivable. Also, the path function serves two or three masters (is aliased between them) - 1. a particle detection signifys (post selects) one of two apertures, 2. a single aperture signifys (pre-selects) a single detector, 3. Two apertures are incapable of pre-selecting which detector will recieive a detection. The formalism is generally prospective - ie. concerns cases 2 and 3 on the path function. Case 1 is a classical reading of the path function and accords with the fact that a detection in a given detector signifys that it's corresponding aperture was open at a particular instant in time - ie. irregardless of whether the particle was in that aperture or in both. In simpler terms, although we can assign meaning to a detection (eg. it signifys an open aperture) we still can't assign meaning to the particle (ie. which detector will recieve the detection) unless only one aperture is open. This puts BPC in a compromised position - firstly, in the way that the wave function's identity can be decoupled from it's propertys (ie. there is a quantum world) and secondly, as a consequence of the first point, BPC either devolves into a logical but pointless statement regarding the status of the apertures (ie. only one aperture can be open, or two open, but not one and two open) - or BPC is incorrect, ie. that in the case of both apertures open, (ie. assuming BPC allows path functions in this case) a measurement on the identity of the wave function does not exclude a measurement on the path function - at least not in terms of case 1 of the path function. If BPC does not allow a path function, (ie. when both apertures are open), then BPC just returns back to being a pointless principle, ie. suggesting the logical but hardly profound statement, that only one aperture can be open, or two open, but not one and two open. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarllooper_dc07.html" title="User:Carllooper">Carllooper</a> 05:25, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Presentation on a preprint server like ArXiv certainly qualifies as "publication", but can it be considered a "reputable" source? Certainly a lot (hopefully most) of the articles there are reputable, but since there is no editorial selection or peer review, it is possible to publish junk there, and many articles certainly are junk. Perelman's proof is notable through it's coverage in the popular and technical press, so a link to the arXiv version is appropriate. Articles that appear <i>only</i> on a preprint server, without significant comments from other sources, can be considered in no way reliable and must be treated as original research, at least as far as the content is concerned.</dd>
<dd>In the present case, we are trying to describe a controversy/dialog. An online preprint is a reliable indication that a participant in the discussion makes a particular argument. If the preprints do not attract independent attention, then the question is how to decide which ones are notable enough to report. The only criterion that occurs to me, although it is difficult to apply neutrally, is to base inclusion on the notability of the author.</dd>

<dd>Ah, gee! <i>Very</i> ridiculous maybe, but surely not <i>extreme</i>?</dd>
<dd>I agree that the existence of a Wikipedia article is a poor criteria to determine notability. Publication in a preprint server is even worse. Please suggest a better alternative.</dd>
<dd>Talk pages are not for the purpose of discussing physics. Editorial arguments, such as the notability of an author, are the relevant criteria here. <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true."</dd>

<dd>Correct; however in order to maintain a neutral point of view counter arguements should be from sources of equivalent stature and notability as the sources for the arguments themselves. This is important because otherwise bias will occur. Print material is not necessary; if so we should have to take out Unruh's argument which has never been printed to my knowlegde. But Unruh makes up for this by being notable. If there is no limit to this then al kinds of people will jump in and try to gain notability through contributing to this article. That is not appropriate behavior for editors here. So what we need to do to resolve this is check the sources for the text that Afshar suggests removing. We then need to reach concensus on whether these sources are strong enough for inclusion here taking into account where they have previously been published in some form and who is responsible for them. Also, the view that path information does not exist even without the wires present needs to actually be relevant to what Afshar's paper claims. Finally, if the preseence of this view creates more problems than it resolves, it might be best to leave it out of the article. This is the reason for various arguments I presented about the consequences of accepting the view that there is no path information even without the wires. Very elementary logic will show that this would have far reaching consqeuences and thus cannot be trusted without a thourough review by experts.</dd>
<dd>My conclusion is simple; we leave a reference to a new wiki article to satisfy the needs of Danko et al, in which they can put their postulations. As far as I can see, they have no real place in *this* article. Surely this is a viable solution? <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 18:54, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Dndn, previously Linas has put equivalent example with water waves, that creates the Afshar observations, the lensing is achieved by varying the depth of the water tank, there are two slits, there is image. All this is explainable only by wave properties and never requires particle-like trajectory. Every image of a slit in the water setup is created by wave that passes through both slits, so no which way. Reply to Carlson, e-prints are notable enough, because the claims are verifiable. Everyone can download and read the paper. Unruh's and Motl's blogs are extremely bad sources, because there is no full argument, only sketch of a such, which <b>is proven to be false argument</b>, and always remember that this blog page can any moment be deleted so there will be NO RECORD of what has been said or written. Motl and Unruh after the deletion can deny what they have said or written. In contrast deletion from the e-print cannot be done freely by the author, and in case of ArXiv the original paper always remains on the server, there appears new [src] version that says that paper is removed, but you can always read it via clicking on version 1. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 06:44, 3 March 2007 (UTC) p.s. (regarding the bolded part of my post) If one is not competent to judge whether a provided proof is valid or not, how/why such incompetent editor should be able to propose deletions of text that he/she is incompetent to understand.

<dd>Danko, you persistently misunderstand what we are trying to do here. we are not here to argue of our own personal viewpoints on the experiment or other experiments. My reasons for presenting arguments that I present have been for the sake of trying to gain clarity for the non expert reader which is what this article should be for. Hence I ask lots of questions where things are not clear. If you state something that does not make sense, I will ask questions. Check my posts and you will see this pattern. Personal conclusions I try to keep off this page (if there have been infringements, appologies to anyone who cares). However what you do is bring in all kinds of sources that have not been vetted by anyone but yourself, you present OR arguments. Additionally, it is not our job to validate proofs. This is why there is no need for what you call a competant editor. We should be reporting on competancy here, not providing it. The question is only whether what you claim meets the standards of Wikipedia for inclusing in the article. I do not believe so. Additionally the inclusion of all this material you present appears to only confuse the reader. For example, you give an example of a similat experiment conducted using water waves and yet I can not for the life of me see the connection. Water waves are waves, and it is clear how those waves are supposed to behave. The point about Afshar's experiment is not that the behavior agrees with wave nature of light, but that it does so while also retaining which-way information for individual photons. In the water based experiment there is no equivalent of photons. So there is no valid comparison. Thus, either answer my question for the sake of creating a clarity, or clarify what you say so that it does make sense, or take such irrelevances away from the discussion.</dd>

<dd>One further thing, an e-print is not notable by itself. Notability is assessed by concensus.

<dd>Dear Dndn, when it comes to science you must understand what you write. Competence here is what matters. The usage of appropriate words, and expressions cannot be estimated properly by not competent editor. The fact that you don't understand the subtle differences between various formulations, and the fact that you don't understand what is the link between "water waves" and "light waves" just reveals your incompetence. Yet I don't mind to help you: the term "wave". Wikipedia accumulates useful information due to competent editors that edit topics that they understand, and some entries get spoiled because there are unfortunately editors that are incompetent in what they are writing. I will not respond to any further comments by Dndn, as I believe his posts are off-topic, incompetent and derogatory. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 12:17, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Carlson, I usually deposit most of my work to be available free at e-prints, and I am well acquainted with the requirements. For each section there is moderator, that allows for the newly added "pending items" to be publicly available. You have to be registeres, and if you are not scientist, and/or your manuscript does not satisfy the criteria for scientific work, it will be embargoed by the moderator. This does not mean that the work is peer-reviewed, but e-print is NOT blog, and e-prints contain PhD theses, as well as newly written revolutionary works that have not passed peer-review (the <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grisha_Perelman_f6f7.html" title="Grisha Perelman">Grisha Perelman</a> case). E-prints are verifiable sources, and reputable in sense that you can check the registration data of the author, which is subject to moderation also. Of course you may try to register yourself with pseudonym, and try to upload a nonsense paper/joke just to disprove me experimentally. I don't believe that you will succeed to do this, especially in arXiv where operates a novel endorcement system. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 13:13, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dr. Georgiev, you know more about the preprint system than I do, but the article on <a href="../../../a/r/x/ArXiv_671d.html#Peer-review" title="ArXiv">arXiv#Peer-review</a> states, "Endorsement comes from either another arXiv author who is an endorser or is automatic, depending on various evolving criteria. Endorsers are not asked to review the paper for errors, but to check if the paper is appropriate for the intended subject area." This sounds like a very low bar, so I still think publication in a preprint server is not <i>in itself</i> sufficient reason to cite an idea in a Wikipedia article. Do you really think that <i>is</i> reason enough, in any case? --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Carlson_64f0.html" title="User:Art Carlson">Art Carlson</a> 14:23, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I feel a clarification is needed here: Danko's paper is in PhilSci archive (a "Philosophy of Science" archive which has a very low credibility in physics if any.) Qureshi's paper is under peer-review, and I know he is having trouble getting his paper published. Reitzner "paper" is only two pages and merely a comment, lacking a reasonable level of detail for a paper in physics. Although Qureshi and Reitzner papers are on arXiv, neither authors are notable, and since arXiv is not a reputable peer-reviewed reference, their thesis including Danko's, which challenges established physics literature MUST be considered OR according to Wiki rules and removed from the article. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 05:27, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Following the request of Dr. Georgiev, I have reviewed relevant Wikipedia policy. I found nothing that explicitly talks about preprint servers. The most directly relevant official policy is <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html#Using_questionable_or_self-published_sources" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution#Using questionable or self-published sources</a>, which states in part:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>A <b>questionable source</b> is one with no editorial oversight or fact-checking process .... Questionable sources may only be used in articles about themselves.</i></li>
<li><i>A <b>self-published source</b> is material that has been published by the author, or whose publisher is a vanity press, a web-hosting service, or other organization that provides little or no editorial oversight. ... With self-published sources, no one stands between the author and publication; the material may not be subject to any form of fact-checking, legal scrutiny, or peer review. ... For that reason, self-published material is largely not acceptable.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition, the discussion under <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_FAQ_f2c5.html#Does_this_mean_we_have_to_include_every_crank_view_that_can_get_itself_published.3F" title="Wikipedia:Attribution/FAQ">Wikipedia:Attribution/FAQ#Does this mean we have to include every crank view that can get itself published?</a> ends with the question:</p>

</dl>
<p>Strictly applying policy, I think we would have to delete this section. I have some reservations because it might very well be of interest to some readers to easily access this information even if it is not reliable. A solution might be a footnote with links to all arXiv articles that reference Afshar's work. I would probably support a compromise along this line, but until someone works out a consensual proposal, I have to vote to <b>DELETE</b>.

<dd>I'm reluctant to delete - not because I disagree with the arguments provided for removing such (ie. what is Wikipedia permitted and what isn't) but because the debate is very important, ie. irregardless of Wikipedia guidlines. One possible compromise is to set up a new "sister" article - that is about the debate - as distinct from being about the experiment, - and all the debate references moved there - where they can continue being edited. I don't know if this new article would be any more allowed than the current situation. Can one have an article about debates? If one can have an article about, say, "intelligent design", I can't see why one can't have an article about something more substantial, such as the debate in question. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 22:42, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, let me comment on the comments that Afshar has made here.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Qureshi's paper is under peer-review, and I know he is having trouble getting his paper published.</i></p>
<p>I would like Afshar to mention his sources for claiming that I am having difficulty in getting my paper published. This paper was written in mid January 2007, and in mid March 2007, somebody is claiming that I am having difficulty in having the work published. Let me mention here that Afshar's experiment was done in 2004, and it has appeared in a peer reviewed journal in 2007.</p>
<p>Danko's paper has appeared in <b>Progress in Physics</b>, a peer reviewed journal. Here is the link: <a href="http://www.ptep-online.com/index_files/2007/PP-09-19.PDF" class="external text" title="http://www.ptep-online.com/index_files/2007/PP-09-19.PDF" rel="nofollow">Single Photon Experiments and Quantum Complementarity</a> So, it should not be treated as OR, whatever that ridiculous term means on this forum. So, now there is published, peer-reviewed paper showing there is no which-way information in Afshar's experiment.</p>
<p>Although this article is about Afshar's experiment, it is our duty to make sure that the reader is not led to erroneously believe that complementarity is violated. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabish_q_9513.html" title="User:Tabish q">Tabish q</a> 15:13, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bill Unruh is an expert in the field. The problem with sources such as ArXiv is that someone under the name of Bill Unruh, or Bill Unruh himself, could post a paper containing complete <i>bogus</i>. Also, it would remain there because there is no peer review, and because only the author can actually <b>remove</b> the paper. Sure, a moderator could "embargo" a paper. But, as someone supporting ArXiv said, "This does not mean that the work is peer-reviewed". Now, from <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>: "<i>A questionable source is one with no editorial oversight or fact-checking process</i>".

<li>I absolutely agree with Michael. Personally, even if Unruh's work was scribbled on a torn piece of tissue, I would still consider it a reliable source! I think in case of Unruh his very name should suffice to make his work not subject to Wiki OR rules. BTW/ One CANNOT post a bogus paper on arXiv using someone else’s name, because Cornell University admins. check the author’s affiliations and e-mail routes before they post it. Nonetheless, it is the author’s reputation that makes the arXiv papers notable, especially if the expert happens to have published numerous papers on the subject in the reputable peer-reviewed journals in the past, which is definitely the case with Prof. Unruh. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 20:55, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe Danko has shown himself incapable of understanding wikipedia policy, incapable of civilised discussion and obstructive to the process of creating a good article. He is attacking personally anyone who disagrees with his point of view. He refuses to answer questions asked to help clarify what he is actally saying if it does not suit him to attempt to do so.</p>
<p>Thus I propose that we make a formal request to ban Danko from this article. This would be regretable, however I can not see how we can possibly make progress if we are fending Danko off all the time.</p>
<p>Even if this formal request is met, it will not stop Danko from contributing to other articles in Wikipedia or indeed follow the constructive suggestion I made of starting a new article to deal with more detailed counter arguments related to the Afshar Experiment, which can be assessed by editors on its own merrit, but would at least allow us to complete our task here.</p>
<p>The mission here is to create an article that conforms to wikipedia policy. There has been a recent streamlining of wikipedia policy with regards to editing articles. For&#160;:those who are not aware, these are now <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>.

I believe it is clear by reading through these articles that Danko is persistently ignoring wikipedia policy and worse than that attacking anyone who tries to explain this policy to him.</p>
<p>What choice can there really be but to ban him?</p>
<p>Please add your choice below, either BAN or DO NOT BAN. This can then be used to help wikipedia admins reach a decision of what to do. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 12:09, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm afraid I agree. Sorry Danko, but once you've published your claims in a reputable peer-reviewed journal you are welcome to include your thesis in the article.

<p>I agree too, D. Georgiev confused the role of wikipedia with a monograph. The aim of the 'Afshar experiment page' is to present objectively and neutrally the result of the experiment and not to humiliate always its author. Georgiev is passionate but this is not sufficient to excuse all. Why also to play like that? Additionally if the theory of Georgiev was right it would not be necessary to create all this senseless debate .This is more than enough: <b>BAN</b> <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrezet_d217.html" title="User:Drezet">Drezet</a> 12:47, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>DO NOT BAN</b> - What Danko is saying regarding the science is completely correct (in my view) - but his abuse of Prof Afshar is completley incorrect - and Danko is incapable of separating the two. I should also add that Prof Afshar, in my view, is also completely correct. Danko - if the wave function is always valid (quantum realism) the path function is never valid - other than as an approximation of the wave function - and therefore complementarity is just redundant or incorrect. But Bohr's Complementarity implys the wave function can have an ontological leave of absence, in the inter-measurement interval by virtue of the epistomological holiday it otherwise enjoys during this interval. But Afshar holds the wave function to account, for the entire duration of the experiment. So it has no opportunity to have a holiday. It is ontologically always there. In quantum realism the wires are not necessary since the formalism is interpreted as ontological rather than epistomological. An ontological formalism always holds the wave function to account - it can never have a break. So quantum realism already violates complementarity. Bohr was not a quantum realist ("there is no quantum world") but you are - by virtue of the ontological status you give the formalism, and the Afshar experiment is as well, but by different means - by epistomolgically holding the wave function to account (using the wires). If there is a problem exposed in the Afshar experiment it's not to be found in any error by Afshar. Or in any error by yourself. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 01:43, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sdirrim, I would suggest that both as mediator and as a relative newcomer to this situation it may be best for you not to vote on this topic. Please also note that we do not have the power to ban anyone. The attempt here is to see if there is a concensus (and failing that a Supermajority) for escalating this matter futher. It is quite correct for me to suggest this and to see what current opinions are. It can be seen that this question is being taken seriously by editors. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 23:07, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A consensus to escalate the matter is one thing. Voting on whether someone should be banned is something else. There is no need to have a consensus on whether a user should be reported, and that is really all the power that we have, to SUGGEST that editors take action. But it still is a nice idea to get a consensus. It just implies that we are directly voting on whether Danko should be banned.

<li>"Afshar's experiment does not yield which way information <i>and</i> demonstrate interference effects for any <i>individual</i> particle (the photon), any more than the classic <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_slit.html" title="Double slit">double slit</a> experiment does, since we already know the photon propagates according to a wave-equation between the slits and any screen (i.e. behaves like a wave until it hits the screen, whereupon is observed as a particle.) The claim of complementarity violation in Afshar's experiment is a statistical argument that applies only to large numbers photons, not to individuals (cf "<i>the</i> particle" above in Bohr's statement is a reference to a single photon, not to groups of photons).</li>

The hypothesis of Afshar that we only need some partial information concerning the interference pattern in order to reconstruct the complete interference is only based on the idea that the fringes already exist. The whole reasoning is circular and for this reason misleading."</i> - Aurelien Drezet</dd>

<p><b>DELETE</b>. Two reasons. 1. It mangle's Drezet's argument - which is otherwise a relatively good one (even though I actually disagree with Drezet) and 2. It is also radically silly.</p>
<p>(re-edited for comprehensibility)</p>
<p>The second part of the argument is saying that Afshar's statistical demonstration of interference (used to violate complementarity) is invalid because Bohr is talking about single particles. If we are to accept this logic then ALL demonstrations of interference I can think of are invalid, including the archetypal double slit experiment.</p>
<p>The first part of the argument seems to be something like this. Since the twin slit experiment doesn't violate complementarity, and there is no difference between Afshar's experiment and the twin slit experiment, then Afshars' experiment doesn't violate it either.</p>
<p>But how is there no difference?</p>
<p>"since we already know the photon propagates according to a wave-equation between the slits and any screen (i.e. behaves like a wave until it hits the screen, whereupon is observed as a particle."</p>
<p>In what way does "already knowing" how the wave function propogates (and particles observed), make Afshar's experiment no different from the twin slit experiment?</p>
<p>Nowhere is this explained. It's as if one had just argued:</p>
<p>"A cat and dog can't be regarded as animals (or a vegetable), any more than a rabbit, since we already know the Earth is round"</p>
<p>Are we to be this radical? I guess what I'm trying to say is that this text, which quotes Drezet, is proposing a very different argument from Drezet - while subsequently pretending to be a summary of Drezet. It is actually OR and should be removed on this basis. This is not to say it is completely devoid of merit but without reference material to support it, it becomes worse than OR - it is OR without the R.</p>

<dd>I think that this time we will succeed in finally wrestling this to the ground, especially as <a href="../../../s/d/i/User%7ESdirrim_3c1d.html" title="User:Sdirrim">Sdirrim</a> is doing a good job. I agree with you completely, also, that listing people at the end of the article would be appropriate. This article should simply state what the Afshar experiment is; what Afshar claims it shows; a few key *relevant* arguments to counter Afshar's claims (and only Afshar's claims, and only where attributible); rebuttles from Afshar (only where attributible) and links for further reading. Some of these things are not so clear to decide but I don't think it will be that hard as long as we stay focused.</dd>
<dd>An example of a difficult issue is the inclusion of Unruh's argument, which has not been published in a peer reviewed paper and additionally appears to not be relevant to the argument at all. Until Afshar's paper was published in a peer reviewed journal, it perhaps was relevant to include Unruh's argument. However this is no longer the case, and to have NPOV we should not have a peer reviewed article countered by an argument presented a few years ago on a blog, even if the personal presenting it is notable. There is of course nothing to prevent the article including links to Unruh's argument. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 14:19, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Michael, was wondering when you would show up again... I believe you are completely wrong in your interpretation, and in any way it is Afhsar's interpretation which is of importance here, not that of any editors. But here is a counter to your point that is directly connected to Afshar's interpretation, in a form that non-expert readers might find easy to digest: Some of the photons do yield both which-way and interference effects in the experiment. If 100 photons are measured as hitting the targets with the wires in place, it is known that statistically a certain percentage (I think it was around 7%) must have interfered with themselves in order to avoid the wires. So in fact 7% of photons do exhibit both which-way and interference effects. The only thing that is not known is precisely which photons of the 100 have done so. However, the paradox is exposed even without this knowledge. Since the paradox is exposed, BPC is violated, as we can no longer avoid concluding a paradox. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 20:37, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your argument would apply equally without the wires: the photons must interfere with each other to produces the fringes, yet we can tell which-way they go by looking through the lens .... so what gives? The flaw (of course) is that no photon observed through the lens contributes to a fringe -- and this also applies when the wires are present.

<dd>Once again you present a different experiment to the one that we are discussing in thia article. Fringes do not form an important part of Afshar's experiment as I understand his experiment to be. You are not actually counterting my point at all. But in any case you need to get your interpretation published in a peer reviewed paper for it to get it included in the article. But a further point: since all photons are detected, then any photons contributing to a fringe would also be detected. Otherwise, what happens to your supposed photons that do contribute to a fringe? Do they just vanish or something? <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 10:20, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An important difference is that, in the twin slit experiment, no which way information (or path function) can be postulated since each and every detection can be traced back to two apertures rather than one. But this is not the case in the Afshar experiment. Each and every detection, in the Afshar experiment, can only be traced back to a single aperture. It is this capacity (to trace paths back to a single aperture) that otherwise defines the path function as such, ie. as distinct from a (time reversed) wave function. So there we have the difference. For single photons neither experiment can demonstrate interference - but as Michael has previously argued "we already know single photons interfere". --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 01:13, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Instead of the rhetorical answer I had in response to this question (which has been deleted) I seek here to answer the innocent question.</p>
<p>While it is true Bohr identifys the formalism with complementarity it is not in the manner of an equivalence. In Bohr's words the formalism is an example (or an instance) of a concept that is otherwise bigger than the formalism. If the principle were no more than the formalism then there would be no need for the principle. However, Bohr has articulated the principle across a number of texts, (not just in quotable phrases) and the principle emerges as saying MORE than the formalism. It is that aspect of the principle, in surplus to the formalism, that can be challenged without necessarily challenging the formalism. One can not to do the reverse. One can not use the formalism to protect this surplus aspect of complementarity. Or maybe one can - but where is that argument? Not here.</p>

<dd>Carl's last paragraph here makes a lot more sense to me than the the way the article reads now. In the sense of being comprehensible, whether or not it is right.

<dd>As Michael suggests elsewhere the formalism predates complementarity but this does not mean complementarity must be understood as only derivable from the formalism. It can also be regarded as expanding the formalism. The quote from Bohr does not provide enough information (despite Michael's claim) to suggest only Michaels reading is applicable. Consider the following sentence:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>An adequate method for painting abstract art is offered precisely by a can of paint manipulated in the manner of Jackson Pollack.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To follow Michael's logic, we must conclude that abstract art can only be defined in terms of the way that Pollack painted. But this is not the case. There is implied in the statement, if not otherwise mentioned, other ways of producing abstract art. And the articulation of such other methods does not invalidate the above statement.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Note that the word "adequate" can be read as excluding not just "inadequate" but also "perfect".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The point is that we need more information about what Bohr said - not just isolated quotes - if the question is to be resolved. But Michaels' argument is that we don't need any more information - that the quote says it all. It doesn't.</dd>

<dd>Artists may disagree with the statement, and so to may scientists, eg. to copy Pollack is not to produce abstract art at all but to participate in Neo Abstract Expressionism (or form of postmodern art). But this is not the point of the analogy. The category "abstract art" or more specifically, "abstract expressionism" has a <i>number</i> of participants only one of which is Pollack. In other words Pollack's art does not define Abstract Art. It is the concept of Abstract Art which defines or otherwise categorises Pollack's art (amongst others) as an example of abstract expressionism. in similar fashion, it is Bohr who is categorising the formalism as a "complementary way of description". Furthermore the validity of the statement is not necessarily in question. And is not made any less so by the participation of other complementary ways of description. The point of the analogy, is that Bohr's statement does not rule out everything else Bohr has said in relation to complementarity. The issue is whether everything else Bohr has said confirms the meaning that Michael (and others) have otherwise extracted from the quote. But nowhere is this research demonstrated - a single quote is supposed to constitute the argument. And it doesn't. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 01:32, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

That text can also be included in the PC article. This is a subtle issue that needs to be written very carefully. It is important to point out that the main point of my papers have been to highlight this important separation in that BPC can be shown to be violated without a violation of the formalism.

BPC in no way alters the formalism (the dynamics of the wave-equation) -- it's something that you derive <i>from</i> the formalism.

<dd>Michael, please kindly answer the following questions with "yes" and "no" only: (1) Is HUP an integral part of QM? (2) Is it true that every time Bohr defended his arguments against Einstein he used HUP to show Einstein's errors? (3) Is it true that it was recently shown that HUP does not ALWAYS enforce BPC (theoretically suggested by Scully et al. and experimentally verified by Rempe et al)? (4) Is it not likely that those who made the claims in the disputed text (Motl, Unruh and others including yourself) were not aware of the distinction between HUP and BPC at the time? (I have direct evidence from the Blogs and Wiki archives that you did not know about the distinction before I brought it up.) P.S. Another important distinction that needs tobe made is the deterministic QM formalism on wavfunction Unitary evolution, and the quantum measurement theory involving the abrupt collapse of the wavefunction, but that's another bag of worms I'm writing an invited paper on for a pedagogical physics journal. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 12:14, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The assumption that you can not observe the paradox, if I understand correctly. Basically BPC is meant to allow us to avoid concluding a paradox. BPC becomes irelevant should an experiment allow us to observe the paradox. If it were logically impossible for an experiment to disprove the valididty of BPC, then BPC would not be falsifiable. However it can be seen that it is logically possible for an experiment to demonstrate a violation of BPC by simply demonstrating the precise paradox that BPC otherwise allows us to escape. The paradox in question is a photon passing through both holes to cause interference while also appearing to have come from only one hole. The statement being debated here has no relevance to Afshar's claims, because it is not actually stating anything that contributes to the argument. In fact, this statement suggests that violation of BPC would mean violation of the QM formalism, which it seems fairly apparently not to be the case. What is relevant is the question of whether Afshar's experiment does in fact demonstrate the paradox. If it does, then BPC is violated. This can happen and still leave the rest of the formalism intact, but incomplete. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 16:57, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Art is completely correct in that I believe there are "additional" false assumptions that led to Bohr et al.'s error. The assumptions are: (i)NECESSITY for irreversible collapse/decoherence of the wavefucntion upon detection of the photon in ensemble spatial distributions such as the Interference pattern i.e. the need for destructive measurement for ensemble properties, and (ii) the NECESSITY for a collapse/decoherence to take place in order to make a measurement. In my experiments the wires make a classic measurement without a "quantum measurement"(i.e. the kind of measurement that causes the collapse of the wavefucntion) which I have termed "Contextual Null Measurement" (see my Perimeter Institute talk for more details.) The major assumption up until my experiment was that any kind of measurement causes either decoherence, or collapse of the wavefucntion. I have shown this assumption to be at variance with QM formalism (see section 3.3 of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701027" class="external free" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701027" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701027</a>) and experimental results (all three published papers). -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 17:08, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I think it doesn't (and I am willing to wager that Prof. Afshar agrees with me). But it doesn't matter what either of us believes. The important thing is to understand that there are (at least) two ways of looking at decoherence, so, if it is relevant to the article and they are attributable, we should report both of them. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Carlson_64f0.html" title="User:Art Carlson">Art Carlson</a> 19:52, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>It is quite depressing to see the state of confusion regarding collapse and decoherence. Decoherence is just that, loss of coherence in a wavefcuntion that leads to loss of interference effects and nulls in the off-diagonals. It is quite possible to have a collapse of the wavefunction in a coherent state, as you see when a photon is observed in a bright fringe. The wavefunction disappears completely (collapses) yet superposition state is observed in an irreversible manner. I think the confusion has been caused by two different uses of the term collapse. In short, collapse is not the same as decoherence. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 20:21, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

In general this is something which should be change in the page i think: One should in this wiki project first find (after the introduction) a section describing the actual facts (i.e., the set-up and the results) and secondly a section presenting the interpretation and the potential consequences.

<p>Here are some more quotes by Bohr, in the same vicinity as the one quoted.</p>

<dd>"In a lecture on that occasion, I advocated a point of view conveniently termed "complementarity," suited to embrace the characteristic features of individuality of quantum phenomena, and at the same time to clarify the peculiar aspects of the observational problem in this field of experience."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"For this purpose, it is decisive to recognise that, however far the phenomena transcend the scope of classical physical explanation, the account of all evidence must be expressed in classical terms."</dd>

<dl>

</dl>
<p>While these quotes are quite inadequate for a full understanding of complementarity, they do help to illustrate that Bohr is talking about something in addition to HUP, and the formalism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"While the combination of these concepts into a single picture of a causal chain of events is the essence of classical mechanics, room for regularities beyond the grasp of such a description is just afforded by the circumstance that the study of the complementary phenomena demands mutually exclusive experimental arrangements.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Note the phrase "... even in the indeterminacy relation ...", in which Bohr is citing such -ie. bringing it into the discussion, in order to show the difficultys involved in using classical concepts to describe the overall situation. But a classical (or semi-classical) account is what he is hoping to demonstrate is, at least, partially possible. He is arguing, in spite of the ambiguitys, (not becasue of them) that a semi-classical description is still possible. And it will be the principle of complementarity that will provide for this possibility. I am not saying this is evident in the pargaraph cited but I am encouraging anyone with questions here to actually read Bohr if they want to get the drift of what I'm saying here.</dd>

<dd>Bohr is not here to comment an Afshar's experiment, thus to include material from Bohr requires arguments to be presented that link the ideas of Bohr to the experiment's interpretation. However this can not be done in this article. To do so is to introduce original research. If Bohr were able to make comments on the experiment now, these comments, however unclear, would to attributable to him, so no problem. However the application of things Bohr said a long time ago to this experiment requires an interpretation by some third party. In this case that party is you Michael. This is also fine, providing such interpretation is attributable according to wikipedia policy. I suspect that you can not provide such attributable sources. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 10:44, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On a side note, observe the statement by Bohr "For this purpose, it is decisive to recognise that, however far the phenomena transcend the scope of classical physical explanation, the account of all evidence must be expressed in classical terms.". This is key to understanding Bohr. What he is saying here is that it does not matter how much the nature of the universe <b>transcends</b> classical physical explanations (i.e. is an extension of classical interpretations), we must account for all evidence <b>in classical terms</b>. There is a major assumption. The assumption that any explanations of the nature of universe must be explained in terms of classical concepts. What if that assumption is wrong? And what is there to actually support this assumption? BPC was created to allow us to maintain this classical explanation without facing the which-way / interference paradox, because if we can not measure the paradox then it is not important. If Afshar's experiment allows us to measure the paradox then Bohr's argument falls apart. It is no longer possible to account for all evidence <b>in classical terms</b>. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 10:44, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, we should debating the issues here, not performing a head count of people struggling to understand physics. The formalism of non-relativistic quantum mechanics was finished by c 1927. Complementary, c 1930+, was -- as Bohr said -- an attempt at a <i>description</i> of what the formalism models precisely. Complementarity's development had no impact or feedback onto the formalism. The HUP and other complementarity-related topics can be derived from the formalism; they are not required as separate, additional assumptions.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>While someone here is implying he has given up on understanding physics it is not the case that anyone else here should likewise do so. Bohr is difficult but he is not impossible. The principle of complementarity concerns the way in which the "regularitys" otherwise associated with classical concepts can be extended, if only partially, into the quantum theoretical domain. The back traced path function, for example, is a classical function one can use under certain conditions. This idea is impossible to do with the formalism alone. The "god plays dice" concept of quantum theory is not embodied in the quantum theoretical formalism (for obvious reasons). One needs the physical version of this concept in order to instantiate a back trace on a particle detection. One can employ pseudo-noise functions in a computer simulation but these functions are just that - pseudo noise functions. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 03:35, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Break it up! Dndn1011 and Michael C. Price! Stop fighting! Now, how about this suggestion: We keep the quote from Bohr, because it is sourced and relevant. We are not here to pick a fight with Niels Bohr. The following rhetorical question can be thrown out, unless it is a quote from either of the three references. If it is not a quote, then it seems to be an <i>original analysis of published works</i>, something that qualifies as OR. Also, the rhetorical question seems to be the text at issue, rather than the quote from Niels Bohr. So again, how about we remove only the rhetorical question, as it is most inflammatory part of this debated piece, and it is also OR.

<dd>Correct. Any material included in the article must be sourced. However, the rhetorical question is not directly sourced. Rather, it is a paraphrasing of a point made by Unruh (I believe), and thus is an "original analysis of published work" and is therefore OR. By Wikipedia guidelines, the quote needs to be removed. It may be replaced, but that is debatable. A <i>counter-point</i> sourced from a peer-reviewed and published work may also be included.

I'm afraid in this case, the cure is worse than the disease, although I must say Danko's paper is an apt addition to the collection, especially when authors have to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ptep_online/index_files/rules.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/ptep_online/index_files/rules.html" rel="nofollow">pay</a> for their "papers" to be published there.

<li>Dear Tabesh, "<i>As far as Wikipedia is concerned, a peer-reviewed journal is enough</i>." Not true! It depends on whether the "peers" are reliable. A journal that publishes papers that violate special relativity is a sure sign of the type of referees it has. Publication in this journal is also a clear indication of the type of author it attracts. No self-respecting physicist would even refer to "Progress in Physics" let alone publish there. And as to your desire not to publish in Found. Phys. all I can say is that you may have reason to stay away from the community of Nobel laureates; well I don't. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 13:11, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Marinov published some legitimate papers nearly 20 years before his passing as shown below, but then he pushed some patently cranky ideas later on which led to his ostracism by the scientific community. As sad a story of his tragic death happens to be, nonetheless he was aptly regarded as a pseudo-scientist and the publication of his utterly error-filled manuscript in Progress in Physics is a clear demonstration of the kind of crackpottery they publish. No physicist can regard Progress in Physics as anything but a fringe, and misguided adventure by a few outsiders, who are not taken seriously by the mainstream physics community whom its editor considers as “Mafia”-like conspirators. If you believe otherwise, then you must share their values, and therefore their pitfalls. I’m glad our views on this matter are on the record here.

<p><br />
Under a principle of complementarity Bohr introduces ideas not otherwise implicit in the quantum theoretical formalism. In particular is the idea that "regularitys" otherwise associated with classical physics (eg. the path of a particle) can be partially deployed in the quantum theoretical domain.</p>
<p>Nowhere does Bohr suggest a retrospective path function is in anyway derived from, or limited by the formalism itself. Our only limit is whether we can actually construct such a function, ie. whether we can actually draw an unambiguous path, from a particle detection, back to an aperture (ie. a single aperture).</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is not the formalism which necessarily suggests, implys or otherwise imposes on us that a setup, which allows such a retrospectively constructed path function, is also a setup which prevents us from demonstrating the wave function.</p>
<p>But it is definitley Bohr who does suggest this.</p>
<p>And it is this idea, otherwise understood as "Bohr's principle of complementarity", which the Afshar experiment challenges.</p>
<p>If Michael thinks this idea belongs to the formalism then it is Michael who must answer the rhetorical question. How does the Afshar experiment both violate the formalism (ie. the idea under challenge) and not violate the formalism?</p>
<p>The only answer is that they are not the same thing.</p>

<dd>You seem confused by what the formalism is. You don't need the BPC to generate empirical predictions from QM -- that's what the formalism is there to do. The BPC is there to help us grasp or understand what's going on in terms of classical or pseudo-classical concepts. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>Dear Michael, I am not confused by the formalism at all. I realise your recurrent fallback position (to fictionalise critics of your position as "confused") might seem entirely justified to you but repeatedly telling yourself this won't help you in the long run. The formalism itself represents the fundamental structure of signals otherwise implied in the data produced by actual experiments. It is given an "a priori" status by virtue of it's implicit fundamentalism. However the formalism does not, (and can not) embody the complete de-scription of an experiment. The formalism is a pre-scription. And as you say, you don't need BPC to pre-scribe the outcome of experiments - as that is the role of the formalism (it defines the formalism). The idea that BPC helps us to interpret the formalism is justified. But BPC is also MORE than this. It introduces ideas in addition to the formalism. And (with deep regret) I have argued in the past (if you go back through the history of this talk page) precisely something similar to what you are currently arguing - that Bohr is merely interpreting the formalism - in classical terms for an audience incapable of thinking in any other way. And that Heisenberg was doing the same thing. But on further reflection I found that this was not entirely justified - was not entirely true. In fact, could not be true at all. Bohr was not just a psuedo semi-classicist. He was a real one. If Bohr was aware that the formalism might impose limits on the very possibility of a post measurement classical path nowhere does he provide a warning in this respect. One would always find (incorrectly) that any actual setup which allowed a constructable post-measurement path function occured only in setups in which the wave function was prevented from being demonstrated. This is was not just a metaphor for the classical mind. It is (or was) supposed to be a fundamental principle, ie. a principle without exception. A precisely defined IDEA. And that IDEA is precisely what you find embodied in the Yasin Greenberger formula. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 22:46, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Carl, I said you were confused because you rhetorically asked me <i>How does the Afshar experiment both violate the formalism (ie. the idea under challenge) and not violate the formalism?</i>. The simple answer is that the experiment does not violate the formalism. As for what we are now calling the Yasin Greenberger formula, I have no problem with it being mentioned in the article; as I pointed out, each individual photon obeys the duality relation. It was Linas who saw fit to remove this statement from the article, not me. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>Ok Michael, perhaps we are emerging from the deadlock in which we've been engaged. The simple answer, as you say, is that the experiment does not violate the formalism. That's exactly right. It is due to misunderstandings that the experiment has been framed this way - as if it was claiming to violate the formalism. The result has been ongoing inherent confusion - as embodied by my rhetorical question. But the experiment violates that aspect of complementarity otherwise embodied in the Yasin Greenberger formula. The YG formula itself is not at issue. The formula provides a precise mathematical definition of Bohr's IDEA. It is a formula anyone can derive from a close reading of Bohr. And it is this IDEA (Bohr's idea) which the Afshar experiment challenges. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 00:47, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Michael. As far as Prof Afshar goes, the formalism has never been in dispute - it is only the claim that complementarity and the formalism are equivilant that re-renders the formalism as in dispute. But who is providing that argument? Not Prof Afshar. You are. Or you have been. Or you want to. Basically, if your postulate was correct (that complementarity and the formalism are equivalent) then you would need to show how the formalism is violated by the Afshar experiment. Otherwise it is not the formalism being violated. It is something else - call it what you will - a figment of our collective imagination, but otherwise understood as derived from what Bohr has written. In the long run it doesn't even matter whether Bohr authored this idea or not. It is an idea that exists and is demonstrated, by the experiment, as a not very good idea. Irregardless of who authored it. However, the idea does not belong to me, you, Prof Afshar or anyone else. It is an idea that been floating around since Bohr wrote about his ideas - about a principle of complementarity. It has an existence in the realm of ideas and is (without an essay) merely stated here that Bohr invokes this idea in thost texts which otherwise constitute what we otherwise call Bohr's Principle of Complementarity. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 21:43, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

And perhaps if I (and/or others) stopped responding to Michael's argument that would be the case. But Michael's argument is not a single voice in an otherwise silent universe. It is but one voice amongst many. Why is this vote still pending? Michael does not appear to have anything more substantial to argue in defense of his argument.

<dd>The counter-argument can be argued as a postulate. The postulate is that: the formalism and complementarity are not interchangeable concepts. Now, being framed this way, as a postulate, it is not actually necessary for us to "believe" in it. We merely note that when we postulate this idea (ie. entertain it as correct) we are unable to maintain that a claim of BPC violation is interchangeable with a claim of formalism violation. And likewise, we can't maintain a claim that a failure to violate the formalism is interchangeable with a failure to violate complementarity. Keep in mind that this is just a logical result of the postulate.</dd>

<dd>But the real argument I've been putting forward is not this logic, as basic as it is. It is about what can be understood as BPC. Complementarity is not an implicit echo of the formalism. Bohr advances particular concepts under the name of "complementarity". And these are certainly interpretive but these concepts are not in any way ambiguous or a byproduct of the formalism. For example, in what way is the idea that "experiments must be defined classically" spring forth from the formalism? It doesn't. Yet is a central part of complementarity. Indeed, it is through experiments, defined classically, that the formalism itself becomes constructable in the first place. Or that's how Bohr can be understood. But even if this were not the case, (ie. postulating it the other way) then the reverse question remains. How does the formalism produce this idea? Or more specifically, since we're talking about BPC, how would you use Bohr to answer this question?</dd>

<dd>So simply put, on purely logical grounds there is a counter-argument. And on more substantial grounds - there is more to Bohr's complementarity than a mere echo of the formalism. And on the basis of both these propositions one can understand how BPC can be challenged without challenging the formalism. And that's before we've even challenged BPC!!! --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 06:07, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've read Zurek and others and have no problem following their argument. That doesn't mean I must agree with it. Disagreeing with something is not necessarily the same as confusion. I might say that decoherence theory is confused but I'll leave that for another day. Also, classical concepts emerge within classical thought. Our capacity to theorise alternative modes of emergance - eg. through non-classical means is useful but doesn't change anything. BPC says nothing about this mode of derivation. When BPC speaks of classical concepts should we really be interpreting it as meaning non-classically theorised classicism? This is not to say we can't entertain neo-rationalist fantasms. But can we attribute such to Bohr? --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 03:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The only speculation I can see demonstrated here is in attributing a fundamental aspect of Bohr's principle of complementarity to Ehrenfest. Perhaps you are onto something. It's always possible. But it is hardly proved on the basis that they knew each other. Do you know any other reason why Bohr felt might have felt correct application of the formalism was dependant on a full and unambiguous specification of experiments in classical terms? I mean, other than he knew Ehrenfest and therefore must have appropriated the idea from him? To answer this question requires understanding how one might specify an experiment in non-classical terms - and how one might do so without introducing the formalism as part of the specification. Any guesses? Any math you can dig up? Or literature? It can be done. But can you do it? --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 21:32, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is a rewrite that addresses the previous objections: it entirely sourced, with the exception of one sentence which links the statements by the founding and modern commmentators -- and that sentence is enirely couched in the language of Bohr's quote.</p>
<p>Proposed text start:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/i/e/Niels_Bohr_303e.html" title="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> stated <i>"a complementary way of description is offered precisely by the quantum-mechanical <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_formalism.html" title="Scientific formalism">formalism</a>"</i><sup id="_ref-Bohr1949_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bohr1949" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In this view, since the photons in the experiment obey the precise mathematical laws of quantum mechanics (the formalism), they can be described by Bohr's principle of complementarity. Cf:
<ul>
<li>"I think Bohr would have had no problem whatsoever with this experiment within his interpretation. Nor would any other interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is simply another manifestation of the admittedly strange, but utterly comprehensible (it can be calculated with exquisite precision), nature of quantum mechanics."<sup id="_ref-Unruh2004_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Unruh2004" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li>"There is absolutely nothing mysterious about Afshar's experiment. [....] And of course, the conventional quantum mechanics is compatible with the principle of complementarity."<sup id="_ref-Motl2004_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Motl2004" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>"It was claimed that this experiment could be interpreted as a demonstration of a violation of the principle of complementarity in quantum mechanics. Instead, it is shown here that it can be understood in terms of classical wave optics and the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics."<sup id="_ref-Steu2005_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Steu2005" title="">[4]</a></sup></li>

<dd>Dear Michael, in the absence of the Mediator, I would appreciate if you could "act" when it gets too stagnant. The article is misleading and needs to be corrected ASAP.

<dd>No one disputes that "the article is misleading and needs to be corrected ASAP", but we all disagree about the remedy. Non-consenual changes are going to get us nowhere. I suggest patience and talking everything out, as we are currently doing. The stagnant nature of article is actually a good sign that we are using the talk page in preference to revert warring. P.S. yes the OR tag is only a little change, but an important one. Rather than single out any particular section, perhaps we should OR the whole article, since there is no agreement about which parts are particularly OR?--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>Michael is right. We know that the article needs to be changed, we just argue about what needs to happen. How about another idea: We all focus on one change at a time. Address one issue, then move on, rather than arguing on 4, 5, 6, and Danko. It is easier for me to follow, and it will make a lot more sense.

<dd>Afshar, If you and other editors want to delete huge portions of the article, I personally don't care, and even I will not vote against the suggested by you changes, as I have quited this discussion. However I have my ultimate human right to post on any page where I am allowed access, in cases where personal offences against me, or other people are posted with aim of derogating their basic human rights and human dignity. So I do not agree that my name is invoked in text passages containing insults, while at the same time I even did not participate in the discussion. So just two facts</dd>

<dd>I am sorry to report to you that the Marinov affair, and his tragic suicide as a direct result of his alienation by the mainstream academia is well-known. As much as I empathize with his difficult circumstances, working as a horse groomer and conducting experiments in his girlfriend's apartment, there is no question about the fact that he was firmly and correctly rebuffed by the academia and referees due to clear violations of the known physical laws he advocated. Indeed, feeling his pain, I shed tears over his heart-wrenching description of the rejections, while fully agree with the referees reasoning. None of what I have said is an insult, it is simply a recounting of the fact that such fully-rejected ideas have been published in the same journal you have published in; a journal whose editor believes there is scientific Mafia against him. Any reasonable person can draw his/her conclusions regarding the reliability of the publication (Progress in Physics) as regards OR in WIkipedia. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 07:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

You should know that in principle i could complain to the editor. Two solutions: 1) either you send kindly a message by your self to the editor to change the picture ( very difficult ) or to add my reference in the legend (easier), or, 2), I do it myself :this is less pleasant for you and for me.

<p>Dear Mediator, I have peacefully have retracted myself from this discussion, where reserving my ultimate right to post reply only in such cases in order not to allow for someone to personally offend me [or if needed not to offend anyone else]. I have been out of the discussion, yet Afshar did not stop with his offences. Afshar continued on posting insult after insult on my personality. Why? What he wants? Are all these insults somehow linked at improving the main text of the article? Why the other wiki-editors do not take measures to warn now Afshar that he has crossed the limits. Let's have the same measures for all participants in the discussion, and let's not allow for doubled standards. Please vote to put Afshar on probation for usage of personal insults. If he uses again personal attacks and insults, as part of his argumentation, he must be banned from Wikipedia. So I vote that Afshar be put on probation for usage of personal insults, which means that from now on Afshar shall be banned for breaking the probabition, if Afshar posts one or more messages where personal attack or insult is present. The personal insults should not be considered only these addressed to me, but for any person, dead or alive, who may have or may not have any link to the discussed here experiment. <b>PUT ON PROBATION for repeated usage of personal attacks</b> <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 06:03, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sorry Danko, but you won't be getting off that easy this time. You say: "<i>I have not used "maniac", and "charlatan", during the probation period you talk.</i>": Well, thank you for being so kind as to have resisted your urge to call me those derogatory names while on probation, however, you conveniently disregard the fact that only "falldown" was qualified with the parentheses "<i>(while on probation mind you)</i>". As for <a href="http://www.archivefreedom.org/freedom/Smarandache.html" class="external text" title="http://www.archivefreedom.org/freedom/Smarandache.html" rel="nofollow">Smarandache</a>, he himself states that he has been blacklisted from the arxiv for submitting physics papers, while talking about the scientific "Mafia." "<i>Removed vandalism by a crackpot</i>": That is the Edit summary for your vandalism of my userpage, in which you have attacked New Scientist, one of the most respected popular science magazines in the world as "NEW PROPAGANDA", and predicted my "falldown." You tell me what kind of person makes such statements while on probation. "<i>Disreputable journal</i>" That is a correct assessment of the reputation of the journal "Progress in Physics," and for the well-referenced reasons described above I will stand by that. "<i>Regression in Physics</i>" is an Edit summary for an edit describing the same journal, simply pointing out that trusting such a source as reliable would indeed constitute a "Regression in Physics," and I still stand by that as well. None of the above even compares to your direct attacks and use of foul language by you on my person. I do not wish to attack your personality, although you seem to be doing a good job at it yourself; and for all to see. P.S. I refrained from naming names in the recent NS interview article of the individuals who have personally attacked me, however, I may not be as reserved the next time around. <b>Waiting for Mediator to enforce Dnako's probation, until then I will defend myself against his typically baseless accusations here...</b> -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 08:36, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I must disagree. OR, unlike groundbraking physics, has a set of definitions, and is relatively clear-cut. Furthermore, OR in the article causes accusations of bias, inappropriate refences and confusion. Therefore, I propose this.

<p>It doesn't take a genius to realise that Afshar repeatedly refuses to debate about the formalism-complementarity relationship because of the lack of any substantive input on his part on the subject. Further, since the sources here are universally regarded as valid (e.g. Bohr, Unruh), I presume we can close the chapter in this.

<dd>No, I disagree with the last proposition. Bohr regarded the formalism as a "complementary way of description". He also regarded many OTHER THINGS as a "complementary way of description" and refers to such OTHER THINGS in his discussions of complementarity. The formalism is but one example ie. amongst others. Can MP try to read beyond just one sentence in Bohr's writings.

<dd>Yes, that's right. We're only interested in how complementarity applys to physics. To do so we must begin with a full picture of complementarity (philosophy, art, politics, language, information), ie. as articulated by Bohr, and test which aspects of complementarity (if any) are workable in terms of experimental physics. Only in this way are we speaking about Bohr's principle. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 01:51, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can I add that the concept of space and time has undergone a similar evolution. These concepts existed (within language, politics, philosophy etc.) for a very long time (thousands of years) and were given a priori status, and physics used these concepts for a very long time, until Einstein showed the concepts (as they existed) were a problem (required revision). The physical universe (we can assume) did not change as a result of this revision. And furthermore, we destroy history if we pretend that our ancestor's were really talking about Einstein's spacetime rather than their own. And we will run into problems doing this. If we do an experiment to challenge Newton's spacetime, but define Newton's spacetime as Einstein's spacetime, we'll just end up proving that Newton's spacetime is correct. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 02:32, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

Of course, I consider my interpretation as correct and yours as "confused", but I can understand you might see it the other way around. But just because you think I'm confused doesn't make it so. And, of course, vice versa. But you seem to be running around trying to prop up your miscellaneous statements using ever increasing speculative means.

<li>Well, still you seem a little careless (helpfully not deliberately), and apparently you have not yet fully realized what Danko, Qureshi, and Dereitzer (DQD) are saying. Also, you should be careful in your suggested statement above when you mention "<i>Afshar's setup</i>" as to which particular setup you are referring. I have one setup (Fig. 2 in the Wiki article) with the wires in the path of the light (this is unique to my experiment but is not being discussed by DQD) and another one without the wires (shown in Fig.1 which is the same exact setup as that of Wheeler's and is the subject of DQD’s assertions). Therefore it is not just my setup in which they claim there is no which-way information. They claim in any welcher weg experiment in which the coherent beams cross each other there is no which way information. <b>This includes Wheeler's as well as various other investigators' setups</b>. This assertion is clearly stated by Danko in the past over and over, and is mentioned directly in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701109" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701109" rel="nofollow">Qureshi's manuscript</a>: "<i>The beams cross and there after the detectors DA and DB collect the photons. Interestingly, <b>Wheeler assumes</b> that when the two beams cross uninterrupted, the detectors DA and DB give the which path information. From our preceding analysis it is clear that if there is interference in the crossing region, the two detectors <b>no longer give the which-path</b> information.</i>" So as you can see he is also nullifying Wheeler's setup, the details of which were clearly delineated in his seminal papers on the subject: J. A. Wheeler, in Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory, A. R. Marlow, Ed. (Academic Press. 1978); ibid, in: Some Strangeness in the Proportion, H. Woolf, Ed. (Addison-Wesley Pulishing Compony, Inc, New Jersey, 1980). The bottom line here is that they are invalidating the accepted which-way by momentum conservation argument that dates back to Einstein himself and has been discussed by innumerable investigators from Wheeler down to Griffiths, Scully and others, all of which have reputable references, and some of which (about 16 ref.s ) have been mentioned in my papers. Unless DQD publish their ideas on nullification of the long-held view on presnece of which way information in the setup shown in Fig. 1 in a reputable peer-reviewed journal, this statement (<i>There is no which-way information in Afshar's setup even if there is no wire grid put on the path of photons.</i>) and its sources must be considered OR and removed from the article. P.S. You say "<i>we are here to report, not judge</i>." I disagree, the whole purpose of this Mediation is to establish what is and isn't OR according to Wiki rules. Therefore we are <b>compelled</b> to judge whether a source is reliable or not. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 00:36, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I am not engaging with the physics here because (i) that is strictly speaking irrelevant (although I'll grant we all know the OR rule is honoured more in the breach than observance across Wikipedia). (ii) you refuse to engage with the critical formalism issues I have highlighted in another section. Reciprocate please. And I asked first :-) PS as for which setup is commented on, it seems the sources are talking about both (i.e. with and without the wires), hence my suggested removal of the adjunct about the wires.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<li>"<i>...it seems the sources are talking about both (i.e. with and without the wires)</i>" Well, if you look at the Specific critiques section in the article, it has been devided into two distinct groups. The top group comprising of references to papers by academic physcists Unruh, Motl, Kastner, Drezet, and Steuernagel only talks about the lack of which-way information in the presence of the wires (what can be properly called my experiment) , and all of them agree that which-way information is reliable when there are no wires (i.e. in Wheeler's original setup). The second group, which relates to DQD ref.s deny the presence of the which-way information even when there are no wires (again i.e. in Wheeler's original setup). It is this second group that needs to be removed because their main thesis as described by Danko in the article is OR. Although I disdain Danko's antics, I must say however, he is at least clear cut on what his main thesis is. All I'm suggesting is that the second group that has no reliable sources for their argument be removed. Otherwise, keeping them on the article gives the non-expert reader that the false impression that the OR presented in their papers is accepted in the mainstream physics community. Unruh himself wrote to me and Danko and publicly denounced their thesis. I can post his remarks if you wish. P.S. If we cannot come to an agreement on this simple issue, how well do you think we can do regarding the formalism topic? We need to address this clear case of OR vs. reputable sources and resolve it first before we move on to more thorny issues. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 16:04, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Afshar, Wheeler probably did not consider the possibility of interference in the region where the beams cross, so, the issue of losing which-way information did not occur to him. You can ask him now, what he feels about it.<br />
And since you mentioned the "well established momentum conservation", can you please explain here how momentum conservation in your eperiment works, when the initial state is a superposition of two momentum states?<br />
And please do not raise the issue of OR to extreme levels - you will see my paper in a peer reviewed journal soon.<br />

<li>Dear Tabish, you say "<i>Wheeler probably did not consider the possibility of interference in the region where the beams cross</i>", I think you greatly underestimate Prof. Wheeler's immense insights on this topic. You seem to be unaware of the fact that he published two papers (J. A. Wheeler, in Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory, A. R. Marlow, Ed. (Academic Press. 1978); in Some Strangeness in the Proportion, H. Woolf, Ed. (Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc, New Jersey, 1980), in which he discussed exactly the crossed beam scenario. I conducted an experiment using his setup shown in Fig. 1 of my AIP paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701039" class="external free" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701039" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701039</a>. Here's a depiction of <a href="http://www.irims.org/blog/figures/Weeler's%20Delayed%20Choice%20Experiment%5b1%5d.JPG" class="external text" title="http://www.irims.org/blog/figures/Weeler's%20Delayed%20Choice%20Experiment%5b1%5d.JPG" rel="nofollow">Wheeler's crossed beam experiment</a>and the brief reasoning involving the conservation laws. He discusses his analysis of the setup in his papers in much detail. "<i>You can ask him now, what he feels about it</i>." Indeed I had the honor of discussing his suggested experiments 6 years ago, during which he reiterated the conservation laws as the reasoning for which-way information and pointed out that Einstein himself used that same argument with Bohr, especially during the EPR debates. "<i>Just remember that you are claiming that the long established Complementarity has been violated, whereas I am saying it CANNOT be violated</i>." Well, while I'm questioning the validity of Complementarity which is not central to QM formalism, you defend Complementarity by violating the conservation laws at the very heart of QM. The conservation laws are inviolable and anyone who suggests otherwise would not be take seriously by the mainstream physics community, thus I highly doubt any respectable peer-reviewed journal would ever publish your claims. P.S. Please do not use line breaks in your text, as it takes more space, and makes it more difficult to follow your argument. Looking forward to hearing your response. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 18:56, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are claiming that momentum conservation gives you the which-path information. Let us suppose that detector 1 detects photons with momentum |p1&gt; and detector 2 detects photon with momentum |p2&gt;. Suppose you detect a photon at detector 1 - you would conclude that it came from slit 1 and the initial momentum was |p1&gt;. But this can only happen if slit 2 is closed. If both the slits are open, the initial state is something like |p1&gt;+|p2&gt;. And just before hitting any detector the state is again close to |p1&gt;+|p2&gt;, which says that momentum conservation is there. However, on hitting the detector, a superposition like |p1&gt;+|p2&gt; will go into sometimes |p1&gt;, and sometimes |p2&gt;. All that momentum conservation can tell you here is that the detectors 1 and 2 will click an equal number of times on the average, nothing more!<br />
IF the particle was prepared in state |p1&gt; and u detect it with momentum |p1&gt;, it can give you a which-way information - that happens when only one slit is open. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabish_q_9513.html" title="User:Tabish q">Tabish q</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/b/User_talk%7ETabish_q_1526.html" title="User talk:Tabish q">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tabish_q_c1fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tabish q">contribs</a>) 05:35, 18 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Fantastic. Now I'd like to ask you a few more questions based on your own argument above. (1) As the wavfunctions emerge from the two pinholes I right the initial state as |p1&gt;+|p2&gt; right? Now let the states (that are not spatially overlapped) evolve unitarily for a little while just enough to clear the pinholes (say move about 1cm from the pinholes). They are still spatially non-overlapping. (2) If I observe a photon in the beam emerging from pinhole 1 the superposition |p1&gt;+|p2&gt; would collapse and I would find its state to be |p1&gt; (similarly for pinhole 2) do you agree? (3) Would it be possible to find the photon in beam 1 to have momentum state |p2&gt;? If so, please explain how using QM formalism. BTW/ If you could show this, you would win my $1000 prize I announced 3 years ago, so it’d be worth your time to respond!--Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 17:25, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The scenario before the beams cross and after the beams cross is different. Before the beams cross, there is no interferemce, so no problem with which-way information. Quantum mechanically I had already shown you something before, which u did not respond to.<span class="texhtml"><i>p</i><i>s</i><i>i</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>a</i>exp(<i>i</i><i>k</i><i>x</i>) + <i>b</i>exp( − <i>i</i><i>k</i><i>x</i>)</span>, here the two terms represents waves with opposite momenta. Now, some parts of the two waves cancel with each other, and some parts add to each other. Let me decompose them into that for you <span class="texhtml"><i>p</i><i>s</i><i>i</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>a</i>[cos(<i>i</i><i>k</i><i>x</i>) + <i>i</i>sin(<i>k</i><i>x</i>)] + <i>b</i>[cos(<i>k</i><i>x</i>) − <i>i</i>sin(<i>k</i><i>x</i>)]</span>. For a=b, the sin(kx) terms would cancel and the cos(kx) terms would add up. After interference, you will be left with <span class="texhtml"><i>p</i><i>s</i><i>i</i>(<i>x</i>) = 2cos(<i>k</i><i>x</i>) = exp(<i>i</i><i>k</i><i>x</i>) + exp( − <i>i</i><i>k</i><i>x</i>)</span>, which is two waves moving in opposite direction. But these two waves individually do not carry any which way information.<br />
<b>All photons emerge from the bright fringes. Bright fringes are formed by portions of the states from the two slits which are identical. Orthogonal states cannot be added to give a bright fringe. As the contribution from teh two slits is identical, there is no which-way information.</b> Is that enough for you? --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabish_q_9513.html" title="User:Tabish q">Tabish q</a> 06:41, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Afshar, please reply what is your argument that suggests: [1] Bohr's published work is wrong, and [2] Wheeler's published work is correct. It seems that it is quite possible that Wheeler has made overlook, so You are wrong and Bohr is correct. What is your scientific argumentation that helps us to decide which one of these notable physisits is wrong. I believe if one of them must be wrong, then providing citations will not help. I think that Tabish is correct to point of math formulas, which in this case must be of greater value than citations of literature. Mathematics is superior to everything else called science, so please reply also by writing some equations. I believe some of the other wiki-editors will be good enough in verifying the written math by you. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 07:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>OK, decision made. I have reviewed all of the evidence shown on this talk page. If I may say so, there is nothing original in the arguments in this section. First off, I don't care what the mathematics are. Just because you can provide partial equations to prove your point (and this goes for everyone here) does not mean that you are free to ignore wikipedia guidelines. We have all debated this. The sources that are being referenced by the text in question have been deemed "questionable" and/or "unreliable". This is on account of the lack of mandatory peer-review before release to the general public.</p>
<p>Now, I can forsee "But it has a process where A and B, so C and it is effectively peer-reviewed..." BOTTOM LINE: ArXiv has been deemed not to be a reliable source. Anyone is free to retain the text elsewhere, post a blog about it, put it in a scientific journal, whatever. But not on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not a place to determine who is correct, and then to post that person's ideas. It is a place to post neutral information about a wide variety of subjects gathered from reliable sources. Not to argue who is right. Should people who follow Intelligent Design (or Evolution) be able to make edits to the Evolution (or Intelligent Design) article, on the basis that they believe that they are right? No. Should the same people be able to make edits to the same article strictly on the basis of removing unsourced information and unreliable sources? Yes (Unfortunately, things don't always work that way).</p>
<p>If you wish to alter the basic foundations of the topic on which this article is written, get yourself published in a reliable, peer-reviewed publication, and then put that reliable reference in the article. But until then, don't go changin the article on the basis of "math proves me right, I don't need to listen to Wikipedia guidelines".</p>
<p>Overall, I believe that everyone has shown Disputed Text #4 to lack a reliable source as a reference. Therefore, it should be removed as a matter of policy. It may be replaced with text that has a reliable source, and anyone is free to save the current text of the article to have a template to work from once a reliable source is found. <a href="../../../s/d/i/User%7ESdirrim_3c1d.html" title="User:Sdirrim">Sdirrim</a> 17:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sdirrim, by this logic you will have to remove all the criticism from the page - none of it is published yet. Unruh's is not even an ArXiv paper. But then you will end up making this article a mouthpiece of a work which is not published in a mainstream journal, and is not accepted by the majority physics community. There are reasons why Afshar's work could not be published in any of the mainstream journals like Physical Review and Europhysics letters, where works novel in nature are published, although it claims to be most novel. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabish_q_9513.html" title="User:Tabish q">Tabish q</a> 21:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, after reviewing Wikipedia's policies, absolute sources are not necessary for "Criticism" sections, in this article being Specific Critiques and Ongoing Debate. While ArXiv isn't a reliable source for scientific fact, I would consider it to be acceptable to demonstrate that a certain person expresses a certain viewpoint. The reason we do not need the same level of attribution is that we are stating the "critiques" and "debate" as opinions on the experiment, rather than definite fact. Non-peer-reviewed papers are acceptable sources for things such as "So-and-so has stated such-and-such" but not statements of fact. <a href="../../../s/d/i/User%7ESdirrim_3c1d.html" title="User:Sdirrim">Sdirrim</a> 22:37, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Inclusion of this type of patently wrong OR even in the criticism section is unacceptable. Even if you attribute it to some group (especially if they are not notable), and if their source is unreliable, it nonetheless promotes that argument to a level of legitimacy within the article. It is like saying that in an article on 2+2=4, someone has written a paper that says 1+2=4 and therefore 2+2=5 as a criticism. Such an argument is OR and cannot be used even in the section on a criticism for the article on 2+2=4. The violation of the conservation laws suggested by DQD has been pointed out as absolute nonsense by Prof. Unruh himself even though he is a critic of my work. Let's not mix legitimate critiques with utter nonsense by armatures in the field. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 23:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is why we have the concept of "weight" in an article. Minority views need not be given the same weight as the standard view, but they sould still be included or at least mentioned.

Also I do NOT propose violations of conservations laws. As it was explained clearly to you by Tabish, the argument proposed does NOT violate concervation laws, simply after interference, each slit wavefunction evolves into superposition of two waves each with opposite momentum. As far as the final outcome is 50/50 no violation of conservation laws has been done by us.

Of course there are much more reputable journals that require higher taxes, and sell their content - do not release it free. Progress In Physics releases all his papers for open access, therefore the taxes are not for profit.

<dd>Comparing PNAS with PP? That's an insult. PNAS is a high quality print publication by the best American scholars (mostly in biological sciences), widely read and highly respected. It asks its usually well-funded authors to pitch in IF THEY CAN. As for PP, well, as a colleague mentioned it's not worth the paper it's published on.

<dd>Afshar, don't offend others, as you see this is not good way to lead a discussion. The fact that you are author of Afshar's experiment is understandable, yet this does not give you rights to behave as if this article is under your possesion. Indeed good Wikipedia advice is that you leave others edit the article that discusses your work.

<dd>Dear Michael. I'm not proposing deletion of your mangled contribution. I'm proposing putting back the well sourced counter-argument - and by well sourced I mean your source - Bohr himself. Consider Bohr's words "interference effect". By "interference effect" Bohr is referring to that which is recorded on a photographic plate - not those virtual interference patterns we might otherwise hallucinate as "already there". The single photons to which Bohr refers are theoretical particles. We can only appreciate such individual particles in theory. We can't actually see/experience them in fact. We only ever see (or experience) the trace they leave behind. When Bohr is talking about an "interference effect" he is referring to what we see/experience in fact - (or what a photographic plate experiences in fact). Bohr's "interference effect" is an emperical effect - a factum. And it's a statistical one at that. Otherwise we could point to a single particle trace and claim "look - there is demonstrated interference". Hah. It's absolute baloney Michael. Complete rubbish and you expect people to take you seriously and agree that your reading of Bohr correct. Well sourced it might be but your spin is completely ludicrous. And attributing complementarity to Ehrenfest is the worst defense I have seen emerge from your sorry straw clutching exercise in self delerium. And the way in which you conflate your "already there" argument with Drezet's otherwise decent criticque is absolutely sinful. Your OR is worse than anyone's OR here because you can't even see that it is OR. You are intellectually blind to your very own interpretative positon. Oh yes. I don't understand. You'll seek solace in Zurek, dreaming that everyone is confused and that only YOU understand the universe. Well buddy. Good luck. Just stay out of my way because I'm sick and tired of your stupid simplistic takes on otherwise very interesting theory. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 06:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm on Carl's side. Although I'm long dead I'm still capable of speaking. As a more appropriate way of expression, I advocated the application of the word phenomenon exclusively to refer to the observations obtained under specified circumstances, including an account of the whole experimental arrangement. In such terminology, the observational problem is free of any special intricacy since, in actual experiments, all observations are expressed by unambiguous statements referring, for instance, to the registration of the point at which an electron arrives at a photographic plate. Moreover, speaking in such a way is just suited to emphasise that the appropriate physical interpretation of the symbolic quantum-mechanical formalism amounts only to predictions, of determinate or statistical character, pertaining to individual phenomena appearing under conditions defined by classical physical concepts. - Neils Bohr.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By "attributing complementarity to Ehrenfest" I mean precisely statements such as:
<dl>
<dd>"Bohr probably knew of and drew on Ehrenfest's theorem in developing his complementarity POV." - MP</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Michael is suggesting that Ehrenfest's theorem is what Bohr "probably" means by "classical physical concepts". (as suggested by MP in prior discussions). Apart from being obvious OR it is also completely ludicrous. It goes against the entire grain of what Bohr is saying. Michael wants us to read Bohr as framing the formalism in terms of a "classicism" derived from the formalism. Yet this would just reintroduce the very ambiguitys Bohr is trying to avoid in the first place. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 04:45, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ok. Michael. If your words are so ambiguous as to allow "misreadings" such as mine please clarify. If the message I'm getting from you is incorrect then either you have failed to communicate and/or I have failed to understand. Which of these options is correct remains to be seen. However, if you refuse to elaborate any further (which would not surprise me) then it's no longer me who might be failing to understand - it will be just you who are failing to communicate.</dd>
<dd>For the benefit of other readers, Ehrenfest was brought up in the context of a discussion about Bohr's use of classical concepts. My question was how one could read Bohr's use of classical concepts, as an "echo" of the formalism. Michaels' response was:
<dl>
<dd>"Classical concepts (such as Newton's second law) emerge from the formalism via Ehrenfest's theorem." --Michael C. Price talk 10:35, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>How does one reply to such a thing? After dispatching some thoughts on decoherence Michael responded with:
<dl>
<dd>"I note that you avoided commenting on the emergence of classical concepts, such as Newton's laws of motion, from Ehrenfest's theorem, which is part of the formalism of QM." --Michael C. Price talk 23:52, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I responded to the challenge by suggesting that Bohr's classical concepts were those concepts that classical thought had invented - rather than any that might be re-invented via the formalism. Michael went on to say:
<dl>
<dd>"Bohr and Ehrenfest were particularly close, so Bohr undoubtly drew on Ehrenfest's theorem from the 1920s in developing his ideas on complementarity."--Michael C. Price talk 06:40, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Michael. I am the one who has backed up my claims - by quoting you directly. You are the one that needs to demonstrate how I've misunderstood or misrepresented your Ehrenfest argument. You say:
<dl>
<dd>"No, what is ludicrous is that Carl can produce a quote and then claim it means something completely different. Anyone can read my quote and see that Carl's interpretation is entirely unsupported." - MP</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This is a claim by you - ie. that I have misrepresented you. All I'm saying - is if I have misrepresented you then demonstrate how. As far as I am concerned, you were being perfectly clear. But if you were not (or I have misunderstood you) then please clarify. I can't do this for you. As I said, as far as I'm concerned you are perfectly clear. And I feel I have demonstrated such. Your problem is that while you are quick to accuse others of not arguing their case (which is patently incorrect) you refuse, or are incapable of arguing your own case. Have a look in the mirror Michael. And when you're done please argue your case - ie. in what way I have misrepresented your Ehrenfest argument. In other words - what is your argument if it's not the one I have presented here. Otherwise - as far as I'm concerned - what you are saying is perfectly clear - and perfectly incorrect. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 23:17, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As I discussed at length before, Marinov had several legitimate publications in the 70's in respectable journals like PLA and Found. Phys. yet he later kept pushing crank ideas like perpetual motion machines and absolute motion. To promote his already debunked ideas in a memorial article in PP is in fact worse than Marinov's original attempts. Do you care to explain why exactly he committed <a href="http://www.padrak.com/ine/NEN_5_5_2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.padrak.com/ine/NEN_5_5_2.html" rel="nofollow">suicide</a>? The reason is plain and simple: he tragically succumbed to the rejection from the mainstream physics community that aptly denied him the platform to promote his faulty ideas. This whole issue is a sordid affair, and I do not wish to talk about an individual that has passed away, yet there is not clearer case of carckpottery in 21st century and its promotion than that of Marinov and PP.-- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 12:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>As I read the discussion, most editors agree that the "disputed piece #4" is not based on sources that are themselves considered reliable and does not represent the views of prominent critics. Although this material would not ordinarily be suitable for Wikipedia, there is also the sentiment, shared by myself, that an effort should be made to represent the state of the criticism as completely as possible, even if that means using somewhat questionable sources. I think a reasonable compromise is to put some of this information in a footnote. This solution can certainly be discussed and eventually overthrown, but from the arguments presented, it is definitely closer to Wiki policy than the status quo. In the process I also removed the quotes since they simply stated the conclusion without explaining how it was arrived at. If anyone seriously objects to this move, please give your reasons succinctly here. I do not consider the extended inaction of the "mediator" to be a valid argument. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Carlson_64f0.html" title="User:Art Carlson">Art Carlson</a> 16:45, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I also, support Afshar to be able to edit, yet, please do not supprt his reversals, and offences. I have never been put on probation, nor I am crackpot to be reverted with such a sticker by Afshar. Please don't be blind for such a behavior, let us be civilized, and when Afshar does something bad, let us not close our eyes. Please also revert Afshar's reverts as he feels authorized by your vote giving him rights to edit directly. I and others have already voted and reached the decision that Afshar should be able to edit directly any portion of text, that is not connected with his experimental setup given in the introductory part. The Critique section must be immunized against Afshar's direct edits, otherwise he unbalances, deletes, offends, puts "crackpot labels" and thus pushes extremely his own OR position to the end. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 06:55, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>One of the major problems with Michael's argument is that he conflates an "interference effect" with the wave function, and an "observed particle" with "tracing a path". The formalism embodys the wave function - it does not embody (in a formal sense) the "interference effect". The interference effect is, of course, predicted by the formalism. Now BPC (and Afshar's experiment) is more specifically, about the "interference effect" and it's supposed complementary relationship with the construction (tracing) of a semi-classical path (rather than a particle detection per se). Drezet's argument is an important one which Michael mangles. According to Bohr (which Drezet notes) one can not reconstruct the wave function from a set of individual particle detections. One can, of course, reconstruct composite or "pseudo-wave functions". And this happens quite a lot in information theoretic terms. But in Afshar's experiment, unlike the conventional twin slit experiment, it is actually impossible to reconstruct even a pseudo-wave function. In many ways Afshar's experiment is better than the twin slit experiment since it elliminates the very possibility of reconstructing a pseudo-wave function (I'm ignoring the minor fourier components discernible). In other words, Bohr's warning is actually irrelevant here. Another important point is that, in solid state experiments such as the Afshar experiment, (and the twin slit experiment), the wave function associated with any single detection is mathematically equivalent to the wave function for any other particle detection - ie. in the same solid state experiment. This does not mean they are the same (in a formal sense) - but it does mean one can recycle the math from such, for use in constructing a brand new wave function for prescribing a new particle detection - on the proviso that each is understood as a brand new wave function. But back to BPC. BPC concerns the "interference effect" which IS A STATISTICAL EFFECT. What Bohr was warning against was reading the formal wave function as a statistical effect - if only by definition - by it's very postulation as an a priori concept for predicting single particle detections. But in the Afshar experiment, the wave function (and the formalism) is not at issue. Michael wants it to be but he's wrong. One of the key strategys in the Afshar experiment is to produce an "interference effect" via the intensity of photons detections (per unit area of space or ideally at a point) rather than via the traditional method ie. by a statistical distribution of detections over space. It is the production of an "interference effect" and what's more it even prevents any "illegal" reconstruction of the wave function. And that is how it should be because that is what BPC is all about. It is about just such effects - and the conditions in which just such effects are physically realisable. On the other side is the path function. A semi-classical path not to be confused with Feynman's path integral. Feynman's path integral is a way of constructing the wave function. Bohr's path is a different beast. But it is not important here. I merely wish to show up how Michael's argument is confused at best and deliberately misleading at worst. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 00:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Carl, and others. I agree that Afshar can edit the article, as far as, he does not insert personal offences on other authors. Afshar has claimed himself "expert in the field" and then edits the article by offending others like prof. T. Qureshi, who is really great scientist, has numerous contributions to QM, has shown that Afshar makes simple error in calculations, and has his article accepted in peer-reviewed journal, so let us peacufully expect this event (publication of Qureshi's work), and do not offend each others. Concerning the Progress in Physics, this is official article, peer-reviewed and published in the standard procedures, if Afshar wants to send rebuttal etc., he is free to do so, yet Wikipedia is NOT the place for PARTISAN WARS. Let us be solidary with each other and let Afshar edit the article, but as I said above, as far as he does not offend other people.

<dd>Until and unless OR contained in the old disputed text # 4 is published in a reputable peer-reviewed journal, it should be removed from the article page. If the text remains in the footnotes, at the very least, the statement qualifying the status of the DQD "papers" (such as the one by Art Carlson) should remain to remind the readers of the lack of general support in physics community for their argument. As far as I know, no respectable journal would publish Qureshi's false and erroneous arguments. As for PP, we know what kind of a "journal" it is, the very fact that one ends up "publishing" in such a "journal" is rebuttal enough! -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 07:01, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Afshar, If I look above, I see only your offences, and I see no real argument against PP being good and reputable journal. Did the readers of Wikipedia need Afshar's approval of journals, if so, then post your request in Wiki, and by-the-way give us a list of all "Afshar's reputable" journals, just to know where to publish in the future. I guess at the very moment prof. Qureshi's paper appears, then the place will be also "Afshar's disreputable journal". Did someone ask you why Phys. Rev. Letts. REJECTED your manuscript? Did anyone ask why two other journals rejected it also, before appearing in Found. Phys. where traditionally violations of relativity articles are published - see Wesley, Foundations of Physics, Vol. 10, Nos. 5/6, 1980, 503-511 on Michelson-Morley, and other papers. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 08:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I haven't heard of any of them before, but at least Unruh and Motl have blue links. Would it be reasonable to just keep those two as representatives of this argument in the main text and to mention Kastner, Drezet, and Steuernagel in a footnoote?

<dd>Dear Art, if you check the vol.3 for 2007 of PP <a href="http://www.ptep-online.com/index_files/issues.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ptep-online.com/index_files/issues.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> you will see that there is announced reply by Unruh. I have seen his preliminary draft, and I already sent back to Unruh locating an error of him. So, the Editor-In-Chief of PP is uncertain whether Unruh will re-submit, nevertheless the expected reply is announced now as "coming". The whole discussion better be solved by peer-reviewing and publishing in reputable journals. It took Afshar more than 2 years and half to publish, after series of rejections in top journals. Only now after Afshar's paper is published, not so famous journals, but still good enough [PP has editorial board of four top mathematicians], accept to discuss this experiment [previously no journal will discuss web blogs]. So after 3 months maybe we will see Unruh's reply, and possibly I will also be invited to answer, also prof. Qureshi's and mine work are submitted to other journals and if our analysis is correct, then it will be solved only on math grounds, and nothing will depend on the "notability" or "Wiki-notability" of the authors. As I see Afshar pushes too far his opinion, offends people, and boldly proclaims jimself as expert in the field. Well, Afshar has only 1 paper so far, compare prof. <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabish_Qureshi_f222.html" title="Tabish Qureshi">Tabish Qureshi</a>'s numerous contributions in QM. Also, prof. <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabish_Qureshi_f222.html" title="Tabish Qureshi">Tabish Qureshi</a> is extremely honest physicist and a man, to reject working on Nuclear Weapons, and thus had to leave his previos job. I think everyone sees that Afshar is "promo" oriented and not "science" oriented. If he had disproof, he would have posted at least in arXiv, and would not have offended all of us as "disreputable", "publishing for money", etc. Indeed before my article was accepted Afshar was quite sure that I will never have accepted my work because it is "crackpotery", yet, even I have much more contributions [some of them invited] on topic of bio-physics and QM in biosystems. Afshar's sole paper, does not give him rights to proclaims everyone opposing his views as "crackpot". Please Update the links of my published paper, as well as Kastner's published paper - my edit was reverted by Afshar, despite of the fact that in two of my edits I have updated Kastner's work. I don't have time to do internet war. If one checks back my edits, he will find all the journal bibliography, etc. needed.

<dd>Over the next few years, I am sure science will take its course, and this article will be much easier to write in an way that all parties agree is NPOV. The case could be made that it is too early for any article at all on the Afshar experiment, precisely because there has not been time for the scientific community to respond through its official channels. I am looking for a compromise that allows our readers to find out about this interesting experiment, but also alternative interpretations of it. I agree that giving extra weight to blue links is an imperfect mechanism. It is not clear to me how you propose to deal with the situation until such time as peer-reviewed responses are available.

<p>... The Wiki-entries are always created by people who admirate the contributions of someone, I personally exactly as you [Art] have never heard of Unruh and Motl, before reading in Wikipedia, and I am not impressed by their math inconsistent analysis of Afshar's setup. Nervertheless I do NOT force or push extreme views that their opinions on the topic be deleted, or moved as footnotes. Yes, their views remained on web blogs, and I believe in case when they are officially disproved neither Motl nor Unruh will bother of publishing officially their web thoughts. (Note: Unruh's setup is officially described in my peer-reviewed paper, while Motl's analysis is not mentioned anywhere except on his blog). However I personally think the <b>Critiques</b> section must be restored in its original form divided into two groups of objections, then all web links updated, and finally Afshar once and for all be banned from reverting the Critique section. As I clearly explained in previous posts, Afshar may edit concerning the meaning of his own papers, and on the experimental details of what he has done, but he must not put his Afshar's approval, on what others have said regarding Afshar's views. If a researcher publishes that Afshar's view is inconsistent, it is his own right to defend this position with the tools of mathematical logic. And this implies future mathematical discussion, not Afshar's views on the improtance of mathematics at first place, or Afshar's labeling of the opposing scientist with "crackpot" or other offensive names.

<p>In its current form the whole section is not logical. Before there were two groups of specific critiques, which were clearly separated by the criterion when the which way is erased (i.e. when the grid is put, or it is erased by the interference even if there is no grid). Now this information is deleted. And if there is no such criteria on the common priciple that grounds given opinion, then WHAT makes the critique of Unruh "specific"? Nothing! - the quotation says that "Bohr wouldn't have whatsoever problem". This is repeated 3 more times for the rest of the scientists. What is the common of their claims, is WHY Afshar claims are wrong, and this is what you [Art] and Afshar have deleted. To repeat in quotations that "Bohr wouldn't have whatsoever problem" several times is meaningless, as it does not say WHY Bohr wouldn't have the problem at first place. <b>I think all these quotations should be deleted, and only reference to researcher's work be left.</b> Concerning the statement that the "non-prominent" scientist work has not been peer-reviewed and published - it is a lie, and does not correspond to the truth. Also as prof. Qureshi now has wiki-entry, I am not sure why he is labelled as "non-prominent" yet others that do not even have wiki-entry are "prominent" as they remain in the main text. p.s.

<dd>Well, thanks for the edits. At least some of the true information has been recovered. Now, I don't know what else Afshar may object, there are at least 2 peer-reviewed objections, as Kastner's appears in 2005 2 years before Afshar's paper sees "white day". Still, one may delete the not informative quotations, as well as this incorrect statement, footnote on no which way, "See, for example, the following preprints", it is wrong as the updated paper of mine is no more pre-print, but paper print journal. Soon I will have the new paper print volume as an author, so I will be able to deposit several journal copies in the University Library of Kanazawa University. Still, there are under peer-review works of mine and Qureshi, so let us not engage ourselves in a partisan war for that time.

<dd>I have corrected the statement about preprints so that it now only refers to Qureshi and Reitzner. I have added a parenthetical statement after your reference that Progress in Physics "prides itself on questioning orthodox views".

<dd>Dear Art, are you making parody of PP? Where did you read this? As far as I know my proof defends the "orthodox views" while the Afshar's proof questions the "orthodox views". I consider your remark as offensive and parodizing my contribution as IF I am defending "un-orthodox" view. The PP journal sais that it publishes topics on physics of interest and related math issues. Please remove your comment as derogatory. We are not here to discuss which journal of what is proud. Also the Wiki-entry on PP is not really very nice in its form. Somebody has possibly in-appropriately inserted the quotation, I wouldn't myself included it at first place. I just updated the references, as always, my edits are mostly to provide the original sources, and I never delete factual information, except in cases where obvious violations of Wiki-policy appears. Your remark on PP is highly subjective, hence not appropriate for Wikipedia. Readers themselves can click on the PP link and read and decide for themselves. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 13:01, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>p.s. I have myself re-edited the wiki-text on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progress_in_Physics_0069.html" title="Progress in Physics">Progress in Physics</a>, as the remark was possibly written by person with ill intentions aiming at pushing some personal attitude, which is not acceptable. The home page of PP clearly states the objectives of the journal, and I see nowhere to be written that all kind of "crack-pottery" is acceptable for publishing. I still think that offending journals, is not suitable discussion for Wikipedia. Let us wait, and see future works are to be published soon, prof. Qureshi has already announced that his article is accepted, mine second paper is under peer-review. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 13:12, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Art, let us discuss this topic at the PP talk page. <b>Quoting out of context</b> is bad quoting, and pushes OR views and usually not-good intentions. Please note that I am academic scholar, PhD researcher at the moment in neuroscience, and I am word-by-word acquainted with ALL sections of the mentioned Academic Declaration, as I did the Bulgarian translation for free, as a protest of the nonsense going on in science. My PhD topic has been changed into one that I dislike [i.e. not like too much?], every journal with impact factor above 3, not only checks your affiliations, and the "notable co-authors with you" so that hardly be called science. The main idea of the whole Declaration should be understood after complete reading from A to Z. The stress is on fair science, and judging on solely scientific grounds, and not on extra-scientific factors as notability, money-invested, etc. The Declaration does not say all crackpots are wellcome to publish with us. The declaration implies that crackpot work will be rejected because of logical inconsistency, and not on grounds of lack of eduation, or lack of affiliation. Yes, this requires at least the peer-reviewer to read the submitted mnuscript first. In IOP journal Pure and Applied Optics, my paper was returned in 24 h with note "Dear author, unfortunately your article topic is outside the scope of the journal". I am not afraid to confess that, this is commercialized publishing. Bad is, when journal returns peer-review comments that clearly show that your work is nonsense. . <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 14:41, 28 March 2007 (UTC) p.s. This topic is irrelevant for this talk page, I have seen your edits on PP, so I fully AGREE. Yet, please now revert your edits of (preprint), (the journal prides ..). etc notes, see the section below. Otherwise, I request you to insert also full categorization of all sources, so 3 new labels are to appear - (<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blogs</a>), (not peer-reviewed proceedings), and (<a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_press.html" title="Yellow press">yellow press</a>).

<dd>I'm not sure it's such a ridiculous idea to give a one-link characterization of the nature of our sources. It would help readers that are not at all familiar with the nature of scientific publications. For sophisticated readers, "arXiv" is enough. I will remove the preprint designation for consistency pending further discussion.</dd>
<dd>The note on PP is more difficult. A reader who has not heard of PP - and most have not - will assume that it is a mainline journal. To put this reference into proper perspective, it is important to know that the philosophy of PP differs significantly from that of other publications. You make this very point in your comments above. I have tried to formulate this is a NPOV way by quoting from the Declaration. Would you like to suggest a more appropriate characterization?

<dd>Second question, why prof. Qureshi's link is in the footnote, and Drezet is in the main article? Just wondering - me and Drezet have no great scientific background as both of us are youngsters below 30 years, yet prof. Qureshi has big enough academic record, as he is already awarded PhD, in contrast with me and Drezet. Also Qureshi has a Wiki-link, in contrast to Sternaugel who is completely unfamousm, not to mention that his analysis is subject to objections <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 10:03, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you that the fact that Drezet does not have a PhD (which I didn't know) is an argument that he is not a prominent expert and therefore should perhaps be mentioned only in a footnote.

<dd>I am not argueing in that way! I am testing what are the limits of your honesty in applying your own criteria! For me whether Drezet has PhD or not is NOT relevant. If I cared about notabilities, I would never have argued against Unruh. Yet, I am expecting that Unruh will withdraw his flawed letter, announced in PP, so that the whole issue is decided once and for all. Neverhteless I think there is more interesting events to come in PP, in the dialogue Georgiev vs. Unruh, instead of posting here offenses on journals, etc. p.s.

<p><i>"But in the Afshar experiment it is actually impossible to reconstruct a pseudo-wave function from Afshar's particle detections."</i> I don't want to check who has written this text, but it is obvious misunderstanding of physics. <b>If you don't know the wavefunction of the setup, how can you calculate and predict the outcome?</b> The text is erroneous, and represents one's own thought activity, i.e. OR. I hope the person who inserted this reverts/deletes himself this text. Explanation: physical theories have major purpose to predict the future outcomes of physical experiment, the theories do not have major purpose to be tested or recovered by experiments. All theories say more that can be derived by experiment, that is why theories have explanatory power. Wave-function <span class="texhtml">Ψ</span> is NOT observable, what is observable is <span class="texhtml">| Ψ | <sup>2</sup></span>, so the wavefunction is constructed by the theory, given that you know the conditions of the original setup. The wavefunction is NOT reconstructed with what you observe as <span class="texhtml">| Ψ | <sup>2</sup></span>. So the wavefunction is NOT constructible by the observations, it is constructible [at 100%] from the theory plus the setup conditions. <b>That is why what you will observe does NOT change the conclusions/predictions of the QM formalism.</b> Arithmetics cannot be disproved by experiment - see the basics of math logic. Observations can prove/disprove only the standard QM formalism as "corresponding to reality", but this is another issue. That is why Bohr's complementarity cannot be experimentally disproved without experimentally disproving QM formalism first, yet this is another topic. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 06:11, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A <i>pseudo</i> wave function is not the same thing as the wave function. PLEASE DO NOT CONFLATE THE TWO IN YOUR ARGUMENT. A pseudo wave function CAN be reconstructed from detector data. The wave function can't since it is an a priori concept. By way of analogy one can reconstruct the pseudo-radius of a circle already drawn on a peice of paper. The actual radius is the one used to draw the circle in the first place. Both the pseudo-radius and the radius, as here explained, in extraordinarily simple language, are both profound and deep scientific concepts. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 23:56, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Carl, my sincere regards, however the word "pseudo-wavefunction" is NOT a term in the standard QM formalism. I didn't understand what this term implies, and as this is NEVER used in standard texts on QM, it appears to be your original idea. It is not my fault, that without explicit note I didn't recognize your original thoughts. I hope this clarifies, a lot. Concerning your paper, if you want, I can discuss in e-mail, I do believe as I usually formulate my claims in very strict math language, we can discuss and enjoy the dialogue, as we will exchange meningful information. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 04:38, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The point I'm making is that, unlike the twin slit experiment, from which one can derive a pseudo-wave function, the same can not be said about the Afshar experiment. In other words, any warning regarding reconstruction of pseudo wave functions, from detector data, and the possibility of confusing such with the wave function, is only relevant to the twin slit experiment - not the Afshar experiment - since in the Afshar experiment, a pseudo wave function is not constructible. Hope you understand. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 00:08, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I've just re-read the quote to see what is causing the confusion and am surprised to find no confusion whatsover. Here is the full quote:
<dl>
<dd>Bohr's "interference effect" is, in his own words, a statistical effect (see below). An interference effect is not the same thing as the wave function. One should not (normally) attempt to reconstruct a wave function from an ensemble of photon detections. Such reconstructions will invariably be psuedo-wave functions - especially in non-solid state experiments. But in the Afshar experiment it is actually impossible to reconstruct a pseudo-wave function from Afshar's particle detections.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And just so we're clear here is reproduced a previous commentary (from the talk pages) on this point:
<dl>
<dd>One of the major problems with Michael's argument is that he conflates an "interference effect" with the wave function, and an "observed particle" with "tracing a path". The formalism embodys the wave function - it does not embody (in a formal sense) the "interference effect". The interference effect is, of course, predicted by the formalism. Now BPC (and Afshar's experiment) is more specifically, about the "interference effect" and it's supposed complementary relationship with the construction (tracing) of a semi-classical path (rather than a particle detection per se). Drezet's argument is an important one which Michael mangles. According to Bohr (which Drezet notes) one can not reconstruct the wave function from a set of individual particle detections. One can, of course, reconstruct composite or "pseudo-wave functions". And this happens quite a lot in information theoretic terms. But in Afshar's experiment, unlike the conventional twin slit experiment, it is actually impossible to reconstruct even a pseudo-wave function. In many ways Afshar's experiment is better than the twin slit experiment since it elliminates the very possibility of reconstructing a pseudo-wave function (I'm ignoring the minor fourier components discernible). In other words, Bohr's warning is actually irrelevant here. Another important point is that, in solid state experiments such as the Afshar experiment, (and the twin slit experiment), the wave function associated with any single detection is mathematically equivalent to the wave function for any other particle detection - ie. in the same solid state experiment. This does not mean they are the same (in a formal sense) - but it does mean one can recycle the math from such, for use in constructing a brand new wave function for prescribing a new particle detection - on the proviso that each is understood as a brand new wave function. But back to BPC. BPC concerns the "interference effect" which IS A STATISTICAL EFFECT. What Bohr was warning against was reading the formal wave function as a statistical effect - if only by definition - by it's very postulation as an a priori concept for predicting single particle detections. But in the Afshar experiment, the wave function (and the formalism) is not at issue. Michael wants it to be but he's wrong. One of the key strategys in the Afshar experiment is to produce an "interference effect" via the intensity of photons detections (per unit area of space or ideally at a point) rather than via the traditional method ie. by a statistical distribution of detections over space. It is the production of an "interference effect" and what's more it even prevents any "illegal" reconstruction of the wave function. And that is how it should be because that is what BPC is all about. It is about just such effects - and the conditions in which just such effects are physically realisable. On the other side is the path function. A semi-classical path not to be confused with Feynman's path integral. Feynman's path integral is a way of constructing the wave function. Bohr's path is a different beast. But it is not important here. I merely wish to show up how Michael's argument is confused at best and deliberately misleading at worst. --Carl A Looper 00:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you see, if only on this point, (regarding detector defined "wave functions") we really should be in agreement with each other. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 02:51, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. Delete the whole thing. But someone else needs to do it - but without destroying the links. Re - scientific contribution. It is true that I haven't completed my paper but there is far more material I need to go through than a re-exposition of the QM formalism. I'm writing from the point of view of information theory (a well defined science) and in particular signal theory - and even more specifically, - semiotics. The main problem is this. In terms of the QM formalism alone, one could argue that no "interference effect" can be said to have taken place in the Afshar experiment since the shape of the wave function, which normally determines the presence/absence of an interference effect (at the detector site) is determined only by the apertures and lens/detector arrangement - the wires playing no role whatsoever in shaping the wave function. And since the shape of the wave function, at the detector site no longer carrys any intrinsic interference information (other than minor fourier components) one must conclude that no "interference effect" is demonstrated. But if one is to claim an "interference effect", then one must look wider than the formalism, back in the setup - which is where Bohr is otherwise pre-occupied. And sure enough - there are the wires. We can't erase our knowledge of the wires - but the wave function does - insofar as it never carrys any information regarding the wires in the first place. What we find is that it is the combination of <i>our</i> knowledge regarding the wires (a pre wave function structure), and the information embodied in the data (the intensity level) , plus our understanding of the wave function, which collectively construct our conclusion that an "interference effect" is demonstrated. But this can't be demonstrated by the QM formalism. It can, however, be demonstrated in terms of what Bohr is talking about. And what Bohr is talking about, as well as Heisenberg, involves a good deal of theory beyond the formalism. And to expose such requires a good deal of research which I can only lightly touch upon here in the hope that someone else is capable of picking up on it. For everyone else they must wait for the paper and reponder their equations. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 23:27, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Art, my regards, but Kastner's argument is flawed. It is NOT the superposition that erases the which way. Imagine AS AFSHAR POINTED OUT the two non-overlapping beams, for example arm 1 and 2 of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, or the two slit beams before they overlap i.e. very close to the slit. Yes, they are superposied in the form <span class="texhtml">Ψ = α<sub>1</sub> | 1 &gt; + α<sub>2</sub> | 2 &gt;</span> , however because |1&gt; and |2&gt; are NON-OVERLAPPING i.e. orthogonal, at this stage the ww info is NOT erased, as these two wavefunctions [kets, |1&gt; and |2&gt;] do NOT manifest interference effects. Only after the overlap region the ww info is erased. This is clearly expressed in the equations 3 and 4 in my published article. As you have PhD in physics, you can check for yourself the calculations, they are not too complex after all. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 04:43, 30 March 2007 (UTC) p.s. Kastner consulted Cramer, and Cramer said the ww info is there in many articles and lectures of him! So "never really" if understood literally, then Kastner should provide thesis exactly opposite to Cramer, yet Cramer was one of the consusltants. I am not sure whether Kastner has clear idea of what she is proposing. Simply if she relies only on superposition to erase the ww info, then she provides wrong argument, which is to be classified in 3rd group, separately! <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 04:47, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We are not discussing here whether Kastner is right or not, simply that her argument is improperly characterized in the current version. In addition, I don't think your description here is accurate. She is not saying that the superposition <i>erases</i> which-way-information, but that the wave function <i>always</i> contains both "ways" - at the slits, at the wires, in front of the detector, all the way up till the collapse of the wavefunction in the detection process. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Carlson_64f0.html" title="User:Art Carlson">Art Carlson</a> 07:27, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Art, the which way concept is one-to-one correspondence concept. It has nothing to do directly with superposition of paths, i.e. much more other stuff is needed in order to prove the required bijection. Superposition existent or not, by itself is not directly linked to idea of bijection. For bijection, you must at first define two sets mathematically, then you must verify they have the same cardinality, and then describe a mapping. See <a href="../../../b/i/j/Bijection.html" title="Bijection">bijection</a> for details. I had the impression that Cramer was major consultant of Castner, so I thought that Kastner supports Cramer's view which are exactly clear for which way. Of course all these objections from this group are math inconsistent, so I am not surprized that confusions arise. p.s. feel free to classify Kastner's work any way you like. And reply to Afshar, yes there are two camps of objections, the fact that Kastner does not fit anywhere, is simply because her analogy is hardly seen or understood by anybody, as it is provably incorrect. In contrast Unruh's setup is crystally clear in disproving Afshar's analysis, however not in the way originally proposed by Unruh. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 08:33, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "grid erases info" was put there by Danko to create an illusion of two major camps! The fact is the arguments presented by Unruh, Motl, Kastner, Drezet and others in that section are varied, subtle and usually contradictory to the other critics' argument. Kastner is using Cramer's Transactional Interpretation discussing an allegedly analogous experiment using Spin 1/2 particles and Stern-Gerlach apparatus. I have previously discussed the lack of analogy between my experiment and her suggested one's at the APS March 2006 <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR06/Event/40525" class="external text" title="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR06/Event/40525" rel="nofollow">meeting</a> chaired by Prof. Greenberger, and separately my colleagues have responded to her in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702210" class="external free" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702210" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702210</a>. Her argument is very different from the fringe DQD argument, which is questioning the conservation of momentum argument espoused by Einstein and later used by Wheeler discussed in the article on <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheeler%27s_delayed_choice_experiment.html" title="Wheeler's delayed choice experiment">Wheeler's delayed choice experiment</a>. I suggest we remove the "grid erases info" from the text, and leave the fringe DQD argument in the footnotes, until they publish in a reputable peer-reviewed journal. BTW/ Unruh is a very famous and well-respected theoretical physicists who worked with Hawking and Davies (see <a href="../../../u/n/r/Unruh_effect.html" title="Unruh effect">Unruh effect</a>)...-- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 20:03, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

It seems that once again D. Georgiev try to monopolize the discussion here. I have only two comments concerning his paper . First, watching the submission date (march 01 )and the acceptance date (march 05) it is celar that there is no reviewing process . Also it means that this paper is not more valuable that a preprint on arxiv. It would be nice if danko could calm down a bit and simply be open for other points of view. Secondly, (but this is a detail ) the fact that <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabish_Qureshi_f222.html" title="Tabish Qureshi">Tabish Qureshi</a> is famous or not is not relevant in your argumentation because Unruh for exampl is for sure much more known.

<dd>Drezet, I am "copying" Afshar's argument, as it is one of my favourite ways to lead discussion, use the tools of the opponet, and force him into self-contradiction. Please comment on Afshar, not me. BTW, acceptance date with 2 years delay, is NOT a criterion either.
