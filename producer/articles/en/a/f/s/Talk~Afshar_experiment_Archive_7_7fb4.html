<dd>I will have to agree with Prof. Afshar that Danko is toeing the boundary of disciplinary action, by his name calling and obsessive behavior. If Danko wishes to make a contribution to the debate, he should write up his treatise and have it published in archiv or elsewhere, like 3 of the critics have done. To make a campaign out of his disagreement, is not the way that scientific inquiry is conducted. The noise level introduced in this debate by Danko only serves to muddle the issue and becomes a distraction for those who wish to learn about this experiment, the controversy, and debate. Now, unrelated to this thread, but in order to mitigate any possible accusations of socketry and puppetry and parrotry, let me incidentally just add that I disagree with the scientific conclusion of this work, and maintain that distinguishibility is close to one, while visibility is close to zero.Forkhume 10:31, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Momentum in QM</span></h2>
<p><i><b>Afshar's wrong thesis:</b> <b>" very briefly, the photons happen to have linear momentum. Upon detection at the image plane the conservation laws demand that they must have originated from he corresponding pinhole. I did not make up this law, it simply is Nature in action! "</b></i> In classical physics you can denote the momentum by vector - it has magnitude and direction. In QM you cannot measure both these values correctly - if you measure the momentum magnitude, you actually do not measure its direction, and you do not really measure momentum, but you make mesurement of photon's energy. So the popular view that the interference picture is measuring momentum is not fully correct - better say that the interference picture is measuring photon's energy because <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/5/e/95e3280260efc6b9417f9a22edf57744.png" alt="E = \frac{h c}{\lambda}" />. The popular view is misleading because you may imagine classical momentum vector, and thus think as Afshar does that you have correspondence with a pinhole. However this is wrong and the uncertainty in the momentum's direction is what erases the which way info, and you cannot be sure whether the photon passed through pinhole 1 or pinhole 2. If you put the two pinholes far from each other, so that the uncertainty is much less than the interpinhole distance, then you will have distinguishable photons [at least by time of their arrival] and you will lose the interference picture. Actually you will not measure Energy [wavelength] anymore, but you will measure time arrival. I think that it is better to interprete the Afshar experiment in terms of Heisenberg's E, t uncertainty, instead of classical p, x uncertainty. The problem in the latter is that momentum in classical physics is vector with magnitude and direction, while in QM these both are subject to Heisenberg's uncertainty. I hope this little lecture will be of help to Afshar also, who for 18 years struggles to see the difference between momentum in classical physics and momentum in QM.

<li>Dear Danko, ONCE a photon is absorbed it's momentum is constrained by the geometry of the experimental setup (in accordance with the conservation laws), which in the case of my experiment is well-defined, and different for each image. One does not assign a momentum vector to the photon prior to measurement, but after it's wavefunction collapses we have no other choice, otherwise would have to violate the conservation laws. If you disagree with this analysis, you are essentially diasagreeing with Bohr, Einstein, Wheeler, Greenberger, Englert, Zeilinger, Scully...; not to mention the rest of physicsts in the world! That would be a bigger feat than violating the Principle of Complementarity, but one that I would not support. Also, please understand that <b>Heisenberg's uncertainty Principle is not violated in my experiment and any claim to the contrary is wrong. Assigning such claims to me is disinformation.</b> This is not an educational forum, nor do I have the time to correct the seemingly endless errors you make. For the last time, please heed the statement at the top of the page, and allow the agreed upon process discussed in the voting debate to start. Please respect the outcome of your <b>failed</b> deletion bid. Interference with that process may lead to being blocked from Wikipedia. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 12:49, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dear Afshar, your post is non-sense. I have opposed to Unruh, Drezet, Cramer, Zeilinger .. etc., so IF you add some more names that have made the same error like you, you should provide some direct quotations, and then list them in my negative list. Science is science, so anyone who understands mathematics can check and see that you do not understand what is momentum in QM. In order to make retrospective claim you need to have your photon labeled (e.g. by polarization filters at the pinholes), otherwise it is the uncertainty principle that forbids you to make which way propositions. Read some papers in Physical Reviews because I do not have time to teach you. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 04:19, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here I present visualisation of how should be understood the momentum in QM, and why conservation laws should NOT be applied. Use the standard double slit experiment. Although the light might be emitted perpendicularly to the double slit, it can be detected also in any point where the probability is not zero in the interference pattern at the screen. You cannot look only the photon in considering Afshar's pseudo-conservation of momentum, because you will see absurd - the photon before the double slit goes in one direction, and the final "kick" at the screen in another direction. So something happens during the photon's flight - it interacts with the double slit.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/d/_/Image%7EDd_mo.gif_db08.html" class="image" title="Image:Dd_mo.gif"><img src="../../../upload/9/9a/Dd_mo.gif" alt="Image:Dd_mo.gif" width="429" height="243" longdesc="../../../d/d/_/Image%7EDd_mo.gif_db08.html" /></a></p>
<p>Now since the two slits <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>2</sub></span> are not distinguishable, the photon's probability follows no-which-way distribution where <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i> = | ψ<sub>1</sub> + ψ<sub>2</sub> | <sup>2</sup></span>. The MAGNITUDE of the photon's momentum is known, but the DIRECTION of the momentum is superposition of flight through <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>2</sub></span>, so the final "kick" at the screen (if one thinks classically) should be in such direction AS IF the photon comes from between the two slits. Actually I think that to sum the momentum vectors and to have "kick" in some resultant direction is good for showing the inconsistency of classical visualization, and indeed I propose that the reality of superposition remains [otherwise the kicked atom from the screen will be attributed defined x, and p, which will violate Heisenberg's relations]. The illustration is done just to show that you CANNOT THINK in classical way and preserve the momentum. When emitted the photon might have been perpendicular to the double-slit, but when detected the "kick" at the screen is neither perpedicular, nor you are allowed to say through which slit the photon has passed, nor you should be able to know the direction of the momentum. <b>To appeal to conservation laws in QM is equal to suicide -</b> <i>neither the velocity of light is the higher limit (e.g. Hawking radiation), nor the conservation of energy is strictly required (e.g. vacuum zero energy fluctuations), nor you can have precise measurement of both momentums magnitude and direction (e.g. Afshar's error).</i></p>
<p>Now what happens when you put lens? The same thing - the photon passes through both slits, and interacts with the lens in order to be refracted towards both of the images, and he arrives at both detectors in a pure state <img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/5/0/05020e7f7f6ca188a1c013cd40a261a7.png" alt="\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|D_{1}&gt;+|D_{2}&gt;)" />. Since the light is coherent the photon after the double slit will have superposition of directions of the momentum, some of which might be in imaginary space [that accounts for the possibility of tunneling]. The final "kick" at the detectors IF you imagine one, will surely not be in direction defined e.g. by connection slit 1, center of the lens, and detector 1, for detection at detector 1, and this is because you cannot know simultaneously both the momentum's magnitude and direction. If you have polarized light however, the final "kick" e.g. at detector 1 will be exactly as the defined above, so you will have 1:1 correspondence between slit 1 and detector 1, yet you will not be able to say the magnitude of this "kick", because you do not know the photon's wavelength. As summary somewhere in the flight the photon interacts with the medium of the lens in order to be refracted and might have changed either the magnitude [wavelength] or the direction of motion, in a way that you cannot use momentum conservation! The situation resembles the <b>delayed choice experiment</b> - if you want to "trick out" the photon by measuring its direction of propagation, the photon will know already the future decision that you will make, so the photon will interact in a way to lose or gain some energy, precluding you knowing its wavelength. Inversely if you want to measure the wavelength the photon will <b>supercausally</b> know this, so the photon will interact with the lens to make its direction of propagation unknowable for you.</p>
<p>p.s. the same principle apllies even for the emission of photons by the laser of Afshar, where <span class="texhtml">λ</span> = 650 nm. In case when you know that the photon is with wavelength <span class="texhtml">λ</span> = 650 nm, you actually cannot be sure that it is emitted perpendicularly to the double slit, and in case when you know a photon is emitted perpendicularly to the double slit, you no more know that its wavelength is <span class="texhtml">λ</span> = 650 nm. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 07:18, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Energy_conservation_in_QM" id="Energy_conservation_in_QM"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Energy conservation in QM</span></h2>
<p>Analogously to the Afshar's proposed conservation of momentum, one might argue that the conservation of energy is "Nature in action" (quoting Afshar), so one might equally well argue that vacuum zero energy fluctuations ARE NOT THERE, and one might argue to have disproven QM. So the solution is simple - either you accept that in QM violation of various conservation laws is possible in the limits precribed by Heisenberg's relations, or you should argue that the whole QM is false.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Danko's point of view</span></h2>
<p>Danko could you summarize here in few sentences your argumentations or put a link to a paper&#160;? regards <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrezet_d217.html" title="User:Drezet">Drezet</a> 27 /01/06</p>
<p>Dear Aurelien, I do not know why you want my argument clearly, but I will do just because I have formulated my main thesis in a dozen of EQUIVALENT formulations. Most of you think that everything is just rumbling, but IF turn back and investigate all my examples, you will see a single main thesis, that reveals its face in different angle. So below I put the summary of my thesis.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The Afshar experiment should be understood of terms of <b>E, t uncertainty</b>, where Afshar's claim is incompatible with Heisenberg's principle. It is clear that V=1, because the wires, may be well silver compund detectors of light. Since they detect nothing they are in absolutely dark, hence they record interference minima, and perform Reininger's negative collapse of the wavefunction in basis E (energy). So you know precisely the wavelength <span class="texhtml">λ</span> of the photon, by the spacing of the wire-detectors, and <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/5/e/95e3280260efc6b9417f9a22edf57744.png" alt="E = \frac{h c}{\lambda}" />. But IF you know the which way [K=1] you can calculate the time for arrival of the photon from its emission to its absorbtions. THIS VIOLATES HEISENBERG. But I say that there is no which way, because the photon goes through both pinholes and each photon is in superposition at each detector. Since he has followed two different trajectories each one by single pinhole, you have two calculate time travel by two different length paths, so you have uncertainty in time - so, no which way!</li>
<li>Why Afshar makes error? He does not understand the difference between classical and quantum momentum. In classical physics you have vector with defined magnitude and direction. In complementarity this does not happen. [1] Suppose you have Afshar's experiment you have measured the wavelength, so you know the MAGNITUDE of the momentum, but because the photon has passed thorugh both pinholes [no which way] you do not know the DIRECTION of the vector of momentum. [2] Now suppose another example if you put two polarization filters on the pinholes. Photons are not coherent so no interference will occur and the wire detectors will capture 6 % of the photons. But suppose you remove the wire grid - you still have two well resolved pinholes at the image plane. But this image will not be superposition (pure state) but will be mixed state image. You know exactly the pinhole throught which the photon has arrived to the detector, because you can measure his polarization. So you know the DIRECTION of the photon's momentum, but you neither know the photon's energy, nor photon's wavelength <span class="texhtml">λ</span>, so you do not know the MAGNITUDE <b>p</b> of the momentum vector, because <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/f/0/3f0f9431c3089390e4135f34587e56cb.png" alt="p=\frac{h}{\lambda}" /></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Afshar, Unruh et al. believe in Afshar's claim about which way info, and his argument is in conservation of momentum. There is NO SUCH THING in QM. Quantum momentum cannot have precise magntitude of the vector, and precise direction of the vector at the same time - this is forbidden by Heisenberg's principle and complementarity.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 04:09, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>p.s. Dear Aurelien, I still have not published a paper because currently I work on my Ph.D. thesis and I don't have so much time. Also I stopped uploading of e-prints, before peer-reviewing, and I stopped to produce single authored papers. If someone interested in physics wants to collaborate with me on my argument against Afshar I will be glad to collect and present all my draft papers, and posts. I think that once you see the weirdness of quantum momentum, and K = 0 in Afshar's experiment you will have to withdraw you arXiv entry, so you will enter my company of people who have withdrawn pre-print at least once &#160;:-) <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 04:40, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Link to Drezet's Wiki Entry</span></h2>
<p>Drezet your article just shows what I already advocate since 2004.</p>
<p>I put direct links to your math theory</p>
<p>V - visibility of fringes - in Afshar setup is V=1, because in the minima he detects zero light, or almost zero light. This is Reininger negative measurement. Actually the wires are wide enough to detect 6% of the light intensity if you put polarization filters.</p>
<p>K - which way info - is IDENTICAL to D - distingushability in your math formalism. D = 0, so you cannot distiguish from which pinhole the photon comes, so D = 0. There is no which way information. The photon comes in pure state, so the photon is in superposition and both detectors. No which way - so you have pure state density matrix, so you have non-zero off-diagonal elements, so you have photon being holographically at both detectors at once at the image plane. The fact that after that you collapse the superposed photon in basis D1, D2 is irrelevant. The same is in the Fourier plane - there the photon is in superposition at many fringes at once, but you nevertheless collapse it only somewhere in the Fourier plane, you cannot detect the single photon at pieces spread everywhere, can you?</p>
<p>In order to have which way measurement you should produce somehow mixed state of the photon. This can be done by entanglement with polarization filters, where the reduced density matrix of the whole systems that described the photon only will "look-like" mixed one. So you will have which way information, but not interference. You will be able to diffract 6% of the photons by the wires in Afshar's setup. The fact is that in the entangled state, the photon is not really in mixed state, but the interference info is encoded in the entanglement of the whole system [say photon plus polarization filters]. If you decide to delete the polarization of the photon, in case you have not yet collapsed it [not destructive measurement is done yet], so you can restore back the interference, but this cannot happen without deletion of the which way info.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Emperors New Clothes</span></h2>
<p>The emperor is persuded by his advisor that the beautiful interference patterns in his new clothes are indeed perfectly visible. V=1. The emperor, however, would prefer it if such patterns were also visible in fact.</p>
<p>"Can we not introduce downstream re-interfernce of the photons?" asked the Emperor.</p>
<p>"No your highness," said the advisor, "that is quite unnecessary. Look at how these fine threads have been placed. Do you see how they make the patterns come alive."</p>
<p>"Yes. Of course. You are right. That is brilliant."</p>
<p>The conclusion to this story has become the stuff of legend. But there is a sequel to this story. It is not well known that after the Emperor's defeat at the hands of a mocking crowd, the advisor went on to became the New Emperor. And if you remember the little boy in the crowd who exclaimed V=0, well he had no problem with the Old Emperor. He liked the way the clothes were invisible. He thought it wholly unfair that the Emperor should lose the thrown over such a thing. He hatched a plan. When he grew up he would become advisor to the New Emperor.</p>
<p>"Yes, your highness," the little boy would say to the New Emperor, "that pinhole is indeed a beautiful pinhole. And what's more, it can be demonstrated in new clothes made from just one photon"</p>
<p>"Yes. Of course. You are right. That is brilliant"</p>
<p>You can guess the conclusion to this story. What you wouldn't guess was how the New Emperor's humiliation was far worse than the Old Emperors. For in the laughing crowd was the presence of the Old Emperor, resplendant in a gown of glowing interference patterns laughing louder than everyone else.</p>
<p>But to be fair, the New Emperor would have prefered his new clothes were just satin black with a small hole in them rather than the whole thing made from just one photon.</p>

<p>Dear Drezet, Please bear in mind that the observed interference pattern (IP) is a fully visible one (V=1). The IP you have shown has a low visibility (V&lt;1). If you replace it with an IP in which the dark fringes have zero intensity (V=1), the graphics would be correct. Please let me know what you wish to do.

<p>Dear Afshar, yes V=1, but D=0. So without distiguishability you cannot say which way the photon passed. In QM the momentum is complex number (!!!), and exactly because particles may propagate in imaginary direction tunneling is allowed. After collapse of the wavefunction of photon, you measure NOT the quantum vector of momentum that is complex number, but you measure momentum's magnitude only, so it is nothing but measuring the photon's energy and wavelegth. So what conservation of momentum you speak about??? Do you conserve the complex momentum vector??? Please either provide clear answer, or stop disturbing the editing process of your promo-entry, that finally will be turned into manifest of your failure to understand QM. If you do not have access to the following article "Peter Bowcock &amp; Ruth Gregory (1991) Multidimensional tunneling and complex momentum. Phys. Rev. D 44: 1774–1785." I will be glad to send you pdf. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 07:38, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Drezet, the inserted lens in the figure of the main article is not needed. Either you produce Fraunhoffer diffraction without lens in the far-field approximation, or you may use lens with focal length f, and then the double slit must be located in the focal plane at one site, and the far-field Fraunhoffer image will be produced at the other focal plane. In both directions you will have Fourier and inverse Fourier transform of the corresponding images. So your picture is wrong [not equal distance f between the double slit and the Fraunhoffer image], and also introducing a lens IS OF NO PURPOSE in discussing the double slit. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 10:01, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re: <i>Could this article be merged to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complementarity_%28physics%29.html" title="Complementarity (physics)">Complementarity (physics)</a>?</i></p>
<p>As <a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfalstad_5494.html" title="User:Pfalstad">User:Pfalstad</a> points out, this has been proposed, twice, and rejected. However, I suggest removing all details about complementarity from this article. The article should be limited to saying what Afshar's experiment consists of, where it was conducted, what it claims to disprove and facts about how it is viewed in the scientific community (almost all negative).</p>
<p>To say the experiment is on the fringe is hardly a personal attack. However, Danko's apparent suggestion there is fraud involved is completely unwarranted and I may remove those comments from this talk page. It's one thing to say the experiment's conclusions are wrong or some other observation about the experiment itself. Did I misunderstand you Danko? Making such accusations is almost certainly contrary to WP policy.</p>
<p>Afshar, please avoid using charged words such as "crackpot".</p>
<p>Moreover, as has already been pointed out by <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> (and is also policy) the purpose of this and any article talk page is to discuss the content and structure of the article, not the experiment.

It is however, the responsability of the writers of the article to fairly report the general consensus of the scientific community in regard to this experiment, which I believe is overwhelmingly negative.

<p>Since I was accused by Linas that I do not understand physics, I will illustrate how good is Afshar's knowledge in physics - here is one quotation by his preprint that is indeed the final conclusion&#160;: "<i><b>Since the arguments presented in this Letter are valid for all quantum particles, it is plausible that equivalent experiments could be performed involving electrons or neutrons with identical results to this experiment</b></i>." It seems very "expert" opinion unless I point out that photon is boson, while electron is fermion. In the preprint of Afshar is described the high flux photon [boson] experiment, so exactly in the high flux electron [fermion] experiment you will have "almost identical result" up to the difference between "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_particles#Statistical_properties_of_bosons_and_fermions" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_particles#Statistical_properties_of_bosons_and_fermions" rel="nofollow">Bose-Einstein statistics</a>" and "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_particles#Statistical_properties_of_bosons_and_fermions" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_particles#Statistical_properties_of_bosons_and_fermions" rel="nofollow">Fermi-Dirac statistics</a>"&#160;:-)))) I hope you will get this joke, or possibly advice Afshar to read again some very basic principles of quantum particle statistics.

I argue that all supporting information for the experiment must be backed up by reference to peer-reviewed publications. Likewise, all refutation should be backed up by reference to peer-reviewed publications. Basically, any support or refutation that is not backed up by such material must be considered scientifically questionable — if the argument is sound, why does not appear in some scientific journal? However, any argument that is clearly verifiable by such reasonable sources should be admitted.

<dd>A fact is that unless Afshar's paper is officially published, no serious scientist will lose his time in preparing a paper strong enough to pass peer-reviewing process. To post a brief explanation of error, is not the same as performing computer simulation of the whole setup Afshar. Also no serious journal will accept critique of results published in the yellow press. Conference Proceedings are not counted as peer-reviewed publication, because what you have to do is to pay the tax of about 300-500$ and your paper has good chance to be published in the Proceedings book.

<dd>Dear Garzo, (1) I do not see you asking Danko to take back his Fraud accusations. Why? Isn't that as important as the policy against legal actions? (2) The references in my papers are all from peer-reviewed publications, and well-established. (3) Danko Georgiev's position is "not even wrong," that is, it is beyond redemption! In "defense" of Complementarity, he violates so many laws of physics that I cannot even begin to number them here. He did put together a hodge-podge paper of copied and pasted material from internet sources that have been aptly rejected from archives, and cannot possibly be cited in WP. His involvement in the talk page is akin to allowing someone off the street to take part in Brain surgery! This is not an educational arena and neither I, nor other experts have the time to teach Danko, or point out every error in his statements. His arguments are certainly in the category of "Original Research" and cannot be allowed to be aired here. He is more than welcome to put up his arguments on his own <a href="http://freewebhosting.hostdepartment.com/d/dankomed/" class="external text" title="http://freewebhosting.hostdepartment.com/d/dankomed/" rel="nofollow">web-page</a>.-- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 15:16, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I request that our discussion be limited to the validity of our sources. Therefore, Danko, if you wish to suggest that this experiment or its results were falsified, you have to quote a source that says it — saying it yourself does not carry weight and has been construed as a <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attack_d9d5.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attack">personal attack</a>. Likewise, Danko's personal qualifications are not the subject here — we interpret the sources, not the ability of individuals to interpret them (I myself confess to a hazy memory of long-forgotten particle-physics lectures). As this is Afshar's experiment it seems reasonable to link to his paper on it (just as a biographical article might link to the subject's personal homepage). The link to AIP proceedings seems fair also (if this is what Afshar was willing to present to a room of colleagues). Links to popular science articles are fine too, as not every reader will be familiar enough with the subject area to follow the other articles. However, we should be careful only to include those that are not too fanciful, but link to those that present the experiment in a more straightforwrd way. The link to the <i>Science Friday</i> archive is labelled as being <i>New Scientist</i>. Is this a mistake, or did the image that appears in Science Friday also appear in New Scientist? Can someone verify this? Overall, the article seems to represent a fair number of concerns about the Afshar experiment, which include links to papers by notable physicists (I found most of these also referenced in an arXiv.org search). — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 16:01, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK. I imagine that the image must have been in <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18324575.300.html" class="external text" title="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18324575.300.html" rel="nofollow">this feature</a>. Unfortunately, NS is only readable online with subscription, which prevents it being used as an external link in the Wikipedia article. Perhaps the link to that graphic can be a bit more explicit. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 16:29, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I would like to mention that even if the result of Afshar stirred controversy after its presentation in New scientist it is not the first time that a scientist attacks the position of Bohr . If we should condamn the enthousiasm of Afsahr in defending his interpretation we will condamn all scientists in the same way. Moreover, it is clear that there are several interpretations of the results obtained by S. Afshar but I think that the list of publication and preprint at the end of the Afshar page gives a neutral and equal chance to different scientific interpretations. I dont really understand what Georgiev consider this experiment as a falsification: this is an original experiment very simple to realize and which can illustrate either violation (for Afshar) or application (for me and others) of Bohr's complementarity. To conclude 1) the experiment exists and Afshar invented it, 2) Interpretation is not falsification. Thus I do not see the point of disagreement??? <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrezet_d217.html" title="User:Drezet">Drezet</a> 16:50, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Drezet and others. We all have various opinions on what conclusions can be drawn - that differ in various ways - but none of us (including Danko) disagree with the data produced by the experiment. The only case for fraud would be if such results were manufactured by means other than through the specified experiment (ie. faking of the data). But nobody here, including Danko, has any argumanet at all with the data. The debate is in the domain of interpretation (and/or the mathematics) and about the sometimes overly colourful words exchanged&#160;:) (Carl)</p>
