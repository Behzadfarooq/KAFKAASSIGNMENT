<h2><span class="mw-headline">Critiques is OR</span></h2>
<p>Well, I'm giving up on this article, and can't waste any more time on it. The Critiques section is entirely OR as all of those papers predate my paper and have not addressed my experiment at all. Anyone not familiar with the facts of the case would be misled to think that the authors of the cited papers in the reference have indeed written those papers in response to my work. Michael, if you think this is the way to conduct science in Wikipedia, then I will have nothing to do with this sad joke. Goodbye. P.S. Thanks Linas and Looper for the effort. Dndn1011, sadly you are being unwittingly supportive of Michael's OR here, and hence lose credibility in the long run. Just a little heads up...-- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 20:25, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was not aware of this. I assumed that the quoted critiques were responses. If they are not responses then they do not belong in the article. It is a shame you are giving up, however, when progress is clearly being made. The article is after all much less biased now, I feel. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 23:15, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is also a shame that after much effort and work on my part to try and assist the creation of a more balanced article, Afshar should just dismiss me without thanks, and indeed incorrectly state my position. I actually agree that the Critiques section has been primarily OR and have been lobbying to have this changed. In fact I have strongly argued that there was bias and OR and actually made changes to the article on this basis. But we are trying to reach a concensus here and that can not be done without flexibility and appreciation of other views. But in the end, my motivations are merely for fairness and clarity, not for recognition or friendship or to advance my career or whatever else. Thus thanks are not necessary. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 12:17, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Claiming that "all of those papers predate my paper" are by definition OR is wrong.

<dd>Your emotions have completely clouded your judgment my man. Your analogy is as flawed as all other logical inference you have made so far. The assumption in the above analogy gives the following equivalence: my experiment = perpetual machine. Well, in contrast to the perpetual machine, my experiment has been verified to work by Harvard faculty and other experts...

<dd>Let's start from the top. Do you accept that "The Schrodinger wave equation is generally seen [by physicists] as in accordance with Bohr's philosophical views on the Complementarity Principle."? In other words would a physicist accept this as true? Yes or no? Note that this is a different question from "Is the Schrodinger wave equation in accordance with Bohr's philosophical views on the Complementarity Principle."?

<p>Lets get this right before it goes in the main article. CL</p>
<p>First of all, does Complementarity "enshrine" a "classical-quantum" divide. Would it not be more correct to say a "wave/particle" divide. And before anyone puts it back in the main article lets cover all the points. This is but the first. CL</p>
<p>Now it depends on what Michael is trying to say. If complementarity is the object then the "wave/particle divide" correction seems right. But if the object of the sentence is "classical-quantum divide" then we need to remove the reference to complementarity. The two versions are:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Original research in critiques section</span></h2>
<p>I can't tell who is editing what in which way any more. Somehow, the critiques section was just now exactly backwards. I restored the list of major critics and thier criticisms, and removed the home-grown wiffle-waffle mis-interpretations of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Just to be clear: the major critics are experts in quantum mechanics, and have the credentials and track record to write about such things. A list of who they are, and a pointer to thier critiques is appropriate. A one-or-two sentance summary of each author's points would also be appropriate.</p>
<p>What is not appropriate are the attempts to distill all of quantum mechanics into a few paragraphs of "general criticisms". All of the attempts to do this so far have been severely flawed. I am now convinced that it is not possible to summarize in this way, at this time. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 01:25, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it better to have a brief overview with references so the reader can do their own further research. I do not believe it is good form to have in the main body of the article a list of people who disagree with Afshar. It is fine to state the general issues and then have references to these people in the footnotes, as long as there are not too many. Too many and a sense of bias will be created. The OR issue is that if the article appears to contain significant work in collating together the opinions of others, it will become indistinguishable from a research paper. I know it is a fine point, because in a sense any work on a article requires collation of information. I guess it is a case of the motivation and extent. Listing the major issues and giving references for these is one thing (and quite acceptable), however collating together many sources with the intention of disproving a point of view is clearly OR. The article had been leaning very heavily towards the latter, but now is much improved, although I prefered the critiques section when it did not list dissenters by name. If the remaining critiques have been found not watertight, then they should be removed. The article should contain that which is undeniable and mention areas that have yet to be resolved. Actually weighing those issues in the balance is not what the article is for, as this is an encyclopaedic entry not a research paper. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 09:21, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Complementarity is often viewed as being enforced by the uncertainty principle. In this view since the uncertainty principle is obeyed in Afshar's experiment the complementarity principle can't be violated by it." - Michael Price</p>
<p>It is said here that complementarity is often viewed as being enforced by the uncertainty principle. Yet the reference is about something altogether different</p>
<p>And I quote:</p>
<p>"Demonstrates that complementarity is enforced, and quantum interference effects destroyed, by decoherence (irreversible object-apparatus correlations induced by the detector), not by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle itself."</p>
<p>ie. the reference is about the uncertainty principle <i>not</i> enforcing complementarity.</p>
<p>But if the uncertainty principle does not enforce complementarity then how does it follow, that in Afshar's experiment (or any other experiment), it would decide to change it's mind and enforce complementarity?</p>
<p>I mean I'm open to suggestions.</p>

<dd>'Complementarity is often viewed as being enforced... etc'&#160;: I have never liked this statement. It is weak. The references pre-date the experiment. This appears to be Mr. Prices opinion with non-supporting references. also the footnote says "Demonstrates that complementarity is enforced, and quantum interference effects destroyed, by decoherence (irreversible object-apparatus correlations induced by the detector), not by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle itself.". This is at odds with the assertion "Complementarity is often viewed as being enforced by the uncertainty principle".

<dd>I would like to know how obeying the uncertainty principle means that complementarity can not be violated. Is not in principle possible to have something act as both a wave and a particle at the same time and yet also be adhering to the uncertainty princple? More pertinently, do the current theories being put forward as objections against Afshar's view actually explain the experiment's findings? If not, then all bets are off... any supporting theories of a counter argument could have a flaw in some way. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 15:03, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As pure wave and pure particle, <i>at the same time</i>? No that is not possible. The trade off is expressed in the uncertainty relation. To answer your 2nd point, see the explanations offered by the critics that appears in the reference section of the article. They are saying that there is nothing to explain. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>Just as a side point... how does refraction work? How can a particle be refracted when refractive effects require the observed slowing down of light in a denser medium? As a wave this is easy to explain. But what happens to the particle? As it crosses the boundary does half of the photon travel at a different speed than the other? That seems unrealstic. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 17:02, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is a side point, but interesting: the different expected behaviours for particles and waves was the main reason for the adoption of Young's wave model of light over Newton's particle or corpuscular view. It took Einstein and the quantum revolution to marry the two together. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<li>Dear Michael, you are wrong about the HUP and W-P duality. <b>This is a major misconception</b> suffered by a lot of non-specialist in the field. HUP has nothing to say about wave or particle aspects of a quantum system. It simply establishes the relationship between non-commuting observables such as position and momentum, or energy and time. For instance would you say that position is a purely particle property and momentum a purely wave property? Such assertions are absolutely false, and no expert uses it as such. On the other hand Complementarity covers what can be called purely particle aspect (which-way information, K) and purely wave aspect (the interference visibility, V). These two properties do not have a similar relationship as say momentum and position in HUP. That is why Complementarity was proposed by Bohr, otherwise he would have just used HUP. He made it perfectly clear that his Complementarity Principle was more fundamental and more importantly a distinct physical principle than HP. This is an extremely crucial fact, without which all following assertions are just as flawed. Please let me know if you have any questions in this regard.-- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 16:38, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

This appears to be tying HUP with Complementarity. I would be grateful if you could clarify whether the article is incorrect, so that it can be edited. I believe the "universally accept" part is correct, but not that this is accepted on the basis of Bohr's principle of complementarity, but in fact on the basis of HUP. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 17:30, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dndn1011, the relationship between position and momentum are governed by the HUP inequality, whereas V and K of Complementarity in which-way experiments have a different relationship: V^2+K^2&lt;=1. Although often the term "complementary" observables are attributed to momentum-position and V-K, they mean different things.

<dd>No, there is a single principle of complementarity, which is manifested in different ways in different experiments. The V-K relationship only applies to "welcher-weg" (Which-way) experiments. My experiment only addresses PC in which-way experiments. P.S. I just saw your edit to critiques: "Complementarity is often still viewed as being enforced by the uncertainty principle[8]." That is actually <b>incorrect</b>. It is now understood that Complementarity is NOT always enforeced by HUP thus a different physical concept. The very Ref. to Scully et al. paper suggested and experiemtn to test this fact, and it was carried out by Rempe et al, which positively proved it.-- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 17:55, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A HUP=&gt;C critique of the experiment was implied by the passage in question. But no such critique was forthcoming. The passage did not go anywhere. If the purpose of the passage was to reference a critique of HUP=&gt;C it did a decidedly awkward job at that. And as discussed, if that was the intention of the passage, then it did not constitute a criticism of the experiment - ergo it just deleted itself. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 00:49, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Bohr argument</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>Niels Bohr stated that "an adequate tool for a complementary way of description is offered precisely by the quantum-mechanical formalism" [4] In this view, since the formalism (e.g. the Schrödinger equation) is obeyed by the photons in Afshar's experiment, Bohr's complementarity principle can't be violated by the experiment.[5][6][7] - Michael Price</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is sort of like like saying:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since complementarity is correct, Afshar's experiment can't violate it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Or:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since Afshar's experiment demonstrates that complementarity can be violated, Bohr can't be correct.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Don't you think? But the references are good. Just not sure if you've characterised them with very well. Perhaps it is better to let the critiques speak for themselves.</p>

<dd>You forgot to logon? (You can set your account to "remember" your login between sessions. Saves effort.) Bohr seems to be saying that the formalism (i.e. solutions to QM equations) will always yield a higher-level complementary description (=interpretation?), i.e. that the formalism can never produce a solution that doesn't permit a higher-level complementary description. Presumably this is restricted to formalisms that were known in 1949, but that would include the Schrodinger equation, which is adequate for our purposes.

<dd>Yes, I noticed the logon error. Re. the passage. I can't read it very well. The quote, for example, is unsourced, so I can't track down the context to explore what it might otherwise mean. And the second sentence ("in this view...") relys on the first sentence. And the references for the second sentence (the critques), which I assume support the first sentence, I read rather differently - if only by virtue of the fact that I can't actually read the first sentence. I'll address your elaboration soon. I'm in the middle of other concerns.

<dd>Replace "&lt;something needs to go here&gt;" with "and, since Bohr regarded complementary as a consequence of the formalism (which the experiment conforms to), then...".

<dd>No, because it's not clear if Motl et al, support that reasoning. Or Bohr for that matter. The Principle of Complementarity is positioned by Bohr as something more fundamental than the formalism. The formalism is an "adequate tool". That is, the formalism is compatible with the principle. The principle is not a consequence of the formalism. Or at least that is the way Bohr frames it. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 10:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You seem to be bulding a lot on the word "adequate" and ignoring the word "precisely". Suppose that he had said "inadequate" instead, then you would be correct; but he didn't, he said the reverse. Sorry, I the way it read it is that Bohr intended the principle to be a consequence of the formalism. And that is how every physicist I know understands it, and how Motl et al understand it. That's why they are taught together in text books and at universities. This is a mainstream view, whether you or Afshar agree with it is another matter. (This is despite the debate over whether complementarity is enforced by the HUP or decoherence, because the latter two are both aspects of the formalism.)--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>This is not a game of logic. The words "adequate tool" are in index to the reference you have provided. The history behind the principle of complementarity is discussed there. If you are not interested in that history then why reference it. If it's just the formalism you are interested in - the tool - why do you even bother trying to reference such material. Why don't you quote from your text book instead. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 12:13, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is all about logic. Whether you call that a "game" is your business. If I'd quoted from a text book no doubt Afshar and others would protest that that's not what "Bohr meant"; so I have quoted Bohr instead. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<p>I've put together some quotes from each critique that might help to formulate a breif of such although these are just ones that interest me:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The presence of the interference pattern in Afshar’s experiment is only inferred, but according to the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics it has to be measured in order to be described by the quantum mechanical operator formalism. This requirement is well captured by Wheeler’s famous dictum to the effect “that only a registered event is a real event” [23]." - Ole Steuernage</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The more you can infer about "which way" the less you know about the interference." - Bill Unruh</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"I can't guarantee that everything Bohr has ever said about complementarity was true; it's just my understanding of the complementarity principle that has not been violated by this experiment, and Shahriar may have found a statement due to Bohr in the libraries or archives that was proven incorrect by this experiment. (Thanks to Bert Halperin for discussions about this point.)" - Luboš Motl</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Motl and Steuernage critiques exhibit a similar argument. The complementary (mutually exclusive) observables are only those observables that have been emperically measured (as distinct from inferred). And this is their understanding of the principle of complementarity - otherwise referred to as "Bohr's". Since this is not violated, the principle of complementarity is not violated by the experiment.</p>
<p>But Unrah's language differs somewhat. In Unrah's language the principle of complementarity would appear to equally apply to inferred 'observables' - the otherwise invisible waves (or interference) on the one hand, or "which way" on the other.</p>
<p>And if we were to include Georgiev's contribution we might have yet another argument.</p>
<p>I'm eager to read Danko's argument, Michael, so if you'll excuse me from this interlude, I'm going to put my critical goggles on and have a good read of that. In the meantime, let me know what you think of what I've said. And consider the linas argument as well - that perhaps it is unwise to burden a few sentences with so much responsibility.</p>
<p><br />
Some questions to help (in reading the critiques)</p>
<p>Is our modern definition of complementarity based strictly on observables?</p>
<p>Did Bohr really require complementarity be defined strictly in terms of observables (to the exclusion of inferences) in which case what does Unrah (or Bohr) mean by infering "which way"?</p>
<p>What is it about Afshar's experiment that requires complementarity be defined emperically? But not necessarily, it would seem, in Unrah's case.</p>
<p>What is the difference between an experiment designed to demonstrate complementarity and one designed to violate it? Does it require changes to the epistomological conditions/conclusions you can make? And why?</p>
<ul>
<li>In Danko's argument the axiomatic definition of V is not the same thing as an emperical 'definition' of V as it might have otherwise been thought. Which is almost a relief. The terms "a priori" and "a posterio", acquire new significance. The formalism allows one to express the principle of complimentarity such that Bohr's interpretational crutch "there is no quantum world", is not just unnecessary but possibly incorrect. The principle imposes a limit on the inferential meaning of the observable. The observables become "entangled" so to speak. One can not math consistently say A and B. One must say A or B. ie. in spite of the observables, not because of such. And the argument for mathematical consistency is an extremely powerful one. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 19:49, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
