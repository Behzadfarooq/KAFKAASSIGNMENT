<p>Yes, the article is a mess and this debate is a mess too. Someone needs to step in. I have done so. I have attempted a clean up and clarifcation of the aritcle up to the ongoing debate section. Please, discuss changes here. The aim is to make a good wikipedia article. Leaving asside details and minor corrections (feel free of course to make minor changes, corrections , etc) I feel that we should sign off on the article up to the ongoing debate section. When we have concensus there, we can get to the difficut bit&#160;:)<a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 14:54, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you want really to change something here first correct the introduction&#160;: complementarity has nothing to do with the impossibility for observing wave and particle behavior at the same time as written&#160;: in reality any interference shows both at the same time. Second you must change all the part concerning the debate which is i think useless confusing and senseless (a list of reference is more than enough and we dont need quotation of texts: we are not speaking about the bible here ). we must cool down danko (at 4 kelvin) in order to stop his coming back every half day or less (it will be better if he would decide him self not to act against progress ). May be the other protagonists could follow this advice too: this page looks often like a forum about politics every one is speaking but nobody listen... what for . The research of afshar are published this is a fact all the other works (mine included) are in this context only proposals and should not become the center of the present discussion. Let only describe the experiment and its aim on the wikipedia page this is the only fact ... <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrezet_d217.html" title="User:Drezet">Drezet</a> 15:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>By the way&#160;: the strange claim that which path information is not available even without grid result from a confusion. From the point of view of linear optics if we suppose the two sources coherent (as it is here whatever said DG) we have always the right to consider the (pure) case with two holes as a sum of two (pure) cases with a single hole. However this is only valid for the field of the wave not for the intensity or a hypothetical photon trajectory which is not defined in QM. So indeed when two beams A or B are crossing it is a non sens to claim that the photon detected after the intersection is coming from A or B. This kind of question is a non question we can not answer it in QM. I found also a bit confusing when somebody try do justify this fact by using the formalism of linear quantum optics and doing some obviously wrong manipulation of symbols. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrezet_d217.html" title="User:Drezet">Drezet</a></p>
<p>First of all, publishing in a peer-reviewed journal should not be taken as a certificate of correctness of a work, although it does impart a degree of respectability to the work. Foundations of Physics has published papers in the past which have clearly wrong conclusions - examples are:<br />
"Experimental realization of Popper's experiment: violation of the uncertainty principle?", Y.-H. Kim and Y. Shih, Found. Phys. 29, 1849--1861 (1999).<br />
"Is the quantum mechanical description of physical reality compl ete? Proposed resolution of the EPR puzzle", C. S. Unnikrishnan, Found. Phys. Lett. 15, 1-25 (2002).<br />
These two specific references are ONLY cited here to caution against giving any certificate of correctness to a published work, and to keep an open mind. This is not to cast any doubt on the work under discussion. To do that, we need valid scientific arguments.<br />
Secondly, I do not understand Drezet's argument. If he is saying that " when two beams A or B are crossing it is a non sens to claim that the photon detected after the intersection is coming from A or B", then he agrees with my point of view that there is no which-way information to start with, and hence no paradox.<br />
I have gone through Afshar's Foundations of Physics paper. The only argument mentioned for saying that there is which-way information, is that of momentum conservation, which is clearly not valid when both the slits are open. On the other hand, the back-of-the-envelop calculation done by me on this page indicates that there cannot be a which-way information. So, there is no paradox and there is no violation of complementarity. The calculation may be small enough to fit on the back of an envelope, but it is fully rigorous. It tells clearly where the catch is in Afshar's experiment.<br />

<p>Ok i will try to summarize&#160;: I agree on the conclusion that there is no which path but not on your reasoning. There is no which path because path is a dangerous word in QM . A path is a classical definition. However QM precludes the complete observation of a path existing independently of any experiment. In classical physics this is possible but not here because you have always an unavoidable and finite interaction between your detector and your photon. This is a problem because you can not test rigourously your definition of a path . I will give you an example: if you a have the two beam previously defined then a possible definition of a path could be the flow lines of the Poynting vector. This was the choice of De broglie for example. This definition looks nice because you can explain every single particle experiments with it. However this choice gives some problems because it can be proved that for symmetry reasons such path are not crossing in the intersection region ( read the last article of Hiley in foundation of physics of December ). Ok so now you will say&#160;: well I have a way to test if this is true or not ... I must jut watch the path. Watch the path&#160;? how would you watch this path? If you close one hole the case is completely different and if you use entanglement with a detector ( the so called non destructive which path detector) then the correlation modify non locally the trajectories so that now indeed the path are following the normal intuitive way in straight line. Clearly nature here seems to resist. This is just an example of path definition but all other cases are problematic too. What is observed in afshar experiment in only a click in a particular detector the concept of path is unfortunately very problematic and ambiguous here .</p>
<p>This was for the philosophical back ground not lets consider your maths: In your reasoning you consider a superposition of wave in the interference plane and you wrote: <span class="texhtml">ψ(<i>x</i>) = <i>a</i>exp(<i>i</i><i>k</i><i>x</i>) + <i>b</i>exp( − <i>i</i><i>k</i><i>x</i>) = (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>)cos(<i>k</i><i>x</i>) + <i>i</i>(<i>a</i> − <i>b</i>)sin(<i>k</i><i>x</i>)</span> This is only true in one plane (I call it z=0). In fact you must in general write <span class="texhtml">ψ(<i>x</i>) = <i>a</i> * <i>f</i><sub>1</sub> * exp(<i>i</i><i>k</i><i>x</i>) + <i>b</i> * <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> * exp( − <i>i</i><i>k</i><i>x</i>) = (<i>a</i> * <i>f</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>b</i> * <i>f</i><sub>)</sub>cos(<i>k</i><i>x</i>) + <i>i</i>(<i>a</i> * <i>f</i>1 − <i>b</i> * <i>f</i><sub>2</sub>)sin(<i>k</i><i>x</i>)</span> where f1(x,z) and f2(x,z) are two envelops such that f1(x,0)=f2(x,0). Now if you suppose that for z going to + an - infinity f1 and f2 are disjoint (i.e, like before and after the lens of Afshar) you can see easily that the field in such separated regions depends only on a or b separately. For example in the region where f1 is different of zero ( but f2 =0) you have <span class="texhtml">ψ(<i>x</i>) = <i>a</i> * <i>f</i><sub>1</sub>cos(<i>k</i><i>x</i>) + <i>i</i>(<i>a</i> * <i>f</i>1)sin(<i>k</i><i>x</i>) = <i>a</i> * <i>f</i><sub>1</sub> * exp(<i>i</i><i>k</i><i>x</i>)</span> as obviously expected.... your manipulation is just a trick but experiment will not agree with you</p>
<p>There is another problem: it is wrong to tell that the effect of the wires-grid is to remove the sinus part. The sinus contributes on all the plane z=0 and not only at the wires locations. In fact if a=b the sin is not present in such plane z=0 and there is no interaction so that all my reasoning is still OK.... (on that point i think I agree completely with Afshar) Is it enough for you? <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrezet_d217.html" title="User:Drezet">Drezet</a> 18:44, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dear Everybosy,(i) the expierment "claims to have violated the" PC. It is important to point out exactly what is claimed in the Found. Phys. paper and correctly reflect it in the introduction, and then go on to discuss the controversy or the consensus in the community. (ii) The experimental results indeed VIOLATE the Greenberger-Yasin inequality (See section 5 of the Found. Phys. paper.) Again the claim is that there is a violation, and the experiment is not supportive of the inequality. (iii) Please kindly repost the warning tags on the page header. This article is so terribly messed up that even I cannot follow it. It may be better to revert back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Afshar_experiment&amp;oldid=103325029" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Afshar_experiment&amp;oldid=103325029" rel="nofollow">earlier</a> version, which has a proper intro, and warning tags. Tabish, please wait till you hear from the referees of the Journal to which you have submitted your paper as to the value of your ideas. Furthermore, discussing your OR here is against the Wiki policy. BTW/ Found. Phys. is a highly respected journal, and it would serve your aspirations better not to bash a journal with Nobel Laureate editors and authors.

<p>Drezet, thanks a lot indeed for bothering to give a focussed and detailed reply. From the geometry of the experiment you have in mind, I believe all the action is happening in the z=0 place, in the sense that the detectors are also in the z=0 plane. In that case, one would look at <span class="texhtml">ψ(<i>x</i>,0)</span>, which should be <span class="texhtml">ψ(<i>x</i>,0) = (<i>a</i> * <i>f</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>x</i>,0) + <i>b</i> * <i>f</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>x</i>,0))cos(<i>k</i><i>x</i>) + <i>i</i>(<i>a</i> * <i>f</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>x</i>,0) − <i>b</i> * <i>f</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>x</i>,0))sin(<i>k</i><i>x</i>)</span> Since <span class="texhtml"><i>f</i>1(<i>x</i>,0) = <i>f</i>2(<i>x</i>,0)</span>, you get equal contribution to the detectors from a and b parts. Infact, if the wires are put along the z-axis, f1(x,z) probably has to be equal to f2(x,z) for the whole envelop, to get the dark fringes. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabish_q_9513.html" title="User:Tabish q">Tabish q</a> 20:25, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>All rigth but in z=0 there is fringes and noway to distinguish the contributions from a or b . However it does not mean that this is true every where since in z= +infinity it is possible to measure contribution depending only on a or b. This demonstrates that in the afshar set up the so called which way information ( I prefer to speak about measure of D)and the measure of interference fringes ( measure of V ) depend on z and that when one can measure V a and b become mixed ( which is logical we speak about fringes). The two kinds of measurement exclude each other and Bohr can sleep in peace (like i will do my self now) . Do you agree? If there is no point of desagreement may be i did not really understand your point.<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrezet_d217.html" title="User:Drezet">Drezet</a> 21:03, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Drezet, seems like we are agreeing. However, I would like to add that if one is claiming true violation of complementarity by detecting particle anywhere on z-axis, he/she has to show existence of fringes everywhere on the z-axis too.<br />
<b>To Afshar:</b> Afshar, I think there is no harm in having a healthy physics discussion here. If I am convinced here itself that my thesis is mistaken, I will withdraw the paper myself, without waiting for referee's comments. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabish_q_9513.html" title="User:Tabish q">Tabish q</a> 04:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dear Tabish, I'd prefer the proper channels of peer-review. I cannot spend time here refuting every time OR claims are made. To do justice to your submission, one needs the graphics, equations and correct process of edited communication, for which peer-review system has been devised. This talk page is about the article's accuracy and ensuring OR is removed from it. It is not a bulletin board, weblog, or a forum, and I will not participate in lengthy technical discussion here with anyone. The past experiences with others have always led to more confusion and unfortunately in some cases to unjustified animosity. I'm tired of this farce called Wikipedia.

<dd>You are being unfair. Wikiepedia is not a farce, it is educating people in a most wonderful way, not only to facts but to the process of establishing them. It can be very frustrating, but ultimately the purpose for a science article such as this is to help people like me, who are not scientists, understand where science is at right now. This article could be very clear and simple. Detailed debate as you say belongs elsewhere. Some people here are doing their best to battle with human nature and get the focus back where it belongs. In the process of doing this many lessons are being learned by manny people including myself. It is a shame if you do not realise the value of this and do not wish to participate, however you participation, although valued and helpful in communicating your own experiment, is not necessary. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 11:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes I would, and I feel your pain. I think there have been some very unwise postings here, and I think you have suffered a lot of abuse for basically just "doing you job". It is an unfortunate aspect of human nature. At least here it is all out in the open and recorded down. I am making a new attempt to get the article on track because it appears that the various arguments have settled down... it seems many people are beginning to realise that this experiment is not so easy to dismiss. We have witnessed the article become more and more inconsistent and messy and we have watched the various attempts to wriggle out of its conclusions and as a neutral party my conclusion is that the article should simply present the facts, the conlusions of the creator of the experiment (i.e. you) and the most clear and important counter arguments that stand up to scrutiny, that are actually countering any claims you make. There is no room for bias, to weasle words, or OR. Once the article has been published in a peer reviewed journal, the quality and notability of counter arguments will need to be improved to match. Right now there are a lot of statements in the article which I consider OR applications of notable viewpoints or simply there because of initial "shoot from the hip" reactions to earlier publications. A great example of this is Bill Unruh's experiment which I consider to be completely irrelevant to this article because it is very clearly not the same experiment at all. I knew this right at the start and wanted to remove it (perhaps I even did at one point) however certain people here kept insisting that it should stay and I have been trying to avoid an rv war. I have been pragmatic, in short, putting my own opinions to one side a little out of respect to others. It is a question of attempting to be a neutral editor. It's hard. But it is a great exercise in self discipline. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 13:30, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK Good, thanks for not just reverting my changes. Now we need a systematic approach to fix this article. I ask that we keep one heading per point to address. Please, lets avoid long winded interwoven discussions, we will get nowhere. If you see something you don't like about the article, please create a section with a heading specifying the issue. One section per issue. In each section we can discuss and attempt to reach concensus. In the absence of concensus I will attempt to reflect the majority view, but only as a means to achieving (hopefully) concensus. I think it is clear that this topic is not clear cut and that there are many viewpoints. Let's respect them all and attempt to create a concise article that usefully reflects current thinking.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The validity of the concept of a path of a photon in Quantum Mechanics</span></h2>
<p>This question has been troubling me for sometime and I thank Drezet for affirming my concerns (such affirmations have been a long time coming here). So I believe that this is an important point to mention in the article. Which way information is the same thing as path information. If path information is a concept without validty to a photon, this would seem to render the whole of the debate concerning complementarity moot. Is this not one possible valid interpretation of the experiment? <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 23:16, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As was perviously pointed out by myself and Prof. Unruh, the which-way information (WWI) in welcher-weg experiments is not "Which-path" information. It is rather "which-slit" or "which-pinhole" information. Everybody agrees that assigning a path or trajectory for a photon is not in accord with QM. So, when we say we know which hole the photon passes through, we do not mean we assume a precise trajectory for the photon to have chosen, rather we can "trace" it back to the hole it must have passed through in order to satisfy the conservation laws. The <b>one-to-one relationship between the holes and the corresponding images is the key component of the WWI</b>.

<dd>Dear Afshar, as I have supported you many times when you made correct statements, I will support you now too: YES, <b>one-to-one relationship between the holes and the corresponding images is the key component of the WWI</b>. I will not support however that WWI is there at first place even without the grid.

<dd>Thank you genetlemen. Now remember I approach you as a reader of the article. I will have as such a reader a very strong urge to ask the following questions. Answers to these will be helpful to creating an article that makes sense.
<ul>
<li>If we can say which pinhole, is this not still making an inference about an aspect of the path of the photon that cannot be proven because we can not watch the photon pass through the hole, or measure it as such?</li>
<li>I don't understand how it can be said that the path of a photon makes no sesne in QM, yet we can still say with certainty that the photon went a certain way. These seem logically exclusive. Paradoxical. Is this the core of the paradox that is demonstrated by the experiement?</li>
<li>If Danko's view is correct, is this not the same thing as saying that photons never have WWI or Paths under any cirumstances? How can an arrangement of an experiement change the fundemental nature of light?</li>

(ii) The experimental results indeed VIOLATE the Greenberger-Yasin inequality (See section 5 of the Found. Phys. paper.) Again the claim is that there is a violation, and the experiment is not supportive of the inequality. (iii) Please kindly repost the warning tags on the page header. This article is so terribly messed up that even I cannot follow it. It may be better to revert back to earlier version, which has a proper intro, and warning tags. Tabish, please wait till you hear from the referees of the Journal to which you have submitted your paper as to the value of your ideas. Furthermore, discussing your OR here is against the Wiki policy. BTW/ Found.

<p><b>Reply</b>: I don't think this is a good idea. Afshar is free to chime in here as he pleases, but asking him for advice on how to write this article sets a very bad precedent for WP. As a matter of fact, I don't think that very much needs to said about this experiment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Afshar claims (asserts, says) that it challenges the principle of complementarity. Exactly how, we can glean from what Afshar has written in his SPIE paper.</li>
<li>Describe the experiment as is currently done in the article.</li>
<li>Note (in the intro, certainly, perhaps elsewhere) that there has been considerable controversy, with links to <i>published</i> papers or letters. In some <i>exceptional</i> cases, we can link to blogs (I'm thinking of Motl and Unruh.) Since Afshar is the person in question here, it is also acceptable in my view to have a link to his blog.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would note that the opening sentence currently is highly misleading. I think it should be made clear that the claim is controversial (although my impression is that Afshar is currently much more circumspect about what the experiment actually proves) --<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 16:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are out of order, I am not asking for advice on writing the article but for clarification. I am also trying to set a process for resolving the problems with the article, I have specifically asked for issues to be raised seperately in their own sections and not all mixed together. I think it is quite clear from the opening sentence that this is controversial, as it states there is no concensus in physics on the subject. How the word controversial helps create a balanced fair article in teh face of all teh hostility flying around is not clear to me. I think we should use as neutral wording as possible. This is fair enough in my opinion.

This is the purpose of asking Afhsar for clarification, becuase he claims the article is currently misleading. We will see what he has to say and make changes as needed. You speak of rules of civility, and yet you have immediately turned on a attempt to be civil to Afshar by allowing him a voice in editing the article.

<p>As an editor of this article, I have considerable problem with Unruh's experiment being included as I see his experiment as being very different to the Afshar experiment. The main problem with Unruh's experiment is that which way information is hidden behind half silvered mirrors, whereas in Afhsar's experiement the debate on the validty of Afhsar's argument seems to hinge upon the use of a lens which apparently shows whichway information directly. I see no reason for Unruh's experiment to be included in this article.

<dd>I can go with this as long as it is included as a simple reference without going into detail. If we quote parts of the objections in the article, then we should also quote Afhsar's rebuttles to keep the article balanced. Thus I accept your point that it should remain at this time. However I will make a new suggestion regarding the Specific Cirtiques section. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 22:09, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Incidentally, I just reviewed Unruh's blog entry again (<a href="http://axion.physics.ubc.ca/rebel.html" class="external free" title="http://axion.physics.ubc.ca/rebel.html" rel="nofollow">http://axion.physics.ubc.ca/rebel.html</a>) and he states the following:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, the lens which focuses the light from the pinholes onto the detectors acts just like the final third mirror in my experment, in separating out the light once again (undoing the interference pattern).</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>The problem here is that Afshar's experiment could be argued to behave like Unruh's, except for the fact that the lens provides a 1-1 mapping of hole to target according to the normal understanding of optics. This is a crucial difference, and Unruh has not clarified this. What Unruh is effectively saying is that there is no 1-1 mapping of hole to target via the lens because before photons hit the lens they are in a state of interference and do not contain which-way information. Presumably the lens must in some way manufacture an appearance of which way information. There are interesting consequences to this, and I would be interested to know if Unruh or anyone else has attempted to address them. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 00:49, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you miss the entire point of Unruh's critique. His experimental setups are to demonstrate that how we interpret complementarity is a function of the *entire* experimental apparatus, <i>even parts and paths which the photons do not explore</i>. Thus the introduction of wires into Afshar's experiment (even for the photons that are not absorbed) alters how we should interpret complementarity, compared to the no-wires setup. You can't just look at how complementarity operates in the no-wires setup and just apply this to the wired setup.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>Yes, I understand that is what is claimed. The problem is we are still left in this case with a big question of how it can be that a photon might appear to come from a hole when it actually did not come from that hole. If you hide behind complementarity you are left with that unanswered question. Once again my question is not being answered, but merely being covered up, so that I am expected to ignore this minor detail. I consider this important, however it appears many people do not consider thisimportant.

<dd>Dear Dino, I have explained in a very elegant way why Unruh's setup is equivalent to Afshar's setup, and I have provided all the necessary math calculations that Unruh did not provide. So your incompetence does not mean that Unruh's experiment is irrelevant. The changes that you did in the article are mainly to destroy useful information that otherwise can be utilized by readers that want to read more, and know more. The argument by CSTAR, that Unruh is well-known is just logical fallacy called appealing to authority, but the truth is that his proposal is good for newcomers in the field. Once one understands the logic in Unruh's setup, he/she can understand Afshar's setup.

<p>I have to agree with CSTAR on this. Unruh's argument is very often mentioned as a critique of Afshar's Experiement, and has existed for some time. It forms part of the debate and is from a notable source. Danko's argument is not often mentioned by anyone except Danko. The enforcement of Wikipedia Policy is not always clear cut for many reasons, but Danko has clearly overstepped the mark by placing his own work into the article, without any validation from a third party. Afhsar's experiment has appeared in print on a number of occasions, Danko's has not.</p>
<p>On a different note, I am not sure of the status of Unruh's argument. Was Unruh's argument ever published outside of the internet? I am not sure the only reference is on Unruh's blog. This does in itself raise an interesting point. We could argue all day about it. However Unruh's argument has been avialable for years, and Unruh is more notable than Danko as I understand it. So a choice has to be made. Like I said though, it can be difficult to decide what is or and what isn't OR. Technically, Danko's work is not OR if it is presented before hand at some other source which is referenced to. If we rule out Danko's reference, we would have to rule out Unruh's to, because this is a link to a private blog and nothing more. I only mention this to highlight the difficulties in interpreting WIkipedia policy. The ultimate solution is to use common sense and concensus in these matters.</p>
<p>Things will get a lot easier once the experiment appears in a peer reviewed journal. At that point, non peer reviewed critiques will probably have to be replaced by peer reviewed critiques as and when they arrive. Unruh's critique might no longer have a place in this article once Afhsar's peer reviewed paper is published, because his critique has not been published in a peer reviewed publication. Well perhaps we should just worry about that when it happens. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 21:11, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Unruh might not be an expert on this particular experiment. Although what you are saying is true to some extent, one has to be careful. For instance it could be that Unruh's argument is flawed. The possibility is there, and it would be interesting to see what a peer review would say. For now it is a notable critique because it is from a notable person that is all, and yes it is because of his notability that we sway <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> in his favor.

<dd>You make it all sound so simple. According to you there is nothing to discuss because it is all so obvious. My point is that Afshar spent a great deal of time considering the experiment, whereas Unruh appeared to chime in along with a whole load of other people *perhaps* without full consideration of it. In fact far from being trivial, we have seen all kinds of proofs and explanations, and they are not all consistent with each other. This is reflected in the current article. If you care to read Luboš Motl's blog (which is used as a reference) you will see that in efforts to disvalidate Afshar's argument he tends to move around quite a lot. With regard to Unruh, he is inconsistent. To quote from his blog:
<ul>
<li>Unruh uses a more transparent experimental setup where some issues can be explained very easily, without various technical complications of Afshar's setup. The only respect in which Unruh's setup seems to be oversimplified is that his framework only contains "completely dark" and "completely bright" area, and therefore the subtlety "thickness of the wires is small" does not arise in Unruh's specific approach. (Thanks to William Unruh for his patient explanation of the isomorphism.)</li>
<li>Because of the differences between Afshar's and Unruh's setups, it is perhaps useful to talk directly about Afshar's experiment.</li>
<li>In my opinion both Unruh as well as Kastner replace Afshar's experiment by a completely different experiment that does not capture the main flaw of Afshar's reasoning.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>He then goes on to state his reason for saying Afshar is wrong...
<ul>
<li>The main flaw is that Afshar does not realize that for a tiny grid, only a very tiny percentage of photons is used to observe the wave-like properties of light; these are essentially the photons for which the which-way information is completely lost. Because most photons go through the lens without any interactions and interference, Afshar is not allowed to say that he observes the wave-like phenomena with visibility close to one. In fact, it is close to zero if a consistent set of photons is used to define both V and K.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>What this is saying is that you can't trust a lens. The reason for this (as Afshar has covered) is that all photons are acocunted for and thus there is the *appearance* of which way information even for those photons that couold only have avoided the wires due to interference.</dd>
<dd>Most of the current arguments run up against the same problem. If all photons deomstrate the appearance of which way information and yet this is impossible, it can only mean that the lens can lie. Tell me where is states that lenses can lie in undergraduate science material.... <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 01:50, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

So, would you care to give the answer? Or are you going to just continue being sarchastic and unhelpful? How can the lens not show the origin of a photon?

<dd>I am not trying to learn or explain QM. My god, it's become like a religion hasn't it? I am asking blatently reasonable questions in efforts to end up with an article that actually makes sense. What will shut me up is an answer the the apparently basic questions I am asking that actually fits the verifiable facts. I have yet to get an answer to a basic question and this seems to highlight a misunderstanding of the experiment by those who contirbute to the article. For example, your comment below that the wires absorb some photons and these photons lose their WWI. Yes, theoretically this is understood. This has to be the case to agree with the principle of complementarity. However these photons still retain the appearance of WWI. That is the experimental evidence. Note I say "appearance" because I have a far more subtle understanding that you give me credit for. We can not prove the 1-1 mapping of hole to target via the lense, so I qualify this. I can only conclude through your answers you have not grasped that photons that should have hit the wires retain the appearance of WWI. Is it not important that those of us editing the article should properly understand the experiment? My own level of understanding of the experiment appears to be enough to notice inconsistencies in the article between the facts and editor's interpretation of the facts. I am trying to identify the key argument that Afshar uses and interpret it in plain English, because that would be good for the article. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 12:31, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Clarification: There is an error in the above, which I just noticed. I was making a mental jump in my mind and misinterpreted what you were saying. I took your statement "the wires absorb some photons and these photons lose their WWI" to mean "the photons that interacted with the wires but avoided them due to wave like behavior lose their WWI". My fault and my appologies to you for misunderstanding what you are saying. However I was only considering those photons which are actually detected, not those which are not detected because they are scattered/abosrobed by the wires. The scattered photons, as I have said just now elsewhere, may or may not be significant in the interpretation but that is a different issue to the one of what Afhsar's interpretation actually is. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 14:22, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Like an idiot I will once again try to explain why Afshar's experiment does not violate complementarity, despite all the past evidence that it will do no good at all. Complementarity applies to single particles (see Bohr's quote about "<i>the</i> particle"). Each particle is either absorbed by the wires demonstrating wave properties OR passes through the lens demonstrating particle properties (which slit it passed through) BUT NOT BOTH. No photon passes through the lens AND is absorbed by the wires. Therefore no photon demonstrates both particle and wave properties. Ergo complementarity is not violated. -<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dl>
<dd>Thank you. However this does not match my understanding of the experiment from what I have read. With the wires in place some photons avoid them in a manner than can only be explained by wave properties. That is, if the photons were behaving as particles, we would expect a far greater number of photons to be absorbed or scattered by the wires than is experimentally observed. In fact it is these 'extra' photons that avoid the wires that are demonstrating wave properties, not those photons with are absorbed or scattered. This is shown by how when both slits are open, fewer photons are absorbed than would be the case if the photons behaved solely as particles. So your interpretation is not that which Afshar presents as I understand it. It does not matter who is right, we are trying to present Afhsar's argument, not yours here. You state "Each particle is either absorbed by the wires demonstrating wave properties OR passes through the lens demonstrating particle properties (which slit it passed through) BUT NOT BOTH.", yet this does not appear to be what Afhsar claims. Instead Afshar is claiming that there are photons that avoid the wires because of wave like behavior, yet are also detected as having come from a particular hole. It is true that no photon passes through the lens and is absorbed by the wires, that is trivially obvious. However the experiment apparently shows that some number of photons must have avoided the wires due to interference and yet must have also been detected via the lens as having come from a particular hole. Ergo some photons have demonstrated both wave and particle behavior in the course of their existence. Granted we don't know which photons, and this may or may not be significant to the interpretation. It is a statistical analsysis. This may also be significant to the interpretation. But we should at least be presenting the argument presented by Afhsar in the article, not one by you or me or anyone else. Notable critiques should be present too, but I feel it is kind of important to state correctly what Afhsar is trying to assert before we add critique, don't you think? <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 14:04, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Clarification: When saying all photons are detected, I should say to be accurate, all photons that avoid the wires <strike>and</strike> are detected. I believe some small nummber of photons do get scattered, because a few photons contribute to the interefence pattern close to the minima, even if the probability of doing so for an individual photon is small. Again this may or may not be significant. Afshar might clarify what consideration his paper has given to this, if any. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 14:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Clarification: Motl states "these are essentially the photons for which the which-way information is completely lost". This is counter to the observations that all photons apparently show which way information via the lens. If the lens 'manufactures' which-way information in cases where it is supposedly lost, this can only mean that thw which-way information provided by the lens cannot be relied on. This is what I meant by the lens lying. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 02:54, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The experiment, according to my understanding, claims all the photons are detected. Do you dispute this? It's fine if you do, like I said what I am seeking is clarity. Whether you dispute this or not is not the point, it is what is claimed by Afhsar as I understand it (Afhsar will clarify I am, sure), and thus would bring clarity to Afshar's argument, and should be mentioned in the article. The dispute over the experimental evidence, if there is any, could then also be added to the article. If you find any references that dispute the experimental findings, we can include them.

<dd>Please read other reponses above. There was a misinterpretation of your comments by me. I interpreted your 'absorbed' incorrectly as "interacted with", in the sense of the photon in its wave state passing through the wires. Then I started saying "Asborbed photons are detected". Which is nonsense, if you mean that photons which have their path blocked by the wires = absorbed. I appologise for my inaccurate use of language. This came about in my mind because I was not considering scattered photons as I have covered in my comments above. To summerise: 1. All photons that do not get blocked by the wires are detected. 2. These photons must include some which avoided the wires due to interference. 3. Thus it is proven that some photons must have interfered with themselves (acting as a wave through both slits) and yet also have been detected as coming from one or other hole. This is my understanding of the conclusions of the experiment. The interpretation of this is another matter, as I have said. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 12:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dndn1011: 1) &amp; 2) &amp; 3) are all correct, but 3) is not as signficant as you suggest. We already know (from the clasical <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_slit_experiment.html" title="Double slit experiment">double slit experiment</a> and a host of other empirical data) that the photons propagate as waves, so the wires are only demonstrating what we already know, that they obey a wave-equation; i.e. the wires do not perform a measurement on the photons they do not absorb.

<dd>The reason for asking the question is to help make the article clear. This issue appears central to Afshar's claim and I if no one has an answer it would strike me as an important thing to highlight in the article. It is not a question of adding research here but underscoring an important part of Afshar's claim, at least as I understand it. Thus I am talking about the article, because I am talking about the experiment and what has been published on it. There has existed a bias towards OR critique of the experiment in this article.
