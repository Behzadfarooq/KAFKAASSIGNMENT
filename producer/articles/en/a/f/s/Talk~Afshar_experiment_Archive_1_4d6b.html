<h2><span class="mw-headline">Afshar Experiment: A Dissenting Opinion</span></h2>
<p>The Afshar experiment demonstrates that a coherent path distribution must be assumed to predict the number of photons incident on measurement spaces where path information is being observed, but it does not demonstrate that the coherent path distribution is actually realized across the surface of measurement spaces where path information is being observed.</p>
<p>All Figure number references in this article are references to Afshar’s Figure numbers in his paper “Sharp complementary wave and particle behaviours in the same welcher weg experiment”: <a href="http://www.irims.org/quant-ph/030503/" class="external free" title="http://www.irims.org/quant-ph/030503/" rel="nofollow">http://www.irims.org/quant-ph/030503/</a></p>
<p>In Afshar’s experiment, the two holes can be considered emitters in the sense that he pumps photons through these two holes with his laser, and these photons have to go somewhere. Assuming the Copenhagen Interpretation of different path distribution functions (coherent versus decoherent) for different type of measurements (visibility versus path information), one might ask the question how do these photons get distributed in experiments involving complementary measurement spaces (i.e. how many photons get mapped into each measurement space). This question is also relevant in an experiment that involves only a single measurement space where path information is being measured. The answer of course is that a global coherent path distribution function across all measurement spaces must be assumed to predict the photons incident on each measurement space. The number of photons incident on a measurement space is predicted by integration of the global coherent path distribution function across the surface of the measurement space. But the Copenhagen Interpretation indicates the predicted number of photons incident on a measurement space where we are measuring path information don’t actually exhibit a coherent distribution locally.</p>
<p>So when Afshar says that he has visibility of interference on the photons incident on the lens, if he means that a coherent distribution predicts the number of photons incident on the lens surface, then this is correct. But if he is saying that the photons incident on the lens surface actually exhibit a local coherent distribution across the surface of the lens, then this is incorrect.</p>
<p>In Afshar’s experiment there are 13 measurement spaces. There are 6 measurement spaces where visibility information is being observed corresponding to the 6 wires. There are 7 measurement spaces where path information is being observed corresponding to the 7 portions of the lens segmented by the wires. The number of photons incident on each of the wires is very low because the wires are very thin and Afshar has placed them at the point of maximum destructive interference of the coherent path distribution function. The number of photons incident on each of the lens segments can be predicted by integration of the coherent path distribution function across the face of the lens segment. If the results for all of the lens segments are added up, the result is very close to the value for the whole lens when the wires are absent, since only the portions of the total lens where there is maximum deconstructive interference in the coherent path distribution function are omitted in this integration process.</p>
<p>Afshar’s interpretation of his experiment seems to be that since the wires are very thin and he has carefully placed them at the points of maximum destructive interference, he can treat his experiment as a single measurement space. Since he is observing interference in the photons incident at the wires, he concludes that there must also be interference present in the photons incident on the lens, since he believes both sets of photons are part of the same measurement space.</p>
<p>Even though the wires are very thin, the photons incident on the wires must be treated separately from the photons incident on the lens, since different types of measurements are being made in the two cases, and therefore the photons exhibit different behaviors for the two cases. For the photons incident on the wires, visibility information is being observed, and therefore the photons incident on the wires go through both holes with a corresponding coherent path distribution that exhibits interference in the vicinity of the wires. For the photons incident on the surface of the lens, path information is being observed, and therefore the photons incident on the lens only go through one hole with a corresponding decoherent path distribution.</p>
<p>The argument that the local path distribution across each of the 7 lens segments must be decoherent consists of the following four points:</p>
<p>1) The photons only go through one hole and are resolved at the detectors. Therefore any interference pattern in front of the lens cannot be explained by self-interference.</p>
<p>2) The only other way to explain a coherent path distribution in front of the lens is for a single hole to be emitting a coherent path distribution function. Hopefully we would all agree that this is about as likely as hearing the sound of one hand clapping.</p>
<p>3) If a single hole is (somehow magically) emitting a coherent path distribution function, then it would manifest itself in an interference pattern at the detector image.</p>
<p>4) Since there is no interference pattern at the detector image in Figure 8a, a single hole must not (somehow magically) be emitting a coherent path distribution function.</p>
<p>The third point above is illustrated by Figure 8b where Afshar has induced some of the characteristics of a coherent distribution sourced by a single hole by placing the wires in front of the lens at the points of maximum destructive interference. The image in Figure 8b clearly indicates interference at the detector. The interference pattern is also still clearly visible in Figure 8c, but it does seem to be attenuated somewhat from Figure 8b. Afshar’s explanation for this attenuation is that less photons are incident on the wires in Figure 8c than in Figure 8b, which is certainly true. In summary, Figures 8b and 8c indicate an interference pattern, but this interference is the result of placing the wires in front of the lens. Figure 8a illustrates clearly that there is no interference pattern at the detector without the wires present.</p>
<p>So how does Afshar explain his claim of a coherent distribution across the face of the lens? His explanation seems to be a superposition behavior in the neighborhood of the holes (that the photon goes through both holes exhibiting interference and it also goes through only one hole exhibiting path information). There is a superposition of states before the wave function collapses. Before the wave function collapses, there is a possibility that the photon goes through both holes with a corresponding coherent path distribution, and there is the possibility that the photon goes through one hole with a corresponding decoherent path distribution. Afshar seems to be assuming a superposition of two states at the two holes, but only a single potential path distribution. When we make an observation, the wave function will collapse in a way that depends on the nature of the measurement we are making. If we are measuring visibility information, the wave function will collapse such that the photon goes through both holes with a corresponding coherent path distribution. If we are measuring path information, the wave function will collapse such that the photon goes through one hole with a corresponding decoherent path distribution.</p>
<p>Afshar attributes far too much magic to the thickness and placement of his wires. A couple of examples with different thickness and placement are provided below to illustrate this point. Both of these examples assume a peak-to-peak distance of u = 1.4 mm for the consecutive fringes similar to Afshar’s first experiment illustrated in Figure 1.</p>
<p>For the first example, replace the wires with thin strips with a width of 1.4 mm leaving these strips centered about the maximum point of deconstructive interference. These strips will block some of the portions of the lens where the value for a coherent path distribution is less than the value for a decoherent path distribution (i.e. some of the valleys of a coherent distribution). All portions of the lens where the value for a coherent path distribution is greater than the value for a decoherent path distribution will be left exposed (i.e. all peaks of a coherent distribution). Next determine the predicted attenuation of the radiant flux at the image based on a decoherent path distribution either by calculation, simulation, or experimental measurement. Finally open the second hole and measure the actual attenuation in radiant flux at the image and compare with the value predicted in the previous step. The measured results will be much less than the value predicted by assuming a decoherent path distribution.</p>
<p>For the second example, keep these same strips, but move them to a position where they are centered about the peaks of a coherent distribution instead of the valleys of a coherent distribution. These strips will now block some portions of the lens where the value for a coherent path distribution is greater than the value for a decoherent path distribution (i.e. some of the peaks of a coherent distribution). All portions of the lens where the value for a coherent path distribution is less than the value for a decoherent path distribution will be left exposed (i.e. all of the valleys of a coherent distribution). Go through all of the same steps as in the first example. This time the measured results for the reduction in radiant flux at the image will be much greater than the value predicted by assuming a decoherent path distribution.</p>
<p>Both of these examples demonstrate the same results as the Afshar experiment (i.e. a coherent path distribution function must be assumed to prediction the reduction in photons incident on the detectors). Therefore there is no magic in using very thin wires placed at the points of maximum deconstructive interference.</p>
<p>In summary, the Afshar experiment demonstrates that a coherent path distribution function must be assumed to predict the number of photons incident on measurement spaces where path information is being observed. According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the assumed coherent path distribution function actually collapses into a decoherent path distribution function across the surface of measurement spaces where path information is being observed. The Afshar experiment provides no evidence that the Copenhagen interpretation is incorrect.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Afshar's Response</span></h2>
<p>The bottom line for the above Dissenting Opinion is the following false conclusion (quoted):</p>
<p>"According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the assumed coherent path distribution function actually collapses into a decoherent path distribution function."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the major error in this argument is a misunderstanding of what the <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wavefunction_collapse.html" title="Wavefunction collapse">Wavefunction collapse</a> actually means. Without going into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics#Wavefunction_collapse" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics#Wavefunction_collapse" rel="nofollow">mathematical details</a>, a coherent superposition state can only collapse into an observable with a coherent distribution when a measurement is made. There is <b>no</b> "collapse" from a coherent wavefunction to a decoherent state because upon measurement a coherent wavefunation Psi is mapped into an observable within |Psi|^2 via a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics#Eigenstates_and_projection" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics#Eigenstates_and_projection" rel="nofollow">projection</a>, and <b>not</b> into some other decoherent distribution, say |Psi_1|^2 + |Psi_2|^2 . If the above quotation were true, then we could not observe an interference pattern in a double slit experiment, or immediately after the wires in my experiment, by direct observation, but we do! <b>We cannot change the definition of wavefunction collapse to an arbitrary and mathematically inaccurate one, just to save Complementarity!</b> <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 00:06, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is quite telling that the anonymous writer of the Dissenting Opinion (whose name is actually Alex), having now realized that his definition of the wavefunction collapse was indeed erroneous, has again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ADouble-slit_experiment&amp;diff=8737635&amp;oldid=8734633" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ADouble-slit_experiment&amp;diff=8737635&amp;oldid=8734633" rel="nofollow">attempted to “correct”</a>his conclusion by replacing the pervious version with the following: "According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the photons predicted by the assumed coherent path distribution function actually exhibit a decoherent path distribution function locally across the surface of measurement spaces where path information is being observed." I'm afraid, the more he awkwardly tries to avoid self-contradiction, the more his lack knowledge on even the most rudimentary QM formalism and language becomes apparent. There is no such thing as "coherent path distribution function" in QM. I suggest that he formally study QM before making more clumsy statements.

<p>The article keeps saying that Afshar's <i>results</i> are incompatible with quantum mechanics, that Unruh challenged and led some to doubt Afshar's <i>results</i>, and that if Afshar's <i>results</i> are correct then they have far-reaching implications. As far as I can tell, this is not right. It seems to be Afshar's interpretation of the results, and indeed his understanding of quantum mechanics, which are in question. Unruh's write-up, for example, concludes as follows: "I think Bohr would have had no problem whatsoever with this experiment within his interpretation. Nor would any other interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is simply another manifestation of the admittedly strange, but utterly comprehensible (it can be calculated with exquisite precision), nature of quantum mechanics." The current wording gives quite a misleading impression. -- <a href="../../../r/e/u/User%7EReuben_aaa3.html" title="User:Reuben">Reuben</a> 03:03, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dear Reuben, you say above: "The article keeps saying that Afshar's results are incompatible with quantum mechanics." I can only conclude that you have not read the article carefully. Where exactly is such an assertion made in the article?! As I have said many times in different interviews, my experiment indeed <i>confirms</i> QM formalism, but it disproves Bohr's Complementarity by showing that his "principle" does not follow from QM formalism at all. Sorry, but there is no misleading language here! --<a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 03:54, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You may wish to look up the adjective "novel" in a dictionary. Simply because a particular line of argument follows from an already accepted formalism, does not mean it is not a novel one! Einstein's Special Relativity was implicit in Maxwell's equations, but it was aptly considered as a novel result. Edison’s light bulb also followed from Faraday’s work, but it was a real invention… The non-perturbative measurement scheme introduced for the first time in my preprint is indeed a novel concept with no precedence in the literature.

<li>The precedent would be passing a vertically polarized beam of light through a vertical polarizer, and then measuring the final polarization along an axis 45 degrees from the vertical. Your setup is formally equivalent. Your scheme is no more "non-perturbative measurement" than passing a vertically polarized beam through a vertical polarizer is.

<p>I don't really see how this is supposed to violate wavefunction collapse. Perhaps you can try to clarify. As I see it, the photon travels through the two slits, interferes, the interference pattern travels through the carefully arranged dark-fringe wires, and then the photon collapses upon being detected at one of the detectors. Now, obviously if the wavefunction collapse occurred at the time of measurement, then that photon has reached that detector and so possibility of it having been stopped by the wires is erased. It seems that the argument is being made that because the path of the photon is being determined, that somehow it should go back in time and reestablish a chance to collide with the wire. But this does not seem to logically follow. In a standard <a href="http://www.bottomlayer.com/bottom/basic_delayed_choice.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bottomlayer.com/bottom/basic_delayed_choice.htm" rel="nofollow">delayed choice</a> experiment, the path the photon took is selectively determined after the photon has already passed through the slits, but this at no point goes back in time and arranges something inconsistent with the measurement that was made. So since in order for collapse to occur, the photon has to strike the detector, that collapse already rules out the possibility that it struck the wire. The interference pattern at the detector is only determined by the past of the photon, not the future, because just like in the delayed choice experiment, the detector arrangement could be replaced by a screen. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin"></a> — <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin">Cortonin</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECortonin_dfe9.html" title="User talk:Cortonin">Talk</a> 06:40, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I read every mention of collapse on the weblog, and no justification of the completed and reported experiment disputing collapse is made. Instead, promises are made for future work and a future experiment which would clearly show this. I think this is great, and I would love to read about it, but the fact remains that we shouldn't call things concluded on Wikipedia before the experiments which will clearly do so are actually completed and reported. It's the obligation of the article to document and reason out why said experiment says wavefunction collapse is incorrect. If it can't do that yet, then it shouldn't say that yet. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin"></a> — <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin">Cortonin</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECortonin_dfe9.html" title="User talk:Cortonin">Talk</a> 07:49, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A natural language restatement of Kastner's interpretation</span></h2>
<p>The problem with asserting that this experiment rules out either the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Many-worlds_interpretation.html" title="Many-worlds interpretation">Many-worlds interpretation</a>, or the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen_Interpretation_8887.html" title="Copenhagen Interpretation">Copenhagen Interpretation</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complementarity_principle.html" title="Complementarity principle">Complementarity principle</a>, is the assumption that, because with only one slit open the lenses and detectors provide welcher weg ("which way" or "which path") information, they will also do so with both slits open. This is the assumption of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_locality.html" title="Principle of locality">principle of locality</a>, and locality has been disproven (though perhaps not conclusively, according to some opinions) by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alain_Aspect_488f.html" title="Alain Aspect">Alain Aspect</a>'s implementation of the <a href="../../../e/p/r/EPR_experiment_e112.html" title="EPR experiment">EPR experiment</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photon.html" title="Photon">photons</a> remain in the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entangled.html" title="Entangled">entangled</a> state until they encounter the detectors; at that point, they apparently make the welcher weg choice. However, this presumes that they had a path all along. This cannot have been the case, because otherwise they would have interacted with the wires. And in fact, in the one-slit-open case, they do interact with the wires, and detection at one detector does represent welcher weg information. But despite the apparently intuitive fact that when they choose one detector and not the other it must represent welcher weg information because of the measurement with only one slit open, it actually does not; this is due to a non-local interaction.</p>
<p>Consider the <a href="../../../e/p/r/EPR_experiment_e112.html" title="EPR experiment">EPR experiment</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Podolsky_62fd.html" title="Boris Podolsky">Boris Podolsky</a>, and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathan_Rosen_a4e6.html" title="Nathan Rosen">Nathan Rosen</a> believed that they had shown that either the particles must have had spins in particular axes all along, a violation of the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisenberg_Uncertainty_Principle_4ffc.html" title="Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle">Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</a>, or that the <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wavefunction_collapse.html" title="Wavefunction collapse">wavefunction collapse</a> involved a violation of <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_realism.html" title="Local realism">local realism</a> at the time of measurement, and they maintained that the second was impossible. They were in fact correct in their first assertion, but they were incorrect in their second assertion. What they could not have foreseen was that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stewart_Bell_a43b.html" title="John Stewart Bell">John Stewart Bell</a> would devise <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell%27s_Theorem_a9ac.html" title="Bell's Theorem">Bell's Theorem</a> and show that the values could not have existed prior to the measurement, thus showing that non-local interaction actually takes place.</p>
<p>In the Afshar experiment, the non-local interaction is at the point of measurement, where the photon chooses one or the other detector. In this case, the non-local interaction causes the photon to manifest at one detector and not the other; this is called "<a href="../../../w/a/v/Wavefunction_collapse.html" title="Wavefunction collapse">wavefunction collapse</a>" in the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen_Interpretation_8887.html" title="Copenhagen Interpretation">Copenhagen Interpretation</a>. This is a common description in that interpretation of particle detection in general. The <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wavefunction.html" title="Wavefunction">wavefunction</a> propagates until a detection occurs. At that instant, a non-local interaction takes place, and the particle is detected at a particular location; this implies that the particle simultaneously cannot be anywhere else. If we include "the Andromeda Galaxy" in the definition of "anywhere else," this requires an instantaneous transmission of welcher weg information to the Andromeda Galaxy in violation of the absolute speed of light limit postulate of <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Relativity_1cb0.html" title="Special Relativity">Special Relativity</a>. 66.114.138.239</p>

<dd>Agree, the 66.114.138.239 statements are flawed. Wave function collapse may (bizarrly) occur in a negative form of interaction. Consider a radioactive atom in a singlet state, so that upon decay, the wave function is spherically symmetrical. Consider this atom surrounded by two hemispherical shells, one shell that is 10cm away, and one that is 10 m away. If the particle is detected on the outer shell, one must conclude that the wave function collapsed from spherical to hemi-spherical upon passage past the inner hemisphere, even though the particle completely failed to "materialize" on the inner hemisphere. In general, understanding wave function collapse (of a spherical wavefunction) in a <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloud_chamber.html" title="Cloud chamber">cloud chamber</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wire_chamber.html" title="Wire chamber">wire chamber</a> is an equally bizarre thought process. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 1 July 2005 19:47 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Georgiev's bust to Afshar's interpretation</span></h2>
<p>Certainly there is error in Afshar’s interpretation, and the problem is that he is claiming without proof that there is which way information even when there is no grid before the lens. In order to explain where Afshar is wrong let us present the following scenario:</p>
<p>You have two identical baskets A and B with black ink. You have identical empty baskets A’ and B’ and you have the following two possibilities:</p>
<p>Case (i): you transfer the ink from A into A’ and the ink from B into B’</p>
<p>Case (ii): you transfer the ink from A by half into A’ and B’ and similarly you transfer the ink from B by half into B’ and A’.</p>
<p>If you look only the final state A’ and B’ you cannot determine which of the scenarios did take place. In the case (i) you have one-to-one correspondence between A and A’, as well as between B and B’. In the case (ii) you simply don’t have the above-suggested one-to-one correspondence between the baskets.</p>
<p>Actually the above example is showing clearly that you should know the function that converted A,B into A’,B’ in order to be capable to say is there one-to-one correspondence A-&gt;A’ and B-&gt;B’, or there is just holographic correspondence AB-&gt;A’B’ without correspondence between the elements of the initial and the final state.</p>
<p>In the first case (i) we can say that there is "which way" information, while in the second case (ii) we can say that there "isn't which way" information.</p>
<p>Now the argumentation of Afshar can be understood as <b>circular proof</b> or <b>vicious circle</b>. He takes as a ground the classical ray model of light in which the rays propagate in straight trajectories and then he concludes that A' is image of A, and B’ is image of B. Alas, in QM this is not the case and the production of the image A’B’ can be understood if we consider ONLY interference of waves. Even if there is no grid before the lens the image A’B’ can be considered as result of the following scheme of subsequent interferences: (a) Fresnel diffraction between AB and lens focal plane f1. (b) Then Fourier transform of the image entering f1, and output of Fourier transformed image at f2. (c)Second round of Fresnel diffraction between f2 and the image plane.</p>
<p>If AB is placed at distance a &gt; 2f as is in Afshar’s experiment, then the distance between f2 and the image A’B’ is less than f. In the limiting case when a -&gt; oo, the input at f1 is Fraunhofer diffraction (Fourier transformed image), and the lens performs Fourier transform resolving the two-pinhole image A’B’ at the lens focal plane f2.</p>
<p>But if the production of the image A’B’ can be explained by interference alone, then, even if there is no grid, you cannot claim that there is "which way" info [the scenario is analogous to case (ii) when you split the ink from baskets A and B in order to fill the baskets A' and B']. The strangest is that Afshar puts a grid, and thus sees that THERE IS INTERFERENCE. So the question is "Why Afshar insists that the light propagated along straight trajectory between AB and A’B’?". What he disproved is that classical ray optics is not valid, and in order to disprove complementarity Afshar must show that A’B’ cannot be produced by the interference series consisting of Fresnel diffraction + Fourier transform + Fresnel diffraction. But to start from classical ray optics in order to prove what Afshar wants to prove is simply pseudo-science.</p>
<p>The fact that the lens does not provide “which way” info one can read the paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9903047" class="external autonumber" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9903047" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. A more technical version of Georgiev’s paper that busts Afshar’s interpretation can be found at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/dankomed/afshar.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/dankomed/afshar.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of conclusion we will point out that the current Wikipedia article begins with the phrase "The Afshar experiment is an optical which-way experiment ...", and it is exactly what Afshar needs to prove but he has not proven. Since the experimental setup is not "which-way experiment" the reader is lead into delusion from the very beginning.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reply to Unruh question</span></h2>
<p>Here is the question posed by Unruh. He asks "Yes, the lens acts as a "Fourier transform" device, but again so what?"</p>
<hr />
<p>From: Bill Unruh <a href="mailto:unruh@physics.ubc.ca" class="external autonumber" title="mailto:unruh@physics.ubc.ca" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Sent: Friday, April 29, 2005 1:33 PM To: Danko Georgiev</p>
<p>Again, your interpretation I agree makes no sense. The "which way" infomation IS there in the images, just as it is there in the original pinholes. I would certainly not advise him to give you the $1000 based on this argument. While he is wrong, he is not wrong in the way you have outlined it.</p>
<p>The fact that IF you were to place a screen before the lens, you would see an interference pattern, is irrelevant to whether or not the photons falling on the detectors convey "which way " information.</p>
<p>Yes there is a Airy disk. but so what. Yes, the lens acts as a "Fourier transform" device, but again so what. The natural propagation of the light also acts as a fourier transform. And the lens can be set up to compensage for the natural propagation transform to give you back the original image.</p>
<p><br />
Bill Unruh</p>
<hr />
<p>My reply is:</p>
<p>Dear Bill,</p>
<p>You simply don't understand the essence of my argument.</p>
<p>The existence of light "wave" implies that there is no "which way".</p>
<p>The application of Fourier transform between the two focal planes of the lens COMPLETELY MIXES THE TWO CHANNELS. In the Fourier transform you don't preserve the <b>one-to-one mapping</b> between the object and the image, but you introduce <b>many-to-one mapping</b>. Also the Fourier transform requires <b>interference</b> therefore if there is inteference of photon wavefunctions between the lens focal planes the final image certainly does not preserve the which way info. In order the interference to be absent between the two focal planes of the lens the photon wavefunctions for passage through slit A and B should be not coherent i.e. there must be already some "which way" marker as say different wavelength [color filter on the pinhole] or different polarization [polarization filter on the pinhole].</p>
<p>Danko</p>

<ul>
<li>[Bill Unruh's response, from e-mail CC/ed to afshar@rowan.edu by Bill]</li>
</ul>
<p>Since you decided to post an answer to a private reply to you to this whole list, I will respond in the same way.</p>
<p>a) EM waves are linear. Thus the image at the detectors is precisely the sum of the images from the waves emitted at the two slits. Those independent images are that if the wave came from pinhole 1, the image (yes, with diffraction pattern) falls entirely on detector 1, and the image from pinehole 2 falls entirely on detector 2. This is an elementary result of fourier optics. Yes, there is interference in the intermediate region, interference which comes from precisely the linearity of the waves, but that is irrelevant.</p>
<p>On the basis of your fourier optics, the Green's function of the EM field is precisely such that the image at detector 1 depends only and solely on the amplitude at slit 1, and that at detector 2 depends only and solely on that at slit 2.</p>
<p>b) What has "classical straight ray" arguments got to do with anything. Who discusses them but you? The argument is not based on "classical straight ray" arguments. It is based on the wave nature of light throughout.</p>
<p>You may be getting confused when the term "which way" is used. It is NOT which way the photon went between the slit and the detector. That is NOT what "which way" refers to. It refers to whether or not the photon came through slit 1 or slit 2. That is all. It has nothing to do with what the photon did in the space between the slits and the detectors. You may have gotten misled by the use of the word "way" in "which way" and thought that it referred to a complete path. It does not. In this context it would better be phrased as "which slit". It is ONLY which slit the light came out of that is being determined, not anything about how it travelled between the slit and the detector.</p>

<p>Above is an exchange between Bill Unruh (a veteran physicist) and Danko Georgiev (AKA The Fake) in which Bill rejects his utter nonsense. Although Bill disagrees with me, I applaud his defense of truth, which in this case happens to be the defense of my arguments regarding which-way info in the images. The likes of Georgiev MUST be rejected and marginalized by all real scientists in the interest of scientific advancement, all personal differences aside. I have no problem with considering unorthodox ideas (after all some may consider me as unorthodox,) but after one realizes an individual is fake, and it takes no more than a couple of exchanges for a pro., the individual must be warned, and if stubborn, BANNED from professional forums. Therefore, I shall make recommendations to PhilSci and arXiv archives, as well as Wikipedia to put his name on their blacklist. I would also encourage you to do so. Sorry Danko, but you brought this unto yourself after my repeated warnings...--<a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> | <a href="../../../a/f/s/User_talk%7EAfshar_dad1.html" title="User talk:Afshar">Talk</a> 15:46, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You have the opportunity to prepare your reply, before the paper officially appears in the june issue of the open acess journal NeuroQuantology. You previously said that you have lost "15 precious minutes from your life to read my critique". Well, you should lose 5 years more to study the basics of Quantum mechanics, becuase you don't understand its main mathematics. Read the above paper and you may understand that complementarity is not "interpretational aspect of QM" but it is a set of mathematical instructions that tell you how to calculate probabilities.

<dd>Dear Cortonin, I couldn't care less about the manner in which Danko characterizes me. As any competent physicist would immediately notice, his "paper" is nothing but a hodge-podge of copied and pasted and mostly ill-understood concepts in Fourier optics, denounced by Unruh and myself (yes unfortunately I did read it). It is not impolite to call something what it is. It may be a bit blunt, but in this case, it is a no-brainer: Danko's "paper" is a joke, and an affront to serious physicists. As much as I respect the amateurs getting at it, I cannot ignore an ignorant person insisting on wrong concepts and total abuse of the professional lingo. What would you think if someone recommends that you use the Umbilical Cord to wrap up your gifts? Would you say "sure, a cord is a cord, is a cord"?! No, you would smile, and try to correct the individual, but if he still insists on that idea, you'd be entirely justified to dismiss him as a mere jester, deserving not a single minute of your time. Sadly, that is the case with Danko. Too sad really...

<p>I am polite to anyone who is not using offences. I was blocked by Afshar, so I don't have access to his blog, and to his server, I was threatened to be reported to the PhilSci archive as ignorant, incompetent, and fake [as he calls me above]. I have personally required withdrawal of my paper from PhilSci, because I don't want to bother the editors of the PhilSci archive. They politely have sent me feedback fulfilling my request, and they announced that they will stop accepting papers on this topic, because the function of the archive is not to be a judge.</p>
<p>The problems in my first version were a lot, and most of them were because I did not use any mathematics. Now in the revised version posted at my account in geocities, i have included all the necessary math, showing that Afshar is popularizing wrong interpretation of QM [fraud?!]. I can say that it is not me who sounds impolite, it is Afshar the one who insisted that Einstein's Nobel prize should be taken back&#160;!!! This is total un-respect to other scientists who gave so much for the development of physics.</p>

<dd>Dear Danko, I noticed you have withdrawn your submission from the PhilSci archive. If indeed you removed it on your own initiative, I applaud that. It is a good first step in the right direction. Also, I did see your "improved" paper, but it still suffers from the same shortcomings as the original one.

<p>As I have said I personally have requested removal of my PhilSci paper. It is sad however that you repeatedly claim that I am a medical doctor, so that is why I am ignorant in physics. So far I have not seen any mathematical reply proving your thesis that there is 1:1 correspondence between a slit and a detector. In contrast I have provided a lot of mathematics, and if you really have read my revised paper you should be already competent about the fact that COMPLEMENTARITY TELLS US HOW TO MANIPULATE QUANTUM AMPLITUDES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE PROBABILITIES OF CERTAIN EVENTS. I have simply explained to you that your thesis insists that we observe |psi_1|^2 + |psi_2|^2 distribution [intensity distribution], while I claim that we actually have |psi_1 + psi_2|^2 distribution. If one follows your suggestion we should expect "clumping pattern" if your sigma_2 detector is put out of focus, while if my thesis is right I claim that we shall observe "interference" picture.</p>
<p>Please stop using offensive texts, noone profits from that. Just write down the mathematics proving your thesis.</p>
<p>Danko</p>
