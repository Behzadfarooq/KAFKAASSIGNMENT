The claim of complementarity violation in Afshar's experiment is a statistical argument that applies only to large numbers photons, not to individuals (cf "<i>the</i> particle" above in Bohr's statement is a reference to a single photon, not to groups of photons).

<dd><i>"To conclude, in spite of Afshar's claim we still need two experiments in order to exploit the totality of the phenomenon.

The hypothesis of Afshar that we only need some partial information concerning the interference pattern in order to reconstruct the complete interference is only based on the idea that the fringes already exist.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disputed recent editing and old revert, piece #2</span></h2>
<p>Dear Sdirrim, I think the article should be reverted to my last edit. The current version contains misstatement of Afshar's experiment, and I cannot trace who has written this paragraph which is wrong, and is personal opinion of what Afdshar says, not what Afshar said.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Afshar's conclusion is that the light exhibits a wave-like behavior when going through the wires, since the light goes through the spaces between the wires when both slits were open, <b>but also exhibits a particle-like behavior after going through the lens,</b> with photons going to a given photo-detector. "</dd>
</dl>
<p>Afshar claimed that there is one-to-one correspondence, and in none of the papers he discusses what happens when the photon passes through the lens, nor has stated that the "passage trough the lens" is the particle-like aspect.</p>
<p>Please revert to my last edit of the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Afshar's conclusion is that the light exhibits both complementary wave and particle characteristics in the same experiment for the same photons: a wave-like behavior when photon goes through the wires, since the light goes through the spaces between the wires when both slits were open, <b>but also exhibits a particle-like behavior preserving the which way correspondence between the slit through which the photon have passed and the detector that measures the photon.</b> "</dd>
</dl>
<p>I want to warn that interpreting of what Afshar would have said, thinks now, etc., is classified as OR, and is not verifiable. My proposal is based solely on the 4 verifiable papers that Afshar has released, it says no more no less than what Afshar has officially published. p.s. I hope Afshar personally supports this change, because I think there is no use to oppose to everything I say, I can post quotation of Afshar's post, where he EXPLICITLY said that the particle aspect is based on the idea of <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-to-one_correspondence.html" title="One-to-one correspondence">one-to-one correspondence</a> (<a href="../../../b/i/j/Bijection.html" title="Bijection">bijection</a>)! p.s. 2 In order to explain why my revision is mathematically necessary for nonexperts, I want to add that the current text says the photon "goes to given detector", but the correct statement is "to given detector ONLY" and this "only" is what matters, this is the essense of the word <a href="../../../b/i/j/Bijection.html" title="Bijection">bijection</a> <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 04:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Then put it as a disputed piece of text in the "Disputed Segments (Revised)" section. I reverted the article to that specific section because it was the current version when we decided to make no unilateral changes. Changes were made after that decision, and I reverted the changes made after the revision. If you have an idea for a change to the article, put it under the appropriate talk page section. Put the questionable text under the "Disputed Segments (Revised)" section, and create a new section to discuss changes to the disputed segment. This seems like a good system, and if everyone can refrain from editing, and instead allow me to make only the agreed-upon changes as decided under this system, than I believe we can get this worked out. Thank you all for being civil, and try this system for the next few days. Please read my comments at the bottom of the page, and I hope everone can remain civil. Hopefully, when I get back, there will be a nice, neat set of edits for me to make that I can see have been agreed upon.

<dd>Dear Ideogram, I have accepted the mediation for third time already, and the article can be changed by everyone anyway he likes, except for Afshar, or Afshar sockpuppet friend. Wikipedia is not and advertisement board, and Afshar has already claimed he does not want to contribute to Wikipedia except on his promo. The current article does not contain OR - original research. It contains replies to Afshar claims, where is clearly shown that Afshar is mathematically inconsistent. Pointing out with mathematical calculation that one makes wrong claims is NOT original research, as posting a proof of the fact <span class="texhtml">3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 5<sup>2</sup></span>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Section Afshar interpretation</span></h2>
<p>Afshar urges modification of the section of his views, but the editors that modify the section on Afshar`s claim must provide exact quotations of Afshar! I personally have studied all of his work and know exactly where and what is written. Warning for Afshar: <b>you CANNOT modify your claims in other words</b> because it is Original Research [claims by the author itself, that represent views not published in reputable source!!!], read carefully again the Wikipedia policy. The meaning of the passage on the particle behaviour on the passage through the lens must be supported by exact quotation here in the discussion, and I take the obligation to myself insert Afshar`s request for change if there is evidence for the necessary change, if such quotation is not provided by Afshar the passage that I have edited does not represent the published views of Afshar. Also Afshar`s views seem to have evolved since 2004, because now he wants to reject that he questioned the Eibnstein`s photon idea. If Afshar rejects what he has said, this can be regflected in the article, in the form, <i>Afshar in 2007 took back his accusations of Einstein, and considered that his 2004 claim is wrong</i>. p.s. If Afshar says that New Scientist mis-quoted him, then he can pursue legal actions in the court. Unless this is done Afshar cannot accuse New scientist as he did in Wikipedia saying that he didnot write article himself. I do believe if Afshar starts a process against New Scientist he will lose immediately because the journalists have tapes with records of their interviews! <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 07:17, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur with Ideogram 100%. The question is if Danko presists in ignoring the process the mediator is trying to put in place, then what? I guess we all just glare at him in silence or something..... Danko, we are here to report notable verifiable facts from a neutral point of view, not to throw accusations around or engage in psuedo-legalities. You contributions do a lot to upset people and very little to advance the article. You bring up things that are completely irrelevant and just your own personal inferences. Should Afshar take someone to court then win or lose, we can mention this in the article. As there is no such court case it is pointless to spectulate on one. If Afshar has changed his mind, this can be reflected in the article too, along with any original claims. If there has been misquoting of Afshar or things repeated out of context, then Afshar should have the opportunity to provide verifiable evidence to the contrary. This is actually quite a simnple process, as long as people behave in a clam and respectful manner and engage in constructive discussion. <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 12:57, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Danko, you are not proceeding along with the mediation in good faith, and as usual are muddying the water with erroneous conjectures and agitated hyperbolae. I have not been misquoted, and I will not retract my statement regarding Einstein's views on photons. In fact every physicist with a reasonable knowledge of the history of light agrees that Einstein deserved the Nobel prize for his Relativity theories and not the explanation of photoelectric effect, as it can be explained by classical electromagnetism and stochastic electrodynamics. The fact that no physicist has brought up this issue during the past 2.5 years should give you enough pause to question your own judgment. Please refrain from discussing issues out of place, and allow the mediator to mediate!-- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 15:17, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Discussion of article</span></h2>
<p>I'm back, but will be gone this weekend. I am a student, after all. Since things have calmed down, I would like to continue the previous plan. If you feel that there is something wrong with a section, add it to the "Disputed Segments (Revised)" section, and then I will add another section for discussion of that disputed text. We already began discussion on one piece of text. Just add text that you feel should be changed, and in the new talk page sction put your <i>summarized</i> argument. Please remain civil, take your turn, and summarize your objections and arguments. Thank you. Hopefully, we can start making some progress. Oh, and you don't need to wait for other discussion to finish before addaing another disputed segment. <a href="../../../s/d/i/User%7ESdirrim_3c1d.html" title="User:Sdirrim">Sdirrim</a> 19:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, I would like everyone to refrain from edits escept those discussed here, and I will take care of those. Thank you! <a href="../../../s/d/i/User%7ESdirrim_3c1d.html" title="User:Sdirrim">Sdirrim</a> 20:11, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>To keep things simple here, I will try to keep the article in the same state as when this plan was introduced, save for edits that we all agree on. Thus, I will revert recent changes made since February 9. We all agreed not to make any changes except those we agree upon, and those not familiar with the article are unaware of the current conflict. As such, I have reverted the article to when the agreement was made. <a href="../../../s/d/i/User%7ESdirrim_3c1d.html" title="User:Sdirrim">Sdirrim</a> 17:22, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In addition to the reasons ypu mention, some of the recent changes were claimed to have been based on principles such as NPOV and encyclopedicity.

<p>One last thing: as I have mentioned before, I will be gone from the 15th to the 19th. This would be an excellent opportunity to have a reasonable discussion on the disputed parts of the article and show that everyone can keep things under control. If things spin out of control, then I may have to put in a request for formal arbitration (get the people who actually can ban you from an article). Everyone, please show that you can remain civil for 4-5 days. Thank you. <a href="../../../s/d/i/User%7ESdirrim_3c1d.html" title="User:Sdirrim">Sdirrim</a> 19:04, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm back. Wow. There has been absolutely no activity here. Thank you everyone for waiting. And I think that the recent edit can be left as is, because it didn't change any content. So, since I am back, please discuss what segments of the article need changing. (By the way, you didn't need to cease activity here. I just asked that everyone be civil and not make any changes.

<p>The following point is missing it's counterpoint:</p>

<dd>Niels Bohr stated "an adequate tool for a complementary way of description is offered precisely by the quantum-mechanical formalism"[11]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the photons in the experiment obey the precise mathematical laws of quantum mechanics (the formalism), how can Bohr's principle of complementarity be violated by the experiment?[13][14][15]</li>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The counterpoint, if I recall, was something like this (somewhat elaborated):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The experiment's obedience to the formalism can simply throw into question Bohr's claim that the formalism is an "adequate tool for a complementarity way of description". There is no great logical flaw here. Bohr may be just wrong. Basically, if the formalism is not violated by the experiment, yet complementarity is (if it is), then Bohr's claim is just incorrect.</li>

<dd>Dear Carl, you already engage yourself with position - you mean that if Afshar were correct, then Bohr's claim that complementarity reflects the formalism is potentially false. However indeed claculations show that Afshar uses inconsistent formalism at first place. Since we have decided not to finalize the whole article with conclsion who is correct and who is not [because we cannot satisfy all the three parties in this dialogue] then your suggested repairing of Bohr's views should be <b>rejected</b>.

<dl>
<dd>Dear Danko, the formalism (or inconsistant version therof) may very well be wrong as well, but such is not (directly) addressed by the experiment (other than the possibility of the inconsistency you indicate). But complementarity can still fail even if the correct formalism doesn't. For there is nothing in the formalism that requires complementarity be correct. Or to put it another way - if there is, (and I am happy to entertain this possibility) then we need more than Bohr's word for that. That is the point I'm making. To quote a few words by Bohr as the only defense of complementarity required - is an insult to both your own work and everyone else's on this subject. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 00:12, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree as well. But there is no nonsense in the counterpoint. The counterpoint merely indicates that the previous point, (which disputes the validity of a statistical demonstration of interference), is incorrect - ie. that a statistical demonstration (of interference) is consistent with (ie. does not rule out) the otherwise theorised "understanding" that individual photons interfere. It is the previous point which is nonsense and as a result the counterpoint suffers some contagion from such. And so I suggest removal of both point and counterpoint. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 22:56, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In case there is any latent confusion here, the demonstration of individual photon interference is not being denied by the above disputed statement. It is, in fact, being denied by the previous statement (for which the above disputed statement is the counter-statement).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here is the relevant quote from the previous statement:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The claim of complementarity violation in Afshar's experiment is a statistical argument that applies only to large numbers photons, not to individuals (cf "the particle" above in Bohr's statement is a reference to a single photon, not to groups of photons).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The counterpoint (being proposed for deletion) can be understood in simpler terms as:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>A demonstration of interference, using a large number of photons, does not rule out the idea of interference for individual photons.</i></dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I might also add that the interference of individual photons can ONLY be demonstrated statistically. (Or I'd like to see an experiment that does otherwise). For example, if we use a single photon in Afshar's experiment how do we know it didn't just miss the wires - so to speak. It is only by means of multiple photons, (whether one after the other or at the same time) - and the standard rationalisation - that we arrive at the idea that individual photons interfere - or to put it another way, why would the Afshar experiment, considered in exactly the same way as any other statistical demonstration of interference, not also arrive at the same idea that individual photons are interfering. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 05:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On a general note one might ask <i>why</i> we ascribe the wave function to individual photons, rather than (say) groups of photons. The first answer is "because we can", ie. without causing any conflict with the emperical data. But this doesn't tell us <i>why</i>. One reason why is that it allows us to rule out any latent suspicion that interference is the result of inter-particle interactions. That is, if you do postualate individual photons, they must be ones that self-interfere - otherwise how would you explain the interference pattern created by so called "single particle" experiments (particles emitted one after the other). You couldn't. And, of course, if you don't postulate individual particles then you have no individual particles to interfere with each other. So either way particles don't interfere with each other. They either self-interfere or don't exist at all. Is there any reason why we <i>should not</i> postulate individual particles? There are two quasi-reasons or side-effects to postulating individual particles. One is that the postulated particle must be considered capable of "superposition". We all seem capable of modelling this so no problem there. The other is that our particle, in a state of superposition, finds itself unable to "collapse" so to speak - to become a single particle detection. This one seems to be of particular annoyance to most theorists. Superposition is fine. But wave function collapse? The problem is that rationalisation inevitably erases any information we might otherwise associate with individual particle detections, in much the same way that jpeg compression of a digital image tends to erase certain attributes of the original image without necessarily violating any of the visual structure. From the jpeg image, we can not recover the precise pattern of noise associated with the original uncompressed image. Likewise, from the quantum formalism, we can not (re)construct the precise pattern of individual detections that occur(ed) in any particular experiment. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 22:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>May I have a verdict please? To only delete the section described above (as is the consensus, on the basis of irrelevence), to also delete the reference of Drezet (on the basis of an unreliable source - ArXiv), or to also delete the section above it (on the point/counterpoint system)? It seems that everyone on both side believes that we should delete the referenced text. Should we also delete the quote from Drezet? And finally, would only deleting the referenced text and not the text above it lead to a breakdown in article neutrality? We all agreed to delete this section. Now we just need to answer the remaining two questions and I will act accordingly. <a href="../../../s/d/i/User%7ESdirrim_3c1d.html" title="User:Sdirrim">Sdirrim</a> 16:09, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>In addition</i> to eliminating this statement, I want to throw out the bullet point above, starting with "<i>Afshar's experiment does not yield which way information</i> and <i>demonstrate interference effects ...</i>" and ending with "<i>The whole reasoning is circular and for this reason misleading. - Aurelien Drezet</i>".</dd>

<p>Carl Looper: <b>DELETE</b> (but only if both bullets deleted!)</p>

<p>I'd say we can count that as concensus&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/n/d/User%7EDndn1011_6560.html" title="User:Dndn1011">Dndn1011</a> 18:56, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is not a consensus. My vote for deletion is conditional on both bullets being deleted. My vote differs from Art's vote which, while he prefers deletion of both, does not condition deletion of one on deletion of the other. It is not clear to me, from earlier debates by Afshar, that he is not also voting for deletion of both points. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 23:20, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can I also ask that a user's signature not be used by anyone other than the owner of that signature, at least in a situation such as this. It is extremely misleading.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_A_Looper_8141.html" title="User:Carl A Looper">Carl A Looper</a> 23:23, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To keep things clear, I suggest that if anyone reposts someone else's signature as part of a quotation, that they include "--reposted by [your signature]" as I have been doing. <a href="../../../s/d/i/User%7ESdirrim_3c1d.html" title="User:Sdirrim">Sdirrim</a> 23:38, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Based on the arguments above, I am deleting the disputed piece: <i>The statistical demonstration of interference in Afshar's experiment, as in the double slit experiment, does not rule out the interference of individual photons.</i> Although this is a counterpoint for the paragraph above it, it is invalid. Also, its purpose as a counterpoint is not immediately obvious. I will list the paragraph above the disputed section as "Disputed Piece #5", where the decision can be made to delete it, alter it, or add a valid counterpoint. However, "Disputed Piece #2" has been <b>addressed</b>. <a href="../../../s/d/i/User%7ESdirrim_3c1d.html" title="User:Sdirrim">Sdirrim</a> 23:38, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
