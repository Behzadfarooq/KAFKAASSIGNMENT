<p>Andrew - your problems here seem to indicate that you are not aware of how copyright law works, and that this has been a source of conflict with other users. You cannot simply take pictures from different sites on the internet willy-nilly copy them here. I suggest that you read the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_FAQ_fe96.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright FAQ">Wikipedia:Copyright FAQ</a>, which I wrote in simple, plain english to help people understand the basics of copyright law. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 06:37, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Raul, thanks for your message. I am not just copying images from other sites. I either produce the images myself, or take them from sites where I have personal permission to take them (such as my high school organization: [<a href="http://www.uwc.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uwc.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] or my college [<a href="http://www.middlebury.edu" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.middlebury.edu" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] In case of flags for instance, I make sure to state where I took the flags from. I can contact them personally if you'd like and ask for permission. If you think this is a violation, please let me know why. Thanks again&#160;:)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Every picture on wikipedia has an "image page" assocaiated with it. You need to put information on those pages such as who took it, and what license they released it under. So if you did get permission, you need to make a statement to that effect (preferably, if you get the permission by email, you copy the email to the image page). <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 06:58, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding the image of the Egyptian flag, it came from the <a href="http://www.flags.net/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.flags.net/index.php" rel="nofollow">World Flag Database</a> (as you wrote yourself --note in passing that it is "World Flag", not "World Flags"), and those images are all clearly marked «&#160;©2005 The World Flag Database &amp; Graham Bartram; Flag Drawings © Graham Bartram, portions © The Flag Institute &amp; Mario Fabretto&#160;». They are *not* public domain, so you should not mark them as such.</dd>
<dd>Now, if you obtained permission from them, that is another matter but should be clearly indicated on the image page.</dd>
<dd>Please explain.</dd>

<dd>Whoever Jimbo is, I think he has a point. The intent of the WFD copyright seems to be to allow people to use either a) up to 4 flags on their web site (which is no good for Wikipedia; we want all of the images!) or b) to illustrate a report (basically, homework). The intent of Wikipedia is to make everything as re-usable as possible, and the WFD policy certainly does not allow that. Even if using this one image does not violate their copyright policy, it certainly violates the spirit of Wikipedia. (Besides, if the image gets moved to Wikimedia Commons, it could then appear over dozens of "web sites" --i.e, the various Wikipedias--, which is probably a violation again)</dd>
<dd>In any case, why tempt trouble when all that needed doing was taking the CIA version and fix its colours?</dd>

<p>I am removing my self from the <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Fanous_a89a.html" title="Isaac Fanous">Isaac Fanous</a> VfD debate, in anticipation of getting another admin to step in and deal with Omar, in particular what IMO was a personal attack on you by saying "So its a religious issue".</p>
<p>Nevertheless i presume i am still in a position to influence and advise you, so i will attempt to do so:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Great! So now we know Mr Omar Filini is a liar and hardly in a position to comment on a notble artist such as Dr Isaac Fanous. Not to mention that, from his comment, it is obvious he has a certain prejudice against the Egyptian Coptic community and a serious lack of knowledge when it comes to distinguishing between Coptic Community and Coptic Church! User:afanous On 9:44, Jan 24th (EST)</dd>
</dl>
<p>is full of personal attacks including</p>
<ul>
<li>the word "liar"</li>
<li>the idea that "we know" he "is a liar"</li>
<li>your failure to substantiate your opinion about any untruths</li>
<li>your tone in that post, starting with sarcasm ("Great!") and including
<ul>
<li>labelling your PoV inferences as "obvious" and</li>
<li>claiming to read his mind, by inferring "serious lack of knowledge" as a root cause and failure to "distinguish ... between Coptic Community and Coptic Church" as an intermediate cause of his behavior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please consider being the <i>good guy</i> in this, defending yourself in carefully temperate terms, and removing your own personal attacks before someone else embarrasses you by doing it for you. (I may be overscrupulous, and i am certainly atypical, in my approach to doing that: if i were you, i like to think i would remove that entire edit and copy it to User:Afanous/My regrettable offenses, below an introduction saying</p>
<dl>
<dd>This page contains material that i moved here, rather than leave it where it would continue to offend and damage the WP community. By my not removing it completely from WP, it avoids my concealing my errors.</dd>
</dl>
<p>and replacing it with</p>
<dl>
<dd>:''[I have moved from this spot a personal attack that i made at 9:44, Jan 24th (EST). --~~~~]''

<li>I interrupt myself to say that i meant to say

<p>But then, i'm weird enough to intentionally spell the first-person-singular pronoun in lower case, so consider doing some wiki-research on "removing personal attacks" before taking that advice.)</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that you are winning this deletion debate, and you can "afford to be gracious".</p>

<p>Thank you in return, Andrew (if i may address you thusly; i glanced at your home page &amp; was curious which mountain you were plunge-stepping down). It is hard to get everything here right from the start, and much more important to listen to one's colleagues. As with having a good mountain guide, one value in that willingness comes from learn (directly or indirectly) from the mistakes of those who have been lucky enough to "survive" the potentially "fatal" mistakes. As in the mountains, those who are really too stubborn to learn just don't make it here. But enough of that: i didn't really expect you to be a non-listener.</p>
<p>Let me know, if you like, when careful observation (or experimentation - visit <a href="../../../s/b/_/WP%7ESB_c0d8.html" title="WP:SB">WP:SB</a>) still leaves you puzzled about this place, or urgency demands it. (RTFM? Yeah, often useful; sometimes not.)</p>
<p>Here are two Wiki tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can find the hidden Returns in the middle of the text you're editing by (at least with MS IE as browser) using Ctrl-up-arrow or Ctrl-down-arrow; it'll stop at next the one. (I think you left behind two unintended returns, now both fixed, in editing the VfD page.)</li>
<li>On the other hand, unless the first character of the line (which after word-wrap becomes a 'graph) is colon, asterisk, or pound-sign (#), a lone Return will <i>not</i> start a new 'graph. E.g., your msg to me is a single 'graph. Two Returns (and i think any greater number of consecutive ones) gets you a blank line between two 'graphs; &lt;br&gt;, i think with or without a Return before and/or after, gets you a break between 'graphs without any blank line betweeen them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and i don't think you know yet about ~~~, ~~~~, and ~~~~~.<br />

<p>I just noticed my post above, and am a little embarrassed to have said i was absenting myself and then suddenly "coming [back] on like <i><a href="../../../g/a/n/Gangbusters.html" title="Gangbusters">Gangbusters</a></i>".

<p>Well, we don't use adjectives as article titles, and we do links from adjectives as links to noun-named articles; IMO you don't yet have a feel for how we organize concepts, and need to get more used to the way other things have been done so the kind of changes (changes back?) that i did make more sense to you. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 06:51, 2005 Jan 29 (UTC) <i>&amp; (to split my own two-subject contrib into 2 parts for different sections) 00:49, 2005 Jan 30 (UTC)</i></p>

<li>It is more logical to redirect 'Copts' to 'Copt', and have 'Coptic' as a disambiguation page. It's also a good idea to describe what you're changing in the summary field, so other interested contributors in the community can follow on. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlef01_4b1a.html" title="User:Alef01">Alif</a> 11:53, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I'm not <i>sure</i> a dab page for an adj is a bad idea (as i assumed in my first consideration of that page), but you should try looking at some dab pages like, uh, <a href="../../../o/z/_/Oz.html" title="Oz">Oz</a> or <a href="../../../c/l/u/Club.html" title="Club">Club</a>, i think, and maybe even look at the What-links-here page for <a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisambig_6efb.html" title="Template:Disambig">Template:Disambig</a> to get some feel for the various approaches. (I think we are more free-form abt dab pages than true articles, because they are kind of "mere entry points"; i've never noticed them being covered in <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> or many discussions. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 14:48, 2005 Jan 29 (UTC) &amp; (to split my own two-subject contrib into 2 parts for different sections) 00:49, 2005 Jan 30 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As to removing what i labelled as your personal attack, IIRC you called him a liar or implied that, about his background, when you have no idea (unless you are hiring detectives) what his background is. IMO that is a personal attack within the WP meaning of the term. You might want to look at my belated commentary, now on <a href="../../../i/s/a/Talk%7EIsaac_Fanous_2069.html" title="Talk:Isaac Fanous">talk:Isaac Fanous</a> about why <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">User:Megan1967</a>'s thing constituted one. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 06:51, 2005 Jan 29 (UTC) &amp; (to split my own two-subject contrib into 2 parts for different sections) 00:49, 2005 Jan 30 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, i'll look again (within days) at exactly what i removed, and see whether i might have misconstrued you. It <i>is</i> at least worth saying (having said no one on the VfD was interested, or to be precise, interested <i>there</i> in who was more wronged) that you were much better behaved than Omar, in response to much greater provocation than you gave. I <i>was</i> disappointed in you, but as i say, that could be my mistake, and the <i>worst</i> i'd consider saying about you is that you should be expected to be a valuable colleague, but may have had a lapse under severe provocation from Omar, and that if i were <i>asked</i> for my opinion i'd definitely want to recheck my previous criticism of you rather than repeat it first. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 14:48, 2005 Jan 29 (UTC) <i>&amp; (to split my own two-subject contrib into 2 parts for different sections) 00:49, 2005 Jan 30 (UTC)</i>
<ul>
<li>After looking at what i removed, i still think it merited removal, but i doubt i accurately described the situation (nor therefore the exact correct justification for removal). I oppose our changing that blue VfD-record block on the talk page, but i think you would be justified in linking, or asking me to link, from just below the permanent record to a discussion (here?) that would set the record straight. That'd be your call. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 01:24, 2005 Jan 30 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for uploading <a href="../../../c/o/p/Image%7ECopticCross.jpg_d7f3.html" title="Image:CopticCross.jpg">Image:CopticCross.jpg</a>. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>

<p>Ahlan ya Andrew,</p>
<p>I'm trying to upload the image <a href="../../../s/t/m/Image%7EStMarkCathAlex.jpg_2802.html" title="Image:StMarkCathAlex.jpg">Image:StMarkCathAlex.jpg</a> to Commons <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:StMarkCathAlex.jpg" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:StMarkCathAlex.jpg">commons:Image:StMarkCathAlex.jpg</a> in order to use it in the Arabic article about <a href="../../../../ar/%D9%85/%D8%B5/%D8%B1/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1.html" class="extiw" title="ar:مصر">Egypt</a>. Since you uploaded this image and from the label you attached to it, I assumed that you own the rights to this photos and have placed a label accordingly. Please review and correct as needed.</p>
<p>After I came to leave this message I noticed the previous issues here with regard to rights to photos before. It's always good to put as much information in an image's page as possible. So please add to the one in commons all what you know.</p>
<p>I'm renewing <a href="../../../a/f/a/User_talk%7EAfanous_0198.html#Coptic_Christian_articles_for_Arabic_wikipedia.3F" title="User talk:Afanous">my request</a> to you to enrich the Arabic wikipedia with articles about Coptic Christianity.</p>
