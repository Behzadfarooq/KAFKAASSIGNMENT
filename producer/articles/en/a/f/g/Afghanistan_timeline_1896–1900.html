<p>In the fighting in <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kafiristan.html" title="Kafiristan">Kafiristan</a>, the <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghans</a> have captured twenty-five <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort.html" title="Fort">forts</a> at an admitted loss of 1,500 killed and wounded. In some of the valleys, however, the Kafirs still hold out, although many of the chiefs submit to the <i>amir</i> at the beginning of February. Soon after hostilities are resumed on the southern and eastern sides of Kafiristan, and nearly all the fertile portions are taken by the Afghan forces. In May the troops are ordered into the more inaccessible northwestern part, so as to complete the subjugation of the country. The <i>amir</i> treats the conquered people with leniency. Orders are issued forbidding <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slave</a> traffic in Kafirs, for it was alleged that after the victories in the Bashgal Valley at the beginning of the year certain captives were reduced to an atrocious form of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a>. The <i>amir</i> also gives orders to the Afghan officers to treat the Kafirs kindly, and not seek to convert them by force to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>.</p>

<p>Not for many years has Afghanistan been less disturbed than this year. Few tribal risings occur and the <i>amir</i> Abdor Rahman continues to express friendly relations with Britain. Yet there is a disquieting rumour that Russia is preparing to advance on Herat in certain eventualities, and that an experimental mobilization of Russian troops from <a href="../../../t/i/f/Tiflis.html" title="Tiflis">Tiflis</a> to Kushk (some sixty miles from Herat) was made at the close of the year.

<p>Rumours of contemplated aggression by Russia continue throughout the year, and are the source of much annoyance to the <i>amir</i> Abdor Rahman. He complains that the British government takes no interest in his distresses, and that whenever he has proposed some check upon Russian aggressions the government of India has made no response except the suggestion that Afghanistan might consent to the construction of <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway.html" title="Railway">railways</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telegraph.html" title="Telegraph">telegraphs</a> within her territories. From the Afghan point of view he declares that such concession will be impossible and only a step to ruin. For several years the <i>amir</i> has given much attention to increasing the efficiency of his army, and his regulars, backed by the tribes on the frontier, would be formidable against any invader of his territory. The <i>amir</i> has never departed from a purely defensive attitude, and under his treaty with England if an unprovoked attack was made upon him he could claim British help.</p>
<p>Trade with India is injured by the fiscal policy of the <i>amir</i>. Besides creating state monopolies with regard to several articles, he forbids the export of <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horses</a> to India and the import of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt.html" title="Salt">salt</a> therefrom.

<p>A successful operation is carried out against the <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madda.html" title="Madda">Madda</a> Khels in the Tochi Pass by a small column. Four Pathan towers are blown up by the troops, who meet with no opposition. This action was due to the refusal of the Khels to surrender certain ringleaders implicated in the Maizar outrage of 1897.</p>

<p>The <i>amir</i> Abdor Rahman <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publishes.html" title="Publishes">publishes</a> his <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a>, in which he complains that English policy in Afghan affairs has been inconstant and vacillating, and he urges the importance of direct diplomatic relations with Britain. He considers that England ought to give Afghanistan more of her confidence and more of her moral and material support, allowing him to annex all the territory of the independent Pathan tribes and to form a triple alliance with the neighbouring Muslim states, Persia and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. Also that Afghanistan ought to secure an outlet to the ocean and have a port for her own steamers at which to load and unload. He thinks that the policy of Afghanistan towards her two strong neighbours - England and Russia - should be friendly towards the one least aggressive, and hostile to the power wishing to pass through her country or interfere with her independence.</p>

<p>The commissioner of <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derajat.html" title="Derajat">Derajat</a>, W.R.H. Merk, meets some 500 Mahsud Waziris and announces to them the terms of the government. Payment of a fine of one 0.1 million is demanded, one half to be paid by November 25, otherwise the whole tribe would be <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blockade.html" title="Blockade">blockaded</a> from December 1. Dreading a blockade much more than a punitive expedition the Mahsuds agree to pay the fine and promise not to raid. The <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mullah.html" title="Mullah">mullah</a> Powindah, their fanatical leader, is personally assisting in the collection of the fine in December.</p>
