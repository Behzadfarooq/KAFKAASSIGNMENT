<p>Different members of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/War_on_Terrorism%7E_Allies_fc4d.html#Afghanistan" title="War on Terrorism: Allies">Coalition in Afghanistan</a> have undertaken different responsibilities in the creation of the ANA. All these various efforts are managed on the Coalition side by Combined Security Transition Command - Afghanistan (CSTC-A), a two-star level multi-national command headquartered in downtown Kabul. On the ANA side, as of July 2006 all training and education in the Army is managed and implemented by the newly-formed Afghan National Army Training Command (ANATC), a two-star command which reports directly to the Chief of the General Staff. All training centers and military schools are under ANATC HQ.</p>
<p>Individual <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_training.html" title="Basic training">basic training</a> is conducted primarily by Afghan National Army instructors and staff at ANATC's Kabul Military Training Center, situated on the eastern edge of the capital. The ANA are still supported, however, with various levels of CSTC-A oversight, mentorship, and assistance. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a> assists in the basic and advanced training of <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlisted.html" title="Enlisted">enlisted</a> recruits, and also runs the Drill Instructor School which produces new training NCOs for the basic training courses. A <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> Army advisory team oversees the training of officers for staff and platoon or company command in a combined commissioning/infantry officer training unit called the Officer Training Brigade, also located at the Kabul Military Training Center. OTB candidates in the Platoon and Company Command courses are usually older former militia and mujaheddin 'officers' with various levels of military experience. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> also conducts initial infantry officer training and commissioning at the Officer Candidate School. While OCS is administratively under OTB's control, it is kept functionally separate. OCS candidates are young men with little or no military experience. The British Army also conduct initial and advanced <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Commissioned_Officer_471a.html" title="Non-Commissioned Officer">Non-Commissioned Officer</a> training as well in a separate NCO Training Brigade. The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Forces_Land_Force_Command_bc18.html" title="Canadian Forces Land Force Command">Canadian Forces Land Force Command</a> (the Canadian <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">Army</a>) supervises the Combined Training Exercise portion of initial military training, where trainee soldiers, NCOs, and officers are brought together in field training exercises at the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platoon.html" title="Platoon">platoon</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Company_%28military_unit%29.html" title="Company (military unit)">company</a> and (theoretically) <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battalion.html" title="Battalion">battalion</a> levels to certify them ready for field operations. In the Regional Corps, line ANA battalions have attached Coalition <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embedded_Training_Teams_745f.html" title="Embedded Training Teams">Embedded Training Teams</a> that continue to mentor the battalion's leadership, and advise in the areas of intelligence, communications, fire support, logistics and infantry tactics.</p>
<p>Formal education and professional development is currently conducted at two main ANATC schools, both in Kabul. The National Military Academy of Afghanistan, located near the Kabul International Airport, is a four-year military university, which will produce degreed second lieutenants in a variety of military professions. NMAA's first cadet class entered its second academic year in spring 2006. A contingent of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Army_346d.html" title="Turkish Army">Turkish Army</a> military instructors jointly mentor the NMAA faculty and staff. The Command and General Staff College, located in south Kabul, prepares mid-level ANA officers to serve on brigade and corps staffs. <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> established the CGSC in early 2004, and a cadre of <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Army_282d.html" title="French Army">French Army</a> instructors continues to oversee operations at the school. A National Defence University will also be established at a potential site in northwest Kabul. Eventually all initial officer training (to include the NMAA) as well as the CGSC will be re-located to the new NDU facility.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_Afghanistan_bb8b.html" title="Military of Afghanistan">Military of Afghanistan</a> for further background on the History of the Armed forces of Afghanistan</p>
<p>Upon becoming president of Afghanistan, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamid_Karzai_9fff.html" title="Hamid Karzai">Hamid Karzai</a> set a goal of an army of 70,000 men by 2009. By January, 2003 just over 1,700 soldiers in five <i>kandaks</i> (Pashtun for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battalion.html" title="Battalion">battalion</a>) had completed the 10-week training course, and by June 2003 a total of 4,000 troops had been trained. Initial recruiting problems lay in the lack of cooperation from regional warlords and inconsistent international support. The problem of desertion dogged the force in its early days: in the summer of 2003, the desertion rate was estimated to be ten percent and in mid-March, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> estimate suggested that 3,000 soldiers had deserted.</p>
<p>Soldiers in the new army initially received $30 a month during training and $50 a month upon graduation, though pay for trained soldiers has since risen to $70. Some recruits were under 18 years of age and many could not read or write. Recruits who spoke only <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashto.html" title="Pashto">Pashto</a> experienced difficulty because instruction was given through interpreters who spoke <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dari.html" title="Dari">Dari</a>.</p>
<p>Growth continued, however, and the ANA had expanded to 5,000 trained soldiers by July of 2003. That month, approximately 1,000 ANA soldiers were deployed in the U.S-led <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Warrior_Sweep_dc4a.html" title="Operation Warrior Sweep">Operation Warrior Sweep</a>, marking the first major combat operation for Afghan troops.</p>

<p>The problems of desertion and difficult recruitment are reoccurring problems. Total manpower is at around 35,000 personnel and 3000 new personnel are being recruited each month. Facilities and capacity planning efforts are rapidly adjusting to significant increases in national recruiting efforts to meet manpower needs.</p>
<p>The basic unit in the Afghan National Army is the Battalion or Kandak, consisting of 600 troops. Although the vast majority is infantry, at least one mechanized and one tank Battalion have been formed; more may be planned. As of September <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, 28 of the 31 Afghan National Army Battalions were ready for combat operations and many had already participated in them. At least nine brigades are planned at this time, each consisting of six battalions.
