<p>This description of Command and Control within a US chain of command is incomplete at this time. It refers to Operation Enduring Freedom that includes some other "coalition" members, but is essentially American. However, there is also an expanding NATO structure that covers much of Afghanistan, including the Southern provinces that are the birth place of the Taliban and where the most serious fighting seen since 2001 took place in August and September 2006. This structure reports through the NATO chain of command, which in October 2006 formally took full responsibility for the whole of Afghanistan. CFC-A will disband after 30 Nov 06, and CJTF 76 has already joined the ISAF structure as large chunks of RC East. ComCJTF 76 now is also ComRCEast.</p>
<p>Many of the contingents listed in this article are part of the NATO ISAF rather than the US Operation Enduring Freedom. For example the British, Canadian and Dutch contingents in the South are NATO ISAF forces, rather than those of Operation Enduring Freedom. Some coalition units though, such as ground attack aircraft, support Operation Enduring Freedom, ISAF and the Provisional Reconstruction Teams.</p>
<p>The final completion of the transfer of authority from OEF to ISAF will in some ways not change coalition leadership realities much. The United States will remain dominant in the coalition structure, with a U.S. four-star general arriving to take command in early 2007. U.S. forces hunting the Taliban in eastern Afghanistan will also remain under U.S. control.</p>

<li>Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force</li>
</ul>
<p>This Task Force covers special operations missions across the country. Elements of nearly every major U.S. special operations unit have served in Afghanistan. Units that have deployed to Afghanistan in the past have included <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_Special_Forces_c910.html" title="U.S. Army Special Forces">U.S. Army Special Forces</a> teams, elements of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Rangers_4e36.html" title="United States Army Rangers">75th Ranger Regiment</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navy_Seals_be33.html" title="Navy Seals">Navy Seals</a>, units from the <a href="../../../1/6/0/160th_Special_Operations_Aviation_Regiment_3c5c.html" title="160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment">160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment</a>, squadrons from the Army's covert <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Force_6873.html" title="Delta Force">1st Special Forces Operational Detachment - Delta</a>, commonly known as Delta Force, and air commandos from the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Air_Force_Special_Operations_Command_9d0d.html" title="U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command">Air Force Special Operations Command</a>. <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Clandestine_Service_7558.html" title="National Clandestine Service">CIA paramilitary teams</a> also have served in Afghanistan.</p>

</ul>
<p>The 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division makes up the majority of Task Force Fury, which was supposed to replace Task Force Spartan, headed by the 3rd BCT, 10th Mountain Division. But the Pentagon delayed the return of the 3rd BCT to provide more combat power for an expected spring offensive . The two brigades will operate in the same area of eastern Afghanistan. The 4th BCT includes the following units:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>1st Battalion 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment (formerly 3-504)</li>
<li>2nd Battalion 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment (formerly 3-325)</li>
<li>4th Battalion 73rd Cavalry Regiment</li>
<li>2nd Battalion 321st Airborne Field Artillery Regiment</li>

</ul>
<p>The deployment is the division's third to Afghanistan since the Taliban government was overthrown in 2001. The 3rd BCT includes the following units:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Headquarters and Headquarters Company</li>
<li>1st Battalion 32nd Infantry Regiment</li>
<li>2nd Battalion 87th Infantry Regiment</li>
<li>3rd Squadron 71st Cavalry Regiment</li>

</ul>
<p>The entire 4th BCT was scheduled to deploy but the Pentagon revised that decision in December 2004. Instead, one battalion-sized task force consisting of an infantry battalion and attached fire-support, communications and logistics elements will deploy to assist transition of the coalition operations to the NATO International Security Assistance Force in southern Afghanistan. The non-deploying elements of the brigade will remain prepared to deploy within 15 days. According to a news relase from Fort Drum, New York, where the division is based, more than 1,000 soldiers from the 4th BCT have deployed to Afghanistan. The soldiers are expected to return to Fort Drum in spring 2007. The force, known as Task Force Boar, consists of elements of the following units:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>A reinforced battalion-sized element from 2nd Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment</li>
<li>5th Battalion, 25th Field Artillery Regiment</li>
<li>94th Brigade Support Battalion</li>
<li>3rd Squadron, 89th Cavalry Regiment</li>

<p>In 2002, the Italian Navy contributed to Operation Enduring Freedom, conducting patrols in the Indian Ocean and Italian Navy Harrier close support aircraft were made available to support ground forces. From its inception, Italy has been a contributor to ISAF. In 2003, The Italian Army ‘Task Force Nibbio’ undertook base protection duties at Salerno Forward Operating Base in south east Afghanistan. <a href="http://www.difesa.it/Operazioni+Militari/operazioni-concluse/Mare+Arabico+-+ENDURING+FREEDOM/notizie_teatro_dettaglio.htm?DetailID=3633" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.difesa.it/Operazioni+Militari/operazioni-concluse/Mare+Arabico+-+ENDURING+FREEDOM/notizie_teatro_dettaglio.htm?DetailID=3633" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/sep2003/a092203h.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/sep2003/a092203h.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

<p>The 173rd Airborne Brigade will deploy to Afghanistan beginning in spring 2007. Based in Vicenza, Italy, the brigade was scheduled to deploy to Iraq but the Pentagon changed the deployment to maintain the current level of forces in anticipation of a spring offensive by the Taliban. This deployment affects approximately 3,200 personnel, and the brigade will replace the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, which was recently extended for up to 120 days.</p>

<p>The paratroopers from the 4th BCT, along with the 82nd Airborne headquarters staff and various unidentified support units, will be a part of a deployment of about 11,000 soldiers.</p>
<ul>
<li>218th Brigade Combat Team, South Carolina Army National Guard</li>
</ul>
<p>The 218th BCT will deploy to Afghanistan to train the Afghan National Security Forces, beginning in early 2007. The deployment will include 1,500 service members.
