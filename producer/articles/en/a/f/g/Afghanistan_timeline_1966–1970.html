<p>The first <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five-year_plan.html" title="Five-year plan">five-year plan</a>, begun in 1956, aimed at encouraging <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrigation.html" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a>. Experience showed, however, that progress in these spheres could only be partially achieved as long as internal communications remained primitive and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_resources.html" title="Natural resources">natural resources</a> of the country were largely unexplored. As a result, the major effort was diverted to the construction of <a href="../../../r/o/a/Road.html" title="Road">roads</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport.html" title="Airport">airports</a>, and to the systematic investigation of sources of <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a> supply and of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mineral.html" title="Mineral">mineral</a> wealth.</p>
<p>During the course of the second five-year plan, conditions became favourable for almost unchecked advances along a wide economic front. Promising deposits of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_gas.html" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> and of <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a> ore were discovered; the power available for <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industry.html" title="Industry">industrial</a> use was multiplied many times; and the extension of <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrigation.html" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> led to substantially increased agricultural production.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, as in many other underdeveloped countries, however, this rapid success led to the emergence of new problems unforeseen in the original planning: <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflation.html" title="Inflation">inflation</a> of prices, difficulties over foreign exchange, and an unhealthy reliance on large-scale external aid for the easing of current domestic shortages. The indications are that the third five-year plan will aim mainly at consolidating what has already been achieved rather than at any new major advances.</p>

<p>The first <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">parliament</a> created under the new democratic constitution adjourns for the winter recess. Its relations with the Maiwandwal cabinet were close and cordial, and it gave full support to the government's efforts to achieve national financial stability. Drastic cuts were made in government expenditure and, due to an agreement with the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Monetary_Fund_2655.html" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>, the country is able to face with confidence the completion of the second five-year plan and the beginning in May 1967 of the third five-year plan.</p>

<p>Among the difficulties that Afghanistan, together with other developing countries, faces is the shortage of local <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investment.html" title="Investment">investment</a> capital. Accordingly, the government offers considerable inducements in the third five-year plan to investors in the private sector. Capital goods for approved industries can be imported free; there is an income-tax holiday for three years after production started; and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Import.html" title="Import">import</a> <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tariff.html" title="Tariff">tariffs</a> on a protective scale are to shelter locally produced goods from foreign competition. These measures are designed to minimize direct government participation in the sphere of light industry, so that funds can be made available for the completion of projects begun during the second plan and for additional investment in heavy industry. During 1967 about 131 development projects are underwritten at a cost of 5 billion afghanis. These fall into three main groups: <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mining.html" title="Mining">mines</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industry.html" title="Industry">industry</a>; <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrigation.html" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>; and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telecommunication.html" title="Telecommunication">communications</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_services.html" title="Social services">social services</a>. But in general, emphasis is placed on consolidation. A major objective of the government is to reduce by degrees excessive dependence upon foreign aid for national development. This is likely to take some time, particularly since such aid is readily available from the U.S.S.R., the United States, and the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bank_2c67.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>, to say nothing of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Germany_9d9b.html" title="West Germany">West Germany</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>. Additional assistance in such projects as match manufacture, tanning, shoe manufacture, and furniture making comes from <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. All this does not change the traditional Afghan determination to treat other nations as friends but not as masters, and to retain complete control over domestic and foreign policies. An example of this is the vesting of the new internal air services linking Kabul with many formerly remote areas in the official Afghan Air Authority. Relations with Pakistan ease further, along with an increase in trade.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Maiwandwal resigns for health reasons, the king asking <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_Yaqta_f7aa.html" title="Abdullah Yaqta">Abdullah Yaqta</a>, minister of state, to assume the premiership ad interim pending the formation of a new government. Maiwandwal's resignation is widely regretted, since he is looked upon as one of the main architects of the new Afghanistan. He successfully concluded the second five-year development plan and launched the third; he won national confidence in the 1964 constitution, which liberalized the political structure of the country; his visits abroad strengthened Afghanistan's international position and its traditional policy of friendship without involvement. He eased relations with Pakistan and gave a new impetus to the growth of trade between the two countries. Only a few days after Maiwandwal's resignation, the king takes the final step to complete the structure of the government as contemplated in the 1964 constitution by inaugurating the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_35ae.html" title="Supreme Court">Supreme Court</a>.

<p>In domestic affairs the year is marked by a thorough overhaul of the judicial system by the new Supreme Court; this involves reorganizing the powers and functions of the lower courts in line with the requirements of the constitution. In economic affairs the policies laid down in 1967 for encouraging investors in the private sector by substantial inducements - <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_holiday.html" title="Tax holiday">tax holidays</a>, free import of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_goods.html" title="Capital goods">capital goods</a>, and protective tariffs – are continued. Government investment is again directed to the completion of projects begun under the second development plan and to the encouragement of heavy industry. The emphasis is again on consolidation rather than on beginning new projects, and on the gradual replacement of foreign aid by increased exploitation of national resources.</p>

<p>Domestically, the year is one of quiet administrative and economic progress. The division of powers among the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary laid down in the 1964 constitution, although virtually completed in 1968, entails much detailed work in its precise application to existing institutions. This is especially true in the judicial field, where the structure and functions of the lower courts, previously shaped largely by tradition, are found to need considerable alteration. The changes necessitated in this, as in other branches of the administration, are effected with little friction, due to the popularity of the prime minister and to the steady support which he receives from the king.</p>
<p>In the economic field, the policy of mobilizing local resources to replace by degrees the massive foreign aid furnished by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. continues in accordance with Afghan determination to avoid undue dependence on external help. The main difficulty lies in the shortage of capital for investment in the private sector; and in spite of the inducements proffered by the government growth is slow.</p>
<p>In foreign affairs, the traditional Afghan desire to preserve complete autonomy regardless of external aid and to maintain friendly relations with other countries remains dominant. <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>'s desire for close relations is shown by a visit from Prime Minister <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indira_Gandhi_d446.html" title="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> and by Indian aid in the restoration of the Bamiyan antiquities. Relations with Pakistan and with its new government after the fall of President <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Ayub_Khan_2c2c.html" title="Mohammad Ayub Khan">Mohammad Ayub Khan</a> are correct rather than cordial because of continued Afghan support for the promotion of <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakhtunistan.html" title="Pakhtunistan">Pakhtunistan</a>. This support again becomes vocal when the Pakistan government incorporates the states of <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dir.html" title="Dir">Dir</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swat%2C_Pakistan_6c92.html" title="Swat, Pakistan">Swat</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chitral.html" title="Chitral">Chitral</a>, hitherto domestically autonomous, into the administrative structure of West Pakistan, in accordance, it is claimed, with the wishes of the states' peoples. The resulting resentment in Afghanistan does not last, and the country's policy of friendly neutrality toward both the Communist and non-Communist worlds continues smoothly.</p>

<p>Afghanistan holds its second free parliamentary election since the introduction of the constitution in 1964, with candidates standing for the 216 seats of the House of the People and for one-third of the House of Elders. Many conservative local landowners who have shunned the first election campaign for office and win seats. Often they win at the expense of more liberal, national-minded incumbents; the new parliament, thus, is more conservative than the previous one. Since political parties were not legalized in time for the elections, most of the candidates are men of local prominence again chosen for their personal prestige rather than their political views. Turnout is much higher than in 1965, but still only about 50%; except in times of national crisis political life is so highly localized that interest in central institutions remains minimal, although in Kabul and its environs live broadcasts of the proceedings in Parliament, which result in the confirmation (as required by the 1964 constitution) of Prime Minister Nur Ahmad Etemadi and his new cabinet, attract large crowds of listeners.</p>

<p>Progress in establishing a modern type of administration throughout the country to replace traditional tribal institutions is steady rather than spectacular. The personal popularity of the king and his firm support of the prime minister ensures growing respect for the central government, but this does not prevent occasional outbreaks of severe intertribal hostilities. An important factor in the modernizing process to which the king has committed himself is the steady improvement of communications with the outside world. Several international airlines call regularly at Kabul, and the road from the capital to the <a href="../../../k/h/y/Khyber_Pass_793b.html" title="Khyber Pass">Khyber Pass</a> carries increasingly heavy traffic in both directions. The <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourist_industry.html" title="Tourist industry">tourist industry</a> receives a great impetus both from the erection on the road between Kabul and <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paghman.html" title="Paghman">Paghman</a> of a luxury hotel with spectacular views, and from the readiness with which the Afghan diplomatic posts in many countries grant tourist visas. External communications are stimulated by a marked improvement in relations with Pakistan. The Afghan government shows increasing interest in the economic success of the Regional Cooperation for Development program (RCD), which is being vigorously pursued by Pakistan, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>, and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>; a visit to Kabul by the Pakistan finance minister, Nawab Mozaffar Ali Khan Qizilbash, leads to a scheme for technical aid in the fields of irrigation, seeds, and fertilizers to help Afghanistan achieve agricultural self-sufficiency as part of its policy of decreasing its reliance on external aid.</p>
