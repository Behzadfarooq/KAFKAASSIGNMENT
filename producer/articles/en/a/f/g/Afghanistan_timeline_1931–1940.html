<p>Towards the end of the month the new Fundamental Rules of the Afghan government are promulgated in an issue of the <i>Islah</i> of Kabul. These declare Afghanistan to be completely independent both in external and internal affairs, with Kabul for its capital. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> is to be the religion of the country, and the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Sharia</a> (Islamic law) is to be binding.

Early in November he is arrested on a charge of fomenting rebellion among the tribes of the southeast among whom his family has great influence, and of intriguing with the Soviet government, with a view to procuring the restoration of King Amanullah. He is brought to trial before the <a href="../../../l/o/y/Loya_Jirga_e119.html" title="Loya Jirga">Loya Jirga</a>, or Great Assembly, early in November, and, incriminating documents being produced, he is condemned to death and shot. One of his brothers, Gholam Jilani Khan, who recently returned from Moscow, is also arrested, and another, Gholam Zaddiq Khan, who was minister in Berlin, is dismissed from his post. The king's brother, Sardar Shah Mahmud, takes energetic steps to combat disaffection in the south, where one or two pretenders have appeared.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the month a "Crazy Fakir" appears in the <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khost.html" title="Khost">Khost</a> district in the south of Afghanistan, proclaiming that the ex-king <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanullah.html" title="Amanullah">Amanullah</a> will soon arrive. At his instigation a number of tribesmen take up arms with the intention of marching on Kabul, and they receive considerable reinforcements from the Wazir and Mahsud tribes across the Indian border. They meet the government troops which were sent south to oppose them in the neighbourhood of Matun, and some sharp fighting takes place at the end of February and beginning of March. The tribesmen from across the border then begin to withdraw at the bidding of some of their elders who were sent by the British authorities to recall them, and the rising soon comes to an end. Later in the year one of the ringleaders, Tor Malang, is executed with some of his associates, but the "Crazy Fakir," who fled abroad, is allowed to return with the assurance of a free pardon, on account of his advanced age.</p>

<p>King <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadir_Shah_d6d0.html" title="Nadir Shah">Nadir Shah</a> is assassinated at a school prize-giving in the courtyard of the palace. The assassin proves to be a servant of <a href="../../../y/u/s/Yusufzai.html" title="Yusufzai">Yusufzai</a> Sardar Ali Gholam Nabi Khan, who was executed for conspiracy and treason exactly a year previously, and his motive was to revenge his master. He is executed along with a number of his associates on December 22. Nadir Shah reigned for just over four years, during which time he laboured chiefly to instil into his subjects a desire for national unity and for peaceful progress in the arts of civilization. The success of his policy is demonstrated by the fact that his assassination has no political repercussions. His son, <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahir_Shah_df9c.html" title="Zahir Shah">Zahir Shah</a>, a youth of 19, is immediately proclaimed king, and receives the allegiance of his three uncles, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sardar_Mohammad_Hashim_Khan_6b82.html" title="Sardar Mohammad Hashim Khan">Sardar Mohammad Hashim Khan</a>, the prime minister, Sardar Faiz Mohammad Khan, the minister for foreign affairs, and Shah Mahmud Khan, the minister of war, and of the rest of the ministry, the Ulemas, and the tribal leaders. Kabul soon resumes its wonted aspect and the rest of the country remains perfectly quiet. One of the new king's first acts is to pardon Ghulam Dastgir, the Kotkai pretender, who had given a good deal of trouble earlier in the year and who now transfers his allegiance from Amanullah to Zahir Shah.</p>

This movement is the result of an agitation carried on for some months in Waziristan by one Syed Mohammad Sadi, commonly known as the Shami Pir (Syrian imam), a priest from Damascus whose family is connected with the ex-king Amanullah. A rebellion breaks out in southeast Afghanistan, headed by the Suleiman khel, and the number of the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insurgent.html" title="Insurgent">insurgents</a> soon rises to 2,000. The government, which has been watching the activities of the Shami Pir, is not taken unawares, and quickly sends to the scene of the disturbances two brigades with ten aeroplanes, which are soon after reinforced by two more brigades. The insurgents are defeated in two battles on June 22 and 24, and the revolt soon comes to an end.</p>
