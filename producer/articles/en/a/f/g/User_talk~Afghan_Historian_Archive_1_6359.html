<p>-Thanks for asking Khoikoi. I'm pretty lazy when edit and am caught up in writing to a point that I forget to sign in or cite myself. I'm making a habit of going back and inserting my user and writing edits being signed in, rather than signed out.

<p>Hey Afghan Historian, Welcome! I just noticed an edit by an anonymous user on an archived discussion who signed your username. This may have been you, since you say above that you have been going back and signing things. The problem with that is that Wikipedia has had the problem before of users impersonating other users, especially in controversial topics such as issues in the Middle East. It's much safer if you sign in and then "sign" all your comments by putting in ~~~~ in the markup, which comes up as a stamp of your username and the time you posted it. This is far more difficult to impersonate, because even I could put in <a href="../../../a/f/g/User%7EAfghan_Historian_d035.html" title="User:Afghan Historian">User:Afghan Historian</a>, and I know nothing about hacking. Also, it's better to respond to things from the archive on the current talk page, perhaps by copying and pasting the comment you are responding to. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Makemi</a> 19:35, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>-Thanks Makemi. I'll remember that. -[[<a href="../../../a/f/g/User%7EAfghan_Historian_d035.html" title="User:Afghan Historian">Afghan Historian</a> 04:10, 22 January 2006 (UTC)]]</p>

<p>I think that whole argument is somewhat pointless and it's somewhat subjective in scope. On the one hand, "race" is kind of going out and regional genetics taking its place which links various people together in a chain all over the world with various types found in one place or another. In addition, the extreme view would probably be that the Ethiopians do not have any West Asian ancestry which is nonsense as they clearly share many genes with Arabian populations. Then the other extreme is to overempasize this issue. I'm not sure what I can contribute though as the page looks okay and the debate sounds like it will only end up devolving into some shouting match over the 'Caucasianness' of one group over another. Might be better left alone at this point. The Somali page which I worked didn't include any debate over race so much as a general physical type and with whom the Somalis are related. I think it's better to just leave it at that. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 19:06, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That is a complicated question (as is everything else in that region). There was certainly the Indian and Buddist influence in Afghanistan. And many of the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barmakids.html" title="Barmakids">Barmakids</a> were of Buddha's faith originally. So you even had the influence in Iran as well.</p>
<p>Im not exactly sure I fully understand your question though. But you may want to ask <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">User:Tajik</a>.

<dd>Afghanistan is deffinitly Iranian - by language and by culture. Of course, Indian and Iranian cultures are related. But since the advent of Islam, Iranian culture has become a part of the Islamic world. 90+ % of Afghanistan are native Iranian-speakers, 60+% being Persian-speakers and 30% Pashto-speakers (some ethnic Pashtun families have become Persian by language). The region today know as "Afghanistan" was part of "Greater Khorasan" in the past and thus, the birthplace of modern Persian language and culture. Of course, there is a lot of modern Indian influence in Afghanistan (Indian movies, music, clothing, etc) ... but all in one, Afghanistan is Iranian. -<a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tajik</a> 00:16, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hadn't really given it any thought regarding Afghanistan's cultural position, but I have long viewed it as an Iranian domain. The region/country that overlaps between the Indo-Aryan and Iranian civilizations is Pakistan, a place I've travelled to, and not Afghanistan which is Iranian with a large Turkic minority. Although I think the Pashto-speaking population is probabaly higher than the 30% figure Tajik gave you as it's at least 35% and will probably be higher once more Pashtun refugees return to Afghanistan which is possible. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 21:28, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Tajik means pure Pashtun, i.e. those not overlapping with the Persian linguistic sphere. Many speak both. My guess though.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 11:12, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I personally think the people there are both right. Azeris are Turkic, but they are Iranian too. It is an established fact that pre-14th century Azeri language was not even Turkic. And besides, the origin of the Iranians themselves was Central Asia (as has been stipulated in the <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avesta.html" title="Avesta">Avesta</a>), and not the "Fars" region in today's south Iran which they later partially migrated to.</p>
<p>I think what some editors are so afraid of is that "Turkic" is (incorrectly) being identified with Turkey (and hence Turkish).</p>
<p>For Scythian,</p>
<p>In Persian, we say Sakkaa, and the mythical heroes of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahnama.html" title="Shahnama">Shahnama</a> (the Ilyad of Persian literature) were all from Sakestan or Sajestan.</p>
<p>But anyway, regarding sources, usually anything that <a href="http://www.iranica.com" class="external text" title="http://www.iranica.com" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia Iranica</a> says, I take at face value and accept fully.</p>
<p>But there are some other sources too you can touch bases on: <a href="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/scyth1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/scyth1.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/Scythian.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/Scythian.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<p>His ethnicity is without a doubt Persian, while his nationality was Indian. That's pretty much the end of it. In addition to konwing something about his musical background, I saw an episode of Biography on him which identified him as an ethnic Persian, but not Iranian. Calling him Iranian in the modern context is a bit of a stretch and doesn't really make any sense. As for how people identify themselves, it clearly varies. For some people their ethnic allegiance means more to them than any national one etc. I don't know if Freddie Mercury identified himself as Iranian, I only know that he did identify himself as a Persian which Parsis generally do since they have intermarried and kept to themselves for centuries until very recently. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 18:21, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, the only thing I've inherited from all that mouthful of names in my family is an <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agate.html" title="Agate">agate</a> ring, which was the personal property of Shirazi. And considering the 40 or so cousins I have in my family, it is lucky I even got that much. So in that respect, Im ordinary just like everyone else. I get by with student loans whenever I can, and I work for a pitiful 1600$ a month salary as a research assistant, living off of TacoBell and McDonalds. But I dont complain. Things could be worse. My dad was the one who got things easy (a paid for Ivy League education and all). But for me, it never came easy: I have to work my ass off just like the rest of the noble creatures of this abode.</p>
<p>As for my grandfather who was a colonel of the Shah, he retired before the revolution, which made him immune to any political persecution by the revolutionaries. Thats why he stayed in Iran until he died in 94. Otherwise, if you were in the Shah's Army and ranked, chances are, the revolution would have not treated you well. Either execution, or imprisonment.</p>
<p>Hence many high positioned people fled to the US. An exodus.</p>
<p>And thats why you keep running into all these "high class from old govt" types.</p>
<p>All Ive ever cared about in my life is being close to a top academic library, and being free of illness and malady in health. The rest is just parentheses.</p>
<p>Besides, you should be proud. Pakis are smart people. At least you guys had Abdus-salam, a Nobel laureate. We persians never got one, being so hedonistic and all. God those L.A.

<p>Thanks for the note on my talkpage. Well Freddie was a pretty complex personality. Even though he was born in Zanzibar and spent much of his early life in India, it seems he had no particular love for either of the countries, let alone Iran. Bottom line is that he considered himself to be British other than any thing else. He rarely commented on his early life. As for his ethnicity, i believe the story of "Freddie taking pride in Persian/Iranian roots" is purely concocted as no biography mentions it. Indian Parsis are ofcourse an endogamous communtiy of 8th century Zoroastrian immigrants from Persia, but over course of time, they have sort of assimilated in Indian culture. Granted that they look more fair, but same holds true for numerous Indian communitites especially the Gujaratis and Sindhis who primarily resided in area traditionaly dwelt by Parsis. To paraphrase in the words of Freddie's childhood friend (also a Parsi) Geeta Choksi (When asked whether she felt Persian or Indian in the Freddie Mercury - A Definative Biography)</p>
<p><i>"What rubbish, ofcourse i feel Indian. I may be exotic to say that 'I am Persian' but we were hounded out of Persia a long time ago'"</i></p>
<p>I think Indian Parsi sums it all. If any reader in interested then he may go to the main article for more info. Anyways i dont think Freddie's ethnicity should be central to the article but if people are going to refer to him as Persian or Iranian on Wikipedia then same would hold true for people like Rajiv Gandhi and Tatas and Birlas (which i daresay our Indian nationalists will not be able to stomach). <a href="../../../e/n/g/Image%7EEngland_flag_large.png_aa3a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/4a/England_flag_large.png/20px-England_flag_large.png" alt="" width="20" height="10" longdesc="../../../e/n/g/Image%7EEngland_flag_large.png_aa3a.html" /></a> <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAMbroodEY_dc79.html" title="User:AMbroodEY">अमेय आर्यन DaBroodey</a> <a href="../../../i/n/d/Image%7EIndia_flag_large.png_efcd.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6c/India_flag_large.png/20px-India_flag_large.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../i/n/d/Image%7EIndia_flag_large.png_efcd.html" /></a> 13:27, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article's become way too long and is often redundant (i.e. the disputed border claim with Afghanistan). Also the terminology has gone from academic to the usage of subjective terminology such as 'great' etc. The smart thing to do is to shorten parts of the article so that links can provide readers with more information, rather than repeating information found in in-depth articles. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 01:01, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, it's all a myth created by Khomeini's enemies to make him and his ideas seem 'foreign'. he's most definitely not even remotely Sikh and his grandfather's family moved to India for a time and then his grandfather returned to Iran. That doesn't make him Indian. It's all made-up. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 21:42, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Certainly no offense taken, and thanks for filling me in. For the record I got involved on the Iranian music page after formatting it and didn't previously know much about any of this, but my main problem was this: a link to a BBC news article was removed from a page, and only opinions were given to support its removal. A supplied link (on a talk page) to an article at Brian May's site was broken. As a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>, verified info on Wikipedia (referencing a BBC article definitely qualifies) must be legitmately unverified, not removed by those who cannot prove their knowledge is sourced, or not the product of original research. I think it would be proper for information about the mistake (especially as it seems to be quite a common misconception) to be included in the article, along with evidence, eg a working link directly to the relevant piece on May's website. FM does seem to be revered by Iranians, no matter how tenuous his claims to Iranian / Persian / Parsi etc. ancestry.

<p>Hello. Don't worry, my page is just archived because it was too long. I read some of Lawrence's work and it's my impression that Lawrence's actions were to help the Arabs, but he was manipulated and used by his superiors who were afterall imperialists. The British are responsible for what happened in Israel/Palestine, but this was after Lawrence who did not envision or intend for things to unfold as they did since he argued for Arab indepedence. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 18:09, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
