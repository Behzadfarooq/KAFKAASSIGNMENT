<p>Question 1) are you an IP or a registered user? Your question was signed as a registered user but the edit history shows it coming from IP 65.101.173.61. I will answer to both. I rv'd the content simply because of the way it was worded...<b>He was also supposed to have been a fan of Indian singing diva Lata Mangeshkar, although he never personally confirmed this. Traces of her influence can be seen on his album A Night at the Opera.</b>...violates several rules including <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">WP:AWW</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>(the last one being the most important).

<p>I was never really religious but always had an interest in them. Recently I had the opportunity to attend at Zoroastrian meetings and really liked what I learnt about it. I had my Sedre pooshi two weeks ago where I accepted it as my faith. I know Parsi conservatives do not accept converts but thats not the case with the Iranian Zoroastrians as they are basically coming back to their faith. I hope this clears things up --<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKashk_e250.html" title="User:Kashk"><b>- K a s h</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/s/User_talk%7EKashk_0fc5.html" title="User talk:Kashk">Talk</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Kashk" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Kashk" rel="nofollow">email</a></sup> 08:37, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, As you mentioned that you are a Panjabi Pashtun, let me correct you here that eigther you could be a Pashtun or Panjabi at one time - I will never suggest you to get ride on the back of two horses at the same time by contributing any fake article which nowhere exist! You had also mentioned that your mother is Pashtun but didn't signify your father? Well I have seen as your nick like Afghan Historian, you must be a Pashtun then! I have dozens and dozens of classic collections of books regarding Pashtuns, including my personal observations aswell, but believe me have never found like Panjabi Pashtun in any form. Yes this is another thing that Pashtun People would have adopted the Panjabi culture and language in some areas of Panjab but again even then Panjabis would not reckoned them as Panjabis and Pashtun dosn't like it also to be called Panjabi! Because creation of any nation is not an overnight game, it takes centuries through evolutionary period. If you have forgotten your language and culture that dosn't makes any difference but for that you will have to be a acquisitive to get back your language and culture. I hope you would have got my point. Thanks. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaider_3cec.html" title="User:Haider">Haider</a> 17:11, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If your father is Pashtun then you should have considered yourself a Pashtun, nevertheless as I have mentioned before, if your forefathers had forgotten their culture and mother tongue Pashto and adopted Panjabi would never count you as Panjabi, I will reiteriate, for that you will have to adopt atleast Pashto language to become a proper Pashtun, that's totally depends on your will now - I hope you will love to learn Pashto as it was the language of your great ancestors. Sorry for that I am not using a term "Pathan" for Pashtun, that was an intentional sin bieng thrust on Pashtuns by outsiders for their own incentives/targets/goals etc, just had tried to divide pashtuns and then rule. It is great if you can speak Panjabi so fluently but what price are you paying for it, in form of to lost your own real language? Kindly do not mix the two races by termed them as Panjabi Pashtuns, there are so many Pashtuns even in NWFP who can chat in Hindko also but that dosn't mean those Pashtuns would become of some another race, while there mother tongue is Pashto and they do chat in Pashto amongst themsleves. If you have full command on English or Panjabi then why not Pashto also or is it the only language in the world that you don't want to speak, despite it is your own language and you could'nt deny that! I will be with you with your Peshawar article. Thanks <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaider_3cec.html" title="User:Haider">Haider</a> 21:20, 17 May 2006</dd>

<p>You can also called me as Haider Pashtun. I really got happy to hear that you are a proud Pashtun and would like to get your language back, probably it may take some time but very possible to acquired, and why not because your ancestors were Pashtuns. There are countless books available for basic Pashto, sorry if am emphasizing much for Pashto but believe me I love my language so feel helpless in this case. I will feel happy to join you in your Peshawar article, which is already an impressive and informative collection and hope that would be a great one after some amendments.

<p>I noticed your citation and thought it was good. The edit war that's happening now is not new. It has been a debate on that page for a long time. Rather than constant rv'ing the article. All editors who have differing opinions should make a <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERFM_dd02.html" title="WP:RFM">Wikipedia request for mediation</a> to settle a disagreement that has gone on wat too long.
