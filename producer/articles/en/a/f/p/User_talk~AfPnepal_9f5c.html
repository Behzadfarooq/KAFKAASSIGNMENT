	    <p>Alliance for Peace – Nepal (afpnepal) Lazimpat, Kathmandu, PO Box 4269 [www.afpnepal.org]</p>
<p>Introduction: The Alliance for Peace is a non-profit, non-partisan, non-government organization working for a peaceful and democratic Nepal. Alliance for Peace was established in 2003 by a group of like-minded students and youths who saw the need for peace in a country being torn apart by violence and conflict. Now, the organization is made up of a team of dedicated professionals, youth and student leaders. Alliance for Peace targets youth and students because we believe that students and youths are in a maturing and learning stage of life, so their minds and way of thinking are still open and malleable and can be influenced and guided in the correct path. The Alliance for Peace works actively for good governance and the preservation of Human Rights. It also aims to help build a society that is free from crime, conflict and violence against humanity. The Alliance works through advocacy, research, support, capacity building and workshops and forums.</p>
<p>Past Activities: Ever since its inception, the Alliance for Peace has had a substantial history of working among the students and youths. Due to resource constraints and considering the urgent need of the situation, the Alliance’s activities till date has been more focused on the youth groups. The Alliance has carried out all the activities till date out of its own resources. Each year on September 11, the Alliance for Peace has held commemoration service to remind people of the terrors facing the world and the global impact of terrorism and to spread the message of peace. Also every year on August 6, Hiroshima Day, the Alliance has held commemorative services to remind people that war and violence against mankind is not the answer and the only real solution to global harmony is peace. In 2004, the Alliance conducted a program entitled “Crisis in Democracy and Role of Youth”. The Alliance also conducted an interaction program with young journalists entitled “Role of Media in Peace Building”. The Alliance has also held several training programs on skills for political campaigning.</p>
<p>Ongoing Activities: After the Royal takeover of February 1, 2005, the Alliance for Peace has worked actively to gather information about individuals, primarily student and youth activists, arrested and held by the State. This is because the Alliance feels that the students are the one with the least safeguard and representation. The Alliance has then disseminated this information to national and international Human Rights organizations. Members of the Alliance has visited and given moral support to the arrested student activists. AfP Nepal has also filed Habeas Corpus petitions at the Supreme Court against the arbitrary arrests of these individuals under false accusations by the State. Currently, the Alliance for Peace is conducting a year long program entitled “Loktantrik Bahas (Democratic Discussions) – A Forum for Democracy”. In this forum, the Alliance invites 40-50 students as participants and a renowned and respected figure delivers his views on relevant socio-political issues and then there is an open floor session during which the participants raise questions and issues on which they disagree or which they don’t understand. The objective behind this forum is to create a culture of dialogue amongst the students and youth in Nepal. AfP feels that students and youths should be given guidance and made capable not only through education in the literal sense but through a better understanding of the various facets of the society that they live in, be it political, social or economic. An interactive discussion forum helps them grow in more ways than just formal education. The Alliance is also conducting a survey to study the human rights situation in schools and colleges. The Alliance is also in the final stages of talks with the Embassy of Finland and the OHCHR, to conduct a long term program to raise awareness and sensitize students’ leaders about human rights. In mid July, the Alliance conducted a conference on “Education and Conflict: Identifying Problems and Determining Solutions”. The Alliance has also started an advocacy campaign to raise and deliver the demands and aspirations of the students and youth for the Constituent Assembly and is making plans to conduct a convention of the students and youth for the documentation of their demands and aspirations for the Constituent Assembly and the New Nepal to follow.
