<p>I agree: The departments of the AFL-CIO are largely autonomous, and each has a great deal of control over its jurisdictional areas. For example: The disaffiliation of the Carpenters union in 2000 led to a major dispute within the Building Trades Dept. in which the larger AFL-CIO was unable to participate or resolve. The dispute led, in part, to the larger debate over the role of the AFL-CIO in 2004-2005. The disaffiliation of the Operating Engineers from the Building Trades in 2006 continues to reverberate, and may well impact the entire AFL-CIO as well as the Change to Win labor organization. Additionally, these departments establish major contractual, jurisdictional and organizationl structures which have a significant impact on American industry. Merging them would be akin to merging Library of Congress into an article on Congress. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim1965_7d40.html" title="User:Tim1965">Tim1965</a> 18:03, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This section isn't really well explained and the articles given are very biased. I think that until we have more general iformation about AFL-CIO policies, these claims should be removed.</p>
<p>== Role in Destabilizing Democratically elected Venezuelan government == ===2002=== In Venezuela, the AFL-CIO's Solidarity Center worked with and funded what it called the "flagship organizations" behind illegal, company-initiated lockouts of oil workers and the failed coup against the democratically elected government of Hugo Chavez. See www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?sectionID=19&amp;itemID=8268 and http://www.counterpunch.org/barahona10222005.html Role in Destabilizing Democratically elected Haitian government ===2004=== In June 2006 an American Labor Magazine, Labor Notes, documented the role that the ORIT, ICFTU, ILO, and the AFL-CIO's Solidarity Center played in supporting a destabilization campaign waged against Haiti's elected Aristide government. The Solidarity Center ignored and failed to investigate massive labor persecution against public sector workers and trade unionist supporters of the ousted government throughout 2004, 2005, and 2006.

<p>So is the AFL-CIO an international organization or is a US organization? The article is confusing and seemingly contradictory about this. The first sentence (after my copy-edits) says that the AFL-CIO is "the largest federation of unions in the United States", but then says "made up of 53 national and international unions" and later the article says "The AFL-CIO is a federation of international labor unions". -<a href="../../../p/g/a/User%7EPgan002_fb49.html" title="User:Pgan002">Pgan002</a> 07:05, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The AFL-CIO is not a truly internaional organization. 'International unions' in America are really large American unions that have locals in Canada. As a national labour federation, the AFL-CIO only has influence over the American unions, but the American unions often have varying degrees of control over the Canadian sections. Canada also has a national labour fed, the Canadian Labour Congress, which most of the unions affiliate with as well. If I remember, I'll wikify the mention of international and write up a quickie explanation page. --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrigaux_3a56.html" title="User:Crigaux">Crigaux</a> 16:14, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"International" is a standard term in the North American labor movement to describe what is essentially the national union, compared to a Local, Joint Council or regional body. Yes, most of the "international" unions only have membership in Canada and Puerto Rico, and although that does technically makes them international, it is something of a misnomer. It's a standard term in the community nonetheless, and to use anything else would be a bit revisionist. --Poppopbang 13:12, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FAST was dissolved as a constitutional department of the AFL-CIO following the disaffiliation of UFCW and UNITE-HERE and subsequent creation of Change to Win. It now operates as a non-profit called <a href="http://www.fast-raa.com" class="external text" title="http://www.fast-raa.com" rel="nofollow">FAST-RAA</a> and does the same work for the same people (both Change to Win and AFL-CIO unions).
