	    <p>The <b>AFL-NFL Merger</b> of 1970 involved the merger of the two major professional <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> leagues in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> during the time: the <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a></i> (NFL) and the <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Football_League_76b2.html" title="American Football League">American Football League</a></i> (AFL). It came as a result of an intense competitive war between the two leagues. The merger paved the way for the combined league, which retained the "National Football League" name and logo, to become one of the most popular and powerful sports leagues in America. This event is often referred to as the beginning of the modern era of professional American football.</p>

<p>After its inception in 1920, the NFL fended off several rival leagues. Prior to 1960, the most important rival was the <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="All-America Football Conference">All-America Football Conference</a></i> (AAFC), which began play in 1946. The AAFC differed from the NFL in several ways, and the AAFC's perennial champions—the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Browns_d021.html" title="Cleveland Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>— were considered to be the best team in professional football during that time.</p>
<p>However, due to the AAFC's poor financial situation, it disbanded after the 1949 season. Three of its teams, the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Colts_%281947-50%29_2ca5.html" title="Baltimore Colts (1947-50)">Baltimore Colts</a>, Cleveland Browns, and <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_49ers_43f8.html" title="San Francisco 49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>, were absorbed into the NFL in 1950.</p>

<p>After the NFL absorbed the AAFC, it went unchallenged by rival leagues until 1960. <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamar_Hunt_30d6.html" title="Lamar Hunt">Lamar Hunt</a>, son of oil millionaire <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._L._Hunt_1964.html" title="H. L. Hunt">H. L. Hunt</a>, rebuffed in his attempts to gain at least part-ownership in an NFL team, conceived the idea of a rival professional football league, the <i>American Football League.</i> The league established teams in eight American cities: <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Patriots_95ad.html" title="Boston Patriots">Boston Patriots</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo_Bills_71a1.html" title="Buffalo Bills">Buffalo Bills</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Jets_c84e.html" title="New York Jets">New York Titans</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_Titans_ab07.html" title="Tennessee Titans">Houston Oilers</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Chiefs_89f3.html" title="Kansas City Chiefs">Dallas Texans</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Broncos_cd7b.html" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Raiders_c8ad.html" title="Oakland Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_Chargers_92bd.html" title="San Diego Chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</a>.</p>
<p>Though they had allowed a few black players to play, the NFL maintained an unwritten quota system, and had ignored the plethora of small colleges which had sprung forth to accommodate the rush of <i>"<a href="../../../g/i/_/GI_Bill_3d1a.html" title="GI Bill">GI Bill</a>"</i> students after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Many of these small colleges were predominantly black, so many valuable football talents were largely ignored by the NFL.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The AFL signed stars from small colleges, such as: <a href="../../../e/l/b/Elbert_Dubenion_2665.html" title="Elbert Dubenion">Elbert Dubenion</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluffton_University_2785.html" title="Bluffton University">Bluffton</a>); <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lionel_Taylor_7741.html" title="Lionel Taylor">Lionel Taylor</a> (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_Highlands_f173.html" title="New Mexico Highlands">New Mexico Highlands</a>); <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Sestak_0d30.html" title="Tom Sestak">Tom Sestak</a> (<a href="../../../m/c/n/McNeese_State_1b88.html" title="McNeese State">McNeese State</a>); <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Tolar_b5a9.html" title="Charlie Tolar">Charlie Tolar</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Hennigan_203a.html" title="Charlie Hennigan">Charlie Hennigan</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwestern_State_94fb.html" title="Northwestern State">Northwestern State</a> of Louisiana); <a href="../../../a/b/n/Abner_Haynes_4565.html" title="Abner Haynes">Abner Haynes</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Texas_State_c09a.html" title="North Texas State">North Texas State</a>); and a host of others. From major colleges, it signed talented players like: LSU's <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisman_Trophy_cdcb.html" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> winner <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Cannon_b090.html" title="Billy Cannon">Billy Cannon</a>; Arkansas' <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Alworth_700f.html" title="Lance Alworth">Lance Alworth</a>; Notre Dame's <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daryle_Lamonica_558b.html" title="Daryle Lamonica">Daryle Lamonica</a>, Kansas' <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hadl_87c2.html" title="John Hadl">John Hadl</a>, Alabama's <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Namath_dedd.html" title="Joe Namath">Joe Namath</a>, and many more. The AFL also signed players the NFL had given up on: so-called "NFL rejects" who turned out to be superstars that the NFL had misevaluated, including <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kemp_481d.html" title="Jack Kemp">Jack Kemp</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_%28Babe%29_Parilli_676d.html" title="Vito (Babe) Parilli">Babe Parilli</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_McDole_56d2.html" title="Ron McDole">Ron McDole</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Powell_0061.html" title="Art Powell">Art Powell</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tracey_5e84.html" title="John Tracey">John Tracey</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Blanda_d5f6.html" title="George Blanda">George Blanda</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Maynard_8e66.html" title="Don Maynard">Don Maynard</a>, and <a href="../../../l/e/n/Len_Dawson_d302.html" title="Len Dawson">Len Dawson</a>.</p>
<p>The AFL instituted many policies and rules that today are considered an integral part of professional football:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-point_conversion.html" title="Two-point conversion">two-point conversion</a> (conforming to the college rule)</li>
<li>Official time on the scoreboard clock</li>
<li>Players' names on jerseys</li>

<li>The sharing of gate and television revenues by home and visiting teams.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NFL had none of these features before the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Football_League_76b2.html" title="American Football League">American Football League</a> came into being. Additionally, the AFL played a more wide-open game, with long passes and reverses; and it promulgated colorful uniforms and team logos.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL-NFL_Merger_06c7.html" title="Edit section: War between the two leagues">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">War between the two leagues</span></h3>
<p>At first, the NFL ignored the AFL and its eight teams. They assumed the AFL would consist of nothing but "NFL rejects," and fans would not waste their time watching them when they could watch "the real thing." But unlike the NFL's previous rivals, the AFL was able to survive and grow. After the AFL's Dallas team moved to Kansas City, and the Los Angeles team to San Diego, it started to prosper. The New York team began to draw record crowds, aided by the signing of quarterback <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Namath_dedd.html" title="Joe Namath">Joe Namath</a>. Namath and New York agreed to a $427,000 contract, something completely unprecedented at the time. And by 1965, NBC paid the AFL $36 million to televise its games, ensuring the league's financial survival.</p>
<p>As the rivalry between the leagues intensified, both leagues resorted to <i>"dirty tricks"</i> to sign players, and to <i>"baby-sit"</i> prospective draft picks to keep them away from the other league's representatives. The leagues entered into a massive bidding war over the top college prospects, paying huge amounts of money to unproven rookies in a desperate attempt to outbid each other for the best players coming out of college.</p>
<p>Because of the intense competition, teams often drafted players that they thought had a good chance of signing with them instead of selecting the best players. For example, 1965 <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisman_Trophy_cdcb.html" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> winning running back <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Garrett_8095.html" title="Mike Garrett">Mike Garrett</a> was expected to sign with an NFL team, so no AFL team picked him in the 1966 AFL draft until the 20th (final) round, where he was selected by the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Chiefs_89f3.html" title="Kansas City Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>. However, Garrett surprisingly shunned the NFL and decided to sign with Kansas City. But still, once they were signed, there was tacit agreement to honor the other league's contracts and not sign players who were under contract with a team in their rival league.</p>
<p>But that tacit agreement was shattered in early 1966, when the NFL <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Giants_d193.html" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a> signed <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Gogolak_f65c.html" title="Pete Gogolak">Pete Gogolak</a>, the first professional soccer-style placekicker, who was already under contract and playing with the AFL's <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo_Bills_71a1.html" title="Buffalo Bills">Buffalo Bills</a>. That breach of trust by the NFL loosed the <i>"dogs of war."</i> When <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Davis_cbd7.html" title="Al Davis">Al Davis</a> of the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Raiders_c8ad.html" title="Oakland Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> took over as AFL Commissioner, he began stepping up the bidding war, immediately signing eight starting NFL quarterbacks, including <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Brodie_e5a8.html" title="John Brodie">John Brodie</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Gabriel_0940.html" title="Roman Gabriel">Roman Gabriel</a>, to contracts with AFL teams.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, both leagues spent a combined $7 million signing their 1966 draft picks.</p>
<p><a name="The_merger_agreement" id="The_merger_agreement"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL-NFL_Merger_06c7.html" title="Edit section: The merger agreement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The merger agreement</span></h2>
<p>The intense rivalry led to serious merger talks between the two leagues. By <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">June 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, they announced a merger agreement. Under the agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>The two leagues would combine to form an expanded league with 24 teams, which would be increased to 26 teams by 1969, and to 28 teams by 1970 or soon thereafter.</li>
<li>All existing teams would be retained, and none of them would be moved outside of their metropolitan areas.</li>
<li>AFL <i>"indemnities"</i> would be paid to NFL teams which shared markets with AFL teams. Specifically, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Giants_d193.html" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a> would receive payments from the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Jets_c84e.html" title="New York Jets">New York Jets</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_49ers_43f8.html" title="San Francisco 49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> would get money from the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Raiders_c8ad.html" title="Oakland Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>.</li>
<li>Both leagues would now hold a <i>"common draft"</i> of college players, effectively ending the bidding war between the 2 leagues over the top college prospects.</li>
<li>While maintaining separate schedules through 1969, the leagues agreed to play an annual <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL-NFL_World_Championship_Game_0f38.html" title="AFL-NFL World Championship Game">AFL-NFL World Championship Game</a>, matching the championship teams of each league, beginning in January, 1967 (which would later be known as the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a>).</li>
<li>The two leagues would officially merge in 1970 to form one league with two conferences. The merged league would be known as the National Football League. The history and records of the AFL would be incorporated into the older league, but its name and logo would be retired.</li>
</ul>
<p>The features of the merger depended on the passage of a law by the <a href="../../../8/9/t/89th_United_States_Congress_0721.html" title="89th United States Congress">89th United States Congress</a>, exempting the merged league from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitrust.html" title="Antitrust">antitrust</a> law sanctions. When NFL commissioner <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Rozelle_440a.html" title="Pete Rozelle">Pete Rozelle</a> and other professional football executives appeared before the Congress' Subcommittee on Antitrust, chaired by <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> congressman <a href="../../../e/m/a/Emanuel_Celler_c0c5.html" title="Emanuel Celler">Emanuel Celler</a>, two points were repeatedly made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rozelle promised that if the merger was allowed, no existing professional football franchise of either league would be moved from any city</li>
<li>Stadiums seating less than 50,000 were declared to be inadequate for professional football's needs (thus compelling the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bears_3f7c.html" title="Chicago Bears">Chicago Bears</a> to move out of <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wrigley_Field_d92d.html" title="Wrigley Field">Wrigley Field</a>, for example).</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, Congress passed the new law to permit the merger to proceed.</p>
<p>As 1970 approached, three NFL teams (<a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis_Colts_aabe.html" title="Indianapolis Colts">Baltimore Colts</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Browns_d021.html" title="Cleveland Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, and <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Steelers_bedf.html" title="Pittsburgh Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>), agreed to join the ten AFL teams (<a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Bengals_5178.html" title="Cincinnati Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_Dolphins_fba7.html" title="Miami Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> had joined the original <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">Boston Patriots</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo_Bills_71a1.html" title="Buffalo Bills">Buffalo Bills</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Broncos_cd7b.html" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_Titans_ab07.html" title="Tennessee Titans">Houston Oilers</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Chiefs_89f3.html" title="Kansas City Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Jets_c84e.html" title="New York Jets">New York Jets</a>, <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Raiders_c8ad.html" title="Oakland Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_Chargers_92bd.html" title="San Diego Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a>) to form the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Football_Conference_f0dc.html" title="American Football Conference">American Football Conference</a> (AFC). The other thirteen NFL teams (<a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Falcons_01c3.html" title="Atlanta Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bears_3f7c.html" title="Chicago Bears">Chicago Bears</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Lions_6dd4.html" title="Detroit Lions">Detroit Lions</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Bay_Packers_4077.html" title="Green Bay Packers">Green Bay Packers</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Rams_0f39.html" title="St. Louis Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Vikings_eec0.html" title="Minnesota Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_Saints_b2f5.html" title="New Orleans Saints">New Orleans Saints</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Giants_d193.html" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Eagles_04d3.html" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Cardinals_c8e5.html" title="Arizona Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_49ers_43f8.html" title="San Francisco 49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>, and <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Redskins_17e9.html" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>) became part of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_Conference_d886.html" title="National Football Conference">National Football Conference</a> (NFC).</p>
<p>The teams' owners had trouble deciding which teams went into which divisions. It was settled after various combinations were drawn up on slips of paper, put into a hat, and the official alignment was pulled out by Rozelle's secretary.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all three of the major television networks signed contracts to televise games, thus ensuring the combined league's stability. <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_on_CBS_99e6.html" title="NFL on CBS">CBS</a> agreed to broadcast all games where an NFC team was on the road, <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_on_NBC_848f.html" title="NFL on NBC">NBC</a> agreed to broadcast all games where an AFC team was on the road, and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> agreed to broadcast <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a></i>, making the NFL the first league to have a regular series of national telecasts in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_time.html" title="Prime time">prime time</a>.</p>

<p>A few devoted AFL fans had the belief that had Al Davis been given the opportunity to continue his efforts, the NFL would have folded, or capitulated to join the AFL, rather than the AFL losing its identity.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> However other observers note that the NFL had a far richer television contract at the time of the merger, in large part due to market exclusivity in such leading population centers as Los Angeles, Detroit, Philadelphia, Washington and Baltimore, while the AFL had teams in cities that were not among the nations leading media markets, including cities such as Miami, Buffalo and Denver, which had no other major league teams, and Kansas City which had only a failing (and ultimately relocated) baseball team. Some of these American Football League fans were disappointed because they wanted their league to continue. Those feelings were reinforced when American Football League teams won the final two <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_American_football_championship_games_bce1.html" title="Professional American football championship games">AFL-NFL World Championship games</a> after the 1968 and 1969 seasons.</p>
<p>While the AFC was the dominant conference post-merger until the early 1980s, many have cited that the three NFL teams that joined the AFL to form the AFC were largely the reason. While the Colts and Browns were respectable playoff contenders during this period, AFL fans especially hated the Steelers because it won four Super Bowls in a six year span. With a few notable exceptions such as the Raiders and Dolphins, this essentially made the AFC dominated by an "old NFL" team instead of an AFL team.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the merger paved the way for a new era of prosperity for the NFL. Since 1970 there essentially has been only one major professional football league in the United States. Other leagues such as the <a href="../../../x/f/l/XFL_352c.html" title="XFL">XFL</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Football_League_4cc2.html" title="United States Football League">United States Football League</a> (USFL) have never been a serious challenge to the NFL, folding after one and three seasons, respectively.</p>

<p>Six expansion teams have been formed since the merger. All of these teams became the primary tenant in their stadiums:</p>

<li><a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Texans_c5f6.html" title="Houston Texans">Houston Texans</a> franchise awarded October 6 1999, began to play in 2002</li>
</ul>
<p>Officially, the Baltimore Ravens were designated as an expansion team. Before the 1996 season, the Cleveland Browns' owner, players, coaches, and contracts were carried over to Baltimore. The Browns eventually resumed play in 1999, with new ownership, a new coaching staff, and players acquired through an expansion draft. Officially, however, the Browns franchise retained its original team history and records as if the club had <i>suspended operations</i> for the 1996-1998 period. The same public relations ploy had been announced when baseball's Washington Senators became the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> in 1961, and the new <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Rangers_%28baseball%29_b4f3.html" title="Texas Rangers (baseball)">Washington Senators</a> were given (for awhile) the Washington history while the Twins were officially treated as an "expansion" team.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Houston Texans expansion franchise replaced the old Houston Oilers in the Houston market. Unlike the Baltimore/Cleveland situation, however, the Tennessee Titans retained all the franchise records of the Houston Oilers (as well as their nickname, for a couple of years), while the Houston Texans history officially begins in 2002. Coincidentally, both of those AFC teams adopted nicknames that had been abandoned by original AFL entries in different cities (New York Titans and Dallas Texans).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Seattle Seahawks, the Carolina Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars were true expansion teams, entering new markets for the NFL at the time of expansion. Both Tampa Bay and Jacksonville occupied existing stadiums that were expanded to meet the NFL's attendance requirements, while Seattle and Carolina built new stadiums.</p>

<p>The Super Bowl has been seen as a powerful incentive for local governments, businesses and voters to support the construction, seat licenses and taxes associated with new or renovated stadiums. Therefore, the league has and continues to award Super Bowls to cities that have built new football stadiums for their existing franchises.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the NFL's criteria for expansion has been the region's ability to host a Super Bowl. However, only five Super Bowls since 1984 have been played in stadiums used by three of these expansion teams; four of these games were played in Florida, and one game was played in Texas.</p>
<p>In some cases, cities have been selected as provisional Super Bowl sites, with the construction or renovation of a suitable facility as a major requirement for hosting the actual game. In the past, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a> have each received provisional site awards. In both cities, the league moved the game to a different site when public funding initiatives failed. The most recent provisional site award went to <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Missouri_d52a.html" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City</a> for a Super Bowl to be played in 2015 in <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrowhead_Stadium_c0df.html" title="Arrowhead Stadium">Arrowhead Stadium</a>, but Kansas City has since withdrawn their request because the funding for the new roof has failed.</p>
<p>In addition, the following areas have used public funds to build new stadiums to retain or regain franchises: <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Chiefs_89f3.html" title="Kansas City Chiefs">Kansas City</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Rams_0f39.html" title="St. Louis Rams">St. Louis</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Ravens_9241.html" title="Baltimore Ravens">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Browns_d021.html" title="Cleveland Browns">Cleveland</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Bengals_5178.html" title="Cincinnati Bengals">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Vikings_eec0.html" title="Minnesota Vikings">Minneapolis</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Texans_c5f6.html" title="Houston Texans">Houston</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Steelers_bedf.html" title="Pittsburgh Steelers">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Eagles_04d3.html" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bears_3f7c.html" title="Chicago Bears">Chicago</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_437e.html" title="Tampa Bay Buccaneers">Tampa</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_Seahawks_2af6.html" title="Seattle Seahawks">Seattle</a>.</p>
