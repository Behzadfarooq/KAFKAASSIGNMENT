<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/Africville%2C_Nova_Scotia_2b71.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Settled in earnest after the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_1812.html" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>, founded by Marc-Aundre Macleod the community of Africville was officially founded in the <a href="../../../1/8/4/1840s.html" title="1840s">1840s</a>. The community had a population of approximately 400 residents, mostly African. The population did not fluctuate significantly in size or character from its inception to its end; it remained a ramshackle collection of houses. In the late <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850s.html" title="1850s">1850s</a>, the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Scotia_Railway_995c.html" title="Nova Scotia Railway">Nova Scotia Railway</a> was built from Richmond to the south, bisecting Africville as the line wound its way along the western shores of Bedford Basin. The <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercolonial_Railway_6b75.html" title="Intercolonial Railway">Intercolonial Railway</a>, later <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_National_Railways_eeab.html" title="Canadian National Railways">Canadian National Railways</a>, constructed Basin Yard west of the community and trains ran through the area constantly.</p>
<p>The municipality of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax_County%2C_Nova_Scotia_2076.html" title="Halifax County, Nova Scotia">Halifax County</a>, and the neighbouring City of Halifax, refused to extend basic utilities such as sanitary water and sewage or street lighting. As the City of Halifax expanded, Africville became a preferred site for all types of undesirable industries and facilities -- <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">prisons</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slaughterhouse.html" title="Slaughterhouse">slaughterhouses</a>, even a depository for fecal waste, from nearby Russellville.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax_Explosion_8313.html" title="Halifax Explosion">Halifax Explosion</a> of 1917, elevated land to the south protected Africville from the direct blast and complete destruction which leveled the neighbouring community of Richmond. However the community did suffer considerable damage. Several residents were killed working at the Richmond Wharves. Africville recieved little of the reconstruction and none of the modernization which was invested into other parts of the city after the explosion.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/Africville%2C_Nova_Scotia_2b71.html" title="Edit section: Eviction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Eviction</span></h2>
<p>Although Africville was an extremely poor community, the social cohesion of its residents was strong. They fought for and won the right in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> to receive municipal services, but the city council's agreement in principle was never translated into any action.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, the area was being studied by developers and municipal planners because of its prime location, and the planned construction of a second bridge to improve links between <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth%2C_Nova_Scotia_b76f.html" title="Dartmouth, Nova Scotia">Dartmouth</a> and Halifax. In the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, the federal government's National Harbours Board was considering a major port expansion in adjacent Fairview Cove, including building a large container terminal. Many social workers and reformers also felt the community should be moved in the spirit of integration and urban renewal. Many of Africville's inhabitants were technically <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatting.html" title="Squatting">squatters</a> with no legal title to their homes or land, making them exceptionally vulnerable to outside pressure to leave their community.</p>
<p>Although its residents fought bitterly, Africville was destroyed between <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, and its residents were relocated into public housing downtown near Uniacke Square and Mulgrave Park, while some were sent to slum housing further away from the city centre in places like <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spryfield.html" title="Spryfield">Spryfield</a>. Many never forgot the stigma of having their personal possessions moved by municipal dumptrucks instead of moving vans. The last remaining resident, Aaron Carvery, left Africville on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2.html" title="January 2">January 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, following a protracted dispute. The last building of the community to be demolished was the Seaville African United <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist.html" title="Baptist">Baptist</a> Church.<a href="http://www.coastclassic.ca/issues/020605/citymatters.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.coastclassic.ca/issues/020605/citymatters.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>The relocation programme has been criticized for its poor planning as it failed to take into account the way the people lived. Most were simply transplanted into a city and community they did not know, in impersonal apartments. During the demolition, some of the residents were still in their homes as the bulldozers came to demolish the area. Social networks were disrupted, causing depression and a great deal of social distress. To this day the areas of resettlement have a reputation for poverty, crime, and other related social problems.</p>
<p>For many Nova Scotians, Africville remains a symbol of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_discrimination.html" title="Racial discrimination">racial discrimination</a>. The relocated residents have almost universally remained impoverished and few, if any, have benefitted economically from the destruction of their former homes in the name of development. Even today, Africville is little heard of outside of the province.</p>
<p>Part of Africville is now occupied by a highway interchange that services the <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._Murray_MacKay_Bridge_2d45.html" title="A. Murray MacKay Bridge">A. Murray MacKay Bridge</a>, however the port development at Fairview Cove did not extend as far east as Africville, leaving the waterfront intact. In light of the controversy surrounding the community, the city of Halifax created Seaview Memorial Park on the site in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, preserving it from development. Former Africville residents have carried out periodic protests at the park throughout the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, including one squatting attempt which lasted over two years.</p>
<p>In May <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_ef87.html" title="New Democratic Party">New Democratic Party of Nova Scotia</a> <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_05a5.html" title="Member of the Legislative Assembly">Member of the Legislative Assembly</a> <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maureen_MacDonald_ceb2.html" title="Maureen MacDonald">Maureen MacDonald</a> introduced a bill in the provincial legislature called the <i>Africville Act</i>. The bill calls for a formal apology from the Nova Scotia government, a series of public hearings on the destruction of Africville, and the establishment of a development fund to go towards historical preservation of Africville lands and social development in benefit of former residents and their descendants. Halifax mayor <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_J._Kelly_77c2.html" title="Peter J. Kelly">Peter Kelly</a> has offered land, some money and various other services for a replica of the Seaview African United <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist.html" title="Baptist">Baptist</a> Church. After the offer was originally made in 2002, the Africville Genealogy Society requested some alterations to the Halifax offer, including additional land and the possibility of building <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affordable_housing.html" title="Affordable housing">affordable housing</a> near the site. The Africville site has been declared a national historic site.</p>
