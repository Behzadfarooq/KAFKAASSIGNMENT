	    <p>Just wondering, but is there a reason this isnt listed as "African-American Religion"??? I'm just not familer with the term "afro-american"... american's with afro's? I think the page should be moved to African-American, but then again since I'm not sure and unfamiler with the term I thought it should be brought up here for discussion.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyver07_9583.html" title="User:MacGyver07">MacGyver07</a> 11:54, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>African American is a US-specific term. The Afro- prefix, like the Euro-, Sino- or Anglo-, is perfectly acceptable and widely used (see <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Guyanese_3922.html" title="Afro-Guyanese">Afro-Guyanese</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Latin_American_507e.html" title="Afro-Latin American">Afro-Latin American</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Trinidadian_2633.html" title="Afro-Trinidadian">Afro-Trinidadian</a>); in this context "American" refers to the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a>, not the US. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 12:17, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We have made what we believe are important changes to the Afro-Religions pages, yet they are automatically deleted (reverted) without cause. We have added one of the most basic cosmologcial concepts and divine tenents ineherent in all African traditional and Diaspora religions which is <b>Ancestral Veneration</b>, yet it was deleted without cause.</p>
<p>We have added</p>
<pre>
. . . <i>New World traditions often masked for their survival . . . However, many in the Diaspora are resorting back to the traditional orthodoxy of their ancestral religions no longer finding a need to mask them.</i>
</pre>
<p><b>Which was delete without cause</b>.</p>
<p><br />
We have included the other African traditional religious practices in the Diaspora such as:</p>
<p><i>Mami Wata</i> Vodoun Ifa Orisha Akhan Kemet (Ausar Auset) Santería Rastafarianism Spiritual Baptist Islam/Black Muslims</p>
<p><b>All of the above were delete without cause.</b></p>
<p><br />
Wikipedia has invited others to expand this "stub" yet it is being reverted back without cause. Please explain why these changes are not acceptable and how they are in violation of Wikipedia's three pillars <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifiability</a>, and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citing sources</a>.

<dd>The reason, explained in the edit summary, was that you were disrupting the article by breaking good links. It's good that you try to follow the wikipedia policies. Now try to respect the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">Manual of style</a> too. Please use the "show preview" function instead of frequent "save page", and always add an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEdit_summary_ca7e.html" title="Help:Edit summary">edit summary</a> (just look at the article's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Afro-American_religion&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Afro-American_religion&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>. Regarding the disruptions of links (which you did again, thus breaking the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3 revert rule</a>), you have changed replaced good link <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arar%C3%A1.html" title="Arará">Arará</a> with red lnk Arará (West African Vodoun). Changed <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Southern_states_fa55.html" title="U.S. Southern states">U.S. Southern states</a> with red lnk Across the United states (whatever enciclopedic meaning that may have), changed <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation_of_Islam_86de.html" title="Nation of Islam">Nation of Islam</a> (which, indeed, would not belong here) with Islam/Black Muslims. You added links that would qualify as self pomotion. You overpopulated the list by duplicating entries to a level of detail that is simply not justified by the purpose of the list (of course there are a few people practising <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santeria.html" title="Santeria">Santeria</a> in the US, but Santeria is specifically Cuban, it suffices if it shows up under <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> in the list). Normally even sloppy edits are corrected, not reverted, but when they are combined with self promotion, lack of explanations and persistance in error, straith reverting is much more likely to be applied. Finaly, please don't overemphase the talk, it only makes it more difficult to read, and sign using four tildas:~~~~. Again, please read the manual of style, fill in edit summaries, don't disrupt previous edits. <a href="../../../q/y/d/User%7EQyd_7b48.html" title="User:Qyd">Qyd</a> 13:54, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Respecting and reading the Wikipedia Style manual, which I have done, is a process that is best perfected through direct experience. Meaning that I (as <b>you</b> and others have), make mistakes as I am learning. I also take strong issue with your accusations of “<i>self-promotion</i>.” Your justification for excluding “<i>Santeria</i>” and the other African Diaspora religions from the United States category does not make sense. All Diaspora based religions originated in Africa, that does not exclude them from being noted for their development, and expansion in the New World. African Americans (their “insignificant” numbers notwithstanding) must also be recognized as active participants in the various Diaspora religions and this list must reflect this. The NOI (Nation of Islam) as you originally listed is not an African Diaspora religion, and the majority of the African-American population are not adherents. Further, if you do not want an "oveemphasis on talk," then assure that you own information is accurate and supported by verifiable sources. Perhaps another means other than exclusion should be created to reflect this historical fact.Losing patience and condescending to personal attacks and less experience in manipulating the mechanics of Wikpedia will not accomplish this goal. I will still continue (mistakes and all) to contribute if the situation warrants. Anagossii --MWHS 14:41, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very well. You could start by fixing the red links that i pointed out (as you could see, I haven't reverted your edits once the discussion started). Self-promotion: I meant adding <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mami_Wata_3afa.html" title="Mami Wata">Mami Wata</a> as a separate religion, when it is just a part of (probably) <a href="../../../v/o/u/Voudou.html" title="Voudou">Voudou</a>. Moreso in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=If%C3%A1&amp;diff=64203949&amp;oldid=64203544" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=If%C3%A1&amp;diff=64203949&amp;oldid=64203544" rel="nofollow">your edits</a>] to <a href="../../../i/f/%C3%A1/If%C3%A1.html" title="Ifá">Ifá</a>, a clear spamlink which you add persistantly. And believe me, there's no loss of patience on my side, on the contrary. Frustration yes, sometimes when I see you ignoring advices (add <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEdit_summary_ca7e.html" title="Help:Edit summary">edit summary</a>, use a <a href="../../../s/b/_/WP%7ESB_c0d8.html" title="WP:SB">sandbox</a> instead of multiple sucessive edits, don't break <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3 revert rule</a>, etc) (click blue links for more info). - <a href="../../../q/y/d/User%7EQyd_7b48.html" title="User:Qyd">Qyd</a> 15:07, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fair enough. I am still working on understanding (not <i>ignoring</i>) <i>the sand box, advice page</i>, and other resource pages. Wikipedia is a bit complex to follow, vision problems not withstanding. FYI: <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mami_Wata_3afa.html" title="Mami Wata">Mami Wata</a> is a <i>separate and distinct</i> religion period. One can be initiated to Mami Wata and not the <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodou.html" title="Vodou">Vodou</a>. The reverse is also true. Women are the dominate clergy in that they initiate the men,but the reverse is not true. Also, adding the Vodoun and other websites to the Ifa page is <b>not a spamlink</b>. It is <b>critical</b> to actually include as many of the Diaspora religions whose divinatory systems depend upon Afa/Ifa as possible. The intent is to change the all prevailing misperception that <b>Orunmila only speaks to the Orisha</b> and Egun of the Yoruba. There is considerable controversy as well as to its actual origins in West Africa. Although the "Yoruba" are (rightly) credited with its introduction, there is questions of what groups have been excluded that originally made-up the now "Yoruba" clans. Finall, there is no need to "spam." West African Vodoun does not recruit nor proselytize. As many are turned away as are called. It is a tradition of strict orthodoxy which is not for everyone. There simply is no need to "<i>pimp</i>" the religion. However, there is a great need to understand it, even amongst the different practitioners of the various tradition, who (unadmittedly) believe prevaling Hollywood stereotypes. We honor and respect our religions and our only goal is to present them accurately and from our own perspective, as much as possible, as is accorded other groups.</p>

<p>"Mami Wata is a separate and distinct religion period"</p>
<p>On that I can't agree. Does it have a different cosmology? Differnt gods? Different belief system? It is simply a different church, and this kind of dissemination is common in many Afro-American religions. Where would we get if every <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbanda.html" title="Umbanda">umbanda</a> church or <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candombl%C3%A9.html#Temples_and_priesthood" title="Candomblé">Candomblé Temple</a> for example would claim a place for as a distinct religion. And please don't tell me you are unbiased. Your user name, Mwhs, stands for Mami Wata Healer Society. I can understand that your religion is very important to you, but try to understand the greater purpose of this encyclopedia. What I'm trying to avoid here is having an obscure movement taking over the focus of articles. That's my point of view, and I would appreciate if you tried to understand it. <a href="../../../q/y/d/User%7EQyd_7b48.html" title="User:Qyd">Qyd</a> 20:31, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anagossii (MWHS), I appreciate that we all make mistakes when getting familiar with wikipedia, and I'm happy to try to explain some things you may find a bit tricky. Ask a question about this article here, or a general question on my talk page if you like. However, Qyd is right — some aspects of your editing style are likely to annoy other editors if you continue in the same vein. Especially when you are new to editing, listening to other editors is vital. Discussion and consensus on the talk page should precede any controversial changes, and is more likely to achieve lasting results than continually reverting back to your preferred version (also known as <a href="../../../e/w/_/WP%7EEW_c046.html" title="WP:EW">edit warring</a>). Please use edit summaries (the little box above the "save page" button) so that other editors know what you are changing.</p>
<p>As for the content, I have to agree with Qyd that Ghana is not Afro-American and does not belong in the list. I also think that is it enough to list the countries where these religions developed and predominate. i don't think an extensive list of religions in the US section is helpful. Immigrant communities worldwide may practise these religions, but it is counter-productive to list every country. To give an analogy, the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_language.html" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese language</a> is also spoken in the US, but to list the US in the list of countries where Portuguese is spoken would be misleading. <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 02:28, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am still working on the summary issue. It is a bit confusing for me. In fact, when I view the summary instruction page, it is actually blank. If you can offer an example of what I would place in the box, I will <i>get-it</i>. The section on Ghana I agree should be removed. However, I do not agree at all that the categories in the US section should be changed. The subject heading is "Afro-<b>American</b> Religions," which includes all of the Afro-Diaspora religions not where they originated, but where they are currently being practiced which includes the USA. African religions are the birthright of the African-American Diaspora, and many are returning to these traditions in record numbers. This section must reflect this current reality. The African-American community can no longer be omitted or excluded as if their presence does not count. This is both a travesty to their ancestors and a denial of the many who have returned to their ancestral religions, many are even stronger in their commitment because of the history in America of their suppression. I will remove the Ghana category. It does not belong. Thank you for your civility. Anagossii--MWHS 04:26, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you click on the "history" tab (next to the "edit this page" tab), you will see a list of edits, and next to each is the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEdit_summary_ca7e.html" title="Help:Edit summary">summary</a> that the editor gave. I noticed you are now doing this so I guess you got it!&#160;:) On another technical note, wikipedia is case-sensitive — <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancestor_veneration.html" title="Ancestor veneration">ancestor veneration</a> will work but Ancestor Veneration will not. I'm not sure what you were attempting with the <a href="../../../t/o/g/Togo.html" title="Togo">Togo</a> link, but currently, you have linked the text "Southern Ghana, Burkina Faso" to the Togo page. I assume this was not deliberate, but please don't continue to restore this edit after other editors have cleaned it up for you. In addition, there are some problems with punctuation and sentence structure. I urge you to seek agreement here (on the talk page) before making changes to the article that have already been challenged by others. Your continual reverts to your version (with errors) will acheive far less than a vigorous discussion here and will put editors off-side.</p>
<p>I see your point about the page title implying all religions practised by African-diaspora communities in the Americas. However, the <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">lead section</a> describes religions which involve divine spirits/orishas/loas etc. I think it's worth grouping these together, and distinguishing them from other traditions like Nation Of Islam and Rastafarianism. If these are to be included, then to be fair, all Christian churches with significant number of black adherents should also be included — not to mention other religions like Buddhism and Judaism. <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 05:02, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. If you see a red link, it's worth trying it in the "search" box on the left column. You will find there are pages on <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kemetic_Reconstructionism_46a3.html" title="Kemetic Reconstructionism">Kemetic Reconstructionism</a> and the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Ausar_Auset_Society_363d.html" title="Ausar Auset Society">Ausar Auset Society</a>. Again, I feel these faiths need to be distinguished from those spiritual traditions that were brought by communities from Africa to the Americas and maintained since that time. <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 05:20, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the feedback. You are correct concering serveral points. Namely adding <i>Rastafarianism</i> and other religious traditions not brought over by Africans to America. You can revert the page. I will clean-up the additions that I have made, and present them here for discussion, and the correct way to include them. Anagossii--MWHS 13:59, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks good to me. I think it makes sense to list the religion first, as you have done, rather than the country, as the article has done previously. Perhaps the column headed "country of origin" could be renamed as "developed in", as some could argue that they originated in West Africa? Also, perhaps we could lose Macumba from the list, or put a <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macumba.html" title="Macumba">Macumba</a> link in the comments section of the Afro-Brazilian religions? And Santería is also practised in Mexico and elsewhere?</dd>

What about other religions that are primarily practised in the Americas by African-diaspora communities, as discussed above (e.g. Rastafarianism), but can't claim a continuous tradition from Africa? What about reconstructionist religions like <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kemetic_Reconstructionism_46a3.html" title="Kemetic Reconstructionism">Kemetic Reconstructionism</a>?

<dd>Rastafarianism and NOI: I personally don't think they should be included here, as they are not in line with the definition given in the leading paragraph (and would belong to "African-American religions" rather than "Afro-American Religions"). <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santo_Daime_416c.html" title="Santo Daime">Santo Daime</a> (and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uni%C3%A3o_do_Vegetal_992f.html" title="União do Vegetal">União do Vegetal</a>?) is mainly indigenous, and <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vale_do_Amanhecer_c759.html" title="Vale do Amanhecer">Vale do Amanhecer</a>... well, UFO, so shouldn't be in the list.

<p>I think the table is a wonderful idea and is more user friendly. More importantly, it is not exclusionary. The table can also allow for the expaning growth and morphing off of other African-based traditions, such as Vodoun which is non-syncretic, and more orthodox, vs. Haitian Vodou and New Orleans Voodoo. For the question below: The word "loa" is not used in Benin to describe the Vodou. That is used in Haiti as well as the Creole word "<i>Lwa."</i> In Benin, the word for Vodou is "<i>vodou</i>" with a small-case "v." The Vodou of Benin is also not blended with other outside elements. African religions came to the New World as complete traditions. The use of saints, and other ethnic blends was largely for its surivival. As far as adding religeous movements influenced by Afro-American religions, This might could be sub-headed under a US Afro-religions. Thank you Anagossii--MWHS 16:39, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now i'm going to exopse my ignorace, as I am merely an interested dabbler, but I have some more questions that perhaps you or Anagossii can answer. You classified Haitian Vodou as a Dahomeyan tradition. I thought it also had Yoruba and Kongolese roots? Major families of loa include the Rada (Rada is a cognate of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arar%C3%A1.html" title="Arará">Arará</a>, a Dahomeyan tradition) and Nago (another name for the Yoruba language and people). Also, i noticed Anagossii changed "loa of Dahomey" to "Vodou of Dahomey", which I suspect is a better term. I thought the word loa/lwa was a Yoruba word, and in Benin, "divine spirits" are known as vodun? If so, the table should probably be modified there too. I would like to look at a good reference text if anyone knows of one? <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 05:51, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Loa/lwa is probably a <a href="../../../f/o/n/Fon_language.html" title="Fon language">fon</a> word (but I can't back that up); "Vodun" shound also describe those spirits, but it has the major disadvantage of being too close to Vodou/Voodoo, and sofar <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodun.html" title="Vodun">Vodun</a> redirects to <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodou.html" title="Vodou">Vodou</a> instead of describing the families of spirits; I believe Voudou is mainly of Dahomeyan origin, although many deities (especialy Rada) have orisha equivalents. "Vodou of Dahomey" is used to describe the religion of Benin (as to differenciate it from Haitian Voudou). This <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A1019666" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A1019666" rel="nofollow">BBC article</a> is a clear and concise reference, and has links to more indepth sites. <a href="../../../q/y/d/User%7EQyd_7b48.html" title="User:Qyd">Qyd</a> 12:07, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, both of you, for the information. Qyd, do you have evidence that the word loa/lwa is used in Benin? If not I think we should stick to "vodou" in the table for accuracy, as per Anagossii's suggestion. I did come across several websites that suggested the origin of the word is actually French creole (from <i>lois</i> - "law"), although the <a href="../../../v/o/o/Voodoo.html" title="Voodoo">voodoo</a> article has it as a Kikongo term (but no reference for this claim). I also think you are incorrect about Rada (please put me straight if I'm wrong); the word Rada refers to a Dahomeyan tradition, not a Yoruba one (Orishas), which is identified with the word "Nago". The <a href="../../../v/o/o/Voodoo.html#Haitian_Vodou" title="Voodoo">Voodoo#Haitian Vodou</a> page states that "Haitian Vodou also has strong elements from the Bakongo of Central Africa and the Igbo and Yoruba of Nigeria...", and gives the three most important families of loa as Rada (Dahomey), Nago (Yoruba) and Lemba (Kongo). The <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haitian_mythology.html" title="Haitian mythology">Haitian mythology</a> page also states that its roots are in "Yoruba, Kongo and Dahomey mythology". So I think the three should be listed as "roots" of Haitian Vodun unless I am missing something. Thanks for the link to the BBC site, but I was actually looking for a published source that we could cite, in part to address these issues. I'll have a look on google scholar when I have a moment.</dd>

<p>The way I understood it (and I might be wrong), is that haitian voudou spirits are grouped in 3 families: Rada (with roots and strong similarities to west african traditions), petwo (the aggresive loas, specific to the new world traditions) and ghede (spirits of the ancestors). Yes, rada loas have dahomeyan roots; what I meant was that those dahomeyan roots have yoruba equivalents (papa legba=eshu, ogoun=gu=ogun). Rada loas, while being strongly dahomeyan in origin, are closer to yoruba traditions when compared to Petwo and Ghede.<br />
You're right about spiritual baptism being a protestan sincretysm, that was just a wrong copy-paste.--<a href="../../../q/y/d/User%7EQyd_7b48.html" title="User:Qyd">Qyd</a> 04:18, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to change the word "loa" in the table to vodou (as "loa" seems to be primarily a Haitian thing, and for other the reasons cited above). Qyd, you rightly pointed out that the word "vodou" may be confusing, as the word links to the religion, rather than to spirits. However the article does explain in the lead section that the word can refer to "individual spirits or deities". Will you accept the change from loa to vodou? Perhaps you have other proposals/modifications to help clarify it? <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 06:02, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Congratulations! The table looks great, and it is inclusive of all the ATRs in the Diaspora. I know this must have been a challenge and we commend you. However, there is one historical point that I would like to make. The category for Vodou's origination lists <i>Dahomey</i> and <i>Mythology</i>. I am not sure what the <i>Mythology</i> represents for the religion, and do not believe that it is appropriate. The Dahomean government (Benin) has historically made exclusive claims as the home of the Vodou religion for political and economic reasons which are too detailed for this discussion. However,the Vodou religion is one of the original indigenous religions of Africa, and is estimated to be as old as <i>10,000 years</i>. This clearly predates the existence of Dahomey, who in truth are not the sole “<i>originators</i>” of the Vodou religion. As an ancient “<i>un-syncretize</i>” religion, the Vodou is indigenous to many countries in West Africa to include, <i>Togo, Southeastern Ghana (Anlo-Ewe), Burkina Faso, Sierra Leon, Senegal</i>, and many other regions. These regions are also where many Africans were taken and enslaved in the <i>New World</i>, and should be included. I (or you) can include them to offer a more comprehensive and accurate portrayal of the Vodou religion. I also think that the countries courrent name “"Benin <i>should be used and “</i>former Dahomey<i>” placed in parenthesis. Thank you for the hard work you are doing.

<dl>
<dd>We have made what we believe are some important historical changes to the <i>Vodou origin</i> section of the table. The first being replacing <i>Haiti</i> as a <i>primary origin</i> of Vodou's evelopment. <i>Haitian Vodou</i> is a syncretize Diaspora religion developed in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_a493.html" title="New World">New World</a>. It is another branch and/or root religion of its mother religion of Vodou in West Africa. Secondly, the Vodou religion <i>developed</i> throughout many regions in Africa. There is evidence that the Vodou religion merely migrated to West Africa with its adherents from the Sudanic regions. Nonetheless, to the chagrin of other nations in West Africa, Benin (former Dahomey) continues to lay claim to being the <i>home of the Vodou religion</i>. Unfortunately, reinforced by western anthropologists, this claim is believed to be more for economic and political reasons than any attempt at historical accuracy. Lastly, we have found no historical evidence that the Yoruba had a hand in the development of the Vodou religion in West Africa. We are aware that the <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/voodoo.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/voodoo.htm" rel="nofollow">religioustolerance.org</a> page continues to attribute the development of the Vodou religion to the Yoruba, however, this is an error that we are working to correct. One of the earliest homes of the Ewe and Fon groups was ancient <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketu.html" title="Ketu">Ketu</a> and other regions in Nigeria. They are believed to have migrated to this region from the east as early as the 11th century. It was only with the expansion of the growing <a href="../../../o/y/o/Oyo_empire.html" title="Oyo empire">Oyo empire</a> in competing for land to expand, that these Vodou groups were forced to migrate southwesterly. Any remnants of the Vodou religion that existed in the region may be a result of their earlier presence. Currently, there are what are know in Benin as <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nago.html" title="Nago">Nago</a>, meaning Yoruba worshipers of the Vodou religion in some parts of southern Benin. However, it is known by the locals that they descend from populations of either warrior families, or early immigrants to that region, especially during the infamous Dahomean wars with the Oyo empire. There, one might find a mixture of both the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orisa.html" title="Orisa">Orisa</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/l/Gelede.html" title="Gelede">Gelede</a>, and traditional Vodou deities being honored. --<a href="../../../m/w/h/User%7EMwhs_5c19.html" title="User:Mwhs">MWHS</a> 01:48, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The way that the chart is prepared, it delineates each religions supposed country of origins, which would logically be its ancestral origins, since they are ancestral religions. The idea that <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_religions.html" title="African religions">African religions</a> are somehow <i>new</i> to their current regions (i.e., Dahomey) is largely the result of western anthropological speculation, which goes against both the historical and <i>spiritual-physical</i> evidence known to its heirs and lineage practitioners. Meaning that many African/Diaspora priests of the <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodou.html" title="Vodou">Vodou</a> (for example) can chronicle their <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancestry.html" title="Ancestry">ancestry</a> and their tutelary deities to remote regions that pre-date its current alleged "country of origin". We simply do not see the conflict in making these long overdue corrections. In deference to you, we have reverted the wikilinks back to Dahomey Mythology, although we do not agree with this classification. However, in noting that all of the so-called major religions are also categorized this way, we will accept this classification. Lastly, we thank you for your clarification concerning your demeanor. We also apologize for our persistence in wanting to make certain that our ancestral religions are presented from our Diaspora world view, which has been historically omitted. In doing so, especially with editors who may not be accustomed to working with the Diaspora, or who do not respect their contributions and persistence, things can become heated. However, make no mistake about it, our intention is only to present our historical and religious world view with as little confrontation as possible. We are only concerned that our world view regarding our ancestral religions is not again lost to the pen of modern day revisionists. We can assure you that as the tone of some of these editors become more amicable, ours will as well. --<a href="../../../m/w/h/User%7EMwhs_5c19.html" title="User:Mwhs">MWHS</a> 15:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Very good. Now as the roots are as old as 500 years, can we agree that those roots are not set in countries that didn't exist in those times? --<a href="../../../q/y/d/User%7EQyd_7b48.html" title="User:Qyd">Qyd</a> 20:57, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We have already stated this fact above. However, there is universal agreement that a point of origin must be attributed to these ancestal traditions, and that point of origin is usually the last geographical location from which they were taken and transported to the New World. the countries that we have listed did exist during that period, and the Africans enslaved in the New World brought the Vodoun religion with them.--<a href="../../../m/w/h/User%7EMwhs_5c19.html" title="User:Mwhs">MWHS</a> 16:14, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First and most important: no, those countries did not exist in that era. Second, the root of a religion should not be the "point of origin" (that's elusive, hard to pinpoint and even harder to demonstrate), but another religion, the "ancestral" one. That's why I preffered to list <b>mythologies/african religions</b> as roots, and not some <b>political entities</b>. If we could agree on this aproach, it would help the reader a great deal (by keeping apples and oranges appart). --<a href="../../../q/y/d/User%7EQyd_7b48.html" title="User:Qyd">Qyd</a> 17:24, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
