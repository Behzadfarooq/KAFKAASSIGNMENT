<p>I recommend that someone edit this page to add more scientific based information. Particularly what causes Sub-saharan african's hair to be unique and perhaps add a bit of what the differences are in textures, glands in the scalp, etc that make sub-saharan hair different. This page currently reads like someone's personal interpertation of how black hair and the social attitudes toward it. This page does not explain very much about afro textured hair itself at all.</p>

You also need to a a tag stating which licence you wish to release the pictures under. If you are happy to give up all copyright on the picture just add {{PD}} If you want to keeps some rights look through the other licenses and choose one.

<dd>You were informaed that those pictures cannot be used; you got them from the internet (I do not think you own all of the websites from which they came, as you said above. You said <a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_X_dbf3.html" title="User talk:Anonymous X">on your talk page</a> that you "got them from the internet", and when I ran a search looking for fair use alternatives, I ran across those pictures on several other websites). The page was tagged for cleanup, meaning that someone needed to revise the page and bring it in line with the proper formatting for a Wikipedia article. This page does not belong solely to you; anyone can, will, and should edit it. It is not an act of vandalism to clean up an article, but reverting pages to your preferred version (especially when that version is not in line with standards) <i>is</i> vandalism.--<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 08:39, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I should say, this is a relative;y unfortunate turn of events!! First some lunatic vandalises my work by removing my pictures and senetences without adding anything new except two pathetic examples of an Afro and cornrows ( this is about Afro extured hair, not just styles)and then people I THOUGHT were my friends decide to delete my lovely photos that compliment my article so well.... This article was my baby. You all have ruined me... P.S It was said the article needed to be 'cleaned' but with only a few things removed and changed is it any better then before? No, my article with my lovely pictures was better then the mess up there now!! I was going to add more to, but nobody appreciates me.. --161.57.100.3 22:59, 30 October 2005 (UTC)Anonymous X</p>

<p>I liked my article the way it was. It's bad enough I can't show the pictures, is it a MUST that all the links to them be placed at the end or what that your personal preference? Unfortanatly I don't have free use photos.And why is the link to the wooly hair syndrome continuosy removed, you might as well remove the 'some Caucasians have extremely frizzy hair' as well to, it was only there to link the wooly hair syndrome. --24.176.41.51 20:59, 5 November 2005 (UTC)Anonymous X</p>

<li>To (mis)quote <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_D_38d6.html" title="Chuck D">Chuck D</a>, "you don't own no article". Whether you liked the article the way it was or not is completely arbitrary: it had to be improved to meet our quality standards. How external links are formatted is not my personal preference, but an established style guide for a consistent and professional layout style. As per our <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">Manual of Style</a>, external links are placed at the bottom of a page in a formatted list, and not strewn throughout the article.

<dd>It would be wavy, which is a different texture altogether. It can vary from being very curly, but distinct from nappy, to being almost straight, but in most cases it will be jet black (though it can sometimes be other colors).
