<dd>I believe (as reflected in the edits I have made) that this article should primarily confine me to the Civil Rights movement between 1945 and 1970, with references of course to the historical background for the movement and the results of the movement.

<p>Your links agree with me:</p>
<p>3. "when they use it as an adjective they should punctuate it with periods"<br />
4. "United States or U.S. is more precise."<br />
5. "The abbreviation U.S. is acceptable when used as an adjective."<br />
7. "Spell out United States when it is a noun; use U.S. (note periods) when it is an adjective."<br />
8. "It is preferable to spell out the names of countries and federal agencies, abbreviating or using acronyms only when space is limited and then with periods."<br />
9. "The two-letter abbreviation for the United States of America uses periods."<br /></p>

<dd>It looks hackish. Best to spell it out if a clean acronym is not used. "American Civil Rights Movement" is the far more common name anyway. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>

<dd>This anonymous contributor [216.18.46.6] apparently does not recognize the special meaning of "Radical Republicans" in this context: it refers to the group of Senators and members of the House of Representatives in the years after the Civil War, led by Thaddeus Stevens, who championed "Radical Reconstruction." The mistake is understandable, since we did not link to the article on Radical Republicans; I have taken care of that. That article on Radical Republicans also needs to be improved.

<dd>This comment also highlights DanKeshet's point at the top of the page--this article sprawls too much by trying to cover blacks' struggles from 1865 (and before). While I do not think that we should set 1945 as the starting point, given the significant activities of the NAACP and others in the 1930s and 1940s, the article might benefit from some pruning of the 'background" section. Other sections, such as the part on the role of the federal government, are way too simplistic and give JFK and RFK much more credit than they deserve. Given the size of the article, we may want to spin off some subsidiary articles rather than making this one any longer and more unwieldy. A bibliography would be good too. -- <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItalo_Svevo_b9c0.html" title="User:Italo Svevo">Italo Svevo</a> 10:00, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added a link to the documentary At The River I Stand, which examines the Memphis sanitation workers efforts to unionize. This gives further context to the events surrounding King's assassination.

<dd>It's a good idea, but it probably needs its own page. Among the aspects to be covered are (1) historic exclusion of African-American workers from labor unions, particularly craft unions, and black estrangement from the labor movement, (2) labor's halting efforts to include black workers on an equal basis in the first thirty years of the last century (the IWW, Steel and Packinghouse organizing during WWI), (3) black-led unions, such as the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (which is already the subject of a good article that links the BSCP to the civil rights movement through people such as A. Philip Randolph and E.D. Nixon), (4) CIO efforts in Packinghouse, steel, auto (particularly Ford), mining, tobacco and elsewhere, (5) the modern era, when AFSCME, District 1199 and other unions took up the cause of civil rights as a union issue/workers' rights as a civil rights issue, and (6) affirmative action struggles within the labor movement, particularly but not exclusively construction, with a satellite articles on Weber v. Steelworkers, the Philadelphia plan and the like.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not all of this has to do with the civil rights movement as we usually understand it, i.e., as the assault on state-sponsored segregation, Jim Crow and white supremacy. But I don't know that you can really cover 3, 4 and 5, where the connection between the labor movement and the civil rights movement was strongest, without covering 1 and 2 as well. And once you get to 5, you really have to cover 6 as well. Which makes for a somewhat sprawling article. Any suggestions on how to do it better? --<a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItalo_Svevo_b9c0.html" title="User:Italo Svevo">Italo Svevo</a> 02:47, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Which is another point some of us have made before. This article, which mentions Newton Minow but not E.D. Nixon or Rosa Parks and which leaves out the years between Plessy and Brown, is a mess. Individually the sections are good—I like the quote from Dick Gregory, as an example—but it does not do the subject justice because there is no sense of history. Even within the period covered, for example, there is hardly any mention of the real tensions over strategy and leadership between the SCLC and the NAACP, between the SCLC and SNCC, and within SNCC. Plus, as I've said earlier, it gives the Kennedy administration far more credit than it deserves. It has the fault of many histories: looking back we know it had to turn out this way because . . . well, because it did.</p>
<p>I don't think making it longer would fix it, so maybe we need to split it into two: the American civil rights movement (1900 – 1954) and the American civil rights movement (1954 and after). The obvious split would be before and after Brown, as the movement became a sustained mass movement. I would also start the history at 1900 or so, with the Niagara movement, although obviously the forty years before would get a section. The first section would cover the battle between Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois, the NAACP's activities in those years, Garvey and the UNIA, Scottsboro and the March on Washington that didn't happen. The second would also cover Malcolm X and black nationalism, "black capitalism", the Poor People's March and Operation PUSH, and the current state of the movement, such as it is.</p>
<p>This is obviously a radical reconstruction of the article, so I won't make the mistake I've made before of hacking away without getting some sort of consensus. Nor do I claim, it goes without saying, any monopoly on the right to make changes this sweeping; there are too many people who have put time into improving it over the past few years. But I don't think we can fix it with incremental changes. --<a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItalo_Svevo_b9c0.html" title="User:Italo Svevo">Italo Svevo</a> 02:47, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IS, if you check out the history of the article, it's based on public domain text from the U.S. government. That is the explanation for many of the biases you're noting, esp. it's emphasis on government in the movement. The current structure was largely dictated by this public domain source, and I imagine, has stood so long because nobody was willing to restructure it. I would be quite happy if you were to reorganize it as you see fit, as the ideas you have stated so far seem quite appropriate to me. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanKeshet_ba33.html" title="User:DanKeshet">DanKeshet</a> 00:20, Mar 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I suggested, I have split the article into two pieces, overhauling both. While the first one (1896-1954) has no obvious narrative, the second one does, perhaps a little too much so. In the process I have eliminated a lot of anecdotal material simply because we could not fit it all in and still offer a history. Others may think I have put in too much in the way of quotations. Since this is wikipedia, you know how to make your preferences known.</p>
<p>I was not able to devote much space to the Black Power movement and none to Malcolm X or the Panthers or "black capitalism" or Operation PUSH or the current state of the movement. The fact is, I ran out of steam just as we were running up against the 31 kilobyte mark. I also cut off the history at 1968, which is certainly arbitrary, but defensible. If it sounded as if I conflated King and the movement in the last few sections of the article, I think it is fair to say that King's problems represented the movement's problems and vice versa. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItalo_Svevo_b9c0.html" title="User:Italo Svevo">Italo Svevo</a> 03:47, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The integration of the University of Mississippi (which resulted in an armed insurrection in Northern Mississippi for a time in the fall of 1962, which was put down only by thousands of federal troops. Also, in Little Rock, there were ten students, not just nine. The first day, local authorities prevented them from entering. A day or two later when the 101st was providing security only nine showed up. One of the students got fed up with the protestors and transferred to Horace Mann (an all black school). <a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMpearl_818f.html" title="User:Mpearl">Morris</a> 03:48, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no genetic or other scientific test for "whiteness" or "blackness" (Or "negroness" or "african-american-ness"). Classifying human beings according to these concepts is a POV. Any use of the terms "white", "black", "negro" or "african-american" is a POV unless a definition is provided. Centuries ago people were divided into "nobles" and "commoners". This distinction was entirely a political/religious belief, which supported the feudalist system.</dd>

</dl>
<p>I disagree. Even if we think it was a ridiculous idea, we can still have an article that discuss the division of people into "nobles" and "commoners". I think that people with any point of view would agree that during the period 1955 to 1968, that there was a partially successful movement to help one group of people gain some rights to be legally equal to the other group. <a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMpearl_818f.html" title="User:Mpearl">Morris</a> 21:21, Jun 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did put a note near the top of the article that the terms (e.g. <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a>) have evolved over time, and refering the reader to the article on that. <a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMpearl_818f.html" title="User:Mpearl">Morris</a> 21:21, Jun 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>From the perspective of the racists, a black person was someone whose ancestry included so much as a single suspected black person, just like in Nazi Germany a Jew by definition was someone whose ancestry included a single person who had practiced that religion, irrespective of what their religion was at the time of the persecution. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a>|<a href="../../../a/l/m/User_talk%7EAlMac_adb0.html" title="User talk:AlMac"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:36, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just want to add content, in order to agree with the article's title -- to be consistent with the article's present content, the title would need to be "(Some topics within the) American civil rights movement (1955-1968)" -- instead, I'm adding the needed content, in a manner as non-disruptive as possible but still more-or-less chronologically fitting into the time segment spanned by that section. Obviously I'm disagreeing with previous editors... who perhaps had good reasons for not using an accurate title, but failed to put those reasons on this talk page....</p>
<p>Also, I feel a lot of time pressure in making edits on this article. Right now, at least 2 sections are missing: 10 The March on Washington and the next section 11 Mississippi Freedom Summer. This must be due to vandalism since the history page certainly does not show their removal, missing since yesterday at least and numerous times in the recent past. My conclusion is to divide my edits up by section, doing one at a time and as quickly as possible in an attempt to NOT have a vandal making changes at the same time as I am making my changes. All I can do about it is explain where I'm coming from, in making my edits piecemeal. On the vandalism topic, if the administrators are removing comments about it in order not to encourage vandalism by even mentioning it, that's fine with me, please email me to that effect so I'll know it for the future, and remove these comments now. I'm NOT going to add this article to my watchlist, so perhaps I'll never know. I don't regard my work here as a contribution, just an unpleasant repair job that I can do because I'm familiar with the topic for the time being, and which I therefore altruistically do as an affirmative WP citizen. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFor7thGen_68be.html" title="User:For7thGen">For7thGen</a> 18:00, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>After (re)reading some of the above comments, I want to add: I see nothing wrong with splitting the article into about 4 sub-articles, to get down well under 32 KB even after years of further growth. And I LIKE the article's style, just a knowledgeable friend talking to me about a few big topics, in an encyclopedia-manner of course; provided that the main Timeline items for that time segment are kind of thrown in at the end of the topic = section. I don't like a title like "some topics within the" any more than others do, so in order to be consistent with the title, this smoothly-add-timeline-items-at-section-ends alternative is what I would choose and did in fact choose, in my edits. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFor7thGen_68be.html" title="User:For7thGen">For7thGen</a> 18:35, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

I was wikifying <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Nathaniel_Lee_a386.html" title="Howard Nathaniel Lee">Howard Lee</a>, the former mayor of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chapel_Hill%2C_North_Carolina_2de0.html" title="Chapel Hill, North Carolina">Chapel Hill, North Carolina</a>, and I came to this sentence: "His election was considered a step forward for the ongoing American civil rights movement . . . ." If I make "American civil rights movement" a wikilink, it now redirects here, which seems pretty silly in referring to an event that occurred in 1969. Suggestions, anyone? My own preference would be to make this article cover the period since 1955, recognizing that most of the material will concern the 1955-68 period but there will be some relevant items from 1969 on. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 09:20, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

That song is <i>still</i> being opposed to this day, and lots of people would claim that the Civil Rights Movement is ongoing.

<dd>Be reasonable. Claiming that the average African American earns less today than in 1950? What planet are you on? The standard of living today is incomparably higher than fifty years ago. It makes about as much sense as comparable claims for white workers ("Employees are earning less in real dollars than in 1960...") The source of almost all such "statistics" is utterly without foundation. Ask any of your parents or grandparents. I am not going to say,"If you want more evidence, just look around: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condoleeza_Rice_ea1f.html" title="Condoleeza Rice">Condoleeza Rice</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Powell_f293.html" title="Colin Powell">Colin Powell</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah_Winfrey_92a2.html" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_Angelou_560c.html" title="Maya Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Walker_2905.html" title="Alice Walker">Alice Walker</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Young_0669.html" title="Andrew Young">Andrew Young</a>..," because in 1961, I could just as well have written <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marian_Anderson_b8d7.html" title="Marian Anderson">Marian Anderson</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_Ross_60d9.html" title="Diana Ross">Diana Ross</a>, or <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Baldwin_e251.html" title="James Baldwin">James Baldwin</a>, BUT when Diana Ross or Marian Anderson travelled around the United States, they could not stay in the same hotel as some of their staff or orchestra members who were white. I grew up in an America where such achievement and accomplishment would have been almost unthinkable. Although it is definitely true that the United States still has a long road ahead in creating a society with racial equality of opportunity, we should never deny that progress has been made. It is an insult to the many brave people, both black and white, who fought and struggled so hard, to provide the degree of equality that we do have today.</dd>
<dd><i>More importantly, not everything is about money.</i> Human dignity and self-repect are also so very important. The Civil Rights movement was about these ideas, much more than about making money. Being able to sit anywhere in the bus, or being able to try on a dress in a department store are more than just about money. African Americans live in an utterly different social and cultural universe today than in 1950, 1960, and even 1970. An African American child in school today has a radically different vista open to him/her. His/Her view of the world is light-years away from what a similar child had in 1955 or 1965. As I wrote, we Americans still have a tremendously long road ahead as a nation, and I would even acknowledge that real equality is still largely elusive, but this ought not obscure the progress made. 66.108.105.21 19:32, 26 September 2006 (UTC) Allen Roth

<p>I don't know if anybody is aware but the american civil rights movement was a BIG movement in which minorities demanded civil rights, so it wasn't <i><b>just</b></i> about African Americans; mexican-americans, native americans, women, and prisioners were ALL part of the civil rights movement, and, to me, there is no mention whatsoever about this group.

<dd>I think a better solution would be to create articles for the rights struggles of other groups and then reference them at the top of this article.

However, the use of the term "American Civil Rights Movement" is commonly referenced in scholarly articles, encyclopedias, and textbooks as solely referring to the struggle by African-Americans (If you want citations, I would be more than happy to provide a list for you).</dd>

<dd>Oh, dear, was this the wrong thing to do. Leaving aside the issue of scope for the moment, the term "Civil Rights Movement" or "American Civil Rights Movement" is the <i>most common name</i> in use for this topic. The Google test: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=american.civil.rights.movement" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=american.civil.rights.movement" rel="nofollow">american.civil.rights.movement</a> nets 225,000 results, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=african.american.civil.rights.movement" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=african.american.civil.rights.movement" rel="nofollow">african.american.civil.rights.movement</a> just 23,000. Thus the name violates <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">naming policy</a>, which calls for using the most common name for something unless it is impossible to do so with clarity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This isn't a <i>generic</i> term that can be futzed with, it's the <i>encyclopedic</i> term. (A generic name would be, for example, Human rights activism in the United States.) It's the term that was used at the time, and it's the term that appears in hundreds, perhaps <i>hundreds of thousands</i>, of scholarly and academic works referencing the period. Now, I can see the urge to describe the contents of the article more accurately, but that would have required looking to a generic name as outlined. That wasn't done. The objection appeared to be that the article was not an overview of all civil rights movements in the United States. <i>That article does not exist</i>, and it's unclear whether anyone has proposed writing one. The question then becomes why we are disambiguating from an article that doesn't exist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, there is another problem with the name that I recall from a year or so ago, and that's the appended "(1955-1968)". Again, this was apparently done to fix the article's scope, but that shouldn't have been necessary, unless again there were an umbrella article -- History of African-American civil rights in the United States, for example. The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281896-1954%29_3db6.html" title="American Civil Rights Movement (1896-1954)">American Civil Rights Movement (1896-1954)</a> article does exist, and now they are named differently, which is an example of narrow awareness on the part of certain editors. That's one small problem. But I, and I'm almost 100% sure that contemporary members of the movement would agree, object to the scoping of the article as a movement for <i>African-American Civil Rights</i>. In fact, the opening of that article states, "The civil rights movement in the United States has been a long, primarily nonviolent struggle to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans." The very <i>concept</i> of the movement was to <i>enforce</i> civil rights that inherently existed for everyone, but were denied to one segment. The idea that this was a movement <i>on behalf</i> of only one segment is disturbing and offensive -- sort of the way "civil rights" have been rhetorically redefined as "special rights" that one segment is fighting to get <i>over and above</i> another segment. Thus, I object on the grounds of inappropriate and POV rhetoric (although I hasten to add it's not clear that there was any such intent, it is just an error).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thus, I hope that editors involved (yes, a small number indeed, not exactly a consensus) will reconsider the reasoning behind this name change and whether it is appropriate. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 11:13, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The page was on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> for 6 days and then re-listed for an additional 10 days. The move tag was on this talk page itself for 10 days.

James Reeb, a Unitarian Universalist minister, was murdered in Selma, Alabama, after he and twenty percent of the denomination’s ministers responded to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s call to march for justice." From <a href="http://meadville.edu/Ab_NewsEvents_CivilRights.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://meadville.edu/Ab_NewsEvents_CivilRights.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>: "The instructor, the Rev. Dr. Gordon Gibson, first encountered issues of race in the South as a Unitarian teenager. As a newly ordained Unitarian Universalist minister, he was a participant in the early phases of the 1965 Selma voting rights campaign, and served a jail sentence in Selma. From 1969 through 1984 he was the Unitarian Universalist minister in Mississippi, where the previous full-time settled minister was shot and critically injured by the Klan in 1965."</p>
<p>Although I don't have a source for the statistic, a Unitarian Univeralist minister who had marched with Rev. King once told me that half of all the white clergy who did so were Unitarian Universalist.

<p>Hi. I must admit I find the ommission of any specific mention of the efforts and dedication of Robert F. Kennedy to be quite remarkable. JFK's record on civil rights before attaining the presidency was negligible. It was his younger brother's obsession and passion for the rights of the blacks and other minorities which in very large part initiated the Kennedy administration's efforts to secure the Civil Rights acts. Robert Kennedy did more to desegregate Capitol Hill and all other branches of government than any politician before or since - he even threatened Vice Presidenct Johnson over the issue. I would be happy to write a section on RFK's work in this field, and I feel that without mention of his work this article fails to give the fuller picture of events from 1960-1968. Such was RFK's standing on this issue that on the night, and following day, of King's assassination when RFK gave a speech (on the need for peace following the killing) in Indiannapolis that city was to be virtually the only major city where rioting did not take place.</p>
<p>Having just read the article in full, virtually every mention of 'President Kennedy' or 'The Kennedy administration' ought in fact be a refererence to Robert Kennedy - who took the majority of the decisions alluded to.</p>

<p>James L. Hicks wrote a piece in the <i>Amsterdam News</i>, December 28, 1957: "1957: Year Negroes Fought Back". In it he alludes not only to Little Rock, but also to the independence of Ghana and also to the incident in which (as Scott Saul put it recently—Scott Saul, <i>Harper's</i>, December 2006, "On the Lower Frequencies: Rethinking the Black Power movement", p.92-98, the relevant passage is on p.94) "hundreds of members of the Nation of Islam lined up in strict military formation outside a [Harlem] police station when one of their own was bludgeoned by officers; the disciplined Black Muslims marched off—and the much rowdier crowd that had gathered dispersed—only after Malcolm X gave word that the beaten man was assured proper medical care." I think something about this may belong in the article; it is a landmark in the more militant side of the struggle for Black American civil rights. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:38, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't believe it is 'essayistic'. Ultimately, the Kennedys were an integral part of the of the Civil Rights history - whether one denounces them for 'privilege' or not.

<p>I'm sorry...but i don't think you have the authority to do so. The admin was not <i>at all</i> misinformed. It was a decision based on a consensus(seeing that there was no opposition) that the name should be changed. Whether you thing that two voice in the vote is fair or not is a different problem. Now i don't mind if people oppose this move...but i do have a problem with people complaining <i>after</i> the discussion was ended. The move discussion was even extended. So please don't give excuses about this and that ...b/c if people felt really strongly about it (that it shouldn't be change) people should've voiced your oppinion earlier. If you want to discuss this issue further...please contact the administrator directly. I respect the procedure. When i changed the article's title, many people opposed and said that i should contact the administator first before i make major changes, and i, too, would truly appreciate it if you would do the same.

<dd>Unfortunately or Fortunately (however way you view it) lack of awareness is <i>technically</i> a consensus. Frankly i'm tired of trying to tell people what's technically right or wrong. I followed the procedure &amp; the rules, and that is all there is to it. If you disagree please contact the administrator, and <i>please</i> do not change the name of this article without going through the necessary procedure (like i did). Thanks. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVircabutar_b798.html" title="User:Vircabutar">Vircabutar</a> 01:17, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> hated desegregation and civil rights. They hated black people, and they think that they are christian. Can you believe that? That is reaaly funny. Ha. Ha. No, actually that is sad. <span style="color:#ccf;background:#ccf;border-style: single"><a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmartie960_f5c4.html" title="User:Smartie960">Smartie960</a></span> 23:45, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
