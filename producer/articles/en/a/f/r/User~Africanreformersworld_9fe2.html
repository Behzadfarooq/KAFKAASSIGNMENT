	    <p>We at African Reformers Organisation has just concluded a seminar/workshop on HIV/AIDS /SEXUAL MOLESTATION, to the glory of God we have a large turn-up from parts of the country and we are looking forward to have an International Project that will bring Africans both at home and diaspora together and share a common ideaa on Factors affecting Youths and the General African Continent. African reformers organisation is a non governmental organisation, in Nigeria, we are hoping to network with an ineternational organisation so as to achieve her aims and objectives, to strethen and contribute to the development in the world at large.However,we wish to network so that we can contribute towards the development of humanity and solution to their distress for both the children, youth, and the olderone. As a regard of this, we wishes to hear from you soonest. Togther we aspire, together achieved, together we make great things happen, for we will , we can and we must. Mission &amp; Purpose seeks to advance the values and interests shared by voluntary organisations by fostering co-operation, promoting best practice and through the delivery of sustainable common services. such as: Current affairs, research, campaigning, conferences and seminars, training, recruitment and workforce development,Culture and tourism, advice, publications, ICT support, computer software, office supplies,project development and management, Charity Giving. Collectively these people work every day to further the aims and objectives of 20,000 voluntary organisations which support and care for communities and disadvantaged groups throughout the world. All this - not for profit but for Humanity. EDUCATION is not only a basic human right, it is a path to a better future. With education, people in developing countries are more likely to get jobs, giving them an income for food and shelter, leading to higher self-esteem. They are thus more likely to take an active part in their communities and help change what they can. Our international conterparts education campaign has seen successfully on many fronts. We would work on a campaign to persuade the government to abolish school fees; children in education.We would successfully support the most vulnerable children - street children, disabled children, children of street workers - to access school education. But it is not just children who are affected by a lack of education. Over 860 million adults cannot read or write; a shocking statistic considering that the right to education is enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human Rights.African Reformers Organisation would take an innovative approach to adult learning, Reflect, encourages groups of adults to use storytelling, drama and song to discuss issues that are important to them. FIGHT AGAINST HUNGER over 650 million people still go to bed hungry every night, despite the fact that there is enough food in the world to feed everyone. In most developing countries over half of the population live in rural areas, usually involved in farming. But often they only have small plots of land, or they can be thrown off it at a moment's notice, they don't have access to the tools they need, the land becomes degraded from overuse, and they struggle to feed themselves. Poor farmers are also being increasingly threatened by corporate control of agriculture. Trade rules, subsidies, patents and the wants of big business are all undermining the ability of small farmers to produce enough food to survive. By providing seeds, tools, training will help the less previledged people access the means to make a living, put food on the table and gain the respect of family and community. We wil also campaign across 25 countries,lobby individual country's governments to get them to change their own policies. HEALTH AIDS causes the deaths of approximately 8,200 people every single day, the majority of them in poor countries. emergencies In Africa a shocking 80 million people have been directly affected by these epidemic.International trade rules mean that drugs to treat the disease are too expensive for most poor people; the scope of the disease means that parents die and children are left both orphaned and head of the family; badly maintained infrastructures mean there are no doctors or health clinics for over 25 kilometres. The shocking reality is that: More than 45 million people are living with HIV Over 10 million children have been orphaned by AIDS In 2000 a child died from HIV/AIDS every minute Speaking out for those affected Recognising the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS across the developing world, we place a special emphasis on tackling this issue. We aim to do this through the enhancement and expansion of African Reformers Organisation programmes focused on HIV/AIDS prevention, care and advocacy. The main focus of our advocacy is to urge governments to adopt policies and programmes that prevent new infections and care for those infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS. Saving and protecting lives Disastrous though they are, emergencies do offer the potential for change for the better, if we can learn from them. African Reformers Organisation always look for ways in which an emergency can change the status,which will permit people to rebuild their lives and homes and families in a pleasant way Conflict poses one of the greatest threats to development, destroying lives and undermining efforts to eradicate poverty. At the same time, poverty and injustice can increase the risk of war and armed conflict, with wars more likely to be fought in countries that are poor and lack effective political and legal institutions. Children Rights Children are often seen, but not heard. Yet their voice is crucial to the development process. Without a specific focus on child rights, we risk missing the issues that matter to children. What are child rights? All children have human rights, regardless of their age, gender, race, ethnicity or disability. These rights are clearly set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was agreed in 1989. The Convention is the most widely accepted human rights treaty ever (only two countries are yet to endorse it) and commits governments to protecting and ensuring children's rights. Particular attention is given to the needs of: Refugee children Children with disabilities Ethnic minority children and children of indigenous origin Working children Child victims of sexual, physical or other forms of abuse Children affected by armed conflicts We believe development is more than simply achieving an adequate standard of living for the poor. It is about transforming lives and creating a momentum for change so that all men, women and children can reach their God-given potential in life. To do this, it is not enough to work with people to address the symptoms of their poverty. It is also necessary to tackle the underlying causes by speaking out against injustice, the abuse of people's rights, and challenging the structures that make people poor. Recognising the important role we have to play in this transformation process,including: Aid Increased overseas aid, effectively targeted, can help people to break out of the cycle of poverty and build a better future for themselves. Amongst others. Debt Debt still continues to cripple countries and impoverish people's lives. Despite debt relief by some countries like the UK, seven million children die each year as a result of the debt crisis. The UK can influence the wealthiest nations now to speed up the process and make debt relief more generous. Disability As many as one in five of the world's poorest people are disabled. Yet, they can seem almost invisible. Frequently set apart as different, labelled as a burden and excluded from the everyday life of society, children and adults with disabilities can become locked in a spiral of poverty and powerlessness. We believe that challenging attitudes and bringing disabled people into full view can break this spiral. PRSPs African Reformers Organisation will be an active voice on the World Bank's Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and would be working to ensure the best outcomes for the poor. Policies for poverty reduction after the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and IMF Masters of their own development? PRSPs and the prospects for the poor Trade For poorer countries to benefit from the global economy there must be a fairer trade system.A coalition of organisations lobbying for fair rules to govern world trade. The contributions and impact of volunteers are greatly enhanced when individuals and groups combine their efforts to advocate for better conditions and increased recognition.</p>
