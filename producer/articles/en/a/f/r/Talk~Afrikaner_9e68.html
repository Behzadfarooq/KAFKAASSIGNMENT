<p>Aside from the problem with weasel words (see <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words</a>) this section does not cite any sources or explain the historical limit of this classification which is no longer relevant. Is it perhaps a joke or a hoax?</p>
<p>Aside from these glaring problems, the main issue regarding "classification" (white + Afrikaans = "Afrikaner") is not even mentioned as if it is a commonly accepted classification or "ethnic group". The main problem with this assumption or classification however, is that according to the article on <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a> a shared language and race does not constitute an "ethnic group". In modern times "Afrikaner" can at best be described as a "cultural group" that possibly also includes aspects of religion and cultural traditions in addition to language and race. The other concern is the political nature of the term that meant different things at different historical periods. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeon_Steyn_e30c.html" title="User:Deon Steyn">Deon Steyn</a> 12:19, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&lt;--The term <i>Afrikaner</i> has different meanings according to the historical context<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. The classification of people into an Afrikaner ethnic group is also dependent on the historical period and quite problematic in a modern context.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/Talk%7EAfrikaner_9e68.html" title="Edit section: Historical">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Historical</span></h4>
<p>As described earlier in the article the term was first used by the early Dutch colonists at the beginning of the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>. Clearly they could not constitute a distinct ethnic group at that time, because they were still ethnically Dutch and later French and German before they formed a homogenous group.</p>
<p>Over time this group formed a distinct cultural identity with shared language (Afrikaans), religion and identity, distinct from their original respective ancestors as well as later British colonial powers.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Cape Dutch</dt>
<dd>The colonists at the Cape who did not take part in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Trek_8707.html" title="Great Trek">Great Trek</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Boers</dt>
<dd>Because if the resultant divide both geographically and possibly ideologically between the <i>Cape Dutch</i> and the participants in the Great Trek, these groups grew apart. This group comprises those who had established themselves in the eastern Cape frontier and the Republican Afrikaners who trekked inland during the Great Trek.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This distinction no longer exists, because people freely move between all areas of the South Africa. Today only regional <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialects</a> differentiate Afrikaans people from different areas, much like any other country. These dialects are however regional and more numerous than merely "Cape Dutch" or "Boer".</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/Talk%7EAfrikaner_9e68.html" title="Edit section: Modern">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Modern</span></h4>
<p>Currently it is difficult to classify anyone as an Afrikaner <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> – whether as ethnic or cultural group – based solely on a combination of language and race. Even if a person is of obvious European descent and they speak Afrikaans as a first language, it is almost impossible to claim a large genealogical link to the original Afrikaners of the Cape Colony or the subsequent ethnic group due to intermarriage with other European settlers<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, especially the large number of British descent.</p>
<p>The population of white or European Afrikaans first language speakers are also far from homogenous with regard to religion, politics or cultural practices <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Even the Afrikaans historian, Hermann Giliomee, described the classification as: (Afrikaans) "enige iemand wat lief is vir die land en wat lief is vir Afrikaans" (English: "anyone who loves the land and who loves Afrikaans"). <sup id="_ref-gilominterview_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gilominterview" title="">[1]</a></sup> --&gt; ________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>

<dd>First off, please familiarise yourself with some standard Wikipedia practices, notably:
<ul>
<li>Discussing a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_faith_4adf.html" title="Wikipedia:Good faith">good faith</a> edit before reverting it.</li>
<li>Manual of style guidelines for talk pages: <a href="../../../t/a/l/Help%7ETalk_page_601e.html" title="Help:Talk page">Help:Talk page</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the last edit, it replaced completely unsubstantiated (without cited sources) claims that the current Afrikaner population is divided into two groups ("cape dutch" and "boers"). Secondly, nowhere in my edits do I claim that there is no group as "Afrikaners" whether it is ethnic or cultural. I simply clarified that it is not a simple question of being "white" and "afrikaans speaking". If you refer to your own external sources you would see they further qualify add certain religious affiliations and according to the last census there was 2,5mil white Afrikaans first language speakers, but only 1.5mil white members of the Dutch Reformed church (language unknown). It has to be made clear that this is not a typical "ethic group" such as "Serbian" that can be distinguished by langue of "african american" that can be distinguished by race, but a combination of factors including: genealogy, race, language and religion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have attempted to bring balance and neutrality to this section, perhaps we can add more, but please discuss first. No one is trying to deny the existance of this group, merely trying to clarify it's complicated definition. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeon_Steyn_e30c.html" title="User:Deon Steyn">Deon Steyn</a> 11:46, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article on <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups.html" title="Ethnic groups">ethnic groups</a> clearly states that <i>"An ethnic group is a human population whose members identify with each other, usually on the basis of a presumed common genealogy or ancestry (Smith, 1986). Ethnic groups are also usually united by common cultural, behavioural, linguistic, or religious practices. In this sense, an ethnic group is also a cultural community."</i></dd>

<dd>It is therefore clear that the classification of ethnic groups is much more complex than you let it on to be, according to your statement <i>"It has to be made clear that this is not a typical "ethic group" such as "Serbian" that can be distinguished by langue of "african american" that can be distinguished by race, but a combination of factors including: genealogy, race, language and religion."</i></dd>

<dd>It therefore seems that all <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups.html" title="Ethnic groups">ethnic groups</a> are classified by the combination of factors that you refer to, which nullifies your argument that Afrikaners are not a "typical ethnical group".

<p>Afrikaners as an ethnical group is way too distinctive for you to label all white South Africans with Afrikaans surnames as "Afrikaners". I grew up in Bellville and our neighbours' son had Afrikaans surname just because of 1 father from 1 generation, all other generations were Flemish and also had Flemish surnames. He even looks Flemish, but spoke Afrikaans. So can you really call him "Afrikaner"? His name is Werner Greeff. Why provide scientific citations (as you ask) when this example proves to you that "Afrikaans + White = Afrikaner" simply does not work.<a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickedHorse_b95b.html" title="User:WickedHorse">WickedHorse</a> 22:45, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All white South Africans with Afrikaans surnames, who speaks Afrikaans as a mother tongue and who identifies with the Afrikaner way of life, are by default Afrikaners. Some may even have English, German, French or Flemish surnames. Afrikaners share the same genetic code as the North and Western European ethnic groups of today, these groups therefore only need to make the cultural shift to become Afrikaners or any one of the other groups. Follow the genetics, and you'll find that Afrikaners, Dutch, Germans, English, Flemish and the French share the same genetic make-up. Between all of these peoples, the dividing line is what they do during every-day life. I did not ask for broad scientific citations, I asked for sociological citations. --<a href="../../../g/e/m/User%7EGemsbok1_ed08.html" title="User:Gemsbok1">Gemsbok1</a> 16:36, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even with the most accurate sociological citations, neither myself or you would know what Okkert Brits's mother tongue is or whether he really identifies with the Afrikaner way of life. The same for all the other people you blindly categorise into "Afrikaner". And according to you, a person from the Western European ethnic groups merely has to associate with the Afrikaans culture to become an Afrikaner. What about "mother tongue" and surname? You contradict yourself. --<a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickedHorse_b95b.html" title="User:WickedHorse">WickedHorse</a> 20:01, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So now you, <a href="../../../g/e/m/User%7EGemsbok1_ed08.html" title="User:Gemsbok1">Gemsbok1</a>, change your tune again and you qualify the group "Afrikaner" with "<i>Afrikaans as a mother tongue</i> <b>and who identifies with the Afrikaner way of life</b>". This basically then comes down to a choice and canyou enlighten us all as to what exactly the <i>Afrikaner way of life</i> is? As for not being a <i>typical</i> ethnic group, I stand by that claim, because the majority of ethnic groups have a much clearer definition than things like "identifying with a way of life". --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeon_Steyn_e30c.html" title="User:Deon Steyn">Deon Steyn</a> 05:59, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still stand by the definition given, i.e. an Afrikaner is someone from European ancestry, who speaks Afrikaans as a mother tongue and who associate with the Afrikaner culture (commonly known as the Afrikaner way of life). My previous statement above about racial ancestry focused on that area only, not the entire definition. You may refer to the "Culture" section to find some detail about the Afrikaner culture.

<p>Going on current definitions of "Afrikaner", the onus is on <i>you</i> to prove that Okkert Brits's mother tongue is Afrikaans and that he associates with the Afrikaner Culture. Unless you cite personal interviews from media references or other similar reliable sources, you are purely speculating these people's "Afrikaner" ethnicity, and must have a third agenda as Deon Steyn has speculated. Nevertheless, in the absense of proof provided by you as explained above, I will start removing all of the people in the Category:Afrikaners from that category unless properly proven by explicit sources in each and every article about the person, starting as soon as I get time. --<a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickedHorse_b95b.html" title="User:WickedHorse">WickedHorse</a> 18:57, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact is – as you have admitted – that a person should associate themselves with Afrikaner "culture" so you can not simply use race and language to label someone as "Afrikaner". Your second argument comparing "Afrikaner" to <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English people</a> is not a valid one either, because the one is much younger and started off as a combination of several diverse ethnic groups, apart from that it is a group closely associated to a nationality which is another important difference. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeon_Steyn_e30c.html" title="User:Deon Steyn">Deon Steyn</a> 06:46, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have acted in <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_faith_4adf.html" title="Wikipedia:Good faith">good faith</a> when I compiled the category for Afrikaners. If you delist anyone from the category without citing proof as to why they are not Afrikaners, I will argue vandalism on your part and ask for arbitration from wikipedia. You cannot force your one sided relativism view of the Afrikaner people and culture like this. You are not acting in good faith towards Wikipedia and merely using it as a mouthpiece for your current political views. The Afrikaner ethic group is in exactly the same situation as the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_people.html" title="Welsh people">Welsh people</a>, <a href="../../../x/h/o/Xhosa_people.html" title="Xhosa people">Xhosa people</a>, <a href="../../../z/u/l/Zulu_people.html" title="Zulu people">Zulu people</a> etc. with regards to the anomalies that worry you, you are therefore welcome to place your arguments in the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups.html" title="Ethnic groups">Ethnic groups</a> article where these global issues can be discussed. -<a href="../../../g/e/m/User%7EGemsbok1_ed08.html" title="User:Gemsbok1">Gemsbok1</a> 07:55, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

In that case, please also familiarise yourself with <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>. As for the Afrikaner ethnic group being in "exactly the same situation as the Welsh people, Xhosa people, Zulu people", this is a false notion, because they are very different in terms of the different defining characteristics:

<li><b>histories</b> ("Afrikaner" is shorter)</li>
<li><b>politics</b> (Afrikaner; first use was political, subsequent connotations)</li>

<dd>Please sign your comments, <a href="../../../g/e/m/User%7EGemsbok1_ed08.html" title="User:Gemsbok1">User:Gemsbok1</a> and please refrain from once again deleting or reverting sections conflicting with your view. Nowhere did that section state that there is no such ethnic group as Afrikaner. It merely shows the – sometimes political – motives, context and history of some of the very strict pseudo-scientific definitions of this "ethnic group". It is common knowledge – explained in the very references you cite – that the term "Afrikaner" has been used and changed at different times to suite different purposes. In Chapter 2 of of your last reference (<i>Institute for Security Studies on 'VOLK' FAITH AND FATHERLAND</i>), <a href="http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No81/Chap2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No81/Chap2.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> it clearly states how the "National Party" sought to unite politically diverse group by a "three-pronged strategy to promote and establish Afrikaner nationalism and to promote a separate Afrikaner identity by creating consciousness among Afrikaners based on their language, religion and traditions" in the first half of the 20th century.</dd>

<dd>A neutral point of view (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) is one of the basic principles of Wikipedia and we must guard against bias – or worse yet – subtle political undertones. I say this now, because I notice a worrying trend whereby certain editors are trying to steer a group of articles in a particular political direction. I fear that not all editors are aware of the related pages and do not see the full context when only looking at one or another. The pages in question are (apart from this one for <i>Afrikaner</i>):

<p>Firstly, it seems that you want to change all articles not showcasing your view. Secondly, I never said that there were no political connotations to the Afrikaner term, I emphasized that I did not agree with <i>your</i> political view of the term. Your effort at extreme cultural reletavism is obvious in your statements, so do not even try to pretend as if you are presenting a neutral point of view. I have been editing the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaner.html" title="Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkstaat.html" title="Volkstaat">Volkstaat</a> articles to get rid of a extremely biased and sometimes racist right wing view, but some of those views are applicble therefore none with references were deleted. I did not contribute in any major way to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_Afrikaners_9141.html" title="List of notable Afrikaners">List of notable Afrikaners</a>, or the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_in_South_Africa_aef0.html" title="Crime in South Africa">Crime in South Africa</a> article.

<dd>Firstly, I would think that all editors want should <b>correct</b> all articles that are biased, not neutral or not balanced. I don't have any political affiliation and I don't have any political view of the term, I merely pointed out that the term has certain political connotations and in some circles it is used as a political tool.

<p>I know that strictly speaking the term Boer is applied to farmer or 'peasant' but all the 'Afrikaners' I've met, and that's probably about 7 or 8, have referred to themselves as Boers, perhaps we should have a seperate article for Afrikaners and Boers, but include most of this one in the Boer one because Boers are whites whereas 'Afrikaners' include elements of the coloured community who consider themselves Afrikaner.</p>
<p>If someone could tell me why certain 'Afrikaners' find the term Boer offensive please do tell me, it only means peasant in the sense that it means common people.</p>

Boer is a very ambiguous term (the article covers that rather well). Afrikaners often jokingly refer to themselves and each other as "boere" (plural of boer), and most will accept the term if it is used by another ethnic group. The term is never used formally where "Afrikaner" is meant. However: The term can easily be taken or mistaken as an insult, often leading to flared tempers. Compare with "nigger" (sorry if that offends anyone. if it does, I give them permission to call me a boer.) An example is a piece of graffiti next to a road in Johannesburg: "kill the boer." It Should also not be confused with the real meaning of the word (farmer).

<p>That's my point, it's the way that a lot of people generalise about white South Africans and particularly Afrikaners and it's highly offensive for a lot of them and because so many believe it this article could be a platform for spreading knowledge and eradicating ignorance.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should have an article emphasising that there is an Afrikaner nation, more so than one of English- speaking South African whites who still have ties with Britain. The fact is that they are a large group of people (at least 2,700,000) and have been seperate from Europe for at least 200 years. They have a different culture, a different language. I've heard ignorant people say if they're forced out of Africa one way or another that they'll be coming 'home'? It's not like they've been on holiday, they've had probably 8 or 9 generations at least who've been born there (more for some of the original Dutch settlers' descendants) born and raised in Africa.</p>
<p>They have a nation because:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have a history together, they're bound as an ethnic group by hardship, wars and a common culture</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Their own language</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A clearly defined homeland, which they recognise as where they come from</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>No ties outside of Africa for most of them, other than commercially</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A culture seperate from that of their ancestors in Holland, Germany, Belgium or France</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
So if someone with more knowledge of their culture than myself could start an Afrikaner Nation page it would be productive in my opinion.</p>

<dd>Any such discussion or information would relate directly to this page and would not require a separate article. As for what constitutes an "Afrikaner", well that has also been thrashed out extensively on this article's talk page (see the archives) and is also covered extensively in the article. The fact is, there is great debate on what constitutes an Afrikaner ethnic group (if one could define such a group). In any event, adding the <i>nation</i> suffix would do nothing, but evoke 'white supremacist' language and notions. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeon_Steyn_e30c.html" title="User:Deon Steyn">Deon Steyn</a> 06:45, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are there Afrikaner Americans? If so, i think wikipedia needs to have an article about them. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGringo300_19ab.html" title="User:Gringo300">Gringo300</a> 05:27, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
