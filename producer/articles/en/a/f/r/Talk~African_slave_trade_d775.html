<p>Actually, the main reason about why Europeans traded African slaves, is that the Catholic Church's verdict during the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valladolid_Debate_530a.html" title="Valladolid Debate">Valladolid Debate</a> was that the natives from the New World had a Soul and should be then considered as human beings. The final turn of the debate was in continuation on the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Laws_a87e.html" title="New Laws">New Laws</a> (1542), and made a crucial impact on Spain's decision to eventually rather "take" African slaves. Then Native Americans couldn't be used for Slave Trade, although the treaty didn't really change their condition, to tell the truth... Anyway, pope <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_III_5a70.html" title="Paul III">Paul III</a> began then to promote the use of African slaves, as previous decisions would have created an economic disaster for the Spanish Crown.</p>
<p><br />
One more thing:</p>
<p>To argue that Native American's weren't able "to perform hard physical labor", it's really questionable! Even if in fact the text precises the European slaver's point of view, it should be precised as well that this argument was not actually a strong one, since most of Native Americans already practiced agriculture...</p>

<p>This article seems to err on the "cautious" side for figures (judging by a quick check on Google), and the claim that "slavery had a neutral, or even somewhat positive effect on those left behind" seems worrying enough to warrant careful checking. I've marked it as needing attention; some solid references, at least, would be nice. --19:10, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm a bit disturbed by the comment that historians currently believe that the slave trade had a "neutral, or even somewhat positive effect on those left behind in Africa." While you do make sure that this is only relevant to those left behind, the previous comments you refer to are to the slave trade as a whole, not just non-slaves. The enslavement of 12 million people cannot by any stretch be called a either positive or neutral, and I think greater care should be taken that the article does not imply that it can.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Today, however, many scholars believe slavery had a neutral, or even somewhat positive effect on those left behind in Africa." This has to be the most vile and disturbing comment I have ever come across in months, perhaps this year. Irrespective of Africa's past greatness, the idea that twelve million civilians and the millions of children they would produce being enslaved for 400 years somehow left a "positive effect" on Africa is without doubt worse than Nazi revisionism. How patently ubsurd, the sentence will be deleted. (nov 16, 2005) - XM</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While you may be personally offended by the idea, these views are today increasingly dominant one in the historiography. Please read the works of J.D. Fage, Eltis, or Lovejoy. Here, for instance, is a quote from John Thornton's <i>Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800</i>:
<dl>
<dd>As these scholars see it, slavery was widespread and indigenous to African society, as was naturally enough a commerce in slaves. Europeans simply tapped this existing market, and Africans responded to this increased demand over the centuries by supplying more slaves. The demographic impact, while significant, was local and difficult to disentangle from losses due to internal wars and slave trading on the domestic African market. (pg. 73)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Of course <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Rodney_5d02.html" title="Walter Rodney">Walter Rodney</a> still has many supporters, but increasingly the evidence seems to be pointing away from his thesis about the slave trade. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 22:50, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The demographic question is still quite controversial - Patrick Manning used computer simulations some years ago to argue that, though the Atlantic slave trade didn't actually make the population of the continent fall, it did lead to stagnation, and that the population would have been tens of millions higher in 1900 had it not occured. Eltis has, on the other hand, questioned the fertility and mortality parameters Manning used... If anything, I think the ", or even somewhat positive effect on those left behind" comment is so vague that it can't help looking offensive.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've forgotten my password, so I can't sign in, but I left the original comment that started this particular discussion. While I agree that some historians may say that there was a positive or neutral effect on those not enslaved, this is always the case. All you're saying is those that didn't suffer didn't suffer, and obviously the slave traders, who did exist prior to the European entry into the trade, got richer. All I meant was that we should be careful not to cheapen what is one of the worst episodes in human history (in terms of scale and repercussions, if not in intent) for the sake of appearing objective. I don't think any of us are in a position to weigh the misery the slave trade caused against the short term economic gains.</p>

<p>There has been a great deal of research into the number of slaves taken, and the records from this period are not inconsiderable. The 28 million figure taken from <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1523100.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1523100.stm" rel="nofollow">here</a> is the standard estimate for the total number of slaves exported in all three major trades, the Atlantic, Saharan, and East African trades. Today about 12 million is the standard figure for the Atlantic trade. Lovejoy's "The Volume of the Atlantic Slave Trade" looks at numbers of slaves leaving Africa and Curtin's "The Atlantic Slave Trade a Census" looked at the number of slaves arriving in the Americas and both came up with roughly the same figure. There are some scholars who support higher figures, but the highest number I am aware of is Inikori's 15.4 million, and few today believe that is accurate. I don't think anyone has ever presented evidence for as many as 28 million being taken. A brief overview of the numbers debate can be found at <a href="http://acad.erskine.edu/facultyweb/gettys/history409/exslavetrade.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://acad.erskine.edu/facultyweb/gettys/history409/exslavetrade.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 15:13, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This seems like a pretty lame reason to abuse African people. They did it because they were very racist. And those slaves will see these people burn in hell.</p>

<p>I'am very disppointed that people will be like this. Who cares how their look like and what different their have. Their are still human beings. NOT ANIMALS. I can image how hard was it probably for them to be treated like a slave. No where to go, just had to service their Master or his Mistress in the poor condition. If their Master doesn't have enough money or something they could be sold to anyone for the money. Slave trade was like a animal trade. Not a slave trade, which there was no Human rights for the Slave and couldn't say no because their had to feed their family to feed. While i read and found out about it. i am so disgust that human will treat other human like animals because their colour skin and their can't do the house work or work in the farm and had to let the slave work in the bad condition while their rest at home. Their should have let the slave right. Before the whole thing has started.</p>

<li>Please, it is important that these obviously biased claims be removed. A substantial portion of the population was removed. It was definitely a phenomenon that the population was aware of. Hey, where did my brother go? Let us be realistic.</li>
<li>The last sentence is completely nonsensical. And the previous few sentences seem to be made in an unfactual and opiniated way. There was corresponding population growth to counter the kidnapping of hundred's of thousands of africans? Only a people who eradicated another whole population in the new world, can speak of human lives in this manner.</li>
<li>Practices before Europeans arived are probably not that hard to come about. And a GREAT deal of slaves were KIDNAPPED.</li>
<li>These statements are extremely biased. Half were sold by african states as the mentally insane, and the other half were sold by african states as war booty? Please, somebody do some unbiased scholarship. If this is not updated soon, I will get some professors from my university to update this information.</li>

<p>I removed the following section:</p>
<p>"Building the New World was obviously going to be a difficult fete to take on. The Europeans realized that they needed help expanding their empire. Many of the natives of the New World were not useful because they were either sick or dying from the diseases that the Europeans brought over. Therefore the Europeans needed to seek help elsewhere. They chose African slaves for a number of reasons. They were hard workers, used to the climate and were immune to the diseases. The first side of the triangle is the export of good from Europe to Africa. African kings and merchants actively took part in the trading of slaves from 1450 to about 1900. For the slave the African kings would receive a variety of goods from Europe. The middle passage of the triangle was the transport of slaves to the Americas from Africa. Many of the deaths of the slaves were said to have happened during the middle passage. This is because the slaves were exposed to new diseases and also because of malnutrition. The slave ship conditions were terrible, however, the death rate on the ships were lower then those of seaman officers and passengers on similar voyages. Five times the amount of slaves were transported to the Americas compared to those transports to Europe. The third and final part of the triangle was the return of goods to Europe from the Americas. The goods were the products of slave-labor plantations and included cotton, sugar, tobacco, molasses and rum.</p>

<p>The relevant information is already in other sections of the article, and the section is badly written. Words such as 'help' and 'useful' are uncomfortably euphemistic, and the claim that Africans were 'hard workers' is also very loaded.Peyote koyote 02:33, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree we need more diversity of sources, but that said J.D. Fage is acknowledged by everyone to be one of the most prominent scholars of slavery and the slave trade, and we can't simply ignore him as he is not African. Also please try to avoid linking to videos and audio tracks for references. By the nature of the media, these sources cannot be peer reviewed, unlike book and journal articles, and thus can't be considered as reliable.

<p>I strongly disagree i have searched everywhere and one thing i have found is that a video by a historican in 2006 going 2007 is 100% as valid as any book. We are here on a website for heaven sake. There is no denying technology. The entire concept of wiki is revolutionary, If a man sits down on a video and explains populations demographics, and he is clearly a real person with an academic record at a specific university that is 200% valid. absolutly we not accept the above statement. what could be more valid. God knows who writes books.

<p>I dont what everyone you are talking about, but i removed them not for that reason beacuse they are not in any format for me to check up. see how references are done. And to sit down and only have ONE WHITE MANS book is really wrong! and arrogant. And entire article with one white voice. And Tukufu Zuberi can been seen talking about numbers but guess what he is African and hence not to be taken serious. RACISM.all over wikipedia we have this arrogance. Look at this langauage The Mighty black king, WHY black? WHo is writing this? black this and black that. Slavers and Slave traders is what they were. It shows it has been written by a European mind that has a serious POV an an axe to grind. like "ohh they were black u know" Black black black you know. They were if anything called African as they were from African not Blackia. or blackia. discuss before changing things I am open minded trust me, but i dont like white racist views of history.

<p>Just glancing through a couple of your posts Halaqah some of your arguments appear to fall in on themselves. The one above is a classic example where you are playing the race card yet, yourself, use the term "ONE WHITE MANS book", even adding emphasis. For your information colour is no indicator of knowledge even if the subject under discussion does have a racial elements. In a previous posting you asked if an African or a European would know more of the slave trade. The answer is that both have an equal chance of knowing provided they research the subject. Being Black, or white, does not impart any special knowledge. Knowledge is gained through learning and research, it is not decided by genetics.</p>
<p>When I read over Halaqah's paragraph I was stunned and disgusted. I see the words "ONE WHITE MANS book" pop out at me and I feel the need to read it because of the glaring racism. Having only ONE WHITE MANS book is really wrong? Arrogant? How so? Maybe the best books were written by African Americans. But WHAT SHOULD IT MATTER AS LONG AS THE ARTICLE IS HISTORICALLY ACCURATE? Then I kept reading. As I continued to raed I was only further confused. I got the impression that you were also saying that the article was written by a European mind. Ok, so now we have only one white mans book (which is racist to Caucasians) but also it is written by a European (which is racist to African Americans)???? Really confused - and really disgusted. It seems to me that while writing about how horrible racism is you were also contridicting yourself by being racist. Wow. Good job!</p>

<dd>Halaqah, what do you mean by putting in the "Fage links properly." The references followed standard format. Fage's book is easily checked, it is a standard text and would be available in any university library. What you seem to be implying is that a work that cannot be read online is not a valid source. I hope I am misinterpreting you, but if so that concept flies totally against current Wikipedia policy. Please read <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:reliable sources</a>. Wikipedia's goal is NPOV and accuracy, the only way this can be achieved is by relying on sources that are reliable and have been subjected to peer review. Removing references and replacing them because they cannot be checked via Google flies totally against our efforts to make Wikipedia academically credible.</dd>

<dd>You might be interested to learn that Fage was actually one of the pioneering scholars to embrace African oral history as valuable historical source. But please don't confuse oral history with videos posted to YouTube. Also, while I'm sure Tukufu Zuberi is an admirable scholar he is not actually a historian, he is a sociologist. Looking over his publications he also does not seem to have ever done much work in this area. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 16:18, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zuberi is not here as a Historian he talks about Population demographics he is very famous in this field. The problem with fage was the references and i didnt really want to take them out but the format was useless, Say i didnt know who he was, The reference were very unclear, plus the article cites only him, its like reading his book. Yes the video might be Yo tube but more important is it is Zuberi. You know how African people have to deal with academic racism, why cant people understand this? Zuberi doesnt have to be a historian, Gates isnt a historian he is is cited everywhere.

<p>When i get time i will go through this, I will not remove ref, if anything i should have ask for them to be cleaned up. But I will start adding references from African people, African scholars and make sure the language on this cite is fair and respectful, no more mighty black kings and black slave traders. 2007 academia must move on, it wasnt white people, they were Europeans, Bristish French etc, the Hausa King, this is the voice for history, not might black kings. What did black have to do with his slavery practices. I will also stress Zuberis research be added, In the video he blatently talks about "ALL OF THE RESEARCH HE HAS DONE" which means he has studied this topic. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">Halaqah</a> 00:53, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do agree that the paucity of African sources is a problem, multiple perspectives are always important. However, we have to make sure that the sources are credible and reliable. There are many scholars who are African or of African decent who do work in this area. A quick JSTOR search finds that while the vast majority of people working in this area are not African, which is certainly a poor reflection of academia, that there are interesting papers by people such as G. Ugo Nwokeji, Lansiné Kaba, and C.N. Ubah that could be incorporated into this article. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 01:57, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

My friend (adlux)where and when did i say revolution? How about FAIR PLAY. An artcile on AFrican slave trade all written by some white guy. Whats that got to do with revolution? how about academic racism and exclusion of the plurality of our society. take a look at wikipedia concept why do you think i can edit here and you can edit here. dont start ducking and diving to keep your traditions of oppressing me alive. What tone? POV, that is your problem your def, your translation, always the same rant from the eurocentric mind, African people are emotional and you are civil and studied. I am glad Simon see the inconsistency with the historical narrative of WHO IS TELLING WHOESE STORY. every human culture has a narrative style, I already know most peoples race on wiki by how they right, that is human culture. So unless African writing styles or how we use words and see things is invalid i would have to ask the likes of Aldux to stop the pointless attempts to make me feel i am "violating something", as Malcolm Said when a white man does it its alright, however when a black man does it..."--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">Halaqah</a> 10:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>i have to say that Halaqah is right, it is true that much important African history is recorded orally, but it also saddens me how passionate many people are for Africa's recognition, yet nearly any bookstore you go to contains almost nothing beyond picture books on Africa.people have the power to change that, it is sad that they dont. I have a very good friend that comes from the Masai tribe and he is well educated, he was a phd student of my fathers until he graduated and returned to tanzania. he is currently working on compiling a book with my father on African folk stories which should be published soon, point in case it is important to my father, and especially to him to have these storys recorded, before they are lost to the 'modernization' which the masai are being forced into. to be honest i know relatively little on this topic but it does intrest me, i am white/european, from the west coast but grew up for many years in the south, my closest friend is african american/black (excuse me if i dont use the politically correct term, i mean no disrespect it is truly out of ignorance) so i have seen much racism and it saddens me. despite its modernization racism is still alive in the south as with the rest of the world. i would love to say i am not at all racist, but to be frank i would probably be lying, i have no ill will towards any race but objectively speeking due to media, culture, and any number of things i am sure that all of us are guilty of at least some assumptions at some time that where based on race. yet it is exactly those assumtions that we must fight, the unconcious reactions that society has placed, we must recognize those and make changes within ourselves to lose as much racist thought or behavior as we can. that is why it also saddens me to see someone so passionate to end the opression of African Americans (once again excuse me if i am wrong) be so quick to use the same negative judgements towards white people. to assume that a white historian is inacurate, to bellitle it to "the opinions of one white man", and to get upset over the words "black king" and say it should be the Hausa King and then turn around and say white man multiple times with no attempt at being as consideriate as he himself, or anyone desereves... well i can only call that racist, and i firmly believe that you can not fight racism with racism, that only breeds more hatred. i am not deffending Fage here, i know nothing of the man, but if what was written is slandor than dont fight slandor with slandor, show facts. if you do you will not be written off and neither will your sources as long as the reader has brains enough to understand a different perspective. i understand your plight i have witnessed much racial opression first hand, but what i would ask of you, is not to lower yourself to the level of racists, but rather change those minds that can be changed. i will reasearch this more now, but i also encourage you to find some citable (by wikipedia standards, regardless of how much that may constrain them) sources that are African, because frankly i would love to hear how they differ, and understand the atrocity wich was slavery as well as possible. i came on here to get a better understanding myself because my girlfriend, whom is from Japan, so knows little about the history of African slavery do to its small affect on her contries history, was asking me many questions about slavery, i had some answers, but didnt want to misinform her so decided to reasearch the ones i could not answer. so i would also ask if anyone has any good refferences you could recomend i would love to see them so i can better inform her and learn myself. thank you everyone for your time. any coments or sources please feel free to email me aahroon@gmail.com thanks.</p>

<p>I'm in the process of looking in to this, but MUCH more research needs to be done about the VERY prominent role that these Charleston Jews played in the African slave trade, the slave trade which was overwhelmingly centered in the city of Charleston in North America (especially after The North became increasingly abolitionist-oriented) until about 1807, when the slave trade was outlawed (though it certainly continued, albeit quietly).</p>
<p>Also, South Carolina eventually had more African slaves living in the state than non-slaves (as Wikipedia says: "For most of its history, black slaves made up a majority of South Carolina's population.") and the slave owners constantly feared a large slave-uprising or insurrection; indeed, even in modern times African-Americans are about 1/3 the population of the state of South Carolina, possibly a bit more.</p>
<p>It seems that wherever there was a very early North or South American synagogue or large Jewish presence you also find a prominent slave market, both in North and South America (along with the Caribbean and North Africa). All evidence points to the fact that it was a <i>very large role that Jews played</i> -- not to mention the fact that many of these Sephardic Jews hailed from the Netherlands, and everyone knows that the Dutch played a huge part in the African slave trade (<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Netherlands_53cf.html" title="History of the Jews in the Netherlands">History of the Jews in the Netherlands</a>), and that they had been recently expelled from Spain and Portugal (<a href="../../../a/l/h/Alhambra_decree.html" title="Alhambra decree">Alhambra decree</a>), but the <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crypto-Jews_9ef6.html" title="Crypto-Jews">crypto-Jews</a> remained -- Spain and Portugal were both THE dominant shipping powers around this time. The oldest synagogue in North or South America was established in 1636 (the Kahal Zur synagogue in the Dutch capital of Recife, Brazil). Eventually Brazil had more African slaves than any other place on Earth. There were also many Sephardic Jews living in North Africa (a traditional Sephardi area) which served as a jumping off point where the slaves were gathered (see <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triangular_trade.html" title="Triangular trade">Triangular trade</a>) by both local Arabs and these Sephardi Jew collaborators and then shipped to North or South America.</p>
<p>There was also an amazingly large slave market in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newport%2C_Rhode_Island_c6b0.html" title="Newport, Rhode Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, which is the site of the oldest synagogue in North America (<a href="../../../t/o/u/Touro_Synagogue_bf44.html" title="Touro Synagogue">Touro Synagogue</a>); check out these stats: "As early as 1708 African slaves outnumbered indentured servants in Rhode Island eight to one. In fact, between 1705 and 1805, Rhode Island merchants sponsored at least 1,000 slaving voyages to West Africa and carried over 100,000 slaves back to America. More slave ships would leave Colonial Newport than any other American port of that time. By 1770, one out of every three Newport families owned at least one slave" <a href="http://www.colonialcemetery.com/082706.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.colonialcemetery.com/082706.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>Please we do not need anymore fage, he is know for his legacy of anti-African rhetoric, most African academics credit him as this. He contradicts and makes a mockery of African suffering. How can you say "not all bad" can you say this about the Jewish Holocaust? I am sure if we look we can find some good. You cannot remove tags and revert work. Basil Davidson more states it was horrible than anything else. plus no references. and we cannot have anymore fage in this topic please, let other ref be allowed, he is a seriously disputed source for valid references on Africa.

<dl>
<dd>That you disagree with someone is no reason to slander them with personal attacks. Fage is one of the world's leading scholars of African history and the slave trade. He was editor of the Cambridge History of Africa, co-founder of the Journal of African History, and author of a standard text book. He is about as authorative a source as you can get, and you can't simply dismiss him as invalid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to your changes, please check the article. The paragraph you readded that begins "The slaves came from many different sources" already exists in the new "Source of slaves" section. The two other paragraphs you are trying to add also exist in other parts of the article. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 07:27, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
he slanders Africans, he is a valid racist, proof of what we have been working with. not everything he said is invalid, he must be viewed with caution. he is your authority do not beg the question. J<b>.D. Fage is acknowledged by everyone to be one of the most prominent scholars of slavery</b> what about African insistutions, they dont see him as nothing. You dont even see the level of arrogance in this statement. I dont blame you, how could you know what you are saying, if you been trained to think like this from day one. Think outside the box, who is fage, who made his famous, where is the work of Dubois? who has greater access to getting printed, whose opinion protects the advantage of white people? so he is famous because he is white and he is famous because he supports the anti-African voice in history, just like Kant and others no difference. This is not a reason for notability in 2007, I am sorry. These agents of mis history are no longer the scholars on Africa. p.s i am reading his book now.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሀላካሕ)</a> 07:30, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, please stop with personal attacks. Fage is best known for arguing that the slave trade was not a demographic disaster for Africa. This might or might not be true, and certainly many scholars disagree with him, but that he holds this view, which does have quite a bit of hard evidence behind it, does not mean he is a "racist" who "slanders Africans." We do need a diversity of sources in this article, even if most modern scholars generally agree with Fage. Rodney is the obvious counterpoint, and if you are looking for fame and notability he far outshines Fage, however his work is several decades out of date at this point. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 08:03, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Sorry but you have 7 refernces to fage already, this is extreamly unfair especially if i have voiced serious opposition to using his outdated and racist material. Again and again he says everything to belittle and make less the reality of the holocaust on Africa. No one could do this to Jewish people, he would be called antisemitic. Considering what he is saying what are his sources? In anyevent 7 refernces to him on the same slant cannot be valid. he constanly hammers the same agenda, it was good for Africa, they sold each other out, it was so bad after all. This is highly offensive and racist and i have a right to say so because it is known to be so he has no cred in African circles. He is a European with a Eurocentric opinion on a people his ancestors enslaved. 7 ref remain of fage, find someone else. The quality of this topic is not balance if he is in here over and over and over again, and saying things which are anti-African. How could slavery be good for Africa? Holocaust was good for Jews? the ones that made money from it? nonsense.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሀላካሕ)</a> 09:15, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That you repeatedly say that you disagree with Fage does not make him an invalid source. You cannot deny he is a prominent voice in this subject, and even if you disagree with his views you cannot simply delete all the arguments you disagree with.

<p>do you appreciate what slavery has done?. Go in a bookstore at random and pick up a book on slavery, who has the dominant voice if not the oppressors, fage is a known member of the camp of academic racism. I emailed Temple University and got some feedback and there isnt any debate on who he is, so here we are and you are quoting him 9 times and then you get another person saying the samething and add him in, then you find another person with the same content and add him in as well. It isnt a list of what fage thinks, make one new point and move on, it is editorizing to say "fage says" and "so and so agrees" and guess what "so and so agrees as well" on the same point. Why dont you add Kant and Hume to the discussion, they are more famous than Fage? <b>Most scholars agree</b> with him, there you go again Asante doesnt agree with him, Karenga doesnt agree with him, Rodney doesnt agree with him, Shareef doesnt, Mazrui doesnt, Zuberi doesnt, Hilary doesnt (Hillary Beckles), the list is very long, actually most Africans dont. 9 ref to the god of African history, it is tarzan all over again.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሀላካሕ)</a> 23:45, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To my knowledge Karenga, Mazrui, Asante, and Zuberi have never published anything in this area. Beckles is one of the leading experts on slavery in the Carribean, but has not done much work on the African context. Rodney is an extremely important writer in this area, and his views are addressed in the article, the main difficulty is that his work is now thirty years out of date. The most prominent poeple working in this area today are Lovejoy, Manning, Eltis, Thornton, Miller, and Inikori. Of those only Inikori pretty much thouroughly rejects Fage. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 03:52, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am taking my time to be respecful to your contributions. I am finding much strange statements Slavers in Africa made a lot of money, if true how could slaving be profitable for Europeans, somebody had to get the short end of the stick, Europe paid a lot for slaves but Europe profited, but fage would say it didnt really work out for Europe. Basil states they got very little for slaves and as time went on they got even less, like 1 gun for 10 slaves. How can you get rich if you r at war everyday looking for slaves, these statements regardless of where they come from are poor in construction. Many Africans went to english universities, who, when where, it is a statement of great contradiction to known facts (show the records of their uni admissions, fage doesnt) where are these sources. Fage could write Africa was rubbish is it valid, read Hume and Kant can we add that here as a valid argument " African never had a history" for this same reason much of Fage, esp in the negative is a joke in our times, out dated and racist, not to mention beyond logic. taking 20 million people and causing wars and bloodsheed was good for Africa. Holocasut was good for Jews and had no effect on their population, that is the weight of the comparison. because some Jews got rich--but how many 4% 19% of Africans got rich? 1% 0001% fage is citing opinion not history. look at his sources and see. he is defending academic racism. Another issue is you are doing personal edits and linking things without sources, judging content and making poor links. re: fage and friends. And Soliders didnt go to Africa to end slavery, wonder why they would be noble so fast. we can either write an honest account or just add madness for the sake of plurality which is a silly activity as plurality is for balance not listing any and everything in a big rubbish bin--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሀላካሕ)</a> 09:30, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>SimonP pick a truth, Basil said Euros got SLaves and Africans got guns, clothing and cheap tins and pans, how can a gun make a nation rich? When you trade gold and ivory its not the same as trading human beings. So which one is it? Most historians agree that Africa got an unequal deal even the same Joseph E. Inikori.
