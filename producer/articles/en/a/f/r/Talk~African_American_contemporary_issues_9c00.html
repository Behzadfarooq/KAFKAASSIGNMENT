<p>The article made a point that employers seem to be indifferent about whites who serve yet appreciative of African Americans with military experience. This is an interesting point, but it seems out of place in the article. I think someone needs to ask their local AfrAm Studies major to whip this whole article into an encyclopedic article.

<p>The author of this article has not taken heed to the numerous conscientious suggestions of others in the discussion section. It grossly distorts facts and has an overwhelmingly negative, pessimistic tone. This article serves no useful, informative purpose, and I fear that the less informed will be further misinformed after reading this article. Either clean it up, or remove this article completely. This article is unscholarly and pedestrian at best. Kemet 19 Nov 2005.</p>
<p>This article is currently on its way to NPOV - compare the current with the former and much more POV version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=African_American_contemporary_issues&amp;oldid=16904066" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=African_American_contemporary_issues&amp;oldid=16904066" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevey7788_7be5.html" title="User:Stevey7788">Stevey7788</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevey7788_4943.html" title="User talk:Stevey7788">talk</a>) 18:19, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article is a move in the right direction, but I think it needs to make changes in the language to avoid the types of generalizations that deny the profound diversity between African Americans. The sections "Institutional racism and discrimination, Environmental racism and Public education and failing schools" clearly indicate that the author already has pre-conceived notions of how African Americans live---many African Americans have overcome institutional racism and discrimination (it can, in fact, be argued that much of the malaise among those of the lower classes is from internalized, not white, racism), most do not live in environmentally racist environments, and failing schools is a problem largely confined to members of the working and lower classes (many of whose members still perform very well when measured according to mainstream criteria). Keep working [musicus, 24 July 2005]</p>
<p><br />
This is stupid. The article on <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> was fine and far more substantial when this was an integral part of it. And how the hell can this claim to discuss these issues from the "unique perspective of the African American experience" (or whatever the hell the flimsy introduction said) -- when contributors are not (and should not be) limited to African Americans?</p>
<p>This -- and the other sections should be reintegrated into the original article. After all, Wikipedia is an online <i>encyclopedia</i> -- and the articles it presents should have some depth of treatment. The article on African Americans in its present, truncated form, once useful and informative, now just sux.</p>
<p>Whose decision WAS this? It should be changed BACK to the way it was. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 23:24, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I believe in the exchange of ideas and opinions, but 'this is stupic' 'sux' 'whatever the hell' are not the way an intellegent person discusses issues in an intellectual format.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is a work-in-progress. Nothing is cast in stone. Everyone is allowed to contribute and that's both its strength and its weakness.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>No, the main article wasn't 'fine'; it was too long [approaching 32KB] and involved. Further, it departed from 'African American' in a way that <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_American_b5d5.html" title="Irish American">Irish American</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_American_4105.html" title="Italian American">Italian American</a> do not. I don't mean to say that it was bad (although it still needed work). You are correct; the article WAS informative. That does NOT mean that <i>all the information has to be in one place.</i> Many, many Wikipedia topics are split into subtopics and articles. There is no reason, for example, for Chitterlings or what was traditionally called The Black Church to be discussed in detail in a main article on African Americans.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I agree that the intro to this could do with a rewrite. It wasn't intended to suggest that only African Americans will be writing this. By all means rewrite it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It will help if you do not take a proprietary attitude towards articles to which you contribute.</li>

<dd>I don't take a "proprietary" attitude about what I write. However, truncating the article doesn't make much sense. Take a look at "jazz," for instance. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and one expects entries to have length and substance. And, of COURSE the article can be improved upon. My comment about it's being "fine" had to do with its overall structure; it was not a line-by-line appraisal. Your separate, truncated entries are really weak as stand-alone pieces. Perhaps, you should have taken the time to try to write some a decent introductory paragraph to them before slicing and dicing the original.<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 16:16, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"African-American" IS manageable; it is also mis-manageable.&#160;:-p I frankly do not believe the subject has been better served by hacking it up into curious side topics with clumsy introductions that do not stand alone well. As for "Irish-American," I believe someone SHOULD write a similar article which seeks to be a comprehensive overview about them, if one already does not exist. While I have crusty, old, peg-legged white-rapist Irish-American ancestor, the group is not a particular interest of mine -- so, I'll leave that one to someone so inclined.<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 11:28, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Further, there is no difference among a comprehensive article on "jazz," or "race," or "African American." As I stated earlier, Wikipedia is FULL of lengthy articles when the subject merits; that's what an encyclopedia is. It's not a dictionary. It makes no sense arbitrarily to bowdlerize an article because someone gets the notion in his head it's simply "too long." I think the article -- and its component pieces as they now stand -- while certainly not perfect, had far more integrity as a whole. I think you've made a mess. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 11:37, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just noticed your silly comment about a typo: "Further, mistakes will always be made (and jumped on by others) eg. '...to write some a decent introdtory...' It happens. &#160;;)" What? You're equating a simple typo (and in the "Discussion," no less -- who cares?) with the intentional mutilation of an article because it's "too long"?

<p>Once again, a nameless editor has reverted my contribution in this regard. This is not POV; it's a matter of historic record. Police and elected officials often were complict in mob actions and lynchings of black people. (Read Ida B. Wells' accounts -- or anyone's, for that matter -- of the wave of lynchings and riots that swept the U.S. from slavery to the Mississippi Blood Summer of 1964 and beyond. It's the police's <i>job</i> to uphold the law. And when segregation and discrimination were sanctioned/mandated by law, that is precisely what they did. They upheld a system that oppressed and sanctioned the murder of innocent black people. After all, what happened when Rosa Parks defied the rule that blacks had to relinquish their seats to white passengers? She was arrested by the police! And such things as this have contributed to the hatred, antipaty, distrust and antagonism with which some black folks regard the cops. It is reverted.

<p>---</p>
<p><i>Historically,</i> white supremacy <i>was</i> the law of the land. (Duh!) It is a fact that police were often complicit in the lynchings of blacks. Not to mention the fact that law enforcement regularly participated in the apprehension of runaway slaves and their return to lives of bondage. It was their <b>job</b> to keep whites in power and blacks in check. (Did you even bother to read what I wrote earlier re the arrest of Rosa Parks?) One needn't, after all, be a member of the Klan or of a lynch mob to be a racist white supremacist. (Another <i>big</i> "duh") As I said, Ida B. Wells' accounts of lynch-mob violence are replete with incidents where the police were complicit in such events. You'd have to have been in a coma all your life to be unaware of this fact.</p>
<p>And even in more "enlightened" times, police <i>still</i> acted in collusion with such groups. In 1964, in the killing of Cheney, Goodman and Schwerner, the police deliberately set them free in the dead of night, so they could be apprehended and beaten (and eventually murdered). Civil rights workers knew local law enforcement was not to be trusted -- and so did the federal government -- which is why the National Guard was called in, in Little Rock and called in to protect civil rights workers during the freedom rides and after the murders. Furthermore, there was FBI collusion in the murders of the three civil rights workers in the summer of 1964 -- or hadn't you heard? If you saw the film "Mississippi Burning," don't believe it. It was a flat-out Hollywood lie. Willem Dafoe's FBI agent character was an "artistic device," because film writers and producers believed that the film had to have a white hero for the film to make big box office. Dafoe <i>said</i> as much. In reality, the local G-men (MBI) were in cahoots with the bestial, redneck bastards who perpetrated the killings. This, too, was known from the start. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 08:43, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I googled "police collusion with KKK," and the first file I opened was: <a href="http://www.gjf.org/index.php?page=tvcoverage" class="external free" title="http://www.gjf.org/index.php?page=tvcoverage" rel="nofollow">http://www.gjf.org/index.php?page=tvcoverage</a>. And this was in <b>1979</b>. That's just one instance. It was worse centuries before that in the days when cops were openly members of the White Citizens Councils and grand dragons of the Klan. What kind of Pollyanna world have you been living in? Reverted. Again. Next time, you can spare <i>both</i> of us a lot of time and trouble and ask <i>first</i> -- before you repeatedly revert text you <i>think</i> is POV without even so much as a single word in discussion. *x*<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 19:26, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The disputed text re the cops is not at all about what <i>you</i> think about the cops; this is about the experience and opinions of <i>African Americans</i> -- which are based on historical fact and collective experience. No one even remotely familiar with the history of this nation and the issues surrounding law enforcement and ethnicity would dispute the accuracy of this text. And the facts about who commits white-collar crime are widely known. Time for a reality check. The NPOV warning tag should be removed.

<p>Is this article too pessimistic or slightly racist? Any way we can improve this? This article only focuses on the African-American lower class, not the middle and upper classes. There also seems to be a slight trend toward describing blacks as "criminals," although most blacks are actually VICTIMS of criminals of their own race and are hard, honest workers being discriminated by society. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevey7788_7be5.html" title="User:Stevey7788">Stevey7788</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevey7788_4943.html" title="User talk:Stevey7788">talk</a>) 00:06, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I don't see the need for the article. And, yes, I <i>do</i> think it somewhat racist -- not the content (now), but the fact that no other ethnic group of which I am aware has a similar page on Wikipedia. There's nothing about the "contemporary issues" of white folks, or "Latinos," or "Latvians," etc. I don't think people would like to see what I would have to say about a "contemporary issues" page on white folks!&#160;:p If I had my druthers, I'd delete this muthaf***** altogether. But this was the alternative to having a main article on African Americans that dealt with some of these issues as though it defined who African Americans are as a people -- which was <i>really</i> offensive/racist. I think each of these issues should be dispersed into their related articles (and I don't at the moment know which of these articles actually exist currently or not: healthcare/health care delivery, public health, crime, policing, etc., etc., etc.) or dropped completely. IMO, this approach sux and is <s>symptomatic</s> illustrative of the way blacks tend to be viewed by outsiders in society -- as a "problem."</p>
<p>Anybody in favor of nominating it for deletion? Count me in. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 20:43, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Instead of deleting this, I think this article shouldn't discuss much about the "criminal" and "problem" stereotypes of African Americans. Otherwise, this article could be racist or POV. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevey7788_7be5.html" title="User:Stevey7788">Stevey7788</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevey7788_4943.html" title="User talk:Stevey7788">talk</a>) 23:54, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>After carefully reading this, I have decided that some parts of this article are absolutely gross. We need an NPOV cleanup. Please also remove the repeated use of "disproportionately" - we may like to use another word instead. Additionally, the introduction and endings do not need pessimistic touches. Instead, let's do some brush-ups and add some optimism. I've already done that to the Economic concerns section. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevey7788_7be5.html" title="User:Stevey7788">Stevey7788</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevey7788_4943.html" title="User talk:Stevey7788">talk</a>) 23:57, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is extremely skewed in that it appears to treat AA's as a problem population. How on earth can one have an article devoted to "contemporary issues" among African Americans without a section on institutional racism? (It boggles the mind.) At any rate, I've included some suggested topics that could use development (and there are others -- like the plight of black farmers, etc.) I must say for the record, however, that I have some reservations about this entire piece. Where is there an article on "White Americans: contemporary issues"? (Man! I could go on <i>forever</i> about white folks' issues.)&#160;:p <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 03:11, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is clearly racist. As both a casual and occasionally paid historian of both African and African-American History I will do my best to contribute more balanced and more importantly, research-based material to this article over the next few months. As a sidebar, it's very disappointing to see yet another topic that concerns African-Americans being hoarded over and manipulated by non-black contributors who are either obsessively paternalistic or transperently bigoted. How come there is no white flight in African-Americans studies? lol</p>
<p>How many African-Americans are doctoring the page of Irish-American history? While we may have some perspective we recognize what white people seem to struggle with - you are in the best position to share your own history. We don't fret over your biases or objectivity, we don't accuse you of being unable or unintelligent when it comes to recounting your own ancestral legacy. We let you recall your history in <b>your</b> words. Perhaps this is a life lesson we can pass along, one ethnicity to another.</p>

<dd>Are you telling us that outsiders are in no position to objectively describe the history of another people? That's what it sounds like. By your reasoning, only the people themselves have the right to tell their story. If that's the case, then how are we ever going to know anything about long-dead peoples, especially ones who didn't have writing? It means that the only valid history of, for instance, China, is one written by a Chinese person. Do you really believe that no non-Chinese person is able to understand Chinese history? Do you really mean to be pushing such a racist view?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Put more positively, there are insights that outsiders may glean that insiders overlook. Furthermore, insiders may be under pressure not to tell the "truth," but an approved story instead (again, the example of Communist China comes to mind).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to me that the best history combines the experiences of the insider with the neutral observations of the outsider.

<dl>
<dd>To respond to your points:</dd>
<dd>1. Of course POV and racism should be removed, but I have a question: What if black <i>are</i> a problem in society? (That's not a statement, but a hypothetical question.) According to the Department of Justice, blacks are <b>seven</b> times more like to commit murder than whites, and the absolute number of black murderers exceeds that of whites. (See this: <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/race.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/race.htm" rel="nofollow">Homicide trends in the U.S.</a>) Is it POV or racist to point this out? Is it wrong to point out that murder is a societal problem?</dd>
<dd>2. Statistics are a valid method to show group behavior. Would you prefer that we relied on guesses, hunches, and feelings? How would the removal of scientifically-gathered data improve the article? Also, while I agree that the comparison of blacks and whites can be unbalanced, the best method to fix that shortcoming is to add comparisons with other ethnic groups, rather than delete this one.</dd>
<dd>3. <b>YES</b>. Sources, sources, sources!</dd>
<dd>4. Why? As an American, I take pride in the extraordinary accomplishments of <i>all</i> Americans, regardless of their ethnicity. I admire <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Douglass_7ab5.html" title="Frederick Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a> (African-American), <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ming_Tsai_3a82.html" title="Ming Tsai">Ming Tsai</a> (Chinese-American), <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Calbraith_Perry_461c.html" title="Matthew Calbraith Perry">Matthew Calbraith Perry</a> (Irish-American), <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Edison_ebd8.html" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a> (Dutch-American), <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Shinseki_1e08.html" title="Eric Shinseki">Eric Shinseki</a> (Japanese-American), <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lindbergh_87dc.html" title="Charles Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> (Swedish-American), and more.

<p>I don't know how useful "contemporary issues" is as an encyclopedia topic; we certainly don't seem to have other articles of this sort.

<p>The wiki page <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_emancipation.html" title="Political emancipation">Political_emancipation</a> could use some attention. Currently it is only a stub. Particularly the explanation of the term 'political emancipation' entailing 'equal status of individual citizens in relation to the state, equality before the law, regardless of religion, property, or other “private” characteristics of individual persons' is construed to be an 'opinion' and 'not delivering a neutral point of view.' Does anyone have more information on the word 'emancipation' also being used in the political context of establishing (or any step moving towards) equality in light of the law? Inserting the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Voting_Rights_Act_e309.html" title="Voting Rights Act">Voting Rights Act</a> as such a step of political emancipation was repeatedly erased.</p>
<p>The question one could pose, is: When there have been only 3 African-American Senators in modern times (out of more than the 1500 Senators in total), would you say that political emancipation has been achieved? Does the political system in place really deliver? See: [<a href="http://www.localparty.org/CalSenators.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.localparty.org/CalSenators.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] as an example I found online. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrickS_44c2.html" title="User:FredrickS">FredrickS</a> 18:39, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I dont know what you people are complaining, you are clearly seeing only what you want to. There is no racism in that article, I thought it was almost biased in favor OF Blacks. Its a good article that requires no change.</p>
<p><br />
In the areas of Affirmative Action and speaking about problems of racism in the opening, it seems a bit biased. I think it's safe to say that while the country has made strides in dealing with discrimination in recent years, racial tension is still at least a -fairly- significant problem in a lot of places in the United States. I really think that while this isn't necessarily POV-pushing, the article as a whole just needs a quick run-over to find any potential problems with neutrality or accuracy, and then we can go from there.</p>
