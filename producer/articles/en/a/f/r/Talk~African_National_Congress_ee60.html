<p>I can only find one clear factual error: the ANC did not fight the 1994 provincial elections in coalition with the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party].</p>
<p>For the rest, there is a certain selectivity in the choice of facts -- why a grant to the ANC by the Saudis merits special mention is unclear -- and some selectivity: Anton Lembede and AP Mda, the two Africanists who formed the ANC Youth League, are ignored and it is also unclear why John Dube should be listed as the founder of the ANC when Pixley Seme and Sol Plaatje were at least as significant.</p>
<p>Choices of significant figures are also highly subjective and I would wonder why Robert Sobukwe is mentioned as a key ANC figure rather than as founder of the PAC [Pan Africanist Congress] or why Sydney Mufamadi is listed as a key figure after 1994 when most analysts would choose many other ANC politicians ahead of him.</p>
<p>That said, the entry was surprisingly accurate (perhaps I have low expectations): one clear factual error only is less than I would have expected.</p>

<dd>M&amp;G's argument makes more sense - unlikely that they joined forces to fight this.

<dd>The M&amp;G expert was correct. There was no electoral alliance between the ANC and IFP in 1994. The statement has already been changed by me, and it now says that the alliances were entered into AFTER the elections, but I left the disputed tag in.

<p>I edited the wording slightly. The ANC has been in power since 1994 at the national level, but not alone (eg, IFP has held ministerial posts), and not in every province for all this time. Peter, 2006-06-14.</p>

<p>The date and moment that white and other racial groups were allowed to join the ANC has been omitted.

<p>Although the current ANC is properly covered, the history section needs to be cleaned up and enlarged. There is no mentioning of the historically-important happenings, like the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_the_People_0321.html" title="Congress of the People">Kliptown Convention</a>, the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharpeville_massacre.html" title="Sharpeville massacre">Sharpeville massacre</a>, the <a href="../../../s/o/w/Soweto_uprising.html" title="Soweto uprising">Soweto uprising</a> or the democratic front in the eighties. It also excludes Nobel laurate <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Lutuli_1a9e.html" title="Albert Lutuli">Albert Lutuli</a>, who was ANC's president and who gained international recognition for both the struggle and the party. Oliver Tambo's exile set up in Maputo and later in Zambia, where also Thabo Mbeki had his growth. Could a list be set up of important ANC leaders? Many of them are mentioned on the page, or they should be mentioned. (Govan Mbeki, Chris Hani, Joe Slovo, Bram Fischer, etc.)</p>
<p>(These suggestions are written by a Norwegian with only a minimal knowledge of South African politics, but I see a lot is missing, to an extent it seems misguiding. I only read Mandela's biography, or read any historical document about anc)</p>

<p>Most attacks by the ANC was aimed againsta unarmed people.

Every known resistance force in the world has been called terrorists.. Until they won. But it's sad that there actually exist people, who still linger to the old apartheid propaganda that ANC were terrorists.

<dd>Either you supported the ANC cause or the apartheid system? I'm afraid you are ill informed.

<p>The Magoo bombing and St James Church massacre, amongst others, were cleary acts of terrorism by any definition of the word. They were aimed at civilian targets and not against government or military institutions. Currently Robert McBride who was responsible for civilian deaths by planting the Magoo's bomb, is a metropolitan police chief, an appointment that he received on the strength of his ANC ties, after he was released from jail, again thanks to an ANC pardon. In view of these facts, calling the ANC a terrorist organisation is not apartheid propaganda. In my opinion it would widely be regarded as fact.&#160;: <a href="../../../h/n/j/User%7EHnjvr_c5ac.html" title="User:Hnjvr">Hnjvr</a> 17:52, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It says: "The ANC received most of its financial and tactical support from the USSR, which orchestrated military involvement with surrogate Cuban forces through Angola. In 1985 a group of businessmen, led by Dr. Theuns Eloff, met with the ANC in Lusaka and again in Dakar in 1987 but they returned empty-handed with the ANC immovable in their demand that there be a total capitulation of the White Regime. After the fall of the USSR, however, and the resultant demise of the Cuban exercise, which also brought an end to the ANC's funding, a more conciliatory tone from the ANC resulted in peace talks in the early 1990s, which ultimately resulted in a negotiated constitution, which has since been upheld by the courts."</p>
