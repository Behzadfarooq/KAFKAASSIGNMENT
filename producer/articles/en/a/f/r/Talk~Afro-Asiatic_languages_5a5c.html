<p>We have a terminology problem with the phrase language family. I would say Afro-Asiatic is at least as abstract as Indo-European.</p>
<p>I can't answer that question, I only know that the Semitic languages, judging from some household Arabic, some Biblical Hebrew and five words of Amharic are probably closer to each other than e. g. the Germanic languages.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The phrase "language family" is intentionally vague. Germanic is a language family, as is Indo-European. They're both "families" of languages. Some classifications try to distinguish <i>families</i> (about the time depth of Germanic or Semitic), <i>stocks</i> (about the time depth of Indo-European or Cushitic), and <i>phyla</i> (about the time depth of North Caucasian or Afrasiatic). However, there is no objective way to be rigorous in decided whether a particular grouping should be a family, stock, or phylum, especially when comparing larger or poorly supported languages groups, and few linguists bother. You might get an opinion that Afrasiatic, Altaic, or North Caucasian is older or more diverse than IndoEuropean, but might have a harder time ranking them against each other. --<a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Isn't the most typical terminology "super-family" for a group like Afro-Asiatic (or Indo-European) and "family" for subgroups like Berber (or Italic)?</p>
<hr />
<p>But another problem: The number of native speakers seams to be somewhat to small: If I am right, Arabic alone has more than 200 millions. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakob_Stevo_0c41.html" title="User:Jakob Stevo">Jakob Stevo</a> 15:45, 1 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I got the epicene plural from <i>Chadic Overview</i>, which states that the gendered plural in Semitic and Berber is an innovation. Can you give examples in Egyptian and Beja? What does anyone else say about the plural? -<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreAbbat_a2d0.html" title="User:PierreAbbat">phma</a> 01:22, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

In Beja, the article varies: something like e- m.pl., te- f. pl., but I'd need to check the book. I know Chadic, and I think Omotic, have epicene plurals, but they don't seem to be all that universal in what Bender calls "Macro-Cushitic". - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 19:07, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm vaguely considering setting up an Afro-Asiatic WikiProject to try and encourage the development of a more complete set of articles on Afro-Asiatic languages: anybody interested? Recent work of mine that would tie in includes <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber_languages.html" title="Berber languages">Berber languages</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Berber_languages_32aa.html" title="Northern Berber languages">Northern Berber languages</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chenoua_language.html" title="Chenoua language">Chenoua language</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/d/Soddo_language.html" title="Soddo language">Soddo language</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bench_language.html" title="Bench language">Bench language</a> (in progress). It would be unrealistic to hope to get every language; but it would be nice to have at least a couple of representatives of every Afro-Asiatic subfamily, and to have some better sub-family articles for Chadic and Cushitic especially. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 08:00, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

Map showing the distribution of Afro-Asiatic languages</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ouch. I've been busy creating maps for African language families since I thought this subject could use some color and visualization. The image to the right (<a href="../../../upload/d/da/Afro-Asiatic.png" class="internal" title="Afro-Asiatic.png">Afro-Asiatic.png</a>) is one of them. However, I see that I am a little Africa-minded: I forgot to include the Semitic languages outside the African continent... Forgive me! It will take some time to create a map including the distribution of the Semitic languages <i>outside of Africa</i>, since most of my sources are from an African linguistics perspective. Can someone give me some clues? - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">Mark Dingemanse</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse"><small>(talk)</small></a> 17:05, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Looks pretty good! But surely it includes too much of <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a>? - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:42, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Arabic is spoken in the Syriac (Syrish?) part of Kurdistan, and a band in the south of Turkey, with an offshoot into central Kurdistan, according to Stroomer's (2002) map. The TITUS and SIL maps confirm this Afro-Asiatic offshoot, as far as I can see. See this quick and dirty map of the precise area. However, I am not at home in that area, so I'd be curious to hear your thoughts. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>¶ <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">Mark Dingemanse</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse"><small>(talk)</small></a> 18:51, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hmm. I guess it makes sense that there would be an overlap between Arabic and Kurdish around there, and I'm certainly willing to take Harry Stroomer's word for it. That's a good solution he adopted, actually - coloring in mixed Arabic-Kurdish areas lighter as a transition zone... - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 19:08, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yep, that's a good solution. I also like the way Linguasphere takes inhabitation into account. The layout I have chosen for this series of maps does not permit such subleties. For maps like this that's not really a problem though; they are only meant to present a quick overview of the distribution of the phylum. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>¶ <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">Mark Dingemanse</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse"><small>(talk)</small></a> 01:03, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hallo, I would like to ask the people responsible for the content of this page of anybody else who could know, about the source of the following information which appears in the article about the Afro-Asiatic languages.</p>
<p>In the section "Common Features and Cognates" there is the following table:</p>
<pre>
  Some cognates are:
  b-n- "build" (Ehret: *bĭn), attested in Chadic, Semitic (*bny), Cushitic (*mĭn/*măn "house") 
  m-t "die" (Ehret: *maaw), attested in Chadic (eg Hausa mutu), Egyptian (mwt, mt, Coptic mu), 
  s-n "know", attested in Chadic, Berber, and Egyptian;
  l-s "tongue" (Ehret: *lis' "to lick"), attested in Semitic (*lasaan/lisaan), Egyptian (ns, 
  s-m "name" (Ehret: *sŭm / *sĭm), attested in Semitic (*sm), Berber (isem), Chadic (eg Hausa 
  d-m "blood" (Ehret: *dîm / *dâm), attested in Berber (idammen), Semitic (*dam), Chadic, and 
</pre>
<p>From which book is this information ?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p><br />
See the Etymological bibliography section; they're from:</p>

<p>It's an interesting book, by the way, though regrettably it mostly neglects Berber. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:53, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>When I last spoke to Fleming a couple years ago, he said he grouped Egyptian, Beja, Chadic, Berber, <b>and Semitic</b> against a very diverse Cushitic, with Ongotá as a tentative third branch of this "Erythræan" family (that is, Erythræan + Omotic = Afrasiatic). The article states that he grouped Semitic with Cushitic, but gives no reference. Is anyone able to verify? --<a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 21:42, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Looking back at Ruhlen's Guide to the World's Languages, I realize I phrased that ambiguously; there was not meant to be any implication that Cushitic and Semitic grouped together. Apparently, Fleming 1981 divides non-Omotic AA into three branhces: Semitic, Cushitic, and everything else. If he's changed his opinion, that would certainly be worth changing. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 02:04, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm translating this article into Portuguese and I'd like some help. I'm not sure what this means: <i>a set of emphatic consonants, variously realized as glottalized, pharyngealized, or implosive</i>. Does it mean that all (or many of) those languages have a set of emphatic consonants, and that in some language they are the glottalized ones, in other the pharyngealized ones, and so on? Thanks in advance. <a href="../../../r/c/a/User%7ERcaetano_c88c.html" title="User:Rcaetano">Rcaetano</a> 10:20, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's exactly what it's supposed to mean. However, there may be some overlap. For instance, in Arabic <i>q</i> counts as an emphatic consonant, though I don't believe it's pharyngealized like the others. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 11:06, 2005 Jun 2 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I take that back. Arabic <i>q</i> affects vowels the way emphatic consonants do, but that doesn't mean that it would itself be called emphatic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that is what it means. As a rule, they are pharyngealized in Berber, Arabic, and Aramaic, glottalized in Cushitic, Omotic, and South Semitic, and implosive in Chadic. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 16:49, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Mustafaa, by "South Semitic", are you including the languages of Yemen and Oman, or just Ethiopic? <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 20:02, 2005 Jun 2 (UTC)

<p>Thank you. This is enough for me to translate it correctly. However, I still don't quite understand it. I'm not a linguist, I don't speak any Afro-asiatic languages and I know it's difficult to describe sounds in written form, but could you tell me what does it mean for a consonant to be emphatic? The <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emphatic_consonant.html" title="Emphatic consonant">Emphatic_consonant</a> article doesn't help much. Are there emphatic consonants in other languages? What about Hebrew?</p>
<dl>
<dd>In general, the "emphatic" consonants in Arabic are <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharyngeal.html" title="Pharyngeal">pharyngeal</a>. Basically, this means that in addition to whatever else is going on in the mouth to pronounce the sound, the back of the throat is partly closed up at the same time. In addition to affecting the consonant sound, it also affects the sound of the following vowel. Most modern dialects of Hebrew have lost the emphatic sounds. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichwales_1fa0.html" title="User:Richwales">Richwales</a> 05:03, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Figure given in the article of "285 million people" is obviously not correct, if you go to the link for "Semitic" it says on that page that the Semitic group is "spoken by more than 370 million people", so obviously one of these numbers has to be wrong.

<p>What's with "Some scholars believe that, in historical or near-historical times, Semitic speakers crossed from South Arabia back into Ethiopia and Eritrea, while others, such as A. Murtonen , dispute this view, suggesting that the Semitic branch may have originated in Ethiopia."</p>
<p>Isn't the South Arabian origin of the Axumite Kindom well established (beyond some Afrocentrists)?</p>
<p>Should be stated more positively that main view is Semitic entered Ethiopia/Eritrea from S. Arabia in historical times.</p>
<p>True but S. Arabia was part of Ethiopia--Abyssinia --phenotypically similiar to modern day Ethiopians-</p>

<dd><i>Ethiopia has almost all forms of the Afroasiatic language, making it more plausible that it is the source of the Afro-Asiatic language. There is nothing Asian about it.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm sure there is indeed a researcher (or more than one) arguing that the linguistic diversity of Afro-Asiatic in Ethiopia is a good reason to consider Ethiopia the homeland of Afro-Asiatic. It should be not too difficult to find a good cite then. Also "There is nothing Asian about it" carries with it a lot of (implausible) background assumptions. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 08:54, 7 October 2006 (UTC) Oh well, the article already has a statement to this effect: "Some scholars (such as Igor Diakonoff and Lionel Bender, for example) have proposed Ethiopia, because it includes the majority of the diversity of the Afro-Asiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity, often considered a tell-tale sign for a linguistic geographic origin." So this addition only duplicated what we already had. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 08:55, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Ethiopian origin of Afro-Asiatic languages was now strongly supported by genetics. Their spread is very probably connected with the spread of Y haplogroup E3b1. 82.100.61.114 19:07, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whoever created the chart--You finally fixed the biased chart --You added north Central and north West Africa. This enterprise seems to have an Orientalist, North African caucasoid, neo Hamitic hypothesis bent to it. I was planning to address this issue but you have come close to removing one of the blatant biasses. A lot still needs to be reworded to achieve neutrality and parallel structure. Remember Ethiopia and Somalia are in the Sahel too.</p>

<p>First of all it is not what I think, it is what you did or did not do. You left out a whole family, especially the ones in West Africa and Central Africa, where the "classic negro" lives. Coincidence? I am making sure by content it lives up to the "Afroasiatic" title in terms of content. The sahel is not considered a geopolitical location as say North or East Africa. Not all of North Africa speaks Afro-Asiatic or East Africa speaks Afro-asiatic, the Nilotic language resides in those regions. If we are going to be prescise in terminology for one, do it for all. Bring on the semantic battle! I am rewording the first sentence.</p>
<p>I am also adding slight rewording to this sentence;</p>
<p>The Semitic languages form the only Afro-Asiatic subfamily extant outside of Africa. Some scholars believe that, in historical or near-historical times, Semitic speakers crossed from South Arabia back into Ethiopia and Eritrea, while others, such as A. Murtonen, dispute this view, suggesting that the Semitic branch may have originated in Ethiopia.</p>

<p>The Semitic languages form the only Afro-Asiatic subfamily extant outside of Africa. Some scholars believe that, in historical or near-historical times, Semitic speakers **may have** crossed from South Arabia back into Ethiopia and Eritrea, while others, such as A. Murtonen,**and Ethiopian scholar Ayelle Berkerie** dispute this view, suggesting that the Semitic branch may have originated in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>If it is a "may have" for the out of Ethiopia, it should should be a "may have" for not out of Ethiopia. The not out of Ethiopia sounds more credible. I have also introduce Ethiopian scholar Phd Ayelle Bekerie.</p>
