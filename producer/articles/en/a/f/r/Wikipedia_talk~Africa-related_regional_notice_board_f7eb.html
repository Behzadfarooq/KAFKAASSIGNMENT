<p>Hi, I don't suppose I could get some external comment on <a href="../../../i/r/i/Iringa.html" title="Iringa">Iringa</a>, concerning the best term to describe the Tanzanian settlement: either as a "city" or "town". I'm English, and I've been by accused of colonial sentimentality for preferring "town" and of trying to assert ownership over the article. Therefore I'd welcome wider comment from the community. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 20:03, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I ran across the article <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scam_baiting.html" title="Scam baiting">scam baiting</a> today. For those who don't know, "scam baiting" is the process of stringing along scam artists to try to confuse and humiliate them. The primarly targets are <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigerian_419_scam.html" title="Nigerian 419 scam">Nigerian 419 scammers</a>. I personally find the scam baiting to be in completely bad taste; on the one hand, these scammers are legitimate criminals, and in that sense, they deserve what they get. However, the scam baiters often take things way too far, asking the scammers to send photographs of themselves holding signs with vulgar sayings on them, taking on the personae of racists or neo-colonialists, even getting the scammers (mostly non-wealthy Africans) to send <i>them</i> money.</p>
<p>At any rate, I've raised serious questions about the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">point of view</a> of the article on <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scam_baiting.html" title="Scam baiting">scam baiting</a>. However, I fear my personal opinions on the matter may color my judgement. Please drop by and take a look. Right now, the scam baiting apologists seem to have control of the article, so I thought I'd bring it to the attention of this notice board. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 17:58, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm new here -- so if this is the wrong comment in the wrong place, please fix/move/delete as you see fit. This would-be contributor feels that the problem starts at the top: the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> main page seems neglected, eurocentric, overly concerned with racial characteristics, and conveys no sense of what Africa is actually like. I could (gradually) rewrite <i>some</i> of it, but I don't want to tread on anyones toes -- and anyway I am certain that a longterm fix would require a collaborative examination of other significant articles, eg: <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Africa_008d.html" title="History of Africa">History of Africa</a>.

<p>BT in a notice about the Smithsonian Photography Initiative suggests that "a selection of African photos from the turn of the last century" is "presumably now public domain."</p>
<p>That presumption is erroneous. It does appear that the Photography Initiative images are made available under a relatively generous fair-use policy, compared to materials in some other Smithsonian collections with which I've worked in the past. However, the site asserts copyright over its own images, says other parties may hold copyright in others, and explicitly states that it offers no warrant as to conditions of use of images in which others hold copyright.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Institute's museums and collections are not public institutions in the same sense as the National Archives or the Library of Congress. I am not sure of their exact legal status but they are some variety of what in South Africa would be called a parastatal entity -- in this country analogy might be to Amtrak or the The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which advertises itself as "a private corporation funded by the American people."</p>
<p>And of course even with LOC only some material is in public domain, while in other cases the LOC acts a custodian for material still owned by others, with varying degrees of access.</p>
<p>For extensive details on copyright issues in the P.I., see <a href="http://www.si.edu/copyright/" class="external text" title="http://www.si.edu/copyright/" rel="nofollow">Photography Initiative Copyright Terms and Conditions</a>. I think the most important parts are their definition of "fair use" and what they say about not all images being theirs.</p>
<p>Probably there is much material that could be used under fair use, but the status of images will need to be investigated. And clearly this material is asserted to be not public domain . It thus appears to fall into the usable but less preferred than clear public domain status enunciated in Wikipedia's copyright policy.</p>

<p>Just to let people know how I decide when and how to clean out/move posts in News and announcements: I'm using the noticeboard list template as a measure - figuring that a couple posts past its bottom end is as good an arbitrary limit as any. Anything less and that template runs into the to-do box, causing formatting problems. Most posts (announcements of new articles or WikiProjects, requests for assistance, etc) are applicable only for a short period. If those make it end, they are simply removed. Those posts that are still useful after the six-months, or however long it takes to reach the end of the list, are moved to the General suggestions section as probably worth keeping semi-permanently and reworded to make general.

<dd>I would suggest <i>Speculative</i> or <i>Possible</i> to modify the title you suggest. The evidence is very weak and ambiguous and not accepted by the vast majority of scholars of either Africa or Meso-America, though proponents argue that this reflects anti-black bias in mainstream scholarship. But really much of what is included in the article is not supported by the evidence; the account of the fleet sent by Mansa Musa of Mali is mostly invented for instance -- sources make very brief mention of his having sent out some sort of fleet, but not the specificity of numbers reflected in the article and certainly nothing about a return by the fleet or prolonged or repeated contact. The subject forms part of the larger debates over self-described Afrocentricity. Like other forms of Afrocentricity, the "before Columbus" claim seeks to recuperate African standing according essentially 19th and early 20th century European standards of "civilization" and theories of social evolution. A really African-centered point of view would inquire about the standards of African cultures according to their own lights as to what is good and valuable in life and the organization of society -- are Igbo societies that organized extensive cooperation and trade without the benefit of a centralized state, monumental architecture or steep gradients of social inequality necessarily "less civilized" than state-centered societies based on extensive warfare and social exploitation? The trans-Atlantic argument also has unintended consequences (at least so I presume), e.g. the claims that Africans were the progenitors of Olmec and other Mesoamerican cultures / civilizations, in aiming to claim agency for Africans, paradoxically denies it to Native Americans. <a href="../../../c/c/l/User%7ECclowe_b59b.html" title="User:Cclowe">Ngwe</a> 05:53, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Today I bought a couple of books out of the series "The Ethnographic Survey of Africa". Parts VII and XIII to be precise, on "The Central Nilo-Hamites" (by P. and P. H. Gulliver) and "The Western Lacustrine Bantu" (by B. Taylor). Both books have a substantial amount of information, including tables, maps etc. If any editor would like me to post them, or would like to know some information out of them, I would be more than happy to oblige — feel free to leave a note on my talk page or email me. They were very cheap, and I don't have the time to study them properly. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 17:16, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think "The Ethnographic Survey of Africa" was conducted by the International African Institute, a private organization, and as such the volumes probably still are under copyright. The ethnographies in the series are indeed valuable, but also need to be treated critically, as they are now half a century or more old. In the examples at hand, the category of "Hamite" -- like "Semite" reflecting old biblically-derived racial schemata referring to the sons of Noah -- came under strong criticism in the 1960s (i.e. perhaps a decade to 15 years after the Gullivers' book) as reflecting an underlying implicit racism because rooted historically in theories that tried to attribute the achievements of Sudanic peoples and states to infusions of "white blood". Please note that I am not necessarily attributing such overt motives to the Gullivers, the term was fairly conventional among European &amp; Euro-diaspora ethnographers &amp; historians at the time. But it is not today. The category "Nilo-Hamite" would be rejected almost universally by historians, ethnographers and linguists. <a href="../../../c/c/l/User%7ECclowe_b59b.html" title="User:Cclowe">Ngwe</a> 06:05, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I certainly agree. We must always take into account the era of publication, and also the people who are doing the publishing.

<dd>I think these kinds of books are invaluable for compiling the early colonial history of Africa, and indeed in trying to guess what things were like before.

<p>In the military history project we are lacking information on African military history and presence. If some of you are able and interested to help us contribute to this topic, we would gladly try to support you. But with our meagre background on African history and society, such a taskforce has been out of reach for us. Greetings <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 15:06, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since this is a subject close to me, I guess I'll respond. I hope Wandalstouring will forgive me for following him back to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Military_history_Coordinators_cccd.html#A_possible_new_source_for_recruiting" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history/Coordinators">another conversation</a> he was having about getting users in unrepresented topics who might, for example, write about "Bantu military theory and tactics development".</dd>
<dd>The issue for me, and someone on this board can probably correct me, is that I don't think any such thing exists. If it does, I think it is essentially irrelevant because doctrine, force structure and all those things that military historians obsess over play a role in a tiny minority of modern African conflicts. The substantially mixed-force conventional conflicts I can think of, where two armies line up with armor and artillery and have a go, off the top of my head are the <a href="../../../o/g/a/Ogaden_War_0389.html" title="Ogaden War">Ogaden War</a>, the <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eritrean-Ethiopian_War_2312.html" title="Eritrean-Ethiopian War">Eritrean-Ethiopian War</a> and the various ones where Israel beats up on Egypt. One could make an argument about parts of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Sudanese_Civil_War_4a69.html" title="Second Sudanese Civil War">Second Sudanese Civil War</a>, but I'm iffy about it. South Africa certainly has a substantial conventional military, but I don't recall if it's actually used it against anyone. (Anyone know if <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf-friend_659a.html" title="User:Elf-friend">Elf-friend</a> will be returning?) Going back a bit, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darfur.html" title="Darfur">Darfur</a> and <a href="../../../o/u/a/Ouaddai_Kingdom_6ab6.html" title="Ouaddai Kingdom">Ouaddai</a> had rough parity and had some nasty wars, but we barely have articles on the places, nevertheless the wars between them.</dd>
<dd>The modern African conflicts I've seen are mainly examples of <a href="../../../a/s/y/Asymmetric_warfare.html" title="Asymmetric warfare">asymmetric warfare</a>, in which the result tends to depend on external backers and local terrain, and where the really interesting questions are the "why"s of the conflict. Sure, one could write an article about the First and Second Battles of Kisangani between Uganda and Rwanda, but it's basically a nasty scramble for who can loot the most, with no real national stakes for either of them and no change for Kinshasa. Similarly, the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudan_Liberation_Movement_f306.html" title="Sudan Liberation Movement">Sudan Liberation Movement</a> isn't advertising its force structure.</dd>
<dd>I guess what I'm rambling on about is that I don't see how what I see as the MILHIST focus on figuring out the orders of battle, comparative military technology and military doctrine fits with the conflicts I write about. I'm still unsure that box at <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Congo_War_a920.html" title="Second Congo War">Second Congo War</a> that insists that users fit the combatants into two sides does more good than harm, which is coincidentally the same feeling I get at <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty_Years%27_War_f03e.html" title="Thirty Years' War">Thirty Years' War</a>, as they echo each other IMHO. No one would argue that armed conflict isn't vital in understanding Africa, but I'm not sure how you approach it in a coherent manner. Anyone else on the board have a thought on this? - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 23:16, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I heard about <a href="../../../z/u/l/Zulu.html" title="Zulu">Zulus</a> using some kind of tactic for their battles, surrounding the enemy and beating him finally with their reserves that were waiting with their backs turned towards the battle. I think it was in this time life series of world history somewhere. In the crossbow article we have a source on the West African crossbow and it hints a possible use in warfare. In the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Tondibi_03d1.html" title="Battle of Tondibi">battle of Tondibi</a> for example an initial attack with cattle is mentioned, something not unknown in Subsaharan warfare. Futhermore the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namaqua.html" title="Namaqua">Nama</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boer.html" title="Boer">Boer</a> commandos could be credited for introducing new elements to the European warfare of their time, etc. Going back to the Roman empire, they did have a war with their Nubian neighbours and finally achieved peace by retreating to their old border. Nubian archers seem quite frequent among mercenaries and I can hardly believe corps of archers employed in the Mediterranean for thousands of years did not grasp some tactics. Perhaps one could start with modern times and some examples of mercenary forces(<a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_outcome.html" title="Executive outcome">Executive outcome</a>)/military advisors(<a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a>) in these conflicts and their influence. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 18:34, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In case you need some changes to the standard procedure in military history, no problem. While we can possibly not give exact numbers for the combatants, we can perhaps tell a bit about arms and background. The Minicon (warplane) of <a href="../../../b/i/a/Biafra.html" title="Biafra">Biafra</a> come to my mind. Furthermore we could make some notes on how some of these forces work (for example <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_Resistance_Army_4768.html" title="Lord's Resistance Army">Lord's Resistance Army</a>).

<dd>You make some good points that I'll keep in mind. It's certainly worth keeping in mind if there's a relevant FA push originating in AFR. If milhist, lets us or a relevant WikiProject know when it's working on an Africa topic, you might pull in some knowledgeable editors that it wouldn't otherwise. Certainly none of the articles on my watchlist appear to have had identifiable milhist involvement, but there's a fruitful discussion at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Adowa_ddcd.html" title="Talk:Battle of Adowa">Talk:Battle of Adowa</a> between the Ethiopia WikiProject members and some milhist folks.

<p>There is a new WikiProject proposed to deal with the continent of Africa in its entirety at <a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXYZ_CrVo_WikiProject_Africa_a47c.html" title="User:XYZ CrVo/WikiProject Africa">User:XYZ CrVo/WikiProject Africa</a>.

<dd>One of the primary things I believe this project will try to do, and certainly the thing I personally intend to focus most of my project-related effort in, is determining just where the various articles related to Africa stand right now. Assessment makes it much easier to see which articles are at which level of quality, and to determine which are the most important articles related to a given subject. Once assessment is far enough along to have tagged a large number of articles, it will be a lot easier to help know which areas need most attention. An example of this would be the comparatively new <a href="../../../g/e/r/WP%7EGER_2780.html" title="WP:GER">WikiProject Germany</a>. I believe the project is only about a month old, and already a proposed separate project related to Munich is listed as a proposal, and an old inactive project relating to Prussia is being reinvigorated. I imagine similar developments could be expected here. In fact, I don't think anyone would object is the proposed Africa project were to create "task forces" (like <a href="../../../m/i/l/WP%7EMILHIST_2318.html" title="WP:MILHIST">WikiProject Military history</a>, <a href="../../../w/p/b/WP%7EWPBIO_80a5.html" title="WP:WPBIO">WikiProject Biography</a>, and some others) to deal with specific regions of Africa or specific nations of Africa. Personally, I think such developments are likely and would certainly be encouraged by the new project. Lastly, of course, there is a bit more of an active feel to something calling itself a "project" rather than a "notice board", and it may both get a few more editors involved and other editors more actively involved than the notice board itself. I can't know that, of course, but that has been my own experience with the Germany project. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 14:10, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>There has recently been a change to the <a href="../../../t/o/l/WP%7ETOL_6e15.html" title="WP:TOL">WP:TOL</a> guidelines to aid the clean-up of the biota of ... categories. It states the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Categories related to the flora and fauna of a region should should be based on the common grouping of that region used by zoological, botanical, mycological etc. publications. For example, if it is common to seperate a region based on political boundries (as in parts of Europe), categories should be seperated by countries. If it is common to seperate regions based on geographic features (such as New Guinea), categories should be seperated by geographic region."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>As this notice board probably has the most people knowledgable about Africa, I was wondering if we could reach concensus as to how we should seperate the continent for fauna/flora. Basically, there are two options (though if someone can think of another, please add it). The first would be to seperate Africa by political boundaries. This has some advantages, such as allowing people who are familiar with the countries to easily find the region they are looking for so they can find the animal/plant easily. It has a large disadvantage in Africa, however, where there are a huge number of countries with very similar flora and fauna. This means that some articles have hundreds of categories. The alternative is to seperate the continent by geographic/climatic regions, such as the Sahara, southern Africa, etc. This has the advantage of not having empty categories, as it is easier to fill them, and is better for people unfamiliar with country names.</p>
<p>According to the wording of the new guideline, the decision should be based on how the flora and fauna of a region are normally split by publications. So does anyone know from experience, what the identification books etc. use to seperate Africa. Is it geographical or political. Whatever direction we choose to take, I will create a map similar to <a href="../../../f/a/u/Category%7EFauna_by_continent_2e09.html" title="Category:Fauna by continent">Category:Fauna by continent</a> to aid navigation.

<p>Just now I have put reasons why I think the "History of South Africa" article should be delisted as "Good" on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHistory_of_South_Africa_06cc.html" title="Talk:History of South Africa">talk:History of South Africa</a> page. I do not understand yet how to do some of the technical stuff listed under <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_Review_4ebd.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles/Review">Wikipedia:Good articles/Review</a>, especially moving maintenance templates. Also it seems that raising the issues on the talk page first is good process. The problems in my view are profound and structural and not susceptible to any kind of quick fix by minor or even medium-major surgery; it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.</p>
<p>Having said this, I suppose it is incumbent on me to do something about it. However I won't have time for about two weeks. At that point I'd like to proceed in a way that avoids reversion wars if possible (probably not, but hope springs eternal), probably by creating a version of a reconstruction for discussion prior to substituting it. I would like advice as to whether that is a good idea and if so how I can make a space to work on it. Or should I just do a wholesale change? How are such actions looked upon in Wikipedia culture &amp; etiquette?</p>
<p>The talk page for the article indicates that up to now POV discussions have essentially been over anti- or pro-Afrikaner POV. The essence of my critique is that the article has a giant lack of breadth problem in failing to address the history of Africans and other black people in South Africa adequately, and a gross overemphasis on white politics and wars, which together produce illogical structure, factual problems, and a huge POV bias of an entirely different sort. There seems to be some probability that these arguments will create a megillah with at least some of those involved in previous edits. I'd appreciate it if other folks who think that South African history is and should be African history would take a look and see if you think I'm right or off-base.</p>

<dd>In response, the Central African Federation is not being used to define countries in these regions but is a notable example which demonstrates, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">depending on source/perspective</a>, that countries may be considered to be in any number of regions of Africa.

<p>I wandered by <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_91e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">Wikipedia:Peer review</a> for the first time in many moons and noticed that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikiProject_peer_reviews_eb5f.html" title="Category:WikiProject peer reviews">topic-specific reviews</a> have been implemented under the auspices of various WikiProjects. The way it works is that relevant PR subpages are just transcluded to all the relevant topics. This seems just about decentralized enough that the board could host it.

<dd>In the event that an Africa related article is peer reviewed, where do you propose the page is transcluded?

<p>Well, I just went a little silly and created an entire structure for peer review. The subpage is <a href="../../../a/f/r/Wikipedia%7EAfrica-related_regional_notice_board_Peer_review_2b6e.html" title="Wikipedia:Africa-related regional notice board/Peer review">Wikipedia:Africa-related regional notice board/Peer review</a> (shortcut <a href="../../../a/f/r/WP%7EAFRPR_8abd.html" title="WP:AFRPR">WP:AFRPR</a>). I've <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html#MartinBotII_on_WP:PR" title="User talk:Martinp23">informed Martinp23</a> so his bot will automatically transclude to the main <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">WP:PR</a> page. I also added peer-review and old-peer-review parameters to {{<a href="../../../a/f/r/Template%7EAfrica_noticeboard_fe9c.html" title="Template:Africa noticeboard">Africa noticeboard</a>}}, with corresponding categories at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Category%7ERequests_for_Africa_peer_review_9ec1.html" title="Category:Requests for Africa peer review">Category:Requests for Africa peer review</a> and <a href="../../../o/l/d/Category%7EOld_requests_for_Africa_peer_review_ab75.html" title="Category:Old requests for Africa peer review">Category:Old requests for Africa peer review</a>.</p>
<p>Based on past experience, I don't imagine that this will be an incredibly active subpage, but I figured that I'd get all of the administrative details done now so nobody has to work through a backlog at some point in the future. Please watchlist the peer review subpage. I imagine that editors seeking peer review are also free to add a relevant bullet in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Portal%7EAfrica_Things_you_can_do_c602.html" title="Portal:Africa/Things you can do">Portal:Africa/Things you can do</a> with a link to the subpage.</p>

<dd>I believe that one can inhibit with NOTOC and then build a customized TOC using the built-in identifiers of the section headers, but that's way beyond my technical abilities.

<dd>Since it is done, we should probably be thinking of which pages, such as the peer review and template list, should be transferred, as well as what end state we want for the board.

<dd>I've just added the related country wikiprojects. I am not sure as well how we'd deal with the project. On one hand we have country projects and the general Africa project. It would seem redundant but i believe we can redifine the scope of the African project in a way or another. I'd suggest though that we limit the project to general articles which are not country specific (i.e. Military history of Africa Vs. Military history of South Africa). -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">FayssalF</font></font></a></i> - <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: gold"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 11:35, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I'm against transferring sections from the board to the project. It must be observed that the board has a far longer history, and much more members, so I'd prefer to keep the new peer review section here, as also the new articles.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 22:16, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, but didn't you just give a reason for transferring the peer review? It's less than three months old, and I'd hazard a guess that 90% of the people in that list down there don't know it exists. I think we should move the peer review it and the stub messages subpages over the the project, and scale this page back to, well, a noticeboard. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 00:35, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've probably been as forceful as anyone in arguing against the creation of a WikiProject Africa, and I still do not see how a COTW/M can be supported. That said, the project appears to have attracted the taggers and evaluators, which is no small resource. I had envisioned the board having the functions that don't require large amounts of knowledge in common, while avoiding the pitfalls of forcing a group of people who don't have well-meshing knowledge bases to form highly organized task groups. I haven't changed my opinion but it would be silly to maintain WikiProject-esque pages here. This is simply counter-intuitive for editors not familiar with the CSB to board history. I don't know what that leaves the board, and I'm not sure it leaves it with anything but knitting circle duties, but I feel uncomfortable giving the project anything less than the best chance possible for success in improving Africa articles. I&#160;!vote for moving all subpages as well as, depending on how people feel, the award. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 06:32, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've also had a flick through some of the second user's contributions. Some articles (such as <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bai_Bureh_149a.html" title="Bai Bureh">Bai Bureh</a>) are heavily based on the Heroes book but are probably just about safe from copyvios. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7ECherry_blossom_tree_d84a.html" title="User talk:Cherry blossom tree">Cherry blossom tree</a> 13:24, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm a fan of the bot list. The manual lists missed most newly-created Africa-related articles. The bot's list should be a useful list of articles which are likely to be related to Africa, and may be of interest to contributors to this noticeboard. If it's throwing up unrelated articles, it sounds like its parameters need editing. If you have some examples, that shouldn't be difficult to do. Even if it were decided not to transclude the bot list (and it seems to have lots of support on the talk page), there is absolutely no need to stop the bot operating. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarofdreams_f9b2.html" title="User talk:Warofdreams">talk</a></i> 01:29, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
