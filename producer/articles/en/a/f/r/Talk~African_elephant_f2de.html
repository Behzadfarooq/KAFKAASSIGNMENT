<p>From the introduction: <i>Although it is commonly believed that the genus was named by Georges Cuvier in 1825, Cuvier spelled it Loxodonte. An anonymous author romanized the spelling to Loxodonta and the ICZN recognizes this as the proper authority</i><br />
The references I can find online record (Blumenbach, 1797) as the author of this name eg <a href="http://nmnhgoph.si.edu/cgi-bin/wdb/msw/names/query?scr_mode=T&amp;name=Loxodonta+africana" class="external autonumber" title="http://nmnhgoph.si.edu/cgi-bin/wdb/msw/names/query?scr_mode=T&amp;name=Loxodonta+africana" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> It appears to me that Cuvier may have mispelt it, but that would explain the anonymous correction back to Laxodonta. And does <i>ICZN recognizes this as the proper authority</i> mean they recognise <i>Cuvier</i> or that they recognise <i>Loxodonta</i> (is there an online copy of the ICNZ authority for this). This ref seems to say ICNZ doesn't accept Cuvier <a href="http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/bio/life/mammalia/proboscidea/elephantidae/loxodonta/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/bio/life/mammalia/proboscidea/elephantidae/loxodonta/index.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>&#160;??? --<a href="../../../a/g/o/User%7EAGoon_ec38.html" title="User:AGoon">AGoon</a> 22:56, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Corrct. Cuvier made a mistake, and the ICZN accepts the anonymous authority over Cuvier. The MSW reference you cite is both out of date and note saying what you think it is saying. It says Cubier, and that Blumenbach is the authority for the type species. MSW3 correct this and properly credits Anonymous, and explains this all much as in our article. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 13:15, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My confusiion was not being familiar with the way things are described on the MSW pages. I saw that Blumenbach named it in 1797 and didn't understand why he wasn't given credit. I now see he named it <i>Elephas africanus</i> not <i>Loxodonta</i>. --<a href="../../../a/g/o/User%7EAGoon_ec38.html" title="User:AGoon">AGoon</a> 21:20, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are still confused. Each genus has a type species. Before <i>Loxodonta</i>, all elephant speces were in <i><a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephas.html" title="Elephas">Elephas</a></i>. Cuvier came around ad said, "What ho! These elephants from Africa are significantly different than those elephants in Asia. I hold up this species <i>Elephas africanus</i> as typifying of the African species." Blumenbach had already named that species, which is now <i>Loxodonta africana</i>. But, as we said before, Cuvier gt the naming wrong, and he was anonymously corrected. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 22:31, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please do not edit my posts to a discussion forum even when I'm wrong!, of course you are welcome to post followup corrections&#160;:-). Thankyou, my confusion stems from comparing infoboxes for the African Elephant to similar wikipedia pages in other languages. I've finally realised that my problem is that I've been comparing this African Elephant <i>genus</i> page with those for the African_Bush_Elephant <i>species</i> on other language wikipedia pages.

<p>This info can be found in the "African Elephants" section of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephants.html" title="Elephants">Elephants</a> I didn't thoroughly read through it but as short as the article currently is I know it doesn't include a lot. Even though the stuff about Forest Elephants and Savanna Elephants is probably in those respective articles, it really does belong here.--<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFuzznut_dce0.html" title="User:DavidFuzznut">DavidFuzznut</a> 05:44, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>African elephants are distinguished from Asian elephants in several ways. The most noticeable difference is the ears. Africans' ears are much larger and are shaped like the continent of their origin. The African elephant is typically larger than the Asian and has a concave back. Both males and females have external tusks and are usually less hairy than their Asian cousins.</p>
<p>African elephants have traditionally been classified as a single species composed of two distinct subspecies, namely the savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana africana) and the forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis), but recent DNA analysis suggests that these may actually constitute distinct species.[4] While this split is not universally accepted by experts[5] a third species of African elephant has also been proposed.[6]</p>
<p>Under the two species classification, Loxodonta africana refers specifically to the Savanna Elephant, the largest of all the elephants. In fact, it is the largest land animal in the world, standing up to 13 ft (4 m) at the shoulder and weighing approximately 15,400 lb (7,000 kg). The average male stands about 3 m (10 ft) high at the shoulder and weighs about 5500–6000 kg, female being much smaller. Most often, Savanna Elephants are found in open grasslands, marshes, and lakeshores. They range over much of the savanna zone south of the Sahara.</p>
<p>The other postulated species is the Forest Elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis). Compared with the Savanna Elephant, its ears are usually smaller and rounder, and its tusks are also thinner and straighter and are not directed outwards so much. The Forest Elephant can weigh up to 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) and stand about 10 ft (3 m) tall. Much less is known about these animals than their savanna cousins because environmental and political obstacles make them very difficult to study. Normally they inhabit the dense African rain forests of central and western Africa, though occasionally they do inhabit the edges of forests and overlap territories and hybridize with bush elephants.</p>
<p>In 1979, Iain Douglas-Hamilton estimated the continental population of African elephants at around 1.3 million animals.[7] Although the estimate was controversial due to the large dose of guesswork it contained,[8] it is very widely cited and has become a de facto baseline that continues to be incorrectly used to quantify downward population trends in the species. Through the 1980s, Loxodonta received worldwide attention due to the dwindling numbers of major populations in East Africa, largely as a result of poaching. Today, according to IUCN’s African Elephant Status Report 2002[9] there are approximately between 400,000 and 650,000 African elephants in the wild. Although this estimate only covers approximately half of the total elephant range, experts do not believe the true figure to be much higher, as it is unlikely that large populations remain to be discovered.[10] By far the largest populations are now found in Southern and Eastern Africa, which together account for the majority of the continental population. According to a recent analysis by IUCN experts, most major populations in Eastern and Southern Africa are stable or have been steadily increasing since the mid-1990s, at an average rate of 4.5% per annum.[11]</p>
<p>Elephant populations in West Africa, on the other hand, are generally small and fragmented, and only account for a small proportion of the continental total.[12] Much uncertainty remains as to the size of the elephant population in Central Africa, where the prevalence of forest makes population surveys logistically difficult, but poaching for ivory and bushmeat is believed to be intense through much of the region[13]</p>
