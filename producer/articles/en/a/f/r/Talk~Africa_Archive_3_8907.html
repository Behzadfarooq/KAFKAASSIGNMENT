<h2><span class="mw-headline">What?</span></h2>
<p>"great instability, however, was mainly the result of marginalization of other ethnic groups and graft under these leaders"</p>
<p>What? This statement smacks of ridiculous and historically inaccurate assertions. African leaders CAUSED instability of many African states due to the marginalization of OTHER ethnic groups? This makes absolutely no sense, and appears to blame Africans for the state they are in. Someone clearly wrote that the scrable for Africa by European states resulted in instability, and this statement is clearly a contradiction and should be either edited or removed.</p>
<p>The "graft" part may have more credibility but still seems to need more historical fact, even under this section. - NickSmith2007</p>
<dl>
<dd>The passage quoted is talking about postcolonial Africa. It seems to be talking about leaders from one ethnic group marginalizing people from other ethnic groups. Did this not happen? Certainly, the article should not blame anyone for instability in Africa, which would be an opinion, but merely report facts. We can, of course, report opinions from notable researchers on the subject, if we can do it in an informative way. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 07:30, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cause and effect in African economies</span></h2>
<p>Africa was the poorest region on earth in the pre-independence period and had the lowest levels of investment. The article seems to imply that the lack of wealth is due to the actions of incompetent/corrupt governments even though the economic argument is against that point of view. For example, without the energy generation capacity to enable their exploitation, natural resources do not help a nation's wealth very much. Additionally the import substitution strategies that the wealthy economies used to help their development are not available to African governments. The poverty helps fuel corruption as people feel there is not enough to go around and of course that then worsens things further. Rather than the cause of Africa's poverty, the corruption and mismanagment is an effect. I have not made a change yet as I would like some opinions/discussion first as this is my first contribution. Sez who 03:26, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a very hard to argument to maintain. Some African economies post independence had very good runs of growth (e.g. Cote D'Ivoire which grew annually at 6-8% 1960 to 1985). But when these economies went wrong it was almost always down to issues of government not poverty. Also the comment on natural resources is hard to maintain. Nigeria has an income of many billions from oil but it does not trickle down well. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a><a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">|talk</a> 09:20, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The causes of the state of Africa's economy could be debated ad infinitum. I don't think there is any consensus amongst economists either on the cause or how to fix it. With this in mind, I think the section would be better served to just describe the state of the economy and maybe a single paragraph listing the various causes people ascribe. A thorough treatment of the causes and the debate would be better in a separate article. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 05:43, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, persistent national poverty is attributed to (in no particular order) resource dependence, corruption and unequal trading partnerships. The word persistent is important as the historical causes of national poverty are of course "historic" for want of a better word. The criticism of African economies/leadership is not to do with them ever having been rich or even in a strong position. It can be summarised as "South Asia and Latin America which are also poor (although historically somewhat richer) have increased their contributions to world trade whilst Africa has not. This shows that there is a problem within African economies/governments." There is no economic scenario whatsoever in which modern day Africa could be anything but very poor given the state of the economies at independence. The criticism is that they could have maintained their positions relative to the rest of the world or even improved slightly eg from the poorest region to second poorest by undergoing a record number of years of record growth. To illustrate, take China's historically unprecedented rate of growth and add a further 60% overall to become second to last on the poverty scale. The following provide some summarisation of the theories involved in persistent poverty: Moore, M (2004)The Nation State and Globalisation, International Political Science Review 25:297-319. Pritchett, L (1997) Divergence Big Time, Journal of Economic Perspectives 11:3-18. Uslaner, E (2005) Economic Inequality and the Quality of Government, Dept of Govt and Politics, Univ of Maryland. As it stands, the article doesn't describe Africa's economies so much as make a political statement. Firstly, mention the dependence on agriculture and natural resources ie raw materials in terms of foreign earnings . Secondly, include something on the changes in the world economy that depressed the prices for raw materials then link the two items to the economic colony concept (no this is nothing to do with politics). Third, corruption worsens the poverty since already scarce financial resources are not used efficiently or fairly fueling instability and conflict. Fourth, some mention has to be made of the shift to the utilisation of information/knowledge technologies in generating wealth and the effect this has on any nation without a reservoir of expertise in this area. Fifth, as another contributor pointed out the invisible economy in Africa is actually larger than the official one. This is not a new or even controversial statement, the only controversy is how great the difference between the two is. Since this is a characteristic almost certainly unique to Africa, it deserves mention. There has to be some way of incorporating economic reality into the section Sez who 05:31, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">the real economy</span></h2>
<p>When dicussing Africa's economy, westerners often make the mistake of ignoring parts of the economy that do not involve monetary transactions. In fact, much of Africa's economy consists of subsistence farming, which amounts to considerable production of food but is invisible to the GDP.</p>
<p>For example, a subsistence farmer who grows their own food, gets many useful materials from a nearby forest, and gets clean water from a stream has a relatively acceptable quality of life but makes no contribution to the GDP. If the forest is cut down and the wood sold, but streams will be polluted, the land ruined and the people deprived of forest products that they once received free, but because cash transactions will have occured, this will be exponetial growth in the eyes of economists.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Commonwealth vs. American spelling</span></h2>
<p>There was recently a change to Commonwealth English, which was promptly changed back to American spellings. It would seem to me that the former should be preferred here. Most African countries that have English as an official language have British colonization/-sation in their past, and use British spellings. Liberia may be the only African nation to prefer American spellings, though I don't know if that's true one way or the other. Before we change back to BrE, though, I wanted to see if anyone has any objections, and if so, why. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 15:30, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did not add further links to my comments in October because I am used to thinking of certain issues in my professional capacity rather than in a more generalist way. 1) I stated that African economies were as an average the poorest on earth before independence See: The State of Africa by Martin Meredith either the introduction or the index provides a brief guide to gdp sources. 2) There seems a mistaken perception that natural resources bring wealth unless grossly mismanaged as in "Despite a vast array of natural resources, Xland remains mired in poverty..". Even though it seems counterintuitive, it doesn't work that way. See: Outgrowing Resource Dependence by Will Martin (2002) then simply put "resource dependence" and "Dutch disease" into your search engine and enjoy (ignore the organisations and their environments articles). 3)Nigeria's oil revenue figures are available and yes the political system is phenomenally corrupt. Saying that, the amounts involved couldn't run our local municipal services let alone the whole country. See: ias.berkeley.edu/africa/Events/OilHR/Nigeria%20Factsheet.pdf. 4) This is too long already so I'll wait for a response. Sez who 20:07, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Africa / Asia</span></h2>
<p>Until recently the article stated that "<a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> was considered part of Asia by the ancients, and first assigned to Africa by Ptolemy". This was recently replaced by an anonymous contributor who created the alternative assertion that "Ancient Africa extended into what is now known as Asia". Both these statements are, I think, misleading. "Africa" originally referred to an area to the west of Egypt and "Asia" originally referred to Anatolia and eastwards. Egypt and the Levant were not in either "continent", nor were the continents clearly defined in the modern sense. Both statements have elements of truth. It's true that Egypt was not originally part of "Africa" and it's true that no dividing line existed between what we now call "Asia" and "Africa". But it would be as true to say "Ancient Asia extended into what is now known as Africa" as to say the opposite. Implying that "Africa" was the concept that "extended" has POV implications. This is all about whether Egypt is considered "African" or not - a modern obsession to do with ideas about differentiating Arabic/Islamic and African/Black identity. It really has little to do with the realities of ancient models of geography. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 15:51, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've just checked up on this and have qualified my alterations. It seems that the original sentence was more accurate, but needed expansion. The point is that Greek terminology uses "Asia" as roughly synonymous with the Persian empire. There is no land-break between Anatolia, Palestine and Egypt, and from the Greek point of view there was a broadly continuous flow of countries to their east and south, encompassed by the term Asia. Of course this also means that Ethiopia would have been vaguely "Asian" too in this mind-set, but I doubt that there was any clear definition of the terminology. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 16:32, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm going to go ahead and delete this section under history of Africa. Currently all it states is that China is investing more money these days into certain African countries in order to gain natural resources and then lists the countries that China is investing in. This is TOTALLY inappropriate for a section on modern history and is completely random. Why was China even mentioned? If theres to be a section on which African countries being invested in by China then there has to be a section for which countries are being invested in by every other country which would be ridiculous. --The Way 18:50, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your very welcome. Just to highlight my edits and their reasons, I have also moved all the images to the right because it looks ugly if the text has to twist and turn around the left side images. The main article links have been replaced by the {{main}} template. Two particular issues have become apparent to me which are relevant to the nomination for a good article status. Firstly the text is grammatically and spelling-wise excellent but there are far too many short one/two line paragraphs. Ideally the the text should be condensed to form longer paragraphs. Linked with this is the need for a longer introduction, perhaps incorporating a sentence or two about the history, languages or current political status.</dd>
<dd>The second issue is there are no inline citations which could be used by a reader to check where editors had obtained the ideas from. Without them it looks like <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> which is not a good portrayal of an otherwise broad and factually accurate article. The list of external links is not a good substitute for thorough citations. The single text listed under references should be accompanied by at least four or five more general texts to give a greater breadth to the section. I will try to help with these issues but I thought it would be helpful for you all to note them before submitting for FA candidacy. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_Giant_e03e.html" title="User:Green Giant">Green Giant</a> 00:02, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As an African, I have a problem with the general notions of explorers, exploration and discovery. I take offense to being considered almost like a lost animal species, that was discovered by the mighty Europeans. And even the notion of lost animal species in Africa, is problematic. Because the simple fact of claiming that an animal species was discovered, implies that the animal had no prior encounter with humans. Similarly, the fact that History sources has a tendency to claim discovery of Africa, gives me the impression that those sources claim that we Africans were not humans, until we were "discovered" by Europeans; because were we humans, the implication would be that they were not the first humans there, therefore it was an encounter, not a heroic discovery, right?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Definition of continents</span></h2>
<p>This doesn't so much concern Africa as it concerns Europe and Asia. But in the first lines of the article it says "Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia.". Isn't it true that generally, Asia isn't considered so much as a continent, but rather as a *region* that is part of the continent Eurasia? Culturally Europa and Asia may be seperate entities, but geographically they are not. And continent is a geographical term isn't it? As for this article: shouldn't that first line go "second most populous continent, after Eurasia"&#160;??

<dd>Commonly, as most English dictionaries and compendiums indicate, Asia and Europe are considered separate <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continents</a>/regions with a somewhat discernible boundary (e.g., the <a href="../../../u/r/a/Ural.html" title="Ural">Urals</a>). While numerous disciplines may have varying – and perhaps more appropriate – definitions/delineations (e.g., physiographically describing (Africa)-<a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurasia.html" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> as a single continent or <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercontinent.html" title="Supercontinent">supercontinent</a>), all of these are to a degree conceptual constructs not limited solely by geography.

<dd>I get your point, and I think you have a good point.&#160;:) Indeed I think Wikipedia should best try to reflect the prevailing definitions. However, I think there is some confusion. By the way, I want to make it very clear that I am not trying to force upon this discussion my own POV's about the definitions of certain terms. But I think too many times on Wikipedia and in real life terms like continent, region and landmass are used confusingly. I think it is the ultimate goal of an encyclopedia to define and use such terms in a clear and consistent way, even if this is in a way that not <b>every</b> reader agrees with.

<p>This is a slightly wider debate than just this article but I don't think the general definition of continents is geographical. geographically the Americas is one continent certainly larger than Africa but is considered to be 2 continents.

<dd>Indeed you are right, technically Asia, Africa and Europa could be considered as one single continent even though they are generally considered as three very different regions of the world (hence the existent of three separate names). Often, people say that Africa and (Eur-)Asia are separate because of the Suez Canal. Following that logic, the same would go for the Panama Canal and North and South America of course, but personally I think it's kinda strange to define two separate contintents just because of the existence of a relatively small, man-made canal. Personally, I think a canal doesn't change the fact that for instance Africa and Eurasia are one landmass. I mean, the canal is like what, 10 or 20 meters deep or so? One could hardly reason that such a canal *divides* the landmass in two!&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>About the definition of a continent: maybe I haven't read into the subject enough yet, but I always thought that continent is purely geographical, while in political and cultural terms it's more appropiate to speak of regions. Obviously, North and South America are two different regions, as are Asia and Europe. But personally, I feel that calling Asia and Europe separate contintents is causing confusion by using the wrong term. The border between Asia and Europa is purely cultural, politcal and historical. On top of that: it isn't even clear where the border is. Some say Russia is part of Europa while other say it's half Europa, half Asian, for instance. This debate is understandable since the border between regions is never very clear *because* it's purely cultural, and thus very subjective.(<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagingR2_dfa4.html" title="User:RagingR2">RagingR2</a> 23:08, 2 April 2006 (UTC))

<dd>There are a variety of ways used now to conceptualize continents in the academic world, most do rely on geography. It's probably more correct to either view S. and N. America as one continent and Europe, Asia and Africa as one or view S. and N. America as two, Africa as one and Eurasia as one (which is the view I personally think is best). However, given that most people using wikipedia as a resource aren't from the academic world, per se, its probably best to use the most common definition which still holds that there are 7 continents. Hopefully that view will eventually change, but until it does I think it's best to use it, at least for this article. --The Way 07:01, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand your puzzlement. I initially missed the <a href="#Failed_GA" title="">#Failed GA</a> section myself. I saw the main list and thought that was too much for just GA. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 03:28, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Main idea of other continent's people about Africa</span></h2>
<p>I think the main image people have about Africa (including me before taliking to a friend from Congo) is a quite wrong. I used to see Africa as a country with barely any technological development, like electricity, internet... Maybe this is the main missunderstanding and that should be fixed first of all. Any comment on that&#160;? (answer at cyril.holweck at free.fr) CyrilHolweck 19:58, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I never could have said it better, Cyril. Frankly, the amount of ignorance about Continent Africa (atleast in Europe) is alarming -not to mention annoying- and, given the mordern technology here... You are right Cyril, This is the MAJOR problem that should be fixed. Check out "The Africa You Never See" on your favourite search engine prompt. You'll get a clear idea of what I am insinuating here. CodeLyric 14:36, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
