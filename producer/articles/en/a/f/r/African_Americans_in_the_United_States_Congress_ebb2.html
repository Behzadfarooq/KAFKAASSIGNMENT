The <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_e2d1.html" title="Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fifteenth Amendment</a> (ratified <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_3.html" title="February 3">February 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>) forbade the denial or abridgement of the right to vote on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and gave Congress the power to enforce the law by appropriate legislation.</p>
<p>In 1866, Congress passed the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1866_faa4.html" title="Civil Rights Act of 1866">Civil Rights Act</a> and the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction_Act_593e.html" title="Reconstruction Act">Reconstruction Act</a>, which dissolved all governments in the former <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate states</a> with the exception of <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, and divided the South into five military districts to protect the rights of newly freed blacks. The act required that the former Confederate states ratify their constitutions conferring citizenship rights on blacks or forfeit their representation in Congress.</p>
<p>As a result of these measures, blacks acquired the right to vote across the Southern states. In several states (notably <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Carolina_aeeb.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a>), blacks were the majority of the population, and were able, by forming coalitions with pro-Union whites, to take control of the state legislatures, which at that time elected members of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a>. In practice, however, only Mississippi elected black Senators. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_25.html" title="February 25">February 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiram_Rhodes_Revels_8bdb.html" title="Hiram Rhodes Revels">Hiram Rhodes Revels</a> became the first black member of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">Senate</a>.</p>
<p>Blacks were a majority of the population in many Congressional districts across the South. In 1870, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Rainey_d4a3.html" title="Joseph Rainey">Joseph Rainey</a> of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Carolina_aeeb.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a> became the first black member of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_of_Representatives_fcb5.html" title="United States House of Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>. Blacks were also elected from <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28U.S._state%29_7f30.html" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>All of these <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a> era black senators and representatives were members of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">Republican Party</a>. To many blacks, the Republicans represented the party of <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and of the <a href="../../../e/m/a/Emancipation_Proclamation_d12b.html" title="Emancipation Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, while the Southern <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democrats</a> represented the party of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secession.html" title="Secession">secession</a>. Until 1876, the Republicans made genuine efforts to ensure that southern blacks were able to vote.</p>
<p>After the disputed <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1876_f24d.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1876">Presidential election of 1876</a> between Democratic <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_J._Tilden_d57f.html" title="Samuel J.

Tilden</a>,governor of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, and Republican <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutherford_B._Hayes_76ae.html" title="Rutherford B. Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>, governor of <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>, an agreement between Democratic and Republican factions was negotiated, resulting in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compromise_of_1877.html" title="Compromise of 1877">Compromise of 1877</a>. Under the Compromise, Democrats conceded the election to Hayes and promised to acknowledge the political rights of blacks; Republicans agreed to no longer intervene in southern affairs and promised to appropriate some federal money toward southern projects. With the southern states "<a href="../../../r/e/d/Redemption_%28U.S._history%29_8817.html" title="Redemption (U.S. history)">redeemed</a>", Democrats gradually regained control of Southern legislatures and restricted the rights of blacks to vote.</p>
<p>By 1890, southern states began to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disenfranchise.html" title="Disenfranchise">disenfranchise</a> black voters. <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literacy_tests.html" title="Literacy tests">Literacy tests</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poll_taxes.html" title="Poll taxes">poll taxes</a>, and <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_primaries.html" title="White primaries">white primaries</a> prevented many blacks from voting. Southern states and local governments gradually adopted laws that <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html#USA" title="Racial segregation">segregated</a> blacks. Finally, racial violence in the form of <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching_in_the_United_States_0822.html" title="Lynching in the United States">lynchings</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_racial_violence_in_the_United_States_ba80.html" title="Mass racial violence in the United States">race riots</a> increased in frequency.</p>
<p>The last black Congressman elected from the South was <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Henry_White_0f84.html" title="George Henry White">George Henry White</a> of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>, elected in 1897. His term expired in 1901, the same year that the last president to have fought in the civil war, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_McKinley_c296.html" title="William McKinley">William McKinley</a>, died. No blacks served in Congress for next 28 years.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Americans_in_the_United_States_Congress_ebb2.html" title="Edit section: The modern era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The modern era</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Migration_%28African_American%29_16bf.html" title="Great Migration (African American)">Great Migration</a> of blacks from the South to northern cities such as <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> in the 1920s and 1930s began to produce black-majority Congressional districts. In 1928, <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_DePriest_d7a9.html" title="Oscar DePriest">Oscar DePriest</a> won the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois%27_1st_congressional_district.html" title="Illinois' 1st congressional district">1st Congressional District of Illinois</a> (the South Side of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>) as a Republican, becoming the first black Congressman of the modern era.</p>
<p>DePriest was also the last black Republican in the House for 56 years. The election of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> in 1932 led to a shift of black voting loyalties from Republican to Democrat as the Democrats became the party of economic advancement and (some time later) civil rights for black Americans. By the 1960s, virtually all black voters were Democrats. Two black Republicans have been elected since 1991, but both from white-majority districts.</p>
<p>Until 1992, most black House members were elected from inner-city districts in the North and West: <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore%2C_Maryland_9c87.html" title="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland%2C_Ohio_cd1a.html" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit.html" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark%2C_New_Jersey_17a7.html" title="Newark, New Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a> all elected at least one black member. The only southern cities to have black majority districts were <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta.html" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston.html" title="Houston">Houston</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>. The only Southern rural area to have a black majority district was the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_Delta_464d.html" title="Mississippi Delta">Mississippi Delta</a> area in <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>.</p>
<p>Following the 1990 <a href="../../../c/e/n/Census.html" title="Census">census</a>, the districts were needed to be redrawn due to the population shift of the country. However, there were various court decisions to have districts created with the intent of creating some where the majority of the population are African Americans. In order to comply with the courts, the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redistricting.html" title="Redistricting">districts were redrawn</a> by a process called <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerrymandering.html" title="Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a>. Gerrymandering is when the districts are drawn, the end results an oddly shaped map to encompass a particular group. In this case, grotesquely-shaped districts were created to link widely separated black communities. Due to this method, several black members of the House were elected from <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, rural <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28U.S._state%29_7f30.html" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a>, rural <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Carolina_aeeb.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> for the first time since Reconstruction. Additional black majority districts were also created in this way in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, thus greatly increased the number of black-majority districts. The process was supported by both parties. The Democrats saw it as a way to connect to their black voters easily, which historically votes for the Democrats. The Republicans saw it as a way to win seats more easily, since many of the Democratic voters were moved from their districts. By the year 2000, this resulted in the Republicans holding a majority of white-majority House districts. However, this made the Democratic Party more clearly "black" in Southern states, thus further alienating white voters from the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Since the 1940s, there is no state that has a majority of African-American residents. Because of this, the ability for an African American candidate to be solely elected by the black vote is not possible. This means the candidate must reach out to other races and groups to be able to elected to office, especially in the election for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a>. Despite this issue, three African Americans have been elected to the Senate since that time: <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_W._Brooke_a8c8.html" title="Edward W. Brooke">Edward W. Brooke</a>, a liberal Republican from <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carol_Moseley_Braun_cadd.html" title="Carol Moseley Braun">Carol Moseley Braun</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barack_Obama_6463.html" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a>, both Democrats from <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>.</p>

Revised. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-8071-2082-0</a>. Between 1865 and 1876, about two thousand blacks held elective and appointive offices in the South. A few are relatively well-known, but most have languished in obscurity, omitted from official state histories.
