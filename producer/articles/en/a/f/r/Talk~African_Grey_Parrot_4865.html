<p>On what basis that the link to Tinkerbell webpage got removed? By calling that as spam? Can I judge who you are? Tinkerbell link was the first external link placed into this page a few years ago.</p>
<p>What is the authority of that person and how much is his knowledge of keeping flighted parrot at home? That he want all others to partake of his own ignorance? They burn books in the past. So in modern times of Internet, bookburners turn to labelling stuff they dislike as 'spam' and deleting offending links?</p>
<p>Is it because the way to keep a grey parrot (or any parrots) is to cut the wings and take away flight from them and Tinkerbell webpage is heretical against that mindset?</p>
<p>That same mindset that also hold on to that long discarded set of misbelief that height placement of cage affect relationship of parrot?</p>

<p>Can anyone provide an authority for the claim that these parrots can imitate up to 5000 words? <a href="../../../s/e/g/User%7ESeglea_8627.html" title="User:Seglea">seglea</a> 22:47, 30 May 2005 (UTC)i can mine sang eminem moking bird</p>
<p>It's vague.

But they're certainly very inteligent and they can asociate words to objects (I think that's more important than a big number of words)</p>

I cannot understand why Mikkalai removed my edit: "Greys captured in the wild need time and effort to adapt to human presence, and have a tendency to growl.

<dd>Sorry. Restored. I cannot understand this myself. I looked into the history of my edits at this time period. I was tracking anon vandals from my watch list. Since wikipedia is a bit slowish, I usually open several windows for version comparisons. When this article was checked for suspect's contribs I most probably accidentally hit the "revert" button. I have absolutely no opinion about parrots and never edited pages about them. Sorry again. I will try harder to be more careful. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 07:19, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One is a well built authorative site showing 2nd in google for the term "african grey parrot" with lots of informative articles and other resources. The other has some information and nice pictures.</p>
<p>www.theafricangreyparrot.com has been readded. I'll leave it to other members to decide whether the other site should stay. --Notting</p>
<p>02/03/07 any reason as to why it has been removed - ive checked the guidelines and the site falls within them _ Notting</p>
<p>With due respect, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/shanlung9/" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/shanlung9/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/shanlung9/</a> is the only site that gave all the details on how to have and live with a flighted parrot. The training that is required, the environment that you need. That will enable people to stop cutting the wings and return the gift of flight back to the parrot. And enable them to take even more spectacular pictures of them and their greys. I do not pay money to Google and Tinkerbell webpage appear in the first page of Google search. There is nothing commercial in Tinkerbell site and I do not promote books that seem primarily to advocate that wings are to be cut or to advocate commercially prepared food. Do read more and you will find it contains a lot more than just 'some information and nice pictures'. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanlung_4498.html" title="User:Shanlung">Shanlung</a> 02:00, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Most of the information available in that section is taken from www.itsagreysworld.com, that site itself is owned by an experienced owner of multiple African Greys all of whom receive great individual attention according to the site. The site is contains some useful and genuine information and is very informative. The few remaining other sources are miscellaneous, and the information left by the contributor before me is not deleted. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdeditor_4e04.html" title="User:Birdeditor">Birdeditor</a> 21:07, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Surely this website should be referenced or put in the external links if the information came from www.itsagreysworld.com - Jamie Turner</p>
<p>The information is strangely identical to www.africancongogrey.com. So did itsagreyworld copied from africancongogrey or the other way? It doesnt matter at all to me since both believed that as long as wings do not touch side of cage and head tail do not touch top and bottom that it is ok. I am happy to remain an amateur if being an 'expert' meant advocating stuff like that.</p>

<p>And a whole slew of sites spewed out with that same stuff. Who copied who? Same kind of 'quality information'? Will even become self fulfilling prophecies. Was that link to Tinkerbell cut to allow those kind of stuff to go round and round new owners to be self-enshrining in stone?</p>

<p>I am again removing an external link that has ads, which makes it commercial. Forums, blogs, and bulletin boards are not good Wikipedia links either. Any domain that is added to multiple pages is spam. And the animal telepathy site is not encyclopedic.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not a link farm. DO NOT RE-ADD YOUR SITE. If your page is so noteworthy that it should be an exception to the spam and linkfarm policies, find a couple admins to review your site. Then one of them can add it back with an invisible note that it was added after review by an administrator. If I see that, I will leave it, although I can't speak for all the Wikipedia Project Spam editors (<a href="../../../w/p/s/WP%7EWPSPAM_fbb6.html" title="WP:WPSPAM">WP:WPSPAM</a>).

<p>I'd like to see a couple references to again, but I don't feel I have enough experience to do a major edit to an article such as this. Namely, I'm referring to the differences in appearance as CAG and TAG parrots age. After the first molt (around 12 months), tailfeathers grow back without black tips, but rather fully red. The iris slowly lightens from pure-black at hatch to bight yellow around 18 months. Also, vocalization in the form of human speech minicry typically develops around 12-18 months of age. Anybody feel up to it? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThadius856_6dcf.html" title="User:Thadius856">Thadius856</a> 18:46, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Would it be acceptable to play around with the idea of splitting this article up into more topics?</p>
<p>It seems <b>"African Greys as Pets"</b> is kind of a vague spectrum. In this portion of the article it covers history to care. I don't find it very organized at all.</p>
<p>I think perhaps it would be more appropriate if we seperated the article into a few different topics such as "Care and Grooming" (Or something like that) "Habits and Lifestyle" (You see what I'm getting at?)</p>
<p>I'm not saying any of the information should be dumped, but just seperated in a more organized way.</p>
<p>Anyone with me on this?</p>
<p>-Also, I may have pictures of baby CAGs if you think there is a place for them.</p>

<dd>No problem. I think we should keep the article in one piece, like I noted on your talk page, but the "African Greys as Pets" section <i>should</i> be seperated into subsections. I have tons of pictures as well, but lets worry about that for when we have a long enough article to fit a couple more pictures. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThadius856_6dcf.html" title="User:Thadius856">thadius856</a><sub><a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThadius856_2f19.html" title="User talk:Thadius856">talk</a></sub> 22:49, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>"While comparative judgements of animal intelligence are always very difficult to make objectively..."</p>
<p>Wouldn't <i>all</i> comparative judgements be difficult to make objectively, by virtue of them being comparative and not objective? Or am I totally off-piste here? 81.157.122.109 00:00, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yup you are are a bit off on that. Whether or not a comparative judgement is objective or not depends simply on whether or not the subject being measured is being measured in objective terms. Lets say for instance we looked at a comparative temperatures for London and Moscow over a year the results would be objective as there is no confusion on how to measure temperature. On the other hand inteligence is far harder if not impossible to pin down. How do you compare Einstein to Da Vinci to Mozart? All geniuses in their fields to be sure but how would you objectively test that? Then try developing a test that thart a parrot can (or will) complete...

<p>"Wikipedia spam also consists of external links to websites which primarily exist to sell goods or services, use objectionable amounts of advertising, or require payment to view the relevant content. "</p>
<p>I do not see Tinkerbell webpage exist to sell goods or services and with no advertising and no payment required. By Wikipedia defination of spam, Tinkerbell webpage is not spam.</p>
<p>WHO ARE YOU TO TAKE ON YOURSELF TO REMOVE TINKERBELL LINK? IS IT BECAUSE YOU DESIRE ALL PARROTS TO BE KEPT CRIPPLED WITH WINGS CUT? THAT SHOWING PEOPLE A FLIGHTED PARROT CAN BE KEPT IS ABHORENT TO YOU AND MUST NEVER BE SHOWN AS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY?</p>
<p>Shanlung</p>
<p>Deli nk, that self appointed censor who insist on removing Tinkerbell link knew nothing on parrots and yet see fit to burn books that she knew nothing about. After throwing out that link saying that was spam, she tried to throw that out saying thats 'inappropriate'. I cannot see how someone who knew nothing on Congo African Grey Parrots will ever know what is appropriate.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is to be a collaborative effort that bring together information on a subject. For that to be meaningful, people involved must know not just at a deep level the subject matter, they must be involved directly in the subject itself. I shared years of my life with a Congo African Grey. I am also into many major parrot forums and well known as Shanlung for years. I have yet to come across Deli nk or Pcock in those parrot forums. It is a very valid question that I ask if you have kept African Grey or even other types of parrot. If you have not, how are you going to understand what is to go into that subject.</p>
<p>It is almost like reading all books on how to swim and decide you know all about swimming without even getting into the water. Then on that basis, you will decide the appropriate reading material for swimmers and people who want to know about swimming.</p>
<p>Telling me " link is inappropriate per WP:EL and WP:RS" is not reason enough. I read through WP:EL and WP:RS long ago. How much do you know of keeping a Grey that you can interprete WP:EL and WP:RS to be the judge, jury and executioner? Can I knowing only a little on flower and gardening decide to go into flower and gardening section and decide on what people are to read?</p>
<p>For such an intelligent creature as a Grey, why do you accept what is written that they can be kept in a cage as long as their wings do not touch the side and the head and tail do not touch the top and bottom of cage. Because thats written correctly grammer wise?</p>
<p>And pick on my link that offers respect and entirely different way of treating them?</p>
<p>There is no intellectualising about keeping African Grey. You must keep a Grey before you can talk about keeping Grey. All that I have done are easily verifiable from the hundreds of photos and videos that documented them. The material I offered is to allow other Grey keepers to glimpse into a world where the Grey is allowed full flight at home for them to decide if that way is better than keeping their grey in a tiny cage where the wings do not touch the walls and head and tail do not touch the top and bottom of cage. They also have complete and free guidance in the material to do what I have done or even better. I only want for those Grey keepers their choice to chose.</p>

<dd>Just my penny-worth. I found the Tinkerbell / free flighted Grey keeping very interesting. However as a single experience it isnt that encyclopedic. I'd rather see a link to a more generalised site on flighted grey keeping (if there is such a site) either before it or instead of it if the site itself includes the info from the Tinkerbell source among others. There are upsides to flighted birds that go hand in hand with risks that need to be managed - its not for everyone but it is interesting and adds another aspect to the article which can't be a bad thing. Although the Tinkerbell site is specific to Greys the keeping of flighted parrots is quite generalised and perhaps deserves an article of its own. --<a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamE_f310.html" title="User:LiamE">LiamE</a> 04:05, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi LiamE, I want to thank TexasAndroid first as he rescued this entire section from being burned. I also restored that very important and balanced article on wings clipping. That was written by Pamela Clark, one of the foremost parrot behaviour consultant. That article was based largely on her experience as a breeder of African Greys and with insights into the mentality of Greys. That she went on to cover all other parrots as well should not meant that therefore, that article is no longer on Greys.</p>
<p>As for what is encyclopedic, that word meant 'covering or including a broad range of detailed knowledge'. As far as I know, there are no generalised site on flighted grey keeping. The only comprehensive site on flighted grey (or any parrot for that matter) is Tinkerbell site. I am not even certain if greys can or should be kept as 'pets'. They are viewed by me and all other grey keepers that I respect as family members and companions. Should I be asked to write on keeping them as pets, I decline. Talking about the physical aspects of their care will be very easy.</p>
<p>But thats such a tiny facet.</p>
<p>Of even greater importance will be the mental aspects and the relationships being developed with your grey (or other parrots). People are all different, and as greys are so intelligent, each grey will also be different from each other. The relationship established will be unique and different from one another. The only way to know of greys and other parrots will be to participate in online forums with others who are keeping greys. Should we try for an 'average' , it is like averaging or combining colors of rainbow to getting a meaningless 'white'. I decided I will tell the many grey keepers that I know of this site here. That if their participating here is vital too.. Hopefully, they will come and try to take part in the expansion of this article and make it better.

<dd>I "rescued" the section because it was deleted by an anon, with no edit description whatsoever. Stuff on talk pages is only deleted for very limited reasons. And in this one, no reasons were given, so it appeared a very vandalistic action for the section to be deleted. I can guess at why it was deleted, someone disagreeing with your agressive way of handling things, for instance, but that would be only guesswork and speculation. As long as you do not violate the rules of the project, you have as much right as anyone else to be on the talk page. And an anonymous, reason-less, deletion of your message gives no justification for the deletion.</dd>
<dd>So, really, do not consider me to be on your side on this just because I reverted an apparently improper deletion of your words. The revert was an endorsement only of your right to speak here, not an endoresment of anything you have to say. (And, in the end, I'm not opposing you either. I honestly don't really care much about the subject one way or the other. I have the page bookmarked because it's a spam/vandalism target, and am keeping an eye out for such to revert.) - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 13:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>TexasAndroid,</p>
<p>I checked your page and your records after that rescue and could see your other works as an admin. Within the context of Internet, my arguements are mild but you are entitled to think otherwise. I rather you remain as a neutral Admin. You cannot take one side or the other especially your background indicated you are not into parrots, birds and greys in particular and cannot be expected to have the passion of one deeply involved. Thank you again</p>

Hi LiamE or any Admin here</p>
<p>Any thoughts on what I written in ""African Grey Parrots as Pets" - "verifiable" sources"&#160;???</p>

<p>To Admins</p>
<p>Tinkerbell site has again been removed by anonymous on claims that 'adverts' are inside when in fact, no adverts are in there at all. I do have other more enjoyable pursuits in life than to do shadow boxing with nameless entites. If vandals knowing nothing but their focused prejudices are to be sole control of entries than little more will be said by me. I rather go smell roses than to indulge with them by replacing that link to be torn down by vandals yet again</p>
