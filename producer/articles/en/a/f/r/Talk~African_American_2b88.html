<p>Why is it that a hyphen is always used with Irish-American, German-American, Mexican-American, etc. but it's not used in the title for this article? I see "African American" more often without the hyphen than with it, although it would seem to me that the hyphen belongs, if only to make the style uniform with similar labels. Even contributors to this discussion page have often used the hyphen. So does anyone know why there's no hyphen in the title of this article or elsewhere? <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 02:38, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I remember seeing an african-american commentator on a TV news pundit show calling Obama an <i><b>african</b>-african-american</i> and <i>not a real</i> african-american, because he did not have enslaved african ancestors who were sold into America, and his racial mixing was not with other Americans. But these cultural issues bring up some things. Immigrants from Africa, whose children assimilate into african-american culture, and are for all their behaviour, language and personality, typical of non-immigrants, would they qualify in the more restrictive sense of african-american? 132.205.44.134 02:58, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is important to note: the term "mulatto" was not only designated to people of half pure African blood and half pure European blood. In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries the term "mulatto" was also used to define American people of mixed African and Native American blood; mixed European and Native American blood; as well as people who were descended from any one of these unions, or a mixture of all of them. Incidentally, the term "mulatto" was also used to describe many Native American groups who have origins in North Carolina and Virginia. [I.E. the Saponi Nation, etc].</p>
<p>Keith J. Adkins Keithjosef 14:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The word "mulato" is a common Portuguese word, meaning "1-Son of a white father and a black mother or a black father and a white mother; 2-Dark man" (Aurélio Buarque de Holanda dictionary). The common use is for someone having a skin color that is lighter than a pure black. To give an exemple, in many regions of Brazil, Barak Obama would not be called "negro" or "preto", portuguese words for black, but "mulato". It must be noted that in Brazil the miscigenation between european origin people ("white") and african origin people ("black") is much larger then in North America, so makes little sense to speak in terms of afican-american or euro-american, because the majority of Brazilian people can be called african-euro-american (or euro-african-american). Unfortunately, the plague of pollitically-correctness-at-all-costs is creating the use of african-american as the "correct" word for black skin; Brazil's major TV network used african-american to refer to Nelson Mandela.</p>

<p>I know that this may seem trivial to some, but I'm trying to have men and women represented equally on the various photo collages representing ethnic/racial groups found throughout Wikipedia. This African American photo collage features 6 people, yet only 2 of them are women. In the interests of fairness and equality, please include another woman in the collage so that the collage is balanced (3 men and 3 women). Also, standard procedure is to alphabetize the names in the collage in order to avoid undue preference and bias. I would do this myself, but since I'm semi-computer illiterate when it comes to the 'complicated' stuff here on Wikipedia I don't know how to work with photos or anything like that.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/Talk%7EAfrican_American_2b88.html" title="Edit section: What about the Somali people currently living in the USA?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">What about the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somali_people.html" title="Somali people">Somali people</a> currently living in the USA?</span></h2>
<p>Because of the problems that Somalia has had over the years (particularly from about 1990-present time), many Somalis have immigrated to the USA as America has opened its borders to many needy (mostly persecuted) Somalis since it was controversially 'involved' in the politics of the country. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the people from Somalia are mostly/generally considered "Black" or "African" rather than Arab/Semitic, right? Wouldn't they then be considered a sub-set of the African American as opposed to the Arab/Semitic American? Actually, it seems that the more Black/African type of Somali predominates in the south of the country, while there is quite a bit of Arab/Semitic admixture in the northern half of the country (with considerable amounts of African/Black and Arab/Semitic admixture throughout much of the entire country).</p>
<p>There is also a sizable population of Somalis that came to the USA not only through Somalia once the USA accepted some of them (those fleeing war, strife, poverty, etc.), but some of them also came through Kenya since a large chunk of them live(d) there, and most of the population of Kenya is clearly African/Black. I don't want to seem like I'm indulging in a bunch of 'ethnic and/or racial theorizing' here, but I teach college in NYC and have had quite a few Somalis in some of my classes, and they clearly share more than a few physical features with Africans/Blacks (though often their skin color is often a few shades lighter than a very dark sub-Saharan African which presumably reflects their partial Arab/Semitic heritage: and they are of course almost always Muslims). Would they then qualify mostly as an <b>Afro-Semitic people</b> (kind of like Ethiopians), but with the 'Afro' part generally predominating? I do hope that I don't offend anyone with this semi-rant and half-question/half-statement because I know this might seem a bit ridiculous, but I just thought I'd inquire about this since I've been very interested in Somalia and the Somali people lately and am trying to find out more about their country and ethnic origin(s); most especially though I would like to know if the Somalis currently living in the USA 'qualify' as African Americans (or at least <i>some</i> of them)? --<a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWassermannNYC_d58e.html" title="User:WassermannNYC">WassermannNYC</a> 01:33, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Somali people are not Semitic like Ethiopians lets be clear about that, I say it again Somali people are not semitic by any definition of the word. they do not speak a semitic language, they are not racial semitic (actually no one is). Somali is an Afro-Asiatic language like Hausa. It is Chadic not semitic. rumor control there is no more Arab mixture than that found in Kenya or TZ, Somali people like AA had a hard time and still like to identify with their slave masters lineage.

<p>What is wrong with you people? I don't get this. Why are you people saying a Somali immigrant is Afro-American? Is a German immigrant Euro-American? The person is German-American. As for the Somali, he or she is Somali-American. What did I say about nationalities? They apply to countries, not continents. The person is African because the person is black, indigenous to the land and part of an ethnic tribe. The AA term applies to black Americans whose African ancestors were brought to the USA as slaves on slave ships during the Alantic Slave Trade. In other words, blacks who are descended from American slavery. You people are really getting on my nerves. Here's what I want you to do: look up the history of the AA term. If you do that, you might learn something and stop posting crazy comments. Also, learn about geography. You will know the difference between a continent and a country, and know that nationalities (country of birth) applies to countries, not continents.

All of these Africans are natives of Africa. this is why i hate the word black African, because all Africans are black as someone said you dont get green Africans or White Chinese. if they are the majority they dont bear the adjective. like American-Human, they all human (save Bush and condi)--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሐላቃህ)</a> 20:00, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Newspapers in the United States describe Nigerians living in <b>Nigeria</b> as "African-American." They use it as a (ridiculous) substitute term for "Black." There's no science or reason that will make sense of this, and no absolutes. We could get some precision if we were to discuss "people discriminated against in the United States for their (apparent) (at least partial) African (usually Bantu) heritage" or "people discriminated against in the United Staes for their (apparent) descent from slaves" ... but those are not options editors are likely to flock to. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 16:42, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Blacks in the US are not "usually Bantu" in heritage.

<p>You're wrong, RoboBanks. A Somali immigrant is African because he or she is black, indigenous to the land and part of a tribe. The person is NOT an AA. Period. I know a black guy from St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. He considers himself West Indian (whatever that means). He checks "other" on applications. The Africans know the AA term applies to black Americans. It's not my fault you don't understand. You're the one that can't comprehend this, not me.24.185.49.151 02:41, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anyone find the the income of the African American total compared to the incomes of countries such as Brazil laughable? To compare two populations with no historical, cultural, or geographical similarity is beyond stupidity. If it were an attempt to barg about African Americans, the author did a pretty bad job of it. It could be said in the White American article that the collective income of White Americans is greater than ten times Africa's GDP to show you how senseless it is. African Americans can only be compared with other groups in the United States. I propose removing such ridiculous comarisons. 07:36, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why does our picture show three prominent African American Republican political figures from the latter half of the 20th century? This seems highly disproportionate.

<p>An IP adress user, 67.173.6.76 added some things from someone named "Maddox" to the section. here it is:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><i>Maddox stated, in a post on May 6, 2006:</i></p>
<p><i>"Every time you call someone an "African American," you're making at least two assumptions about the person:</i></p>
<p><i>1. That the person is an American...</i></p>
<p><i>2. That the person is African (because it's inconceivable that black people could come from Haiti, India, Trinidad, Dominican Republic, Brazil, Australia, or Jamaica). Nevermind that; BLACK PEOPLE ONLY COME FROM AFRICA.</i></p>
<p><i>Not to mention that every time you give a black person the distinction of being "African American" out of a mixed group, you're making an assumption about an entire continent; not everyone from Africa is black. I guarantee all you politically correct morons out there have never called a white person an African American. Of course you could avoid all these problems by using the same standards on blacks as you would on whites by simply assuming that all whites are from Africa just as you do for all blacks, but that might be too forward, and in a polite society like ours, people would be all too pleased to point out which of the 192 countries you didn't guess they were actually from."</i></p>
<p>The Maddox links to a disambiguation page. If anyone can find out who this Maddox is and if the person is a good source, we should be able to use some of the information, but it's really unnecessary. I just wanted to note that I was deleting it, beause at this point, none of the information is NPOV or even from a reputable source. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillancad_e70d.html" title="User:Millancad"><span style="color:HotPink">ɱў</span><span style="color:Gold">ɭ</span><span style="color:LightGreen">ĩє</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Millancad_49f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Millancad"><small><sup><span style="color:red">What did I do</span></sup></small></a><a href="../../../m/i/l/User_talk%7EMillancad_5630.html" title="User talk:Millancad"><sub><span style="color:Purple"><b>wrong</b></span></sub></a> 19:36, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
