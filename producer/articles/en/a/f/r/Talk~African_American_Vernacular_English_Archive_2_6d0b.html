<h2><span class="mw-headline">A section on pronunciation?</span></h2>
<p>I'm not a linguist, so I'm not certain where this should be placed -- in a separate section called "Pronunciation"? In AAVE, there is no "th" sound -- which is also a carryover from various West African languages. Instead, the "th" is replaced by a "d": e.g., "duh" instead of "the"; a "v" sound, "muvvah" instead of "mother"; or, an "f," as in "birfday," instead of "birthday."</p>
<p>Some mention also may be made of the substitution of "er" at the end of words with an "uh" sound -- which, as far as I know, is simply a shared characteristic of AAVE with rural, southern speech -- e.g., "yonduh," instead of "yonder," or "bruvva" instad of "brother." <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 21:17, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I certainly agree a section on pronunciation is warranted. However, I believe the assertion that these differences are a carryover from West African languages is disputed. Cockney English, fore example, exhibits many of the same sound changes and has no relation to effects from foreign languages. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 21:50, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To attribute these speech and language patterns is definititely right on target. Any linguist worth his or her salt would certainly do so -- and such has been done repeatedly in several scholarly examinations of this subject. Why is it that lay white folks (certainly, in my experience, white Americans) are so blind to, or obtuse in conceding, our African roots? I've actually had someone go behind me and attempt to edit out references to Africa in sections on jazz, and have had to make a point to insert such references to Africa in other Wikipedia articles treating various aspects of African-American culture. The African influence should be obvious. This article itself makes reference to the commonalities among AAVE and pidgin English and patois in different parts of the U.S. and throughout the Caribbean. What is the common, unifying ingredient? West African origins. It should be a no-brainer. Where white southerners got their accents and speech patterns is something else again. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 07:05, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think this adequately addresses the issue that nearly all of the phonological differences of AAVE from SAE also occur in other, completely unrelated dialects. I'm not going to argue that there is nothing "African" about AAVE, but it seems facile to ascribe a feature like final consonant cluster simplification to the African roots of AAVE, when plenty of other dialects exhibit the same phenomenon. I don't think there is anything uniquely "West African" about cluster reduction and saying that there is would be disingenuous. The same holds for the /ð/&gt;/d/ merger. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 00:55, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not anywhere near an expert on AAVE, having only discussed it briefly in a couple of linguistics classes. However, IIRC, there are a few major features commonly associated with AAVE pronunciation. A non-exhaustive listing, not all found in all AAVE variants:
<ul>
<li>The change of θ to t/f and δ to d/v.</li>
<li>Monopthongization of vowels: /a:/ instead of /aj/.</li>
<li>Deletion of non-prevocalic /r/: [δe:] or [de:] instead of [δer]/ ("there"); [ka:t] instead of [kart] ("cart"), but /rid/ (reed) is the same in both AAVE and SAE.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>There are probably others I'm either forgetting or completey ignorant of. All of these exist in other dialects of English, but the consensus among linguists seems to be that the strongest originating influence for these features is West African languages.</dd>

<p>Now that <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> has created a beautiful summary of the sociological aspects of AAVE, let's see if we can address the phonological differences. We do need to note that not all differences are universal to all variants of AAVE - but that many are common, and considered distinctive to the dialect by SAE speakers. I also think, for consistency's sake, we should use <a href="../../../s/a/m/SAMPA_53ec.html" title="SAMPA">SAMPA</a> transcription, since it's accessible on a US-english keyboard.</p>
<p>Main differences (note that "_" stands for "any vowel" and "#" is "word boundary"):</p>
<ul>
<li>SAE /#T_/ --&gt; AAVE [#t_]; SAE /_T_/ --&gt; AAVE [_f_]; and SAE /_T#/ --&gt; AAVE [_f#] (sometimes [_t#] )</li>
<li>SAE /#D_/ --&gt; AAVE [#d_]; SAE /_D_/ --&gt; AAVE [_v_]; and SAE /_D#/ --&gt; AAVE [_v#]</li>
<li>SAE /r_/ --&gt; AAVE [r_]; SAE /r/ --&gt; deleted elsewhere</li>
<li>SAE /aj/ --&gt; AAVE [a:] and SAE [ej] (phonemically /e/) --&gt; AAVE /e:/</li>
<li>Question&#160;: is the /Q/ vs. /A/ distinction preserved, or is it merged as in Midwestern US dialects of English? EG: /nQt/ "naught" vs. /nAt/ "not".</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a start, at any rate. If I get a chance, I may do some research via google. <a href="../../../p/g/d/User%7EPgdudda_fb58.html" title="User:Pgdudda">pgdudda</a> 15:47, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">be done</span></h2>
<p>the section on <i>be done</i> says</p>
<p><i>Be done</i> is used as a tense marker to indicate the conditional perfect, a future in the hypothetical past. Example: <i>Soon, he be done fixing the leak</i> (="Soon, he will have fixed the leak")</p>
<p>It seems to me that, rather than being a "future in the hypothetical past", what is really meant is a "past in a predicted/expected future" - however, living in england, I have very little experience of AAVE and so, as far as I know, the example could be wrong instead.</p>

<dd>I think you're right. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 23:44, Oct 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, the article is correct that the verb "to be" -- as in some West African languages -- is used to indicate something habitual. "He be's [or "be"] there most Tuesdays."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But in this particular instance, Gingekerr, the verb form is simply a swallowed, contracted "will," which through time customarily simply has been left off completely, and is more along the lines of the kind of thing that happens in a lot of southern speech with the ends of words. "I'll be done fixin' this in a minute," becomes, "I be done fixin' this in a minute." The dropping or swallowing of the contracted "will" -- "'ll" -- is facilitated by the typically southern pronunciation of "I." A reminder that the phrase is not, phonetically, "I'll be"/"I be," but "Ah 'll be"/"Ah be." When examined in this light, the ease of simply swallowing/dropping the verb (which is implied) becomes more obvious. This phenomenon is not a distinct grammatical structure, but a pronunciational phenomenon -- no different from a white southerner saying, "Well, ah be damned!" <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 06:54, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further, I think it's important to trace many of these language and speech patterns to their common source, West Africa.<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 06:56, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Removed the business about "future in the hypothetical past" in light of my earlier comments, because this apparent truth is actually pronunciation-based, rather than a different structure grammatically. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Shouldn't there perhaps be some mention of the full phrasing "BÍN DONE" here, as in "I BÍN DONE went to the market" and "he BÍN DONE cut the grass"? As an AAVE/SAE speaker of the east coast (codeswitcher) it seems to me that its inclusion would be necessary, no? Or is this simply a phrasing peculiar to the Jersey/PA area? [Dione C.]</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Note on necessary additions</span></h2>
<p>A section on pronunciation. Mention of the use of "axe" instead of "ask" (also rooted in W. Africa?). And observation of the subversion of language to redefine negatives; language as weapon/tool. And a section on vocabulary -- because there is, indeed, a separate vocabulary in the African-American community for any number of things, that most white folks don't have a clue about.

<dl>
<dd>For my money, "ask" &gt; "axe" is more likely to be of anglophone than African origin -- the variation in this word goes back to <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_4220.html" title="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a>, when the word (usually <i>ascian</i>) could also be found as <i>axian</i>. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnen_a442.html" title="User:Marnen">Marnen Laibow-Koser</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnen_680d.html" title="User talk:Marnen">(talk)</a> 20:08, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">African Origins</span></h2>
<p>Odd that someone obviously ignorant on a sujbect in some position of "authority" on Wikipedia would challenge an obviously widely held opinion/common knowledge, calling it NPOV, remove it TWICE -- and then tell the person writing from a knowledge base that they have to prove the obvious. But here ya go. Just a minute or two on the Internet yielded this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"...West African languages often lack th sounds and final consonant clusters (e.g. past), and that replacing or simplifying these occurs both in US Ebonics and in West African English varieties spoken in Nigeria and Ghana. Moreover, they argue that the distinction made between completed actions ("He done walked") and habitual actions ("We be walkin") in the Ebonics tense-aspect system reflects their prevalence in West African language systems and that this applies to other aspects of Ebonics sentence structure."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"... similarities between Ebonics and Caribbean Creole English varieties, for instance, the fact that both frequently drop is and are , and that both permit dropping word initial d, b, and g in tense-aspect markers (Caribbean examples include habitual/progressive (d)a, past tense (b)en, and future (g)on). These traits suggest that some varieties of American Ebonics might have undergone the kinds of simplification and mixture associated with Creole formation in the Caribbean and elsewhere. They might also suggest that American Ebonics was shaped by the high proportions of Creole-speaking slaves that were imported from the Caribbean in the earliest settlement periods of the thirteen original colonies."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here's just a partial bibliography of the many, many, MANY scholarly works on the subject. These specifically discuss (in the affirmative) the AFRICAN origins of AAVE:</p>
<p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/ALWT/socio3.html" class="external free" title="http://members.tripod.com/ALWT/socio3.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/ALWT/socio3.html</a>.</p>
<p>Curious how folks will automatically agree that certain language characteristics of Americans who are the progeny of Eastern European Jews -- hooking g's, reversal of verb and subject sequence, questions asked in the form of statements but with an inquisitive inflection -- are Yiddish in origin. No one would question that the cadence and certain characteristics of Italian-Amercan speech are obviously from Italy/Italian -- and on an on. But when it comes to diasporic Africans, all of a sudden, our speech and language patterns are somehow created, out of whole cloth, in the New World. This is really galling. Not only does this NOT make any sense, it reminds me of the old lies and racist assumptions about blacks not having any culture before they came in contact with Europeans. How is it that virtually every OTHER ethnic group in America has speech and language patterns traceable to their homelands BUT black folks? White rejection of and contempt for AAVE is so tied up with white rejection of and contempt for black people that many of them are unable or unwilling to see the truth about either -- in defiance of all logic and proof to the contrary. Someone in the article wrote that slavemasters considered AAVE a mark of inferior intelligence -- like that's not STILL widely the case in this nation today? Such denial and intellectual dishonesty are enough to turn one's stomach. The passage related to African origins is reverted back to the original language. The validity of AAVE as a dialect with clearly West African origins had been established for DECADES -- long before the "Eubonics" debate which began in California became a political football and an opportunity for every reactionary, racist, neocon radio pundit and hack columnist to weigh in on the matter with their usual ill-informed, but highly opinionated, rhetoric to the contrary. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 15:02, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look, I think you're being just a little inflammatory about this. There's no argument that there are African influences on AAVE. However, as you yourself say, there is <i>substantial</i> evidence of creolisation too, and creoles include simplification of phonology <i>as well as</i> grammar. In terms of grammar, <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaiian_Creole_437d.html" title="Hawaiian Creole">Hawaiian Creole</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bislama.html" title="Bislama">Bislama</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tok_Pisin_54f4.html" title="Tok Pisin">Tok Pisin</a> all show the "be"-habitual you refer to,and this sort of construct is almost universal amongst creoles. Too, <b>very</b> few languages have the <b>th</b> sounds, and it wouldn't surprise me if they were dropped first. All we're saying is that some features of AAVE cannot be traced back to African roots, and some of those African roots are indirect, coming through the Caribbean creoles (which also owe a certain amount to the native languages of the region, which you haven't even mentioned yet). To take one of your examples, New York Italians have a distinct way of speaking that only has a small amount to do with direct Italian influence. And the interrogative inflection you refer to in New York Jewish speech is also not limited to that area; it happens a lot in Australia too. On your comments below this one, gesturing and relative distance between people during conversation are also typical of Hispanic and Italian communities - and in no way are they limited to just those three. I just think you're reading far too much into the comments of the others who have commented previously. Not every white person is a black-hating bigot. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThefamouseccles_063a.html" title="User:Thefamouseccles">thefamouseccles</a> 01:02, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't imagine you've done any serious reading on the subject to come to such a conclusion. And when it comes to professionals in the field who study linguistics, after almost 40 years of research on the subject, I'd say you're in the distinct minority. French, for instance, doesn't have a "th" sound, either. And, no, that does not mean all people who share that characteristic in their spoken language do so because of an association with France or French-speaking people. But when those same clusters of people -- from indigenous Africans to New World Africans -- from the same points of origin, with shared and distinct grammatical patterns and shared source words from the same ethnic groups and who also, (in the case of African Americans) by virtue of historical and social circumstances (slavery, segregation and separation), have maintained distinct cultural characteristics and affectations which are markedly distinct from the majority culture, there's pretty damned good evidence that the shared linguistic characteristics (grammar AND pronunciation) come from a common source. And that common source is WEST AFRICA. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 07:59, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I note with interest that you exclude the portion of the the source you cite that makes it quite plain that there is no agreement among linguists about the origins of AAVE. The quotation is from the Linguistic Society of America FAQ <a href="http://www.lsadc.org/faq/index.php?aaa=ebonics.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lsadc.org/faq/index.php?aaa=ebonics.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>

<dd>"<b>Where did Ebonics come from?</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"On this point, linguists are quite divided. Some emphasize its English origins, pointing to the fact that most of the vocabulary of Ebonics is from English and that much of its pronunciation (e.g. pronouncing final th as f) and grammar (e.g. double negatives, "I don't want none") could have come from the nonstandard dialects of English indentured servants and other workers with whom African slaves interacted.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Others emphasize Ebonics' African origins, noting that West African languages often lack th sounds and final consonant clusters (e.g. past), and that replacing or simplifying these occurs both in US Ebonics and in West African English varieties spoken in Nigeria and Ghana. Moreover, they argue that the distinction made between completed actions ("He done walked") and habitual actions ("We be walkin") in the Ebonics tense-aspect system reflects their prevalence in West African language systems and that this applies to other aspects of Ebonics sentence structure."</dd>

<dd>Indeed the page goes out of its way to demonstrate that there are two competing theories. Why then do you insist on representing only one of the two theories here on Wikipedia? The whole point of NPOV is that where there is disagreement, we don't take a side, but we represent both sides of the issue and not make assertions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are correct in the assumtion that I haven't done extensive reading on the topic; however, I have done <i>some</i> reading on the topic, and not just in the "lay press": I have read scholarly articles that were directly about AAVE as well as articles that touched on it in some other linguistic context. I did, however, read enough to know that the topic is not an area of universal agreement or even widespread agreement, particularly with regards to theories about the origins of linguistics features of AAVE, as the quotation above from the Linguistic Society of America makes clear. Personally, I find the argument about most of the syntactic features having origin in West African languages to be convincing—they are unique enough to AAVE that one can convincingly (to me) make claims about the origins being rooted in the distinctive origins of the dialects' speakers, namely west Africans. However, based on my knowledge about how phonological change works, I find similar assertions about the phonology of AAVE to less persuasive. No one knows exactly why sound changes occur—they occur spontaneously and unpredictably. Sound changes occur in every dialect, and I don't see any reason to believe that the sound changes that occurred in AAVE are any different from the sound changes of any other dialect, particularly given the fact that the AAVE-distinct phonological changes aren't in any way unique to AAVE. Final cluster reduction occurs in many dialects of English. Why is it that final cluster reduction in AAVE is necessarily of African origin, when the cluster reduction in the other dialects occurred spontaneously? /θ/ and /ð/ have merged to /f/ and /v/ in Cockney English, not as a result of the influence of any particular language, but simply spontaneously. Why is it that the /ð/ &gt; /d/ merger in AAVE is necessarily of African origin, when a similar change occurred spontaneously in a different dialect? What is the specific evidence that these changes occurred as a result of the African origins of AAVE and not spontaneously, as sound changes have occurred in every other dialect? The fact that completely convicing and satisfactory answers to these questions have not been presented is the crux of the dispute. Certainly AAVE arose under the conditions you describe, but I have yet to see evidence that there is some common set of phonological features of West African languages that clearly explain the phonology of AAVE in any convincing way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But my personal take on the matter is mostly beside the point. The fact is that linguists do not agree upon the origins of AAVE and this fact should be represented in the article. We violate NPOV if we assert that all these features have African origins when in fact there are plenty of people with perfectly valid reasons to not believe that. That is why I changed the assertion to an assertion about a claim. That is the essence of NPOV. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 09:40, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My understanding of "NPOV" is "new point of view," meaning it is unique to the writer. The information I presented clearly is not some quirky, half-baked notion that I came up with and is most certainly not "new." But you are correct that there is debate on the pronuciational aspects of the origin of AAVE. I have reworded my earlier contribution to reflect the pronunciational commonalities between West African languages and AAVE and have stated nothing conclusory regarding pronunciational origins. For now, it is enough to reinstate the important info on the West African grammatical origins of AAVE.&#160;:-p <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 10:38, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

What I meant by the comment above is that I hope that in my more elaborated explanation of the reasoning behind my edits that I made it clear the only motivation behind them was NPOV and my own understanding about linguistic processes, and not a desire to cast AAVE in a negative light. In fact, I think AAVE should be considered just as valid and esteemable a form of English as any other dialect, like Australian, or New England, or South African. My intent was not humor; it was merely an attempt to make a friendly conciliation.

</dl>
<p>"I ain't got no money" is a case of simple double negation. "Ain't <i>nobody</i> leavin' this house 'til I say so!" is a case of double negation used for emphasis. In instances where the double negative is included in an emphatic sentence, the verb precedes the subject. So, to my way of thinking, the operational element of the sentence w/regard to emphasis is not the double negative (which is common, regardless of the tone of the sentence), but the repositioning of the subject and verb.<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 17:47, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

It all comes back to the old assumption that "if they don't speak my language/dialect, they must be stupid".

<dd>However, might it be beneficial to be <i>really</i> clear on the concept that AAVE is, from a pure linguistic point of view, just as valid a language/dialect as SAE? And somehow touch on the notion that the association of AAVE with racial inferiority is incorrect; it's like assuming that someone who speaks with a Spanish accent is an idiot just because English (meaning SAE here) isn't their first language... Or perhaps an entire section on the sociolinguistics of AAVE - as an in-group identifier (cultural membership), as an out-group excluder (not readily understood beyond a basic level by those outside the culture), and how it is perceived by various social groups/strata (rich vs. poor; SAE speakers; various ethnic groups)? Just spouting out ideas, since I'm hardly qualified to write any such section.

I think that's sufficient. I took the reference to "controversy" out of the lead paragraph; because the strongest, clearest definition of something is achieved by stating positives (what something is, rather than what it isn't). The lead paragraph shouldn't be reactionary, but assertive. (Besides, the issue was addressed later, anyway). Besides, I'm really weary of the constant need to repeatedly state, "We are not ...

<li>Some of the distinctive modern aspects of AAVE didn't develop until later in the evolution of the pidgin, giving evidence to the contrary of their "African roots". For instance, the habitual <i>be</i> was not seen recorded until 1800. The precise meaning appears to have emerged at the same time as the grammatical construction; there is little evidence of the use of <i>be</i> in a non-habitual aspect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of any (white) record of the grammatical form does not mean it did not exist prior to 1800. Every appraisal I've read on the subject traces this characteristic to Africa, where it is in evidence still today in several languages. To my knowledge, a similar use of "be" to indicate some habitual or constant act or state appears in no other known U.S. dialect. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 03:21, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are incorrect. Newfoundland English and Hawai'ian pidgin both exhibit habitual 'be.' Neither was influenced by West African languages. Please do not make broad linguistic claims until you have researched them. It detracts from your argument in unnecessary ways. Selective reading of linguistic papers on the matter does not service the debate--as noted above, it's been illustrated in a source you cited yourself that the issue is far from settled in the linguistics community, despite your repeated assertions that this is all obvious and a given. There is evidence for varying degrees of West African influence and I suspect that the grammatical feature is in fact more attributal to West African origins than to the influence of SAE English, but no firm statement on the matter can yet be made without further evidence.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Additionally, I deleted the garbage about the bullshyt theories based on physical differences and racism. I found it offensively worded and incalculably wearisome. IMO, it is completely unnecessary to refute every, single, idiotic, racist notion ever propounded about black folks -- in essence, having to state, "No. Black people are not inherently inferior; are not dirty, smelly, stupid or depraved." The facts about AAVE have been established by the article, and that is sufficient.</p>
<p>Also deleted a long, pretentiously dense section that essentially repeated a lot of what already had been noted. The problem is the contributor is using Wikipedia as a blank slate for a school project -- something for which it is not particularly well suited for.

<dd>Indeed, my school project. Keep in mind that the agreement with my professor was to finish the Wikipedia articles, understanding that it is an encyclopedia. I'm not simply using it as a word processor for a traditional essay. I'm familiar with the values of Wikipedia and I respect them, and that includes my work on this page.</dd>
<dd>While I appreciate your liberal attitude toward refactoring and condensing articles, I'm not sure deleting an entire section, backed up by a well-researched essay by Rickford (1999), was warranted. The section was about diffusion of the dialect, and the various causes for differences between the language of whites and blacks in similar contexts. Your comments are correct about the first paragraph; that was meant to reduce the problem to more serious evidence, to put prejudice aside. Deleting that on the grounds that it is redundant is understandable. Regarding the rest, it's hard to communicate the breadth of this study without linking it to the specific case as Rickford did, but I'm pretty sure your "improvement" doesn't help communicate it.</dd>
<dd>I'm arguing that what I stated didn't "essentially repeat[] a lot of what already had been noted", and that it actually introduced a real issue. If you disagree, please back it up.

<p>I wrote it that way, because even the most learned/highly educated, affluent of African Americans I've known, who grew up speaking only SAE (as I did) use AAVE outside the boardroom -- even if intragroup and solely for emphasis. To be AA and not use it at all, you'd have to <i>really</i> have a stick up your butt/be seriously up-tight.

<dd>I know one African American girl who grew up in a household where use of AAVE was forbidden, and as a result she was completely incompetent in its use. As a result, she feels very uncomfortable around other African Americans, who expect her to use AAVE, and because she can't, she goes out of her way to avoid their company. I don't know how common this situation is, but since you yourself are African American, it seems likely that your perception of the number of people who are in this situation may be skewed, of course, because they would be avoiding your company under the assumption that you would expect them to talk to you using AAVE. My data point is singular, so I don't think any general conclusions can be made from it, but I think my friend makes for an interesting case, no? <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 19:19, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had an African American friend in college who claimed exactly the same experience. She said her complete inability even to "code-switch" between SAE and AAVE marked her as "whitewashed" to some other African Americans, and this made her feel uncomfortable in their presence. Hence she just avoided their company. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 10:10, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's funny. That's sad. Poor dears -- seriously. I hope when they have kids, they take the opportunity to screw up their children the way their parents have traumatized them.&#160;:-p (If some parents put as much emphasis on self-knowledge as speaking SAE, then perhaps their children wouldn't be so insecure about who they are. The same folks probably still carry their watermelons home from the supermarket in brown paper bags -- or are so terrified of being caught with one, they never, ever eat them. Bananas, too. And they'd rather die than wear bright red. lol</p>
<p>I grew up speaking SAE, but my playmates through third grade did not, so I picked up certain elements of AAVE -- but still didn't speak it (as a matter of habit). It wasn't forbidden in my household (though my parents -- especially Mom -- probably would have had a fit had I done so.) But I wasn't razzed by my peers about speaking SAE. (But those were different times; it was back in the Dark Ages.) Spent the rest of my youth in the burbs, in a rather affluent, white school system. It wasn't until I went away to an HBCU that I really started using "Black English," and when I came home, my mother (a public school teacher/administrator) was mortified: "I didn't teach you to talk like that!" Yeah, that sort of thing is fairly common in a <i>lot</i> of black households where one or both parents have a college education.</p>
<p>But even so, I'll bet your friends speak AAVE in <i>some</i> form, even if it is extremely limited. Many people mistake current slang for AAVE, and kids are teased for not bein' hip enough. But every black person I know who comes to mind -- including college professors, high-powered attorneys, educators and CEO's -- everyone in a "down" moment will lapse into an AAVE form, in disgust, in jest, for emphasis, as a put-on -- you name it. (Yep, even my proper-talkin' Mom.) It may not be pervasive throughout their vocabulary; it may occcur only rarely -- but <i>every</i> black person I know code switches: a double negative here, an "ain't" there, a "d" used in place of "th" there (Joking: "Now, you <i>know</i> you ain't right!" or, "That's a <i>ba-aad</i> jacket!" or, "I'mma te-ell!") Sometimes it's simply more about mannerisms and gestures, inflection and cadence (things not really examined in the article and difficult, at least for me, to write about) than specific syntax; maybe a black vocabulary word here or there. But the vast majority of black folks do AAVE <i>sometime</i>. And that's all the text says. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 20:15, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's probably true. "Pure" AAVE (with all the grammatical features), from my observation, is mostly only used in lower-class black areas. Elsewhere, it's more of a mix of SAE and AAVE. This stuff must give linguistic folks headaches.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Can't agree. That is not all the text says, and even if it were, I'm still not convinced it's corect. Regardless of their colour, people who use the occasional 'ain't' or say that something is 'baaad' or that they're 'down' with something aren't necessarily speaking AAVE--or, they're speaking AAVE <i>in the same way that the majority culture does</i>--a few words or expressions, <i>sometimes</i>. But that's because that is in the nature of English, particularly American English. If an educated Jew who speaks standard English says 'So, how's by you?' for effect, does that mean they speak Yiddish English? What if an AA New Yorker says the same thing, for the same reason? Does s/he suddenly speak Yiddish English as well? <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuill_7bcf.html" title="User:Quill">Quill</a> 23:36, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not only a matter of degree here, but whether such things are contrivances/affectations or a natural part of one's culture. AAVE is an enduring part of the culture that, having survived for centuries, survives still as an intrinsic part of African-American cultural expression. The majority of African-Americans currently living outside the Deep South are likely only two generations removed from that place. "Cut eye, suck teeth," "reading people out loud," that neck action (:-p), cadence, inflection, gesticulation, that booming aspiration; and then beyond speech, cornrows, polyrhythmic expression, religious expression (including shouts, call and response, full-immersion baptism and river imagery, spiritualism/metaphysics), "anarchy"/familiarity in formal interpersonal contexts, extended families, communalism, blue notes, the cool aesthetic in art and dress and music and dance and on and on and on -- all those things survive from our <i>African</i> past. A few scant generations of higher education and going to school with white folks hasn't stripped us of AAVE. And to the unnamed contributor, I don't know <i>anyone</i> whose speech incorporates all the elements of AAVE mentioned in the article. It's summa this, summa that. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 00:01, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, that's where you and I differ. I see the cultural affectations of black folks as part of a whole. And as I said before, for me it's not a matter of how much people speak it, but whether they do or not as an integral part of their culture. It is not the same as me or a white Christian using the word "kvetch" or "yenta" from time to time in speech. It's all about whether words, expressions, gestures, cadence, etc., are something intrinsic to their cultural heritage and things that are part of the way they express themselves effortlessly, almost instinctually. And in that sense, yes, in my experience <i>most</i> African-Americans by far, regardless of their socioeconomic status, speak AAVE. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 01:40, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that AAVE is as tied to African-American (hereafter AA) culture as you say it is. If that's the case, is it even <i>possible</i> (by your definition) for someone who isn't AA to speak AAVE, assuming they wanted to? Your argument seems to say that if I (who am not AA) chose to speak in AAVE constructions, no matter how perfectly I used them, I wouldn't be speaking AAVE because it isn't an "integral part" of my culture, whatever that means -- I'd just be on the "kvetch-yenta" level of usage. Is that an accurate summary of your viewpoint? If not, then please disregard the next paragraph and tell me where I went wrong.</dd>
<dd>If that summary is accurate, however, I find this view ridiculous and offensive. If AAVE is a well-formed, consistent language on a par with French or Japanese -- which I think you and I both believe it is -- then why should anyone need to belong to a particular culture to speak it? If I wish to learn Japanese, I don't need to become culturally Japanese to do it, and once I achieve a certain level of proficiency, no reasonable person would deny that I'm speaking Japanese and that my cultural baggage is irrelevant. (Yes, Japanese, like AAVE and most other languages, embeds a certain amount of cultural assumption in the language, but I don't have to become part of the culture to know how to deal with that).</dd>
<dd>So why isn't the same thing true of AAVE? Certainly use of AAVE is part of AA culture, but that's not the same thing as saying that the presence of AA culture is necessary for the "real" presence of AAVE. In fact, I would argue that the presence or absence of an AA cultural context is completely irrelevant in determining who speaks AAVE. Just like French or Japanese: if I understand the rules of the language and can use them to generate and interpret correct constructions, I speak and understand the language. If not, I don't.

<p>Day-um. That's not what I said at <i>all.</i> I simply said that the vast majority of African-Americans speak AAVE, and they do so because it is an integral part of their culture. It's not like me borrowing a word here and there from Yiddish and inserting it into my speech. Further, again, AAVE is more than following a set of grammatical rules; it is also oftnetimes a different vocabulary -- one most folks outside the culture would not understand without explanation -- and all the other elements that go along with speech: aspiration and resonance -- particularly noticeable if you're a male -- inflection, cadance, gesticulation and other nonverbal communication, the distance one stands from another while speaking, etc. Jamie Kennedy made an admirable effort in "Malibu's Most Wanted," which is what made the film so hilarious. But if I turned my back to the screen, there still would have been no question that he was a white man trying to sound like a black one. It was still about AAVE as a second language. Such is most certainly <i>not</i> the case with most African Americans -- and with none with whom I am personally acquainted.

<dd>I'm an American Jew. Like most American Jews, I insert occasional Yiddish words into my speech, and I can often tell the difference when non-Jews try to do the same. But that doesn't mean that non-Jews can't speak more or less perfect "JAVE", if there is such a thing; in fact, I know a few who do. Similarly, I'm sure that not all non-AA speakers of AAVE would come across as non-AA if you couldn't see the color of their skin. What I'm getting at is that just as it is possible (difficult, but possible) for a non-Frenchman to learn to speak French like a native, the same must certainly be true for AAVE.</dd>
<dd>I also take some issue with this statement:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Further, again, AAVE is more than following a set of grammatical rules; it is also oftnetimes a different vocabulary -- one most folks outside the culture would not understand without explanation -- and all the other elements that go along with speech: aspiration and resonance -- particularly noticeable if you're a male -- inflection, cadance, gesticulation and other nonverbal communication, the distance one stands from another while speaking, etc.</i></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>Let's take these assertions in turn.
<ul>
<li><i>Further, again, AAVE is more than following a set of grammatical rules; it is also oftnetimes a different vocabulary -- one most folks outside the culture would not understand without explanation</i> ---- Certainly. <i>Any</i> language contains unique grammatical and lexical elements. The process of language learning should cover both of these, and that's just as true for an English speaker learning a different dialect of English as it is for (say) a Chinese speaker learning Russian. Nothing unusual here.</li>
<li><i>all the other elements that go along with speech: aspiration and resonance -- particularly noticeable if you're a male -- inflection, cadance,</i> ---- Intonation patterns are likewise part of language and should be taught along with grammar and vocabulary if they are semantically significant. Again, true for both the SAE→AAVE and Chinese→Russian cases. Nothing unusual here either.</li>
<li><i>gesticulation and other nonverbal communication, the distance one stands from another while speaking, etc.</i> ---- Here we begin to leave the realm of language and enter the realm of cultural knowledge. Although it would be useful for a visitor to Russia to know about Russian customs, those customs are not part of the Russian language and properly belong to a different study. Likewise for a visitor to an AA community -- although it's important to learn the customs, properly speaking these are not part of AAVE at all; rather, they are part of <i>AA culture</i>, which is a different thing. Language and culture are certainly interdependent to a point, but that doesn't mean that they're the same thing.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Finally, I don't hate you or AAVE. I don't know if "Don't be hatin'" has a different meaning than what would be apparent to SAE speakers (because I don't speak AAVE!); if it does, please translate. This is not a personal attack; I'm just trying to explain why I think AAVE is no more or less culturally unique than any other language, and why extralinguistic aspects don't really belong in a linguistic discussion. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnen_a442.html" title="User:Marnen">Marnen Laibow-Koser</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnen_680d.html" title="User talk:Marnen">(talk)</a> 18:34, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Forgive me, but you've got me crackin' up here in DeeCee!&#160;:-D "Don't be hatin'" is an expression -- one used a lot by the white actor in the movie "Malibu's Most Wanted." (You had to be there, I guess....) Anyway, people generally don't "teach" AAVE. And white folks generally (because of certain physical limitations) don't have the equipment to sound like black folks when they speak -- especially men. (It's a function of resonance.) But all this is getting into stuff that really is an aside. My central point was that most black folks speak AAVE as an integral part of our culture, which is what I wanted to make clear to Quill. Under discussion was whether or not it could correctly be said that most African-Americans speak AAVE. And my point is that it most definitely could be. And the only nonblacks I've ever heard to speak AAVE and actually sound authentic (even if not necessarily "black," ethnically) were those who grew up around black folks; they grew up speaking AAVE. Cadence and inflection seem difficult for others to mimic -- though, as I said, Jamie Kennedy did a passable job -- passable enough to be funny as hell. Comedian Robin Williams, on the other hand, does a truly miserable job. Every time he tries to mimic a black person, I wanna just haul off and slap 'im.

<dd>Excuse me, but you've got to direct me to some legitimate sources here. A lot of them. Deecee, if anyone had the temerity, stupidity-- what can I say--the unmitigated gall to state in my presence that an African-American could not, e.g. recite Shakespeare, dance ballet, sing opera, comprehend higher mathematics or speak ancient Greek because <i>black</i> "folks generally (because of certain physical limitations) don't have the equipment to ... like [white] folks when they ... -- especially men. (It's a function of ....)" my ire would know no bounds. Unless you've got some serious scientific backup, please do not make such statements--at all--ever.

<p>You completely misconstrue (twist?) my comments. What I said was that white people generally cannot/do not <i>sound</i> like black folks when they speak because they have certain physical limitations. This is not related to the grammar and syntax of AAVE -- nor is it related to the other, more subtle aspects of AAVE that are cultural in nature. I simply happened to mention that most black folks can quite accurately discern who is and who is not black by hearing them speak or sing -- affectations of speech aside, vocal techniques/song stylings aside -- which can be misleading. I certainly can, and the same is true of my black friends, particularly when the speaker is male. Ask any of your black friends if they can, and they'll tell you, yes, in most cases they certainly can. It's simply a matter of resonance. Ask anyone who teaches voice, anyone who knows about what makes violins sound different. What gives a violin resonance? Its structure -- the sound board and the aperture. Same thing with the human voice: the nasal cavity and sinuses. In blacks, <i>generally</i>, the structures are different; they are broader and wider. The result is what music coaches call "head-voice resonance." And, yes, as I've already stated by using qualifications such as "generally," there are exceptions in sound quality. Michael McDonald does a far better job mimicking black vocal styles than, say, Michael Bolton or Janice Joplin (whose voice I despise; she croaks and screams like a cat with its tail caught in a door). No one white I've ever heard has had a voice with the particular combination or quality of resonance and power of, say, Gladys Knight, or Etta James, or Big Maybelle, or Bobby Bland, or Howlin' Wolf, or -- you name 'em. And with all the singers out here mimicking/adapting/adopting black vocal stylings, from Mick Jagger to Joe Cocker to Celine Dione to Christina Aguilera (who has an impressive set of pipes and does a more than decent job with what she's got -- and, no, I'm not a fan), did you ever ask yourself <i>why</i>? The simple answer is head-voice resonance. Now, I hesitated when I used the word "limitations," because it is in some way value-laden and I knew could be construed to mean "less than" or "inferior to," when such is not the case -- unless one applies a subjective standard of particular personal taste. (White folks get extremely touchy when it comes to stuff like this!) But the word simply fits in this context.</p>
<p>But all this has gotten too far off the point. I've said what I had to say about AAVE and culture. Yes, most African-Americans can rightly be said to speak AAVE in some form. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 06:50, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, but the idea that blacks and whites have substantially different vocal apparatus was debunked years ago, AFAIK. I don't deny that black and white speakers, at least in America, tend to sound different. But this is not a matter of vocal apparatus. Rather, it's a question of <i>accent</i> -- they have simply learned to use their voices differently thanks to growing up in different subcultures, just as a white New Yorker learns to use his voice differently than a white Georgian does. No physical explanation is necessary (or possible, I think). --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnen_a442.html" title="User:Marnen">Marnen Laibow-Koser</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnen_680d.html" title="User talk:Marnen">(talk)</a> 07:27, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC) -- P.S. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuill_7bcf.html" title="User:Quill">Quill</a>, I'm glad to know we agree.

<p>You really <i>should</i> ask your black friends; they will surprise you. That phenomenon you're speaking of is all about some black folks making assumptions based on the speaking of SAE -- what some (ignorant) folks call "sounding white." People often assume I'm white, too, when I speak SAE. Just as some people might assume, based on musical <i>style</i>, that Aguilera was black. Assumptions color perceptions. All the time.</p>
<p>A simple example of what I'm talking about regarding head-voice resonance: I'm in a back room, and the TV is on in another. I hear a voice speaking SAE (he's got the inflection and everything down), and it sounds like a black man, so I'm drawn to the television. Yep. It's a brother. Happens <i>all</i> the time. Another: The TV is on, and there's this commercial for some car. The music is "Key Largo." I'm listenin', diggin' the music, but I don't recognize the voice or the song. I'm thinking it's a sister, but then I'd probably know who it is; it's too good. Is she or isn't she? Maybe a new singer? I listen carefully. There's that resonance, that depth of tone. It's gotta be a sister, I conclude. So, I start thinkin'. Only <i>then</i> do I come to the conclusion it's the voice of Carmen McRae. Of course, in retrospect, that music is classic Carmen -- I just didn't think/realize it at the time. Another example: I live a few floors above the street, but sound bounces off the apartment buildings on the block and deflect it upward -- the canyon effect. I hear voices below all the time. I can <i>always</i> tell if it's a black man or a white man, based simply on the quality of the tone. If you've heard Nigerians speak, there is a free, audible aspiration with vowel sounds that clears the throat and the nostrils, that is actually forceful, almost explosive. <i>That</i> is the quality I hear in the African-American voice, particularly in males, during spirited conversational exchanges. It's that same head-voice resonance again. Virtually every African-American knows precisely what I'm talking about. (The more I engage in exchanges with white folks on Wikipedia, the more I am reminded of why so many black people just don't bother. Everything is an effort, everything requires some explanation.) And that's not meant to be a complaint or a putdown. No <i>wonder</i> American society is so polarized; the gap of understanding (and misunderstanding) is <i>so</i> wide, communication about even <i>simple</i> things comes on like work. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 10:55, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please don't think that us whitefolx don't know what you're talking about on the vocal quality issue -- I know exactly what you're talking about. Heard it myself many a time. I just don't agree with your explanation of the cause. There's no "gap of understanding" here, unless it be that you're apparently trying to convince yourself that others' disagreement with you is racially flavored. I can't speak for Quill or anyone else, but at least in my own case, race plays no part in what I'm writing; I'm just trying for accuracy.

<p>I'm not going to spend my time searching the Internet for sources -- particularly for stuff that isn't germane to the article in question and that is perfectly obvious to just about every black person on the street. I have neither the time nor the patience. But that's just me. After a while, this kind of stuff gets really old really fast; it's just wearisome. I've already spent too much time discussing this. What some white folks stubbornly want to believe is what they want to believe -- that they can sound just like Otis, or Aretha, or Bobby Bland, or Etta James, or Mavis Staples if they just learn the words and how to bend the notes. Yeah, right. I don't know if it's that seemingly omnipresent sense of white entitlement, or some misplaced sense of egalitarianism or what, but I'm certainly not gonna waste any more time trying to tell them otherwise. If what I have to say is so "interesting," then they'll use their search engines, ask their "black friends," speak to a voice coach -- whatever. Fine 'n' dandy. I'm done.

<dd>Deeceevoice, I'm disappointed in you. I think a lot of what you have to say is extremely valuable, but this refusal to back up what you claim is really shooting yourself in the foot. Your assertions may be "perfectly obvious to just about every black person on the street", but they're not obvious to me (or Quill, or probably a lot of other nonblack Wikipedians). It appears that you complain about not being understood by nonblacks, but then you refuse to explain yourself when asked by people who genuinely want to understand what you're saying. That's not fair, either to yourself or to anyone else.</dd>

<p>Maybe your interpretation of "evidence" is to cauco-centric. Evidence can take many forms i mean. One very important indicator of what Deecevoice is asserting can be found in the music industry. There does seem to be some evidence of general vocal difference. There are differences in hair which does not justify racist arguments, so if it is the case that the particular voice-type common to African American speech might be less possible or impossible for white people due to this slight difference, it does not have to be seen as an indicator of anti white bigotry of any kind. Its a far stretch indeed between voicebox, and intelligence level arguments.80.192.59.196 15:53, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>chuckling* Like I care what it sounds like to you.&#160;:-p The statement isn't misleading at all. The article already states that many African-Americans speak a combination of SAE and AAVE and that code switching is prevalent. Further, not having seen a poll of any kind on the matter, I must rely on my knowledge and personal experience as an African-American. And based upon those two things, IMO, the statement in the context in which it appears is absolutely correct. Two of you have provided examples of black folks who've confessed to you what difficulty they have in speaking AAVE. That "oh, poor me" complaining can be even more of an artifice, far more of a put-on than code switching. Now, I'm not saying such is the case with the instances described herein, but certain knee-grows like to give the impression that they're so far removed from the "great unwashed" of the black masses, that they have a problem fitting in; they're too "well-spoken," as white folks are fond of putting it. Most black folks I know who have their heads straight (not straight-ened) wouldn't dream of saying such things to someone white; it smacks not only of personal insecurity but a desire to suck up to white folks. Yeah, there are plenty of self-loathing, uppity black folks who speak SAE who make a big deal out of being teased because of their "proper grammar." They think their above-average facility with SAE somehow makes them special, and they seek white approval/validation. (This syndrome is particularly noticeable in half-white kids who enjoy being an "exotic" -- just as long as they're not perceived as being "<i>too</i>" black -- and are not above playing the classic tragic mulatto in order to set themselves apart.) But it's my experience that even many of these same folks' speech has readily discernible elements of AAVE if they've grown up in a black family (in this case, generally not the "tragic mulattoes"). One simply has to know what to look for. Finally, Quill, given that black folks <i>do</i> code switch, and given the fact that you're white, you're certainly in a far less tenable situation than I to accurately judge how many black people speak AAVE, how often and to what extent. What part of that don't you get? <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 21:34, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well, Deecee, I've been called 'clueless' before; but since many more people think I'm brilliant, I can live with the fact that there are a few who don't. In this case, I happen to be quite clued in; you don't recognize that because you've made assumptions and decided that you don't have to credit any disagreement because of those assumptions.

<dd>-- not to mention such a self-serving observation. (Crackin' up, still. Dang. And <i>whose</i> ego is showin' here?)

Now, writing "You got no clue" is different from calling you "clueless." (Far be it from me to do so! I certainly wouldn't want to be among the lowly, benighted "few" who don't recognize the awesomeness of your magnificent brain power!) The simple fact is you are in absolutely no position to have any kind of credible opinion on the matter -- unless, of course you have some sort of empirical evidence. Which you don't. Otherwise, you would have presented it. So, again, my "brilliant," white brutha, when it comes to the numbers of blacks who speak AAVE and the numbers who don't, <b>you got no clue.</b> It should be a simple concept for someone of your dazzling intellectual capacities.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">An apology to Quill</span></h2>
<p>Quill, as promised in my e-mail, a public apology. I think the firestorm over my RfC with Wareware has died down sufficiently so that this apology will not seem self-serving.</p>
<p>I do sincerely regret my over-the-top response to your labeling of my comments as "bigotry" in my earlier posts. I was having a bit of fun -- but at your expense. We've disagreed frequently in the past over this and that --and we've also agreed on occasion. When our paths <i>have</i> crossed in disputed territory, we've usually been able to come to a rapprochement of sorts that I believe has enured to the benefit of the discussion/article at hand. That, I think, speaks well of your reasonableness and fundamental fairness -- and, I'd like to think, of mine as well.</p>
<p>As I also told you in my e-mail, self-examination is a good thing -- something I try to do regularly and honestly. I questioned why I had such a reaction to your rather tame, though, IMO, inaccurate and unjustified, language and such a measured, even-tempered response to the appallingly racist vitriol of Wareware. Aside from the normal objections one would have to being accused of being something they are not, I can only surmise that I was completely fed up with what I perceive to be the injustice of being wrongly accused of bigotry on a website where no one but myself had ever reproached Wareware for his flagrant racism. My disgust, however, at that situation perpetrated another injustice, and you were the hapless target.</p>
<p>Again, I'm sorry. Apologizing is not a problem for me. Indeed, my ego is <i>not</i> involved in any of this. But my sense of who I am and what I wish to become is, and that actually makes this apology a relatively easy thing. But don't misunderstand; I <i>do</i> take it seriously. Hopefully, we can continue to discuss, debate, cooperate, write, redact and redact again to improve this sprawling, informative, dynamic, organic, sometimes frustrating work in progress. I am (as, we all are, hopefully) a work in progress as well. And I will do and be better. I promise. &#160;:-)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Accepted. I have no idea what has been going on between you and Wareware or anyone else, so I'll stick to what's been going on here. It was big of you to follow up your e-mail with a public note and I do appreciate it.</dd>
<dd>Deecee, I am well aware that the racist attitudes that are still only too prevalent in the U.S. and elsewhere are reflected in Wikipedia as well. I have felt and still feel that the only way to confront them is to remain level-headed, accurate and clear. I'm not saying I always am, I'm saying I think that's best.</dd>
<dd>Just want to make one more point: I draw a distinction between bigotry and racism. Racism is an institutionalized phenomenon and I don't think you can be accused of it. Further, I did not wish to imply that I thought you were motivated by bigotry, rather that I found the statement bigoted.</dd>
<dd>Let's put this one behind us and press on, shall we?</dd>

<p>Quill, four points. Yes, I understand perfectly the difference between racism and bigotry. And, no. There's no need or desire on my part to discuss Wareware's pathology here. Three: your appraisal of my comments as "bigoted" stem from your misunderstanding, which I may in the future be able to dispel -- maybe not. And, finally, I'm pleased you've accepted my apology.&#160;:-) And, yes. Let's <i>do</i> this thing. (Guess that's five.)

<li>Really. First off, one of the references on this page is a book named "Suite for Ebony and Phonics". As for sources which explain better, the source already listed in this article (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~rickford/ebonics/EbonicsExamples.html" class="external text" title="http://www.stanford.edu/~rickford/ebonics/EbonicsExamples.html" rel="nofollow">Ebonics Notes and Discussion</a>) says, "Ebonics derives its form from ebony (black) and phonics (sound, the study of sound)".

</ul>
<p>I don't want to set off an argument here; I'm just wondering. I'll have to get hold of this book; as it is, Rickford seems to be using a poorly OCR'd version. Observe: "Ebonics derives its form from ebony (black) and phonics (sound, the study of sound) and refers to the study of the language of black people in <u>allits cutural</u> uniqueness" (my emphasis). This isn't Rickford talking; it's Rickford approvingly quoting something written over 30 years ago. The study of sound is acoustics; but OK, in this context it's clear that human sounds are what's meant. The last time I heard, "phonics" was a way of teaching kids to read. Could this be an OCR goof for "phonetics"? It's conceivable that "phonics" was indeed also used to mean "phonetics" or "acoustics"; but if so we should gloss the explanation in the article, lest people misinfer that Ebonics is named after a pedagogic technique. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:30, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

A way of teaching kids to read, Phonetics, and Acoustics. So instead of seeing phonics as inadaquate it's better described as all encompasing. As an additional argument for phonics I'd also like to go a bit more basic (although less verifiable) in that supposing all these words are close enough, phonics would be a better choice simply because it forms a more tightly knit portmanteau. ebon and nics instead of ebon and ics.

<p>I've always understood ebonics to be the "language of the streets". Of course, not everyone "on the street" uses it, even among African Americans. Since ebonics, like most street languages, is fraught with mispronunciations, slang, and grammatical errors, it should be regarded as of limited practical use, and certainly not to be considered equal to Standard American English. <i>.... comment added at 21:25, 22 March 2006 by Jlujan69</i></p>

<dd>(i) Please sign your comments here; you do this by adding ~~~~ to the end. (ii) Yes, Ebonics is of limited practical use. So is Standard American English, which gets blank looks when spoken in most places in the nation where I happen to live. Ebonics is indeed of more limited practical use than standard AE. So? (iii) Like any dialect, Ebonics does not normally have grammatical errors. (Your belief that it has suggests that you haven't digested the article.) It does indeed have grammatical (morphophonological) errors in terms of SAE, in the same way that SAE has simplifications in terms of Ebonics. (iv) As for mispronunciations, yes, Ebonics is riddled with them in terms of SAE, just as SAE is riddled with them in terms of Ebonics (or Danish or whatever). (v) Most lects of any language are plenty of slang (or, if you somehow perceive this as a threat, are "fraught with" slang); it's hardly surprising that Ebonics is too. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 01:01, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, "Ebonics" is not an offensive term. Yes, "Ebonics" may have appeared more often in the popular press. Yes, "Ebonics" has been used by linguists as well as educators, politicians and journalists (and right-wing blowhards, etc.). However, the article is primarily about linguistics rather than education or politics; and in linguistics "Ebonics" is not a widely used term; it's much less common than AAVE (typically spelled out the first time, abbreviated thereafter). It <i>might</i> be a good idea to split this article into (1) "African American Vernacular English", a purely descriptive article devoid of any mention of education or politics (the same sort of article that's provided for, say, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimorese.html" title="Baltimorese">Baltimorese</a>), and (2) "The Ebonics debate", an article about all the politicking.

<li>AAVE is <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhoticism.html" title="Rhoticism">non-rhotic</a>, so the <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alveolar_approximant.html" title="Alveolar approximant">alveolar approximant</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɹ]</span> is usually dropped if not followed by a vowel. However, the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɹ]</span> may also be dropped in other cases, e.g. "story" realized as "sto'y". This is perhaps due to the use of 'y' as a semi-vowel.</li>
</ul>
<p>This description seems to be lacking something in the description of cases where intervocalic R is dropped. Just how is <i>story</i> pronounced without an R? What forms the hiatus between the [o] and the [i]? In SAE, it's pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[stɔɹi]</span>. If the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɹ]</span> is deleted, you have a strange monosyllabic word with a [oi] diphthong. Is the word pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[stɔi]</span> (as though it were written "stoy"), or is some other hiatus inserted, like [w], [j], or <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glottal_stop.html" title="Glottal stop">glottal stop</a>?

<p>Wasn't the first law suit relating to Ebonics (AAVE) filed against the Ann Arbor Public Schools. Oakland Keeps being mentioned, I know it was a more substantial situation but come on. Want info so maybe include in A2 article. Also am I wrong that Ebonics does not meet the definition of a dialect? Just asking can see this is a topic with a lot of emotions involved and do not want to be offensive to anyone. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by [[User:{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{1}}}|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/{{{1}}}|contribs]]).</small></p>
<p>There is no universally agreed upon definition of dialect. Every single language that anyone speaks is some kind of dialect, so the question is not whether something is a dialect or not, but whether two language varieties are each a dialect of the same language, or whether they are two entirely different languages (or I guess whether they aren't different enough to be two dialects, and are actually the same dialect of the same language). The general rule-of-thumb among linguists is that two dialects of a language will be mutually intelligable (i.e. the speakers are generally able to understand eachother), whereas speakers of two different languages will not. To be separate dialects, there need to be some kind of lexical (words) or syntactical (grammar) differences. African American English and Standard American English have lexical and syntactical differences, and are mutually intelligable. They'd both be considered dialects of English. So yes, 'Ebonics' qualifies as a dialect. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahern_c117.html" title="User:Mahern">Mahern</a> 20:43, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From what I know, and from what I have read all over ther net, only a very limited group of linguists (ones who are politically motivated, or have been paid to produce the "desired" results) seem to support the notion that Ebonics is a lauguage or even a dialect. The view from the majority (no I dont have a representitive sample survey) seem to agree with the general public that it is just a corruption of English, with bad pronunciation and grammar. All my black friends agree that it is just street slang, and the ones who work in big business and community programs view it as something that it's holding back many young black people as when they go to an interview and speak they come accross as uneducated and illiterate.</p>
<p>Also, an interesting article from a very intelligent woman <a href="http://www.thepinelog.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/10/19/453740c363cf2" class="external free" title="http://www.thepinelog.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/10/19/453740c363cf2" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepinelog.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/10/19/453740c363cf2</a></p>

To ignore these facts is to ignore our origins and the obvious, glaring fact that we are <i>not</i> simply dark-skinned "Americans." You want to pretend that we came here as a blank slate, culturally, or that our tortured tenure in this nation somehow robbed us of every, single vestige of our Africanness -- despite ample evidence to the contrary? Fine. Deny it if you must. But dispassionate observation of the myriad manifestations of the imprint of Mother Africa in everyday African-American culture and common sense say otherwise. The label is an appropriate one.</p>
<p>Finally and BTW, I find the term "Ebonics" insulting -- for many of the same reasons I eschew the term "Negro." I prefer AAVE; it comes without all the ignorant, racist baggage associated with the Oakland blowup over using AAVE as a pedagogical tool. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 14:57, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not necessarily saying it should bemoved, but the wikipedia policy according to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a> is "Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature," which would seem to indicate that it should be moved. I can't speak for anybody else, but I have never heard it refered to as "african american vernacular english." It maybe be more commonly refered to as such in academic/linguistic circles, but again the policy is to put the article at where the average person is going to look, and I don't think the average person has heard "african american vernacular english" as a term. For the same general reason, the article is under <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> and not William Jefferson Clinton, for example. (Obviously if it is an offensive term this might not be an appropriate thing to do, and I can't really comment as to whether it is or isn't, though I have not heard it used as one).--Derco 23:56, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Firstly, for most people I've spoken to "Ebonics" immediately calls up the Oakland Resolution and surrounding controversy, which is not what this article is about. I believe that the term was made up by the people involved in that resolution, and is a bit of a misnomer anyways since it comes from the word "phonics" (which only refers to the sound system of AAE when the difference is mostly syntactical). In just about every instance I've heard, people who use the word "Ebonics" are referring to it negatively, and more neutral or positive comments use "Black English", "African American English", or "AAVE". Anyone who is actually talking about it as a language system tends to use those terms. There's also been a slight move from some in the linguistics communtity to take out the word "vernacular" since it has slightly negative connotations, and AAE is increasingly being used in print. "African American English" seems a bit more self explanatory. What about moving it to that? <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahern_c117.html" title="User:Mahern">Mahern</a> 20:05, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Jive" a synonym?</span></h2>
<p>Is "Jive" really a synonym for AAVE? I'd thought it properly referred to a slang subset of it.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 23:38, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>hi, not sure if this has already been addressed but I think saying "jive" is a synonym of AAVE is prob on the order of saying, say, yiddish and hebrew are synonymous. or "native" is the same as all the languages spoken on papua new guinea. ok, that's over the top. airplane was a great flick, to the extent that.. bye. <a href="../../../k/z/z/User%7EKzzl_8d54.html" title="User:Kzzl">Kɔffee</a>drinks<a href="../../../%C9%94/_/_/%C6%86.html" title="Ɔ">you</a> 17:42, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i think "colloquially known as" is cool. izl. <a href="../../../k/z/z/User%7EKzzl_8d54.html" title="User:Kzzl">Kɔffee</a>drinks<a href="../../../%C9%94/_/_/%C6%86.html" title="Ɔ">you</a> 04:22, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>hopefully if people call some speech jive, they mean one example, and don't refer to the entire code as cajoling/misleading. yeah. <a href="../../../k/z/z/User%7EKzzl_8d54.html" title="User:Kzzl">Kɔffee</a>drinks<a href="../../../%C9%94/_/_/%C6%86.html" title="Ɔ">you</a> 04:28, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pharos is correct. "Jive" is a term for African-American slang. It does <i>not</i> refer to AAVE as a whole. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 14:59, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems HIGHLY unlikely to me that "jive" is from Zulu. The Zulu word is most likely taken from English, as the "i" that it starts with seems to suggest. Compare "iphepha" (newspaper). [<a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=jive" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=jive" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] relates it to a Wolof word. There has historically beem very little (or practically no) Zulu emigration (forced or otherwise) to the US. Petrus 10:25, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now Jive is being called a "pejorative" name. I don't think this is really any more accurate than calling it a synonym. To my knowledge, Jive is just a name for African American slang. Now, I suppose some folks could use "Jive" for general AAVE in a pejorative way, but I don't think that's especially common.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 16:54, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
