<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Initiated_Church_c072.html" title="Edit section: Nomenclature">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nomenclature</span></h2>
<p>A variety of overlapping terms exist for these forms of Christianity: <i>African Initiated Churches</i>, <i>African Independent Churches</i>, <i>African Indigenous Churches</i> and <i>African Instituted Churches</i>. The abbreviation <b>AIC</b> covers them all. The differences in names correspond to an aspect that a researcher wish to emphasize. Those who wish to point out that AICs exhibit African cultural forms, describe them as "indigenous," and so on. In other words, these terms have largely been imposed upon such groups, and may not be the way they would describe themselves.</p>
<p>Some scholars argue that independent churches or religious movements demonstrate <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syncretism.html" title="Syncretism">syncretism</a> or partial integration between aspects of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> belief and African traditional religion, but the degree to which this happens varies, and has often been exaggerated. Often these churches have resulted from a process of <a href="../../../a/c/c/Acculturation.html" title="Acculturation">acculturation</a> between traditional African beliefs and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> Christianity, and have split from their parent churches.</p>
<p>The charge of syncretism suggests an 'impure' and superifical form of Christianity used to maintain older cultural practices and beliefs. More recently, academic opinion has shifted towards recognizing that all forms of Christianity entail some adaptation to ethnic or regional cultural systems. Bengt Sundkler, one of the most prominent pioneers of research on African independent churches in South Africa, initially argued that AICs were bridges back to a pre-industrial culture. Later, he recognized instead that AICs helped their affiliates to adapt to a modernizing world that was hostile to their cultural beliefs.</p>
<p>While the term "African" is appropriate, given that these Christian groupings formed in Africa, AICs differ from one another. Not all African cultural systems are the same: regional variations occur between West, East, and Southern Africans, and the AICs will reflect these. Africans tend to have in common a belief that ancestral spirits interact with the living (a belief also shared by many Asian peoples). As the discussion of classification below shows, the various AICs also differ widely in their organisational forms. Some resemble western Christian denominations (Ethiopian-types), while others may not (Zionist-types). Some have large numbers of affiliates located all over a country (the Zion Christian Church of South Africa), while others may consist only of an extended family and their acquaintances meeting in a house or out of doors.</p>
<p>Recently, even the idea that AICs are indigenous to Africa have had to be surrendered, as AICs can now be found in Europe (e.g. Germany, Britain) and the United States. In such cases, the term "African" suggests the continent of origin, rather than of location.</p>

<p>African Initiated Churches are found across Africa; they are particularly well-documented in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Africa_7a65.html" title="Southern Africa">southern Africa</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Africa_e6b4.html" title="West Africa">West Africa</a>.

<p>During the colonial period, many <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black</a> converts to Christianity were unable fully to reconcile their beliefs with the teachings of their church leaders, and split from their parent churches. The reasons for these splits were usually either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Political - an effort to escape <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">white</a> control</li>
<li>Historical - many of the parent churches, particularly those from a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> tradition, had themselves emerged from a process of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schism_%28religion%29.html" title="Schism (religion)">schism</a> and synthesis</li>
<li>Cultural - the result of trying to accommodate Christian belief within an African <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_view.html" title="World view">world view</a></li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Initiated_Church_c072.html" title="Edit section: Classification and taxonomy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Classification and taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>There are thousands of African Initiated Churches (more than 10000 in South Africa alone) and each one has its own characteristics. Church historians, missiologists, sociologists and others have therefore tried to group them according to common characteristics, though there have often been disagreements about which characteristics are most significant, and which taxonomy is most accurate. Though it is possible to distinguish groups of denominations with common features, there is also much overlap, with some denominations sharing the characteristics of two or more groups.</p>
<p>Many AICs share traditions with Christians from other parts of the Christian world, and these can also be used in classifying them. So there are AICs of Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, Pentecostal and Orthodox traditions. Some are Sabbatarian, some are Zionist, and so on. The categories described below are those that have been used by many church historians and others, but there are no rigid boundaries between them.</p>

<p>Ethiopian churches generally retain the Christian <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">doctrines</a> of their mother church in an unreformed state. Ethiopian African Initiated Churches, which are recently-formed Protestant congregations, mostly in southern Africa, arose from the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopian_movement.html" title="Ethiopian movement">Ethiopian movement</a> of the late nineteenth century, which taught that African Christian churches should be under the control of black people. They should not be confused with the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church_1c2e.html" title="Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church">Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coptic_Christianity_198f.html" title="Coptic Christianity">Coptic Orthodox Church</a>, which have a much longer and doctrinally utterly distinct history, though some denominations that arose from the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopian_movement.html" title="Ethiopian movement">Ethiopian movement</a> have united with these bodies.</p>

In the early 1900s Zionist missionaries went to South Africa from the USA, and established congregations. They emphasised divine healing, abstention from pork, and the wearing of white robes.</p>
<p>The Zionist missionaries were followed by <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostal.html" title="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a> ones, whose teaching was concentrated on spiritual gifts and baptism in the Holy Spirit, with speaking in tongues as the initial evidence of this. Out of this movement arose the predominantly white <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_Faith_Mission_9246.html" title="Apostolic Faith Mission">Apostolic Faith Mission</a>, which emphasised the Pentecostal teaching, while the black Zionists retained much of the original Zionist tradition. The Zionists split into several different denominations, although the reason for this was more the rapid growth of the movement than divisions. A split in the Zionist movement in the USA meant that few missionaries came to Southern Africa after about 1908, and the movement in Southern Africa and its growth was the result of black leadership and initiative.</p>
<p>As time passed some Zionist groups began to mix aspects of traditional <a href="../../../a/f/r/African.html" title="African">African</a> beliefs like <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancestor_worship.html" title="Ancestor worship">ancestor worship</a> with Christian doctrine. Many Zionists stress faith-healing and <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelation.html" title="Revelation">revelation</a>, and in many congregations the leader is viewed as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet.html" title="Prophet">prophet</a>.</p>

<p>Some AICs with strong leadership have been described by some researchers as <i>Messianic</i>, but some of the researchers who did this initially have changed their minds later. The churches that have been called <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianism.html" title="Messianism">Messianic</a> focus on the power and sanctity of their leaders; often the leaders are thought by their followers to possess <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>-like characteristics.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladura.html" title="Aladura">Aladura</a> Pentecostal Churches, emanated from Nigeria. They rely on the power of prayer and in all effects of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Some typical examples of these churches today are Christ Apostolic Church, Cherubim and Seraphim, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Winners, Mountain of Fire, and church of the Lord (Aladura). The first Aladura Movement started at Ijebu-Ode, Nigeria in 1918 by Sophia Odunlami, a school teacher, and Joseph Sadare, a goldsmith. They both attended St. Saviour's Anglican Church. They rejected infant baptism and all forms of medicine, whether western or traditional. In consequence, they initiated the "Prayer Band", popularly called "Egbe Aladura". Mr Joseph Sadare was compelled to give up his post in the Synod and others were forced to resign their jobs and to withdraw their children from the Anglican School. The Aladura began as a renewal movement in search of true spirituality.</p>
<p>A revival took place in 1918 during the outbreak of influenza epidemic. The group filled with the Holy Ghost used prayer to save many lives affected by the Influenza epidemic. This consolidated the formation of the prayer group and the group was properly named <b>Precious Stone</b> and later to <b>Diamond Society</b>. By 1920, the Diamond Society had grown tremendously and had started to form branches around the Western region of Nigeria. In particular, David Odubanjo went to start the Lagos branch. The group emphasized divine healing, Holiness, and All Sufficiency of God, which form the three cardinal beliefs of the Church today. For this reason, the group had association with Faith Tabernacle of Philadelphia and changed its name to <b>Faith Tabernacle of Nigeria</b>.</p>
<p>A great revival started in July 1930 by the raising of a dead body by Apostle Joseph Ayo Babalola at Oke-Oye in Ilesa. People trooped from neighbouring cities and countries to receive healing at Ilesa. Several people were healed through the power of prayer and there were evidences of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The revival lasted about 60 days and it's still regarded as the greatest revival ever in Nigeria. Faith Tabernacle of Nigeria later invited the Apostolic Church of England in 1931 to form an Association which lasted till 1939. The Revival group went through several name changes until, after 24 years of its formation, it finally adopted the name <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ_Apostolic_Church_6718.html" title="Christ Apostolic Church">Christ Apostolic Church</a> (CAC) in 1942. Today, CAC has spread worldwide and definitely is the precursor of Aladura Pentecostal Churches in Nigeria. Visit [CAC website] at <a href="http://www.cacworldwide.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.cacworldwide.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cacworldwide.net/</a>. The Church has established several schools at all levels, including <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Ayo_Babalola_University_18a2.html" title="Joseph Ayo Babalola University">Joseph Ayo Babalola University</a>.</p>
