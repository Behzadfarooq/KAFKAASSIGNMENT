<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/Africare.html" title="Edit section: Early History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early History</span></h3>
<p>Over the course of its 35 years, Africare has become a leader among private, charitable U.S. organizations assisting Africa. It is the oldest and largest African American organization in the field. And Africa is Africare's specialty. In 1970, when Africare was founded, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Africa_e6b4.html" title="West Africa">West Africa</a> was in the midst of one of the most severe droughts in its history. Animals were dying. Crops could not grow. Villagers were fleeing their homes in search of water. Millions of human lives hung in the balance.</p>
<p>Among those providing help--medical aid to the Maina Soroa Hospital in Diffa, Niger were 17 American volunteers, led by William O. Kirker, M.D., and Barbara Jean A. Kirker, who named their group "Africare". (The Kirkers themselves had been working in Africa, to improve African health care, since 1966.) Eventually, they needed more support. <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diori_Hamani_8437.html" title="Diori Hamani">Diori Hamani</a>, then president of the Republic of Niger, appealed to the United States on the effort's behalf. He went on to pose a broader question: Why don't black Americans, whose ancestors came from the continent, respond to the needs in Africa?</p>
<p>It was to C. Payne Lucas, among others, that President Diori Hamani addressed his appeal. Lucas was then the director of the Peace Corps Office of Returned Volunteers in Washington. He had served previously in Niger and knew the president from that time. Dialogue ensued. What emerged was a concept for a new breed of assistance organization: progressive like America, culturally respectful like the Peace Corps and, uniquely, multiracial in origin as well as Africa wide in scope.</p>
<p>In 1970, Africare was incorporated in Hawaii, with Kirker as its founder and first president. In 1971, Africare was permanently re-incorporated in Washington, D.C.; Lucas became the executive director (later, that title changed to "president"), and Kirker joined the Board. In addition to Kirker and Lucas, other incorporators were Oumarou G. Youssoufou, a Nigerien diplomat, and Joseph C. Kennedy, Ph.D., then at Peace Corps. The original concept of a "new breed of assistance organization" had become a reality.</p>
<p>A $39,550 budget, a U.S. headquarters in the basement of Lucas's home and one project in Niger hardly signaled an impressive start. But Africare's founders loved Africa. They envisioned what Africare could become. They also had the tremendous drive needed to pursue their dreams for their new organization and what it could do for the continent of Africa.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Africare concentrated on helping to alleviate the effects of severe drought in West Africa. By the mid 1970s, Africare had shifted its emphasis to development programs in the areas of food, water, the environment and health--expanding in the late 1980s to include microenterprise development, governance, basic education and, tragically, HIV/AIDS response. Africare provides emergency humanitarian aid as well.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/Africare.html" title="Edit section: Recent History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Recent History</span></h3>
<p>In mid June 2002, C. Payne Lucas retired after 31 years as president and Africare welcomed as its third president, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_E._Coles_e455.html" title="Julius E. Coles">Julius E. Coles</a>: a 28 year veteran of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the first director of the Ralph J. Bunche International Affairs Center at Howard University and, most recently, director of the Andrew Young Center for International Affairs at Morehouse College.</p>
<p>At Africare's founding in 1970, President Diori Hamani of Niger noted,<br />
"The task undertaken by Africare is as immense as the continent of Africa itself, which must confront problems unimaginable to people who have not lived in African settings."</p>
<p>By 1997, Africare had expanded to the point where President Nelson Mandela of South Africa stated,<br />
"I regard Africare as one of America`s greatest gifts to Africa. Your work, in every corner of our great continent, has sustained our own commitment to building a strong and free Africa."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/Africare.html" title="Edit section: Noteworthy Accomplishments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Noteworthy Accomplishments</span></h3>
<p>To date, Africare has delivered more than $540 million in assistance—representing over (2,000 projects need to update) and millions of beneficiaries—to 35 countries Africa wide. Today, Africare’s 150 plus programs reach families and communities in 25 nations in every region of Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>• Africare has been a pioneer in village based rural development in Africa.</p>
<p>In the area of health, special achievements have been in child survival, river blindness control, malaria prevention, national level pharmaceutical management and HIV/AIDS response at the grassroots. Africare has constructed thousands upon thousands of wells and irrigation systems, bringing safe, reliable water supplies to some of the most isolated, desertified communities in Africa. Food production, food monetization and food security continue to represent major focal points of Africare’s workCas does assistance to small scale entrepreneurs, from edible oil producers throughout Southern Africa to women farmers and women owned co ops Africa wide.</p>
<p>In Zambia, where it has worked since 1978, Africare has touched several hundred communities in every corner of the nation. It has been especially effective in helping rural groups, particularly women and youth, to develop the capacity to generate income and to support community needs. These initiatives have encouraged the cultivation and processing of sunflower seed into edible oil, renewable use of forest resources and marketing of honey and furniture, support for orphans and vulnerable children, mobilization of adolescents to educate peers about HIV/AIDS and development of community schools.</p>
<p>• Africare has worked on the front lines of almost every humanitarian emergency in Africa for 34 years: the Sahelian drought of the 1970s; the Somalia refugee crisis and the Africa wide drought of the 1980s; since the 1990s, crises brought on by warfare in Angola, Somalia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Burundi and elsewhere; and since 2002, the resurgence of widespread famine in Southern Africa and the Horn (revise and update)</p>
<p>Throughout Sierra Leone's ten-year civil war (1991-2001) as much as one-fifth of the population were internally displaced (IDP). Africare's intervention began with addressing the immediate food and medical needs of the IDP population, and subsequently promoting self-reliance and self-sufficiency of that population. Activities have included farmer self-help assistance, child immunization, and health care for pregnant women. The restoration of human dignity and the independence of those who were physically, psychologically, and economically affected by the war was a direct result of Africare's intervention. Africare continues to address the basic needs of the vulnerable population through its USAID-funded CORAD project. Through CORAD, Africare has been able to improve health conditions and re-establish livelihood's through agricultural activities for vulnerable women and children. Africare has used the inclusive model of organizing and empowering village-level groups that include members who represent every segment of the community.</p>
<p>• Africare has provided a working bridge between Africans and African Americans. Before Africare came into being, African Americans donated relatively little to Africa (except through the church) because there was no single agency that truly sought to create a bridge to "the motherland". Africare set out to create that bridge, and it has had noteworthy success. Among Africare's most loyal donors have been African-American churches, community groups, social clubs, sororities and fraternities, and more. Sums donated by African Americans have ranged from annual individual gifts of $10 or $25 to the African-American Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority's total giving, over 15 years, of $1.4 million. Through numerous Africare-sponsored events, African Americans have had the chance to learn about Africa and to get to know African people. From the other side, through its African Diplomatic Outreach Program, Africare has arranged monthly discussions between the African diplomatic corps in Washington, D.C., and top-level American experts in fields of concern to Africa. The meetings have facilitated working relationships between African ambassadors and their U.S. counterparts, in turn advancing Africa's cause.</p>

<p>President of Africare, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Coles_03fd.html" title="Julius Coles">Julius Coles</a>, wrote words "10 ways you can help Africa" as Black History Month was nearing its end.</p>
<p><b>1) Read</b> The more you know about Africa, the better you can motivate others to help. Read a survey of African history, stretching back the dawn of humankind more than 200,000 years ago. Read a book about black African leaders, from the Kushite pharoahs of ancient Egypt to the giants of 20th-century independence (Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Leopold Senghor of Senegal, Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Haile Selassie of Ethiopia and many more). Follow African current events on Web sites like <i>AllAfrica</i> (allafrica.com), <i>BBC News/Africa</i> (news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa) and <i>CNN/Africa</i> (www.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/archive).</p>
<p><b>2) Teach, Learn</b> If you're a teacher, plan a lesson or special project about Africa. If you're a parent, look for a fun "African experience" your family can share. If you're a student, do a research paper on Africa or start an Africa Club with your friends. If your school has African students, have a special assembly and ask them to speak.</p>
<p><b>3) Write</b> Voice your views and perspectives on Africa-related issues. Write a letter to your senator, a member of congress, or state or local government official. Share your concerns with companies engaged in Africa. Author a guest editorial for your community of school newspaper, or a posting to your favorite internet message board.</p>
<p><b>4) Speak</b> If you've traveled or worked in Africa, give a talk to a group you belong to. If you've never been to Africa, arrange for an African immigrant who lives in your community to speak.</p>
<p><b>5) Travel</b> If you have the means, visit Africa. Consider a group trip: traveling in groups can can add to the fun as well as reduce the costs (group discounts are often substantial). As much as possible, do business with African vendors for transport, lodging and tours. While in Africa, absorb the beautiful scenery and cultural sites--but also take the time to meet local people, learn about their lives and understand the development challenges that they face. Finally, stay connected, and committed, once you return home. For example, if you visited a drought prone country, involve your friends in raising funds for water wells.</p>
<p><b>6) See, hear, eat ...enjoy!</b> African culture is accessible in most American cities. You can see an African film (<i>Afrique sur le Seine, The Gods Must Be Crazy</i>) or a film about Africa (<i>Hotel Rwanda, The Lost Boys of the Sudan, Cry Freedom</i>). Attend a performance of African music or dance. Visit an African art museum. Eat at an African restaurant. Enjoy and appreciate the incredible variety of cultures that are “African” and share those experiences with others.</p>
<p><b>7) Meet</b> Almost every city and many smaller communities in the United States are home to first-generation Africans. Find opportunities to meet your African neighbors, to learn from them and to invite their participation in local organizations. Reach out especially to new arrivals, who might welcome your help finding housing and jobs and generally adjusting to American life.</p>
<p><b>8) Invest</b> You may be in a position to invest in an African business or to join a group of investors with African interests (there are growing numbers of African investment funds you might want to explore). On the other hand, even the simple act of buying African artwork here in an American store helps to support the artists and their families, in Africa. Depending on where you work, you might also engage your employer in African investment or trade.</p>
<p><b>9) Donate</b> Make a charitable donation to one of the many reputable organizations assisting Africa. Your gift may be large or small. Usually, you can give online. You can support special projects or offer to help “where needed most” in Africa. You can give individually; you can organize a fund raiser; you can give in your workplace. (<i>To donate to Africare, please visit our Web site at www.africare.org or call us at 202.462.3614</i>)</p>
<p><b>10) Share</b> Send this article to 10 other people and ask each to pass it along to 10 more. And ask every recipient to help Africa during 2005 in one of the nine other ways presented above. (<i>To e-mail this article, copy it from the Africare Web site at www.africare.org</i>)</p>
