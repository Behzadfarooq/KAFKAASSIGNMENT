	    <p>Unlike other immigrations, the majority of the Africans who immigrated to <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> did so as a result of the slave trade. The Africans in Puerto Rico came from various points of <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> and were forced to build fortifications and work the fields. They suffered many hardships. The Spanish decree of <a href="../../../1/7/8/1789.html" title="1789">1789</a> allowed the slaves to earn or buy their freedom. The Spanish Crown also encouraged former slaves from outside of Puerto Rico to settle the island. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, slavery was finally abolished in Puerto Rico. The Africans that came to Puerto Rico overcame many obstacles to help shape the music, art, language, and heritage that was to become the foundation of Puerto Rican culture.</p>

<b>Shackles used on slaves in Puerto Rico</b></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>According to historians, the first free black man arrived in the island in <a href="../../../1/5/0/1509.html" title="1509">1509</a>. Juan Garrido, a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conquistador.html" title="Conquistador">conquistador</a> who belonged to <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n_c413.html" title="Juan Ponce de León">Juan Ponce de León</a>'s entourage was the first black man to set foot on the island and in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_a493.html" title="New World">New World</a> for that matter. Another free black man who accompanied de León was Pedro Mejías. It is believed that Mejías married a <a href="../../../t/a/%C3%AD/Ta%C3%ADno.html" title="Taíno">Taíno</a> woman chief (a cacica) by the name of Luisa.</p>
<p>When Ponce de León and the Spaniards arrived in the island of "<a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Borinken</a>" (Puerto Rico), they were greeted by the Cacique <a href="../../../a/g/%C3%BC/Ag%C3%BCeyban%C3%A1.html" title="Agüeybaná">Agüeybaná</a>, the supreme leader of the peaceful Taíno tribes in the island. Agüeybaná helped to maintain the peace between the Taínos and the Spaniards. However, the peace would be short-lived because the Spaniards soon took advantage of the Taínos' good faith and enslaved them; forcing them to work in the gold mines and in the construction of forts. Many Taínos died as a result of either the cruel treatment that they had received or of the <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallpox.html" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> disease epidemic which had attacked the island. Many Taínos either committed suicide or left the island after the failed Taíno revolt of <a href="../../../1/5/1/1511.html" title="1511">1511</a>.</p>
<p>Friar <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas_3d43.html" title="Bartolomé de las Casas">Bartolomé de las Casas</a>, who had accompanied Ponce de León to the New World, was outraged by the cruel treatment of the Spaniards against the Taínos and protested in <a href="../../../1/5/1/1512.html" title="1512">1512</a> in front of the council of Burgos of the Spanish Courts. He fought for the freedom of the natives and was able to secure their rights. The Spanish colonists, who feared losing their labor force, protested before the courts. The colonists in Puerto Rico complained that they not only needed the manpower to work the mines and on the fortifications, but also in the thriving sugar industry. As an alternative Las Casas suggested the importation and use of black slaves. In <a href="../../../1/5/1/1517.html" title="1517">1517</a>, the Spanish Crown permitted its subjects to import twelve slaves each in what became the beginning of the slave trade in the New World.</p>
<p>According to historian Luis M. Diaz, the largest contingent of Africans came from the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Coast_%28British_colony%29_5b2d.html" title="Gold Coast (British colony)">Gold Coast</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/h/Dahomey.html" title="Dahomey">Dahomey</a>, or the region known as the area of Guineas, the Slave Coast. However, the vast majority came from the <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorubas.html" title="Yorubas">Yorubas</a> tribe from Nigeria and the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bantus.html" title="Bantus">Bantus</a> from the Guineas. The number of slaves in Puerto Rico rose from 1,500 in <a href="../../../1/5/3/1530.html" title="1530">1530</a> to 15,000 by <a href="../../../1/5/5/1555.html" title="1555">1555</a>. The slaves were branded on the forehead with a stamp so people would know they were brought in legally and that way they couldn't be kidnapped. The cruelty of hot branding was stopped in <a href="../../../1/7/8/1784.html" title="1784">1784</a>.</p>

<b>Slaves in Puerto Rico</b></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The African slave was sent to work the gold mines, as a replacement of the lost Taino manpower, or to work in the fields in the islands ginger and sugar industry. He was allowed to live with his family in a <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hut_%28dwelling%29.html" title="Hut (dwelling)">bohio</a> (hut) in his masters land and was given a patch of land where he could plant and grow vegetables and fruits. Blacks had little or no opportunity for advancement and faced discrimination from Spaniards. The slave was educated by his master and soon learned to speak his language. They enriched the "Puerto Rican Spanish" language by adding some words of their own and educated their children with what they had learned from their masters. The Spaniards considered the black man superior to the Taínos, since the Taínos were unwilling to assimilate their ways. The slave had no choice but to convert to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, they were baptized by the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> and assumed the surnames of their masters. It should be noted that many slaves were subject to harsh treatment which in some cases included <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a>. The majority of the Conquistadors and farmers who settled the island had arrived without women and most of them intermarried with blacks or Taínos creating a mixture of races that was to become known as the "mestizo's" or "mulattos". This mixture was to become the bases of the Puerto Rican people.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/5/7/1570.html" title="1570">1570</a>, the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a> mines were declared depleted and no longer produced the precious metal. After gold mining came to an end in the island, The Spanish Crown basically ignored Puerto Rico by changing the routes of the west to the north. The island became mainly a garrison for the ships that would pass on their way to or from the other and richer colonies. An official Spanish edict of <a href="../../../1/6/6/1664.html" title="1664">1664</a> offered freedom and land to African people from non-Spanish colonies, such as <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamaica.html" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> and St. Dominique (<a href="../../../h/a/i/Haiti.html" title="Haiti">Haiti</a>), who immigrated to Puerto Rico and provided a population base to support the Puerto Rican garrison and its forts. These freeman who settled the western and southern parts of the island, soon adopted the ways and customs of the Spaniards. Some joined the local militia which fought against the British in their many attempts to invade the island. It should be noted that the escaped slaves and freedman who immigrated from the West Indies, kept their former masters surnames which normally was either <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> or <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>. This is why it is not uncommon for Puerto Ricans of African decedent to have non-Spanish surnames.</p>

<b>The Royal Decree of Graces of 1789 which set the rules pertaining to the Slaves in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean</b></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>By the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_Century_a660.html" title="17th Century">17th Century</a> slaves were permitted to obtain their freedom under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>A slave could be freed in a church or outside of it, before a judge, by testament or letter in the presence of his master.</li>
<li>A slave could be freed against his master’s will by denouncing a forced rape, by denouncing a counterfeiter, by discovering disloyalty against the king, and by denouncing murder against his master.</li>
<li>Any slave who received part of his master's estate in his master’s will automatically became free.</li>
<li>If a slave were left as guardian to his master’s children he also became free.</li>
<li>If slave parents in Hispanic America had ten children, the whole family went free.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
In 1789, the Spanish Crown issued the "Royal Decree of Graces of 1789", which set new rules in regard to the commercialization of slaves and added restrictions to the granting of freeman status. The decree granted its subjects the right to purchase slaves and to participate in the flourishing business of slave trading in the Caribbean. Later that year a new slave code, also known as "El Codigo Negro" (The Black code), was introduced.</p>
<p>The slave could buy his freedom if his master was willing to sell and by paying the price sought. Slaves were allowed to earn money during their spare time by working as shoemakers, cleaning clothes or by selling the produce which they were allowed to grow in the small patch of land given to them by their masters. Another means by which they were allowed to pay for their freedom was by installments. They were allowed to make payments in installments for a new born child, not yet baptized, which cost half the going price for a baptized child. In Puerto Rico there was no racial stigma of racial inferiority since slavery, on an individual basis, could be eliminated by a fixed purchasing price.</p>
<p>Many of these freeman started settlements in the areas which became known as Cangrejos (Santurce), <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolina%2C_Puerto_Rico_0169.html" title="Carolina, Puerto Rico">Carolina</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Can%C3%B3vanas%2C_Puerto_Rico_6fe3.html" title="Canóvanas, Puerto Rico">Canóvanas</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/%C3%AD/Lo%C3%ADza%2C_Puerto_Rico_a5e9.html" title="Loíza, Puerto Rico">Loíza</a>, Loíza Aldea and <a href="../../../l/u/q/Luquillo%2C_Puerto_Rico_19ba.html" title="Luquillo, Puerto Rico">Luquillo</a>.

</div>
<p>One of the most renowned Puerto Ricans of African ancestry was <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafael_Cordero_%28educator%29_e054.html" title="Rafael Cordero (educator)">Rafael Cordero</a> (1790–1868), a freeman born in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Juan%2C_Puerto_Rico_38f5.html" title="San Juan, Puerto Rico">San Juan, Puerto Rico</a>. He became known as "The Father of Public Education in Puerto Rico". Cordero was a self-educated Puerto Rican who provided free schooling to children regardless of their race. Among the distinguished alumni who attended Cordero's school were future abolitionists <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rom%C3%A1n_Baldorioty_de_Castro_d0c7.html" title="Román Baldorioty de Castro">Román Baldorioty de Castro</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alejandro_Tapia_y_Rivera_f7ae.html" title="Alejandro Tapia y Rivera">Alejandro Tapia y Rivera</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Juli%C3%A1n_Acosta_51fd.html" title="José Julián Acosta">José Julián Acosta</a>. Cordero proved that racial and economic integration could be possible and accepted. In 2004, the Roman Catholic Church, upon the request of San Juan Archbishop <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roberto_Gonz%C3%A1lez_Nieves_0cdc.html" title="Roberto González Nieves">Roberto González Nieves</a>, began the process of Cordero's beatification.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Campeche_d66c.html" title="José Campeche">José Campeche</a> (1751-1809), was another Puerto Rican of African ancestry who contributed greatly to the islands culture. Campeche's father Tomás Campeche, was a freed slave born in Puerto Rico, and María Jordán Marqués, his mother, came from the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canary_Islands_dc3b.html" title="Canary Islands">Canary Islands</a>. Because of this mixed descent, he was identified as a mulatto, a common term during his time. Campeche is the first known Puerto Rican artist and is considered by many as one of its best. He distinguished himself with his paintings related to religious themes and of governors and other important personalities.</p>

Capt. Henriques was received as a national hero when he returned the island of Vieques back to the Spanish Empire and to the governorship of Puerto Rico. He was awarded "La Medalla de Oro de la Real Efigie" and the Spanish Crown named him "Captain of the Seas" awarding him a <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letter_of_marque_and_reprisal.html" title="Letter of marque and reprisal">letter of marque and reprisal</a> which granted him the privileges of a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privateer.html" title="Privateer">privateer</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Decree_of_Graces_of_1815_5410.html" title="Royal Decree of Graces of 1815">Royal Decree of Graces of 1815</a> was a legal order approved by the Spanish Crown in the early half of the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_Century_16f1.html" title="19th Century">19th Century</a> to encourage <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaniards.html" title="Spaniards">Spaniards</a> and later Europeans of non-Spanish origin to settle and populate the colonies of <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>.</p>
<p>The decree encouraged slave labor to revive agriculture and attract new settlers. The new agricultural class now immigrating from other countries of Europe sought slave labor in large numbers and cruelty became the order of the day. It is for this reason that we see a series of slave uprisings in the island, from the early 1820's until 1868 in what is known as the <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grito_de_Lares_5074.html" title="Grito de Lares">Grito de Lares</a>.</p>

<p>The 1834 Royal census of Puerto Rico established that 11% of the population were slaves, 35% were colored freemen and 54% were white.</p>

<p>By the mid nineteenth Century, a committee of abolitionists was formed in Puerto Rico which included many prominent Puerto Ricans.</p>
<p>Dr. <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ram%C3%B3n_Emeterio_Betances_d74a.html" title="Ramón Emeterio Betances">Ramón Emeterio Betances</a> (1827-1898), whose parents were rich landowners, believed in the abolition of slavery and together with fellow Puerto Rican and abolitionist <a href="../../../s/e/g/Segundo_Ruiz_Belvis_db9b.html" title="Segundo Ruiz Belvis">Segundo Ruiz Belvis</a> (1829-1867) founded a clandestine organization called "The Secret Abolitionist Society'. The objective of the society was to free children who were slaves, by the sacrament of Baptism. The event, which was also known as "aguas de libertad" (waters of liberty), was carried out at the Catheral of <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayag%C3%BCez%2C_Puerto_Rico_b614.html" title="Mayagüez, Puerto Rico">Mayagüez</a>. When the child was baptized, Betances would give money to the parents which they in turn used to buy the child's freedom from his master.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Juli%C3%A1n_Acosta_51fd.html" title="José Julián Acosta">José Julián Acosta</a> (1827-1891) was a member of a Puerto Rican commission, which included Ramón Emeterio Betances, Segundo Ruiz Belvis and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Mariano_Qui%C3%B1ones_bb3c.html" title="Francisco Mariano Quiñones">Francisco Mariano Quiñones</a> (1830-1908). The commission participated in the "Overseas Information Committee" which met in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrid.html" title="Madrid">Madrid</a>, Spain. There, Acosta presented the argument for the abolition of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery_in_Puerto_Rico_9717.html" title="Slavery in Puerto Rico">slavery in Puerto Rico</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_19.html" title="November 19">November 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rom%C3%A1n_Baldorioty_de_Castro_d0c7.html" title="Román Baldorioty de Castro">Román Baldorioty de Castro</a> (1822-1889) together with <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Padial_7c8e.html" title="Luis Padial">Luis Padial</a> (1832-1879), Julio Vizcarrondo (1830-1889) and the Spanish Minister of Overseas Affairs, Segismundo Moret (1833-1913), presented a proposal for the abolition of slavery. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, the Spanish Government approved the proposal which became known as the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moret_Law_d5ed.html" title="Moret Law">Moret Law</a>. This edict granted freedom to slaves over 60 years of age, those belonging to the state, and children born to slaves after <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_17.html" title="September 17">September 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>. Most importantly for genealogy purposes, the Moret Law established the Central Slave Registrar which in 1872 began gathering the following data on the island's slave population: name, country of origin, present residence, names of parents, sex, marital status, trade, age, physical description, and master's name.</p>
<p>The Spanish government had lost most of its possessions in the New World by 1850. After the successful slave rebellion against the French in St Dominique (Haiti) in 1803, the Spanish Crown became fearful that the "Criollos" (native born) of Puerto Rico and <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, her last two remaining possessions, may follow suit. Therefore, the Spanish government issued the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Decree_of_Graces_of_1815_5410.html" title="Royal Decree of Graces of 1815">Royal Decree of Graces of 1815</a>, attracting European immigrants from non-Spanish countries to populate the island believing that these new immigrants would be more loyal to Spain. However, they did not expect the new immigrants to racially intermarry as they did and identify themselves completely with their new homeland.</p>
<p>The Spanish government in fear of an independence or slavery revolt imposed draconian laws, "El Bando contra La Raza Africana", to control the behavior of all Black Puerto Ricans, slave or free.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_23.html" title="September 23">September 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>, slaves, who were promised their freedom, participated in the short failed revolt against Spain which became known in the history books as "<a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Grito_de_Lares_f4c0.html" title="El Grito de Lares">El Grito de Lares</a>" or "The Cry of Lares". Many of the participants were imprisoned or executed.</p>

<b>Indemnity bond paid as compensation to former owners of freed slaves</b></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, slavery was abolished in Puerto Rico. Slave owners were to free their slaves in exchange of a monetary compensation. The majority of the freed slaves continued to work for their former masters with the difference that they were now freeman and received what was considered a just pay for their labor.</p>
<p>The freed slaves were able to fully integrate themselves into Puerto Rico's society. It cannot be denied that <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> has existed in Puerto Rico since racism is something that exists in every country, however, racism in Puerto Rico did not exist to the extent of other places in the New World, possibly because of the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <a href="../../../8/t/h/8th_century.html" title="8th century">8th century</a>, nearly all of Spain was conquered (711 - 718), by the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moors.html" title="Moors">Moors</a> who had crossed over from North Africa. The first blacks were brought to Spain during Arab domination by North African merchants. By the middle of the <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13th century</a> all of the Iberian peninsula had been reconquered. A section of the city of <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seville.html" title="Seville">Seville</a>, which once was a Moorish stronghold, was inhabited by thousands of blacks. Blacks became freeman after converting to Christianity and lived fully integrated in Spanish society. Black women were highly sought after by Spanish males. Spain's exposure to people of color over the centuries accounted for the positive racial attitudes that were to prevail in the New World. Therefore, it was no surprise that the first conquistadors who arrived to the island, intermarried with the native Taínos and later with the African immigrants.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Catholic Church played an instrumental role in the human dignity and social integration of the black man in Puerto Rico. The church insisted that every slave be baptized and converted to the Catholic faith. In accordance to the church's doctrine, master and slave were equal before the eyes of God and therefore brothers in Christ with a common moral and religiuos character. Cruel and unusual punishment of slaves was considered a violation of the fifth commandment.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When the gold mines were declared depleted in 1570 and mining came to an end in Puerto Rico, the vast majority of the white Spanish settlers left the island to seek their fortunes in the richer colonies such as Mexico and the island became a Spanish garrison. The majority of those who stayed behind were either black or mulattos (of mixed race). By the time Spain reestablished her commercial ties with Puerto Rico, the island had a large multiracial population. Even though one of the reasons that the Spanish Crown put the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 into effect was to "whiten" the islands population by offering attractive incentives to non-Hispanic Europeans, the new arrivals continued to intermarry with the native islanders. By 1868, the majority of the population of Puerto Rico was interracially mixed.</li>

<p>The descents of the former African slaves became instrumental in the development of Puerto Rico's political, economic and cultural structure. They overcame many obstacles and have made their presence felt in their contributions to the islands entertainment, sports, literature and scientific institutions. Their contributions and heritage can be also be felt today in Puerto Rico's art, music, cuisine, and religious beliefs in everyday life.</p>
<p>In Puerto Rico it is common for the terms Negro(a) or Negrito(a) to be used as a term of endearment regardless of his or her racial background. Puerto Rican school children are taught at an early age about the three main "races" of which the Puerto Rican people is composed. In Puerto Rico, March 22 is known as "Abolition Day" and it is a holiday celebrated by everyone.</p>

<p>Some African slaves spoke "Bozal" Spanish, a mixture of Portuguese, Spanish, and the language spoken in the Congo.

<p>Africans not only introduced words to the Puerto Rican Spanish but, they also had a great influence in the island's speech pattern . For example many Puerto Ricans have the habit of swallowing the "s," and often pronounce the "r" as an "l". This is because in the African tongue there is no "s" or "r" sound.</p>

<p>Puerto Rican musical instruments such as la clave (also known as par de palos or "two sticks"), drums with stretched animal skin such as bongos or congas, and Puerto Rican music-dance forms such as la bomba or la plena are likewise rooted in Africa.</p>

<p>The Bomba represents the strong African influence in Puerto Rico. Bomba is a music, rhythm and dance that was brought by West African slaves to the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The Plena is another form of folkloric music of Puerto Rico of African origin. The Plena was brought to <a href="../../../p/o/n/Ponce%2C_Puerto_Rico_7197.html" title="Ponce, Puerto Rico">Ponce</a> by blacks who immigrated north from the English speaking islands south of Puerto Rico. The Plena is a rhythm that is clearly African and very similar to Calypso, Soca and Dance hall music from Trinidad and Jamaica.</p>
<p>The Bomba and Plena were played during the festival of Santiago (St. James), since slaves were not allowed to worship their own gods, and soon developed into countless styles based on the kind of dance intended to be used at the same time; these include leró, yubá, cunyá, babú and belén. The slaves celebrated baptisms, weddings, and births with the "bailes de bomba". Slaveowners, for fear of a rebellion, allowed the dances on Sundays. The women dancers would mimic and poke fun at the slave owners. Masks were and still are worn to ward off evil spirits and pirates. One of the most popular masked characters is the "Vejigante" (vey-hee-GANT-eh). The Vejigante is a mischievous character that stars in the Carnivals of Puerto Rico. Traditionally he wears a <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papier_mache.html" title="Papier mache">papier mache</a> mask and a colorful robe.</p>

<p>Until 1953, the Bomba and Plena were virtually unknown outside of the island until Puerto Rican musicians <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafael_Cortijo_2bd1.html" title="Rafael Cortijo">Rafael Cortijo</a> (1928-1982) and <a href="../../../i/s/m/Ismael_Rivera_d1bf.html" title="Ismael Rivera">Ismael Rivera</a> (1931-1987) and the El Conjunto Monterrey orchestra introduced the Bomba and Plena to the world. What Rafael Cortijo did with his orchestra was to modernize these Puerto Rican folkloric rhythms with piano, bass, saxophones, trumpets, and other percussion instruments such as timbales, bongos, and replacing the typical barriles (skin covered barrels) with congas.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafael_Cepeda_0d52.html" title="Rafael Cepeda">Rafael Cepeda</a> (1910-1996), also known as "The Patriarch of the Bomba and the Plena", was the patriarch of the Cepeda Family. The family is one of the most famous exponents of Puerto Rican folk music, with generations of musicians working to preserve the African heritage in Puerto Rican music. The family is well known for their performances of the bomba and plena folkloric music and are considered by many to be the keepers of those traditional genres.</p>

<p>Puerto Rican cuisine also has a strong African influence. The melange of flavors that make up the typical Puerto Rican cuisine counts with the African touch. Pasteles, small bundles of meat stuffed into a dough made of grated plantain (sometimes combined with pumpkin and potatoes) and wrapped in plantain leaves, were devised by African women on the island and based upon food products that originated in Africa.</p>
<p>The salmorejo, a local land crab creation, resembles Southern cooking in the United States with its spicing. The mofongo, one of the island's best-known dishes, is a ball of fried mashed plantain stuffed with pork crackling, crab, lobster, shrimp or a combination of all of them. Puerto Rico's cuisine embraces its African roots, weaving them into its Indian and Spanish influences.</p>

<p>The African slaves bought with them their pagan religious beliefs. Even though they were converted into Christianity upon their arrival to Puerto Rico they did not abandon their pagan religious practices altogether. <a href="../../../l/u/k/Lukum%C3%AD.html" title="Lukumí">Santeria</a> is a religion created between the diverse images drawn from the Catholic Church and the representational deities of the African Yoruba tribe of Nigeria.</p>

<p>In Santería there are many deities who respond to one "top" or "head" God. These deities, which are said to have descended from heaven to help and console their followers, are known as "Orishas." According to Santeria the Orishas are the ones who chooses the person whom it will watch over.</p>
<p>Unlike other religions where the a worshiper is closely identified with his sect. (example: Christian/Christianity) the worshiper is not always a "Santero". Santeros are the priests and the only official practitioners {"Santeros" are not to be confused with Puerto Rico's craftsmen who carve and create religious statues from wood and are also called Santeros). A person becomes a Santero if he passes certain tests and has been chosen by the Orishas.</p>
