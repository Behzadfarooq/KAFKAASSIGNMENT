<p>"A minority of conservative European observers, such as Dr. William Pierce, assert this fact to be the result of lower intelligence, describing Africa as "The Dark Continent" in reference to its perennial poverty and warfare."</p>
<p>I don't think these claims should be given credence on this page. Are the claims of hitler given billing on the page for Israel or the claims of bin laden on the page for the US? I don't think the claims of racists belong on the front page for Africa. It also doesn't make sence, since Pierce is an American Nazi, not a European conservative. Can we get rid of this paragraph? Otherwise, it needs to be changed to "A minority of American nazis, such as...".&#160;:-[</p>

<p>The demographic section of Africa is severly lacking and comical in nature.</p>
<p>Quoting. "Very small numbers of Caucasians exist throughout Africa, with the exception of South Africa, which is approximately 10% Caucasian."</p>
<p>Why is the number of cacasians in Africa an important fact about Africa as a whole. You do not compare the amount of other ethnic groups in Africa, only caucasians, is this because caucasians have spread their culture throughout the world?</p>
<p>Again. "The African people are predominantly Negro and exhibit several physical characteristics that distinguish them from peoples of other continents. Dark skin is the most noticeable, and scientists believe it originated as a way to adapt to high levels of ultraviolet radiation. Tall height and muscular builds are other common characteristics, with the exception of some pygmy tribes."</p>
<p>What about native Australians, who also have dark skin. As you state in your article, that human life originated from Africa, why would the current native dark skinned populations adapt due to high exposure to ultra violet radiation? A better hypothesis would be that populations as they migrated from Africa adapted to lack of ultra violet radiation -- this is supported by a couple scientific conjectures that claim lighter skin peoples adapted to compensate for lack of vitamen D from sunlight. If scientist claim its a way to adapt to increased exposure to ultra violet radiation, why is it that arabs or other semetic races are not dark as many peoples originating from Africa.</p>
<p>Tall and muscular builds is probably untrue. Maybe many Africans are muscular due to their harder living conditions and an increased reliance on manual labor. Are African's really taller than caucasians, or more muscular or have the potential to be more muscular than any other race?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Tutsi people were considered giants by the Europeans in centuries gone past, I've read, but, I don't think the Falani (Fulani? I don't know how to spell it) are tall, and surely peoples such as the Mbuti are famous -- at least to fans of PBS etc -- for exactly the converse&#160;:) Dishalein 06:51, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again quoting your original article. "Throughout much of their recent history, Africans have faced much racism from non-Africans, first at the hands of European colonizers, then in the United States, where they were enslaved, and then in South Africa, where they coexist with a substantial population of Caucasians. Often this racism results because Africa has made comparatively few technological and cultural achievements.¹ For example, there was no written African language until the invention of N'ko in the early 20th century. A minority of conservative European observers, such as Dr. William Pierce, assert this fact to be the result of lower intelligence, describing Africa as "The Dark Continent" in reference to its perennial poverty and warfare. These are are highly controversial subjects; throughout history their misapplication has led to many tragedies, such as the enslavement of Africans in the United States. See Slavery, Racism, and Apartheid for more information."</p>
<p>You mention enslavement by the United States, which imported many African slaves. However you don't mention slaves imported to Brazil, which make up the majority of the native African descended population in the Americas.</p>
<p>Why is racism even mentioned in an article about Africa, albeit, many people have prejudices both and the past and present about people of African descent; although I don't think this is relevent. Why are cultural acheivements and technological ones even relevent. Many African's would beg to differ on your assumption that they have made few cultural acheivements, seeing that the world's talled human constructions for many centuries was the Great Pyrimid of Giza, until being surpassed by the Eiffel Tower in the 19th century. Written languages have existed in Africa for thousands of years, with the Egyption hyierglyths, I am not sure if this constitutes as a written language?</p>

<dd>(re: written language) Surely, the Rosetta stone is one of the most famous works of written language in history? Dishalein 06:55, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Calling Africa the "Dark Continent" has little relevence to Africa as a whole or even the works of minority Europeans. Europe and other continents just hundred or less years ago were in a period of constant warfare, I am sure that there has not been a time where there was peace throughout the entire European continent for very long. The feudal system of Europe had insured a class of impoverished surfs to do the bidding of the masters for the longest time.</p>
<p>This article is laughable and is a scourge to the entire wikipedia collection. It has very little substance or anything to do with Africa. I would like feedback and corrections. For any questions email me at dismal@wowway.com</p>

<p><a name=".22Utter_garbage.22.3F...Race_Demographics"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Utter garbage"?...Race Demographics</span></h2>
<p>The rewrite of the article yesterday was hardly perfect, but the version that stands now is utter garbage.</p>
<p>(Over 85% of the African people belong to the Black race and exhibit several physical characteristics that distinguish them from peoples of other continents.)</p>
<p>What of the Melanesians, the Negritos of SE Asia, and some Australian Aborigines?</p>
<p>(Dark skin is the most noticeable, and scientists believe that Homo sapiens lost this coloration when it emigrated to the outlying continents in response to lower levels of ultraviolet radiation.)</p>
<p>Every serious article on this subject states that the need for Vitamin D absorption form sunlight caused people's skin to lighten. Anyway, none of the other continent or country articles delve into this topic. This should simply be hyperlinked to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a>.</p>
<p>(Tall height and muscular builds are other common characteristics, with the exception of some pygmy tribes.) Most East African and Southern African Negroids are similar in height to Caucasoids. Cattle herding peoples such as the Masai and Tutsi do tend to be taller.</p>
<p>(White Africans have descended mainly from the Middle East in prehistoric periods and today form about 95% of the North African population like Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt.)</p>
<p>Many north Africans, such as Berbers, are indigenous to North Africa. Also the populations of these countries are frankly too mixed to be categorized as "white" - or "black".</p>
<p>(Despite several shared characteristics, Africans also exhibit linguistic and cultural diversity, with different languages and religions occurring throughout the continent.)</p>
<p>True...</p>
<p>(Very small numbers of Caucasians exist throughout Africa, with the exception of South Africa, which is approximately 10% Caucasian.)</p>
<p>Do the North Africans count as Caucasian?</p>
<p>I think it can be noted that there is a semantic difference in everyday usage between Caucasian and "white". North Africans are mostly Caucasoid but only a minority would readily identify themselves as "white" in Western countries.</p>
<p>(Much of the African continent continues to suffer from severe poverty, famine, disease, and war. In recent times AIDS has become a particularly widespread and damaging problem, with over 30% of some African populations infected.)</p>
<p>North Africa, to my knowledge, has not experienced a famine in recent history. It also has not been affected by AIDS to the degree other parts of the continent have. Some African nations (Gabon, Libya) are, in relative terms, not poor nations and have standards of living that are comparable to middle income nations. There is no denying that the majority of vast Africans are poor.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(North Africa not having famine in recent history) Surely this depends on how you define "recent". Isn't famine in Egypt, due to poor Nile flooding season, nearly invariably mentioned in historical discussions of Egypt? Dishalein 07:00, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>(NB: I don't disagree with your general point of course -- in fact, the whole issue in the Blue Nile/Koga/Nile Basin discussions is that the Egypt end of the Nile does SO much better at irrigation than the areas in Ethiopia.) Dishalein 07:03, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>(The species Homo sapiens sapiens is now believed to have originated in Africa and migrated into the outlying continents about 80,000 years ago. After this African diaspora, humans developed into what are considered the different human races, although it is also contended that not enough isolated evolution in different geographical areas was possible for the species to become polytypic. However, during the years following the migration, some cultural changes, changes of group identities, and some genetic changes, such as skin color, clearly happened.)</p>
<p>I can't argue with this, but this is part of the article on "Race" and is distracting here.</p>
<p>(Throughout much of their recent history, Africans have faced much racism from non-Africans, first at the hands of European colonizers, then in the United States, where they were enslaved, and then in South Africa, where they coexist with a substantial population of Caucasians. See Slavery, Racism, and Apartheid for more information.)</p>
<p>The United States was only one of many nations where black African slavery occurred. (Black) Africans are not unique in facing racism, and it should be mentioned that many intra-African conflicts (Hutu-Tutsi, Arab-Berber) exist as well. To be sure, some of these conflicts were exacerbated by European colonial powers.</p>
<p>Also, it must be noted that other peoples, such as Indians and other Asians live in Africa today, and there have been conflicts between Hindus and black Africans in Uganda and Kenya for instance.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Delete Demographics section</span></h2>
<p>Asia does not have a demographics section, neither does Europe or North America. I find it's inclusision in Africa and especially the way in which it is portrayed suspicious. Such claims as <i>Tall height and muscular builds are other common characteristics</i> is absurd. Does anyone remember the short and plump <a href="../../../d/r/c/DRC_a0c5.html" title="DRC">DRC</a> President <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurent_Kabila_0a6e.html" title="Laurent Kabila">Laurent Kabila</a>? No one would ever be able to include that "Swedes are tall, blond, and blue eyed". This section is more trouble than it is worth. We should delete the Demographics section and move NPOV and salvageble useful information to other parts of the article.</p>
<p>This article was vandalised by a person with an extreme <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrocentric.html" title="Afrocentric">Afrocentric</a> view, advocating genocide of so called<i>white shit</i>. This article needs to be amended and it needs to be amended now or such vandalism will only become more common. Such archaic stereotypes about one of the most diverse and important places in human history will only damage wikipedia's image; especially in such a major and visable artricle as Africa.</p>

<p>I don't support deleting it because you think there is something wrong with it. I think the section could be improved, and that's what should be done instead. If Asia and Europe don't have demographics sections, then why not add one? I don't see why there shouldn't be one.</p>
<p>If you don't believe that Africans on average are taller and more muscular than people of other ethnic groups, then <a href="http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/83/1/229" class="external text" title="http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/83/1/229" rel="nofollow">here</a> is one of many, many studies that have been done on the subject.</p>
<p>I am aware that there are "short and plump" Africans. The claim that a group of entities on average exhibits characteristic X does not mean that all members of that group exhibit that characteristic. By the way, I think it is actually true that Swedish people, on average, exhibit blond hair and blue eyes at comparatively higher rates.

<p>The demographics section should be rewritten, not deleted. It gives too much focus on physical anthropology and ignores the vast ethnic and linguistic diversity in Africa while giving no coverage of population distribution and migration.

<dd>No it doesn't make you racist, and please note I didn't use the word racist anywhere in my post. The only time I have used the word racist in relation to this article was when I deleted the genocidal and racist comments posted by 139.55.7.185 when he/she vandalized the article. <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hosni_Mubarak_3d22.html" title="Hosni Mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederik_Willem_de_Klerk_bb3c.html" title="Frederik Willem de Klerk">Frederik Willem de Klerk</a> are Africans but they are not the "race" in that study. That is problem one with such a designation, not every native inhabitant of Africa is Congoloid. The point I am going to emphasize is this: that many black people, especially <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-Americans</a>, are going to find those claims highly offensive. They will point to the old sterotype that black people are physically superior and intelelctually inferior to white people. Such stereotypes were used as a justifaction for <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> and later segregation. In that vein of thought, I find such comments dehumanizing, as they were used to enforce an insitution that denied people basic human dignity and rights, and indeed in many cases treated human beings as if they were mere beasts of burden.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I cannot speak for those people natively from Africa, but as for African-Americans any notion of a <i>common</i> height is flat out wrong. I have many African-American friends and associates and there is absoloutely no correlation between height and race in that particular sample. None. Nutrition, especially during childhood and adolesence is a major factor in determining height and muscle mass; it is wrong to present such characterisics as purely racial in determination.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A less emotionally charged reason for not maintaining the demographics section is this simple fact: accurate demographics and current demographics on Africa do not exist. Many countries in Africa haven't even taken a census in decades. This is not only true of Africa but also most other contentients; Australia, which of course is occupied entirely by a developed country, and the few hundred temporary inhabitants of Antartica being the likely exceptions. I suspect this is why there are no demographics sections in Europe ect..</dd>

<dd>I move that the Demographics section by chaged to <i>People of Africa</i> or <i>African Peoples</i> with demographics as a sub-category. I also move that the fact that racial characteristics, or even the existence of race, is controversial and should be mentioned as such immediatley following that statement.

<p>Encarta makes a disclaimer in its demographics section that the numbers are unreliable. We could do the same. Each african country does have a demographics section, and the numbers and text we use come from the CIA and US State Dept. If we have to deal with bad numbers, we can avoid them. Just state general demographic trends and discuss the ethnic and linguistic diversity there.--<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 03:10, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I prefer a section titled "demographics" since we seem to be doing that for all the countries [edit: and it would follow for us to do it for the continents too]. I agree in adding disclaimers (about being controversial, etc.), but we should really reduce the discussion of race or take it somewhere else and focus on population and ethnic data. They're black people all over the globe. Why concetrate it here and igonore the White Africans? Otherwise, let's go ahead...--<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 07:49, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you proposing <i>Tall height and muscular builds are other common characteristics</i> that be removed from the Africa article or just demographics? I certainly have no objections to either.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Area figures</span></h2>
<p>I deleted this sentence: "Unlike the figures in the country articles, the figures in this table are based on areas including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers) and may therefore be lower here." It caught my attention because if the first part of the sentence were true, then the figures in this table would be higher by the amount of the inland water areas, not "lower here". When I looked further, I found that almost all the figures in this table matched the figures in the country articles, except Mauritius, Ghana, Tanzania, Djibouti, and Niger. Some were higher, some were lower, and only Niger differed by the water area. So I deleted the entire sentence.</p>
<p>While I'm at it, the Djibouti discrepancy of 23,000 versus 22,000 strikes me as a typo. The <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_World_Factbook_7e28.html" title="CIA World Factbook">CIA World Factbook</a> says 23,000.

Besides, the 30,000 years is a number that needs something to back it up, especially when talking about the whereabouts of ethno-linguistic groups. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 13:45, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">confused by "Migration from Africa continues to this day."</span></h2>
<p>I'm translating this article into <a href="../../../../ko/%EC%95%84/%ED%94%84/%EB%A6%AC/%EC%95%84%ED%94%84%EB%A6%AC%EC%B9%B4.html" class="extiw" title="ko:아프리카">korean</a>, and I came upon this line at the bottom of the history section:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Migration from Africa continues to this day.</dd>
</dl>
<p>what's that? Is this the remains of some debate that took place about the slave trade? Or is this a reference to the contemporary <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_drain.html" title="Brain drain">brain drain</a> phenomenon, or a reference back to how patterns of slavery (from Africa to the U.S.) resemble modern immigration from Africa to the developed nations, driven by the violence of structural adjustment? I need to contextualize that line. Pleae give me some guidance. Thanks. --<a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonghokim_09ea.html" title="User:Yonghokim">Yonghokim</a> 02:25, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've removed it, as I had the same problem. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 07:36, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Badly placed commentary</span></h2>
<p>I had to deleat this from the polotics section.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"As well, under pressure from international financial institutions like the <a href="../../../i/m/f/IMF_5a61.html" title="IMF">IMF</a>, many African governments have been able to turn their economies around, so that they have started to show positive growth according to conventional economic measurements after decades of negative or zero growth. It remains to be seen if such developments will be able to survive long term, however."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Firstly this would belong in the economics section. Secondly it is a very controvercial issue and requires proof to back up any outlandish statement. At the very least it should be removed because it conflicts with other statements made in the economics section that claims Botswana to be doing better than the Neo Liberalist IMF moddle.</p>
<p>Personaly I find putting that comment in this forumn offensive as I would defy anyone to tell me that the IMF and the World Bank have helped to do anything but widen the gap between rich and poor in Africa.</p>
