<p>I think it's important to leave McNair and the other African-American astronaut in there because they are good role models for any youngsters who visit this page, especailly black young man. In addition, going into space is part of diaspora.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, your personal opinion of who makes a good role model isn't relevant to Wikipedia. Here we use verifiable facts. Also, I can't agree with "going into space is part of diaspora". This seems to be at odds with how the rest of the article defines the African diaspora, and it's contrary to what a diaspora in general means. One guy going on a mission looks to me like an entirely different thing. Are they any sources that refer to a "space diaspora" or is this your own term? I haven't removed it again yet, but I remain to be convinced that it belongs. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:00, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Upon further consideration, I've removed this paragraph again. Here's the version I removed (after I tweaked it a bit):</p>
<pre>
 The first <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> astronaut, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Henry_Lawrence%2C_Jr._e3f5.html" title="Robert Henry Lawrence, Jr.">Robert Henry Lawrence, Jr.</a>, can be 
 regarded as the first member of the Diaspora to reach the extraterrestrial realm.  
 His successor, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_McNair_1ea9.html" title="Ronald McNair">Ronald McNair</a>, was killed in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Challenger_Disaster_31d7.html" title="Challenger Disaster">Challenger Disaster</a>.
</pre>
<p>"Can be regarded"? I don't like it. I want a quote from someone reputable who DOES regard it as such. A google did not reveal to me any widespread use of the notion of a "space diaspora", and I fail to see how one astronaut at a time going on a mission relates to diaspora at all. I don't think this paragraph should be put back in without some kind of sourcing or other justification. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:01, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You <i>can't</i> be taking this guy seriously! Read his user page. He's either a troll (my vote) or an ignorant flake. "... spreading more Africans in space"?

<dd>I didn't say this, as I was told this by my afro-studies lecturer who was recounting the tales of African diaspora. He talked about the "outer edges of the realm of diaspora," where I based my edits on. If you don't agree with me then fine, but don't call me a troll or a flake!

<p>[Name calling does not add to intellectual dialog. The concept of "space Diaspora" is used in science fiction and futuristic material. It usually implies a significant number of human leaving earth to settle in space colonies / Moon / Mars etc. Humanities current episodic near earth venture does not relate to this concept.]</p>

<dd>I agree. That black people indigenous in south and southeast Asia and Melanesia are diasporan Africans is taking the word "diaspora" to the extreme of its literariness. It shouldnt be put forth as a generally held view. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 04:59, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Melanesians and Australian Aborginies are no more related to Africans as Arabs or White Europeans, this is clearly POV, there is no evidence to support it other than the fact that these native peoples have dark skin! One dark skin does not necessarily have anything to do with another, Africa is hot, Australia is hot, is it really so hard to accept that there are several examples of people with dark skin on the planet? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngryafghan_73c4.html" title="User:Angryafghan">Angryafghan</a> 12:41, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find the following sentence ‘Much of the African diaspora is descended from people kidnapped during the transatlantic slave trade, with the largest population living in Brazil’ a little biased and misleading. The word kidnapped implies that Europeans just sailed over and took Africans from their homes and completely overlooks the trade between the Africans and Europeans. I suggest just changing in sentence slightly will be more fair and accurate: ‘Much of the African diaspora is descended from people sold into slavery during the transatlantic slave trade, with the largest population living in Brazil’</p>

<p>This section:</p>
<p>"which is also the name of the Southern Egyptians (Saeedi), who exhibit strong African and Equatorial origins and a distinct culture from the northern Egyptians of the Delta."</p>
<p>Has strong original research and total lack of proper referencing. Upper Egyptians (excluding Nubians) do have some distinctive cultural traits from lower Egyptians, there is also a slight (mostly imperceptible) phenotypical variation. But both are clinial, varying gradually rather than abruptly. Moreover, most Saiidis exhibit strong Arab cultural and phenotypical traits when compared with lower Egyptians. Most Saiidis are readily distinguishable from Nubians, let alone "Equatorial" people (with whom even Nubians currently share little). As it stands the phrase is unfounded. I have deleted it. If you want to reinsert it please let's discuss your sources first. Cheers</p>

<dd>Soon after president bush was elected he attended a European summit. In a conversation between George W. Bush and Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Bush astonished his colleague with the question "Do you have Blacks, too?".</dd>
<dd>Rice quickly stepped in. "Mr. President, Brazil probably has more Blacks than the U.S.A.," she was quoted as saying in the German newspaper Der Spiegel. "Some say it's the country with the most Blacks outside Africa." (The United Nations says half of Brazil's approximately 173 million people are of African descent.<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1264/is_5_33/ai_90989871/pg_1" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1264/is_5_33/ai_90989871/pg_1" rel="nofollow">essence</a>, <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/28/cf.00.html" class="external text" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/28/cf.00.html" rel="nofollow">cnn</a></dd>
