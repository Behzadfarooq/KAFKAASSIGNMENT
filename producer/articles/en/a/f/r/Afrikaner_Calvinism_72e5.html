<p><b>Afrikaner Calvinism</b> is, according to theory, a unique cultural development that combined the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinist.html" title="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> religion with the political aspirations of the white Afrikaans speaking people of South Africa. From <a href="../../../1/6/5/1652.html" title="1652">1652</a> to <a href="../../../1/8/3/1835.html" title="1835">1835</a>, settlers primarily from the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and migrant and refugee Calvinist Protestants from <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and elsewhere in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, combined in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> to form a distinct people<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, called the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaner.html" title="Afrikaner">Afrikaners</a> or <b>Boers</b>. A significant number of the French progenitors of the Boer people were <a href="../../../h/u/g/Huguenot.html" title="Huguenot">Huguenots</a>, who first began to arrive between 1687 and 1691 in flight from the persecution that lasted for one hundred years after the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edict_of_Nantes_1398.html" title="Edict of Nantes">Edict of Nantes</a> was revoked.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Between the end of the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a> and the end of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>, these people increasingly considered themselves Afrikaner rather than European. They spoke a their own, indigenous language, called <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaans_language.html" title="Afrikaans language">Afrikaans</a>, and were bound together by a form of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinist</a> religion. Though they lost control of their South African republics to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> after the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Boer_War_db66.html" title="Second Boer War">Boer Wars</a>, the Afrikaners finally negotiated a home-rule arrangement 10 years later and firmly established themselves as the ruling minority in South Africa until international pressure and increasing chaos within South Africa compelled them to dismantle their policies of exclusive control, called <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>.</p>
<p>The Calvinism of the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boers.html" title="Boers">Boers</a> of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvaal.html" title="Transvaal">Transvaal</a> in South Africa developed in a different way from its European and American counterparts. This uniqueness is theoretically a direct result of geographical isolation and political and cultural estrangement, which shut out the influences of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Enlightenment_d728.html" title="The Enlightenment">the Enlightenment</a>. The cross-currents of change which arose within the Protestant cultures of Europe in response to the Enlightenment had minimal effect upon the development of religious thought among the Boers.</p>
<p>This view of Afrikaner Calvinism implies that it is a purer expression of what Calvinism originally was, without the diluting effects of the Enlightenment. Particularly, this view implies that cultural development under the influence of Boer <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_religion.html" title="Civil religion">civil religion</a> is an illustration of the cultural implications of Calvinism. This is especially interesting to contemporaries considering that a form of nationalistic Calvinism arose, which had direct bearing upon the establishment of the Apartheid policy in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaner_Calvinism_72e5.html" title="Edit section: Settlement period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Settlement period</span></h2>
<p>The Dutch settlement of the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_of_Good_Hope_c5d8.html" title="Cape of Good Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> was the first colonial success in South Africa. The key to this success was the establishment of strict rules of trade between the settlement and the native population. No trade or <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_mission.html" title="Christian mission">missionary</a> ventures among the Africans were permitted without the permission of the company administrator. Stealing or shooting <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cow.html" title="Cow">cattle</a> was especially forbidden as a cause of inevitable conflict with the natives. The early Europeans were appalled by the appearance and the customs of the Africans, and the completely false report that the natives were cannibals reinforced their motive to avoid unnecessary contact. The Cape was a walled garden, with <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> on the outside and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> within. This strict order minimized conflicts with the Africans during the early settlement period.</p>
<p>Yet, many of the settlers had arrived with a missionary motive. The synthesis of these attitudes of strict avoidance and a missionary conscience resulted in the widespread practice of indenturing the native Khoisan population, and within that master/servant relationship, to teach the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> to them in hope that the message would filter back through the servant's family (along with reports of the superiority of European life) and thus bring about conversion.</p>
<p>The farmers who lived outside of the physical walls of the towns had a different arrangement than the townspeople. To them, occupation meant ownership, and ownership implied the right to protect their property. As they settled into the seemingly unnoccupied territories surrounding the Cape, they enforced these assumptions of ownership and its rights when the wandering hunters or herding tribes would cross the <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish_River%2C_Eastern_Cape_b9d2.html" title="Fish River, Eastern Cape">Fish River</a> into farm territories in search of grazing land or game. Thus, the farms represented an extension beyond the towns of the wall of separation between the white and the black occupants of the land. As in the towns, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation.html" title="Plantation">plantation</a> <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> was sometimes seen as a means of <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelism.html" title="Evangelism">evangelism</a>.</p>
<p>Separation and rules of exchange were opposed very early in the Afrikaner mind to invasion and conquest. And, this anti-imperialism extended also to the theory of missionary obligation that developed within the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_Reformed_Church_a08f.html" title="Dutch Reformed Church">Dutch Reformed Church</a>: the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_God_9f58.html" title="Kingdom of God">kingdom of God</a> will grow within the sphere of influence assigned to the church by divine providence, as children are taught the Gospel by their parents and family. If God deems it fitting for the Gospel to be received by the natives, and taught to their children, then this is his glory. Toward that end, Christians have a defining role given them from God, a calling, or covenantal responsibility as God's people, to keep themselves pure in the faith and just in their dealings with the heathen, and to be absolutely unyielding in their protection of what has been legitimately claimed in the name of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Triune God</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Folk_Religion" id="Folk_Religion"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaner_Calvinism_72e5.html" title="Edit section: Folk Religion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Folk Religion</span></h2>
<p>This history is essential to understanding the distinctive concept of "calling" that developed among the Afrikaners. These attitudes, very early adopted, went with them through later conflicts, formed in a way that seemed to them obviously crafted by the hand of God Himself. They believed themselves preserved by God's own wisdom and <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_providence.html" title="Divine providence">Providence</a>. The things they suffered, and the strong bonds between them that were formed through it all, seemed to confirm this idea at every turn. Their history as a people has a central place in forming the Boer religion. In this way, a distinctive folk character became attached to their Calvinistic beliefs.</p>
<p>This <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_religion.html" title="Folk religion">folk religion</a> was not articulated in a formal way. It was the experience of the Afrikaners, which they interpreted through their assurance that their absolutely sovereign Creator and Lord had shown special grace to them as a particular people. Their faith, tied as it was to their identity as a people, produced in them no appreciable trouble of conscience over their treatment of blacks as though they were incorrigible and dull-witted children, or animals in the shape of men. It offered no resistance to the slave-trade dependent culture ruled over by the Dutch company.</p>
<p><a name="Nationalism" id="Nationalism"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaner_Calvinism_72e5.html" title="Edit section: Nationalism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nationalism</span></h2>
<p>However, the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> brought these habits of thought more self-consciously to the surface. Because the Dutch of the Netherlands supported the French and American revolutions, the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Dutch_war_8f65.html" title="Anglo-Dutch war">British declared war</a> on the Netherlands and began seizing their trade routes. They landed at the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_of_Good_Hope_c5d8.html" title="Cape of Good Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1797.html" title="1797">1797</a>. After the Dutch declared bankruptcy, the British annexed the Cape and appointed British land administrators there in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1805.html" title="1805">1805</a>, who were zealous propagators of the Enlightenment. They loosened the trade and labor regulations, speaking of the blacks as 'noble savages' whose untainted natural souls they professed to admire, finally outlawing slavery in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1835.html" title="1835">1835</a>. They called the blacks equals, and gave them access to the courts in suit against white landowners. And, they professed to believe in their own autonomous <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reason.html" title="Reason">Reason</a> above all else.</p>
<p>A more antithetical message could hardly be imagined, as the English Enlightenment forced itself upon the Afrikaners. From the Boer point of view, the Enlightenment invaded their shores, seized their properties, annexed their farms, imposed alien laws, liberated their slaves without compensation, justified these actions by appeal to Reason alone, and claimed in all of this to be more virtuous than God. They were exposed to the Enlightenment, and it appeared to them to be a revolution against God.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Resorting once again to the time-tested wisdom of progress through separation, thousands of farmers, called <a href="../../../v/o/o/Voortrekker.html" title="Voortrekker">Voortrekkers</a>, left the Cape beginning in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1835.html" title="1835">1835</a>, and travelled in ox-drawn wagons as far as the Transvaal. Along the way on this <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Trek_8707.html" title="Great Trek">Great Trek</a>, the pioneers heading east were attacked by <a href="../../../x/h/o/Xhosa.html" title="Xhosa">Xhosa</a> tribes who were also moving into the region in retreat from the <a href="../../../z/u/l/Zulu.html" title="Zulu">Zulus</a>. To the north, they were attacked by the Zulu, when trade relations failed. And behind them, the British offered no protection. The great journey of the <a href="../../../v/o/o/Voortrekker.html" title="Voortrekker">Voortrekkers</a> is a central, defining event in the history of the Afrikaners. At the symbolically significant <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Blood_River_4a3f.html" title="Battle of Blood River">Battle of Blood River</a> in December, <a href="../../../1/8/3/1838.html" title="1838">1838</a>, fewer than 500 Boers circled their wagons to fight off tens of thousands of Zulus without losing a single member of their own party. The <i><a href="../../../l/a/a/Laager.html" title="Laager">laager</a></i> (wagon fortress) became symbolic of Boer solidarity, and of their confidence that God would keep them safe against overwhelming odds, if only they would be faithful to Him and rally to the aid of one another. The partly mythologized history of the Boers grew into a theological/nationalistic consciousness in the second half of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Because the Cape Dutch Reformed Church was seen by the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trekkers.html" title="Trekkers">trekkers</a> as being an agent of the Cape government, they also did not trust its ministers and emissaries, seeing them as attempts by the Cape government to regain political control. There were also religious divisions among the trekkers themselves. A minister from the Netherlands, Dirk van der Hoff went to the Transvaal in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1853.html" title="1853">1853</a>, and became a minister in the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk, which was constituted in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a> recognised as the State Church of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_Republic_b338.html" title="South African Republic">South African Republic</a>, separate from the Cape Church.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in the Netherlands, the Dutch church had been transformed by the Enlightenment, a change represented in the minds of those opposed it, by the loss of any meaningful profession of faith as requisite for adult church members, and the singing of hymns and other innovations in worship and doctrine. In the Netherlands a movement grew in reaction to this perceived dismantlement of Biblical faith. It was called the Doleantie (grieving), a movement that led to schism in the Dutch Reformed Church, and the formation of the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Reformed_Church_d226.html" title="Christian Reformed Church">Christian Reformed Church</a> in the Netherlands. The writings of <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillaume_Groen_van_Prinsterer_30a6.html" title="Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer">Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer</a>, and the leader of the Doleantie, <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Kuyper_dca5.html" title="Abraham Kuyper">Abraham Kuyper</a>, began to become known to the Afrikaners. Highly critical of the Enlightenment, the "revolution" as they called it, the Doleantie in the church had counterparts in education and in politics. The timing of this influence was significant, coming on the crest of a wave of evangelical revival, the Reveil (<i>Awakening</i>) in the Dutch Reformed Church which had been led in South Africa by the Scottish preacher, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Murray_%28minister%29_f0ae.html" title="Andrew Murray (minister)">Andrew Murray (minister)</a>. The slogan of the Doleantie, which eventually rang with unintended <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalist</a> nuance for the Afrikaners was, "Separation is Strength".</p>

<p>In the South African Dutch Reformed Church, the more conservative party (known as Doppers) were opposed to singing hymns in church. A minister from this group, Dirk Postma also traveled to the South African Republic, and was accepted as a minister of the Hervormde Kerk, but on learning that he and his congregation could be required to sing hymns (rather than <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exclusive_psalmody.html" title="Exclusive psalmody">the Psalms only</a>), he and the Doppers, numbering about 6,000, broke away from the state church to form the Gereformeerde Kerk. There were thus now three Dutch Reformed Churches in South Africa -- the Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk (the Cape Synod), the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk, which was the state church of the South African Republic, and the Gereformeerde Kerk, the smallest of the three, led by Postma.</p>
<p>The originally contemptuous name, <i>Dopper</i>, may come from the Dutch <i>domp</i> (<i>wick-snuffers</i>) for their opposition to candles and other innovations in worship, perhaps representing their contempt for the Enlightenment; or, <i>Dopper</i> may originate from Dutch <i>dop</i> (and thus <i>drinkers</i>), perhaps on account of their strong opposition to small, individual communion cups.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The separatism of the Doppers, expressed in the severity of their doctrine, the austere <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritanism.html" title="Puritanism">puritanism</a> of their worship, and even in their distinctive dress and speech, set them in stark contrast to European influence. Nevertheless, the Doppers were symbolic of resistance to all things English in South Africa, and despite their small size and distinctiveness they were culturally sophisticated and disproportionately influential during and after the Great Trek. It was the Dopper church that established <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potchefstroom_University_9fd5.html" title="Potchefstroom University">Potchefstroom University</a>. It was from this sect that <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Kruger_cbd3.html" title="Paul Kruger">Paul Kruger</a> arose.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The new Boer states which arose after the Great Trek needed a comprehensive philosophy upon which to organize a genuinely Afrikaner society. Voortrekker 'Uncle' Paul Kruger, first president of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_Republic_b338.html" title="South African Republic">South African Republic</a> upon its reacquired independence after the brief British annexation, adopted the Doleantie in its political form, and formulated the Afrikaner <i>cultural mandate</i> based on the African Calvinist conviction that the South Africans had a special calling from God, not unlike the people of Israel in the Bible. The Doppers waged an intellectual war against outlander culture which was flooding into South Africa through the mass settlements of foreign squatters lured by gold and diamonds, accompanied by British armies. To the Afrikaner mind, the British represented imperialism, viciousness, outlander oppression, covetousness, envy, and unbelief.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> When the Anglo-Boer wars broke out, Paul Kruger's idealized version of Afrikaner history forged the Afrikaners into a united and formidable force. The Afrikaner's Boer War experience, including the death of 28 000 civilians and the destruction of homesteads, reinforced their laager mentality, so as to preserve themselves and their way of life against the British melting pot.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaner_Calvinism_72e5.html" title="Edit section: Afrikaner Broederbond">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Afrikaner Broederbond</span></h2>
<p>The Boer Wars had left many of the Afrikaners utterly destitute. The ruined farmers were seen in the hundreds, following the war, lining the highways selling produce by the basket. After the British reorganized the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_South_Africa_dcee.html" title="Union of South Africa">Union of South Africa</a> and relinquished control to democratic elections, a small, anonymous group of young intellectuals called the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikanerbond.html" title="Afrikanerbond">Afrikaner Broederbond</a>, formed in the years following the Second Anglo-Boer War to discuss strategies for addressing the overwhelming social problem of <i>poor whites</i> and other Afrikaner interests. By the account of <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irving_Hexham_10f1.html" title="Irving Hexham">Irving Hexham</a>, according to Klaus Venter and Hendrick Stoker who were themselves disgruntled members of the secret organization, in 1927 the Broederbond moved to Potchefstroom University, asking that the school would take over leadership of the then-struggling group. That year, the Broederbond formally adopted the Calvinist philosophy based on the work of Abraham Kuyper.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> The Broederbond believed, with deep-rooted conviction, that what their past had provided them through the interpretation of faith was a model of anti-imperialism, self-discipline and responsibility, which in the end would preserve justice for all — blacks, coloured, and whites — against <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communist</a> deceit. These strategies that arose from the Broederbond were directly responsible for the establishment of <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a>, in 1948.</p>
<p>However some who had been members of the organization before <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> preferred the philosophy of <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fichte.html" title="Fichte">Fichte</a>, and other versions of European <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">Nationalism</a>. A <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascist</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Darwinism_4ef0.html" title="Social Darwinism">social Darwinist</a> agenda in sympathy with <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a> arose among some whites in South Africa during the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, which became an unwelcome ally in support of these policies. The Calvinist party within the Broederbond tried to distance itself from this movement, with very limited success because of the secrecy of the organization, their later confessed complete misunderstanding of the real ambitions of non-Afrikaners and blindness to the agony of 'Coloureds' and 'Blacks' under apartheid, and the extreme unpopularity of the apartheid policies in the eyes of non-Afrikaners. The anti-Calvinist nationalists, led by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Hendrik_Frensch_Verwoerd_8871.html" title="Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd">H.F. Verwoerd</a>, overcame the Calvinists in 1950 and used the Broederbond to advance his own political ambitions. International pressures mounted, increasingly isolating the Afrikaners and identifying their policies with the worst kind of godless oppression; but this was a long time in producing a crisis of conscience - or at least, it did not for some time produce sufficient energy to dismantle the complex social system that had been founded upon apartheid.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharpeville_massacre.html" title="Sharpeville massacre">Sharpeville massacre</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, under enormous international pressure, the Broederbond began a slow and quiet re-examination of their policy proposals. And yet no significant changes took place to reform the apartheid system until the <a href="../../../s/o/w/Soweto.html" title="Soweto">Soweto</a> riots in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>. Some time after this, the Broederbond declared apartheid an irreformable failure and began work to dismantle it. The conviction had finally become established, although not universally that, if the Afrikaner people, language and religion were to survive, they must take the initiative to emerge from the laager, and invite South Africa in. The Broederbond (dropping the policy of secrecy and with the new name <i>Afrikanerbond</i>) began proposing initiatives for land reform and the reversal of apartheid.</p>

<p>The reversal of apartheid has cast the <a href="../../../n/e/d/Nederduits_Gereformeerde_Kerk_e114.html" title="Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk">Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk</a> (NGK) into a period of change. While remaining confessionally Calvinist, the religious character of the church is now less cohesive and more difficult to assess. Having been thoroughly conflated with apartheid, historic Calvinism appears to have fallen out of favor. In some quarters, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberation_theology.html" title="Liberation theology">Liberation theology</a> which embraces the Enlightenment idea of <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">Revolution</a> has gained a foothold, and appears to have advocates on the left and the right ends of the political spectrum. American-style evangelicalism also appears to have made inroads, which with its more individualistic emphasis has less potential for a full-scale civil religion. Certainly, the old synthesis of revealed and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_theology.html" title="Natural theology">Natural theology</a> is largely repudiated; officially at least. But, the folk religion of the Afrikaners is not dead. Some scholars and revisionist historians are attempting to draw lines of distinction between Calvinism <i>per se</i>, and the history of the Afrikaners, and the civil religion of the apartheid regime in particular.</p>
