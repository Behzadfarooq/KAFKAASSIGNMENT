<p><b>African art</b> or material culture that originates from the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a> of <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>. This article discusses primarily visual art; for information on African music, see <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Africa_9e2d.html" title="Music of Africa">Music of Africa</a>.</p>
<p>Africa is as widely varied artistically as it is sociopolitically, geographically, ecologically, linguistically, and racially. The arts and material culture of the African continent constitute one of the most diverse and innovative artistic legacies on the 'planet'. Though many casual observers tend to generalize "traditional" African art, the continent is actually full of a multitude of peoples, societies, and civilizations, each with a unique visual culture.</p>
<p>Despite this diversity, there are some unifying artistic themes when considering the totality of visual culture from the continent of Africa.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Utility: Much African art carries a function in the society that produced it, whether this be in terms of physical utility or as a visual indicator of cultural values. Many everyday items such as hair combs, bowls, knives, stools, drums, architecture, and textiles are often adorned with representations of human, animal and supernatural forms, ancestral figures, and geometric patterns, natural accoutrements (such as <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowrie.html" title="Cowrie">cowrie</a> shells and <a href="../../../r/a/f/Raffia.html" title="Raffia">raffia</a>), and vibrant colors. Many of these decorations are used to convey social and cultural meanings, such social structure, status, or gender identity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Visual Abstraction: African artworks tend to favor visual abstraction over naturalistic representation. This is because many African artworks, regardless of medium, tend to <i>represent</i> objects or ideas rather than <i>depict</i> them. Even the so-called portrait heads of <a href="../../../i/l/e/Ile-Ife_095e.html" title="Ile-Ife">Ile-Ife</a> in modern day <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, usually thought of as naturalistic representations of rulers, have actually been smoothed and simplified in an effort to abstract and generalize stylistic norms. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Ancient Egyptian art, also usually thought of as naturalistically depictive, makes use of highly abstracted and regimented visual canons, especially in painting, as well as the use of different colors to represent the qualities and characteristics of an individual being depicted. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Emphasis on Sculpture: African artists tend to favor three-dimensional artworks over two-dimensional works. Even many African paintings or cloth works were meant to be experienced three-dimensionally. House paintings are often seen as a continuous design wrapped around a house, forcing the viewer to walk around the work to experience it fully; while decorated cloths are worn as decorative or ceremonial garments, transforming the wearer into a living sculpture.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Emphasis on Performance Art: An extension of the utilitarianism and three-dimensionality of traditional African art is the fact that much of it is crafted for use in performance contexts, rather than in static ones. For example, masks and costumes very often are used in communal, ceremonial contexts, where they are "danced." Most societies in Africa have names for their masks, but this single name incorporates not only the sculpture, but also the meanings of the mask, the dance associated with it, and the spirits that reside within. In African thought, the three cannot be differentiated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Multiplicity of Meaning: Symbols and forms in African art are typically intended to represent different things to different members of society, depending on age, gender, education, or social status.<sup title="The text preceeding this tag needs specification." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpecificity_5f08.html" title="Wikipedia:Specificity"><i>specify</i></a>]</sup><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since January 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>

<p>African art has a long and surprisingly controversial history. Up until recently, the designation "African" was usually only bestowed on the arts of <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Africa_a597.html" title="Black Africa">Black Africa</a>,</i> i.e., the cultures and peoples living in sub-Saharan Africa. The non-black peoples of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Africa_6a9e.html" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, the blacks of the <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horn_of_Africa_5bbd.html" title="Horn of Africa">Horn of Africa</a>,as well as the art of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, generally were not included under the rubric of <i>African art</i>. Recently, however, there has been a movement among African art historians and other scholars to include the visual culture of these areas, since all the cultures that produced them, in fact, are located within the geographic boundaries of the African continent. The notion is that by including all African cultures and their visual culture in <i>African art</i>, laypersons will gain a greater understanding of the continent's cultural diversity. Since there was often a confluence of traditional African, Islamic and Mediterranean cultures, scholars have found that drawing distinct divisions among Islam, ancient Egypt, the Mediterranean, and traditional African societies makes little sense. Finally, the arts of the people of the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_diaspora.html" title="African diaspora">African diaspora</a>, prevalent in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, and the southeastern United States, have also begun to be included in the study of <i>African art</i> as products of the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_diaspora.html" title="African diaspora">African diaspora</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/African_art.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The origins of African art lie long before recorded history. African rock art in the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahara.html" title="Sahara">Sahara</a> in <a href="../../../n/i/g/Niger.html" title="Niger">Niger</a> preserves 6000-year-old carvings <a href="http://www.manntaylor.com/giraffe.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.manntaylor.com/giraffe.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The earliest known sculptures are from the <a href="../../../n/o/k/Nok.html" title="Nok">Nok</a> culture of <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, made around <a href="../../../5/0/0/500s_BC_bba1.html" title="500s BC">500 BCE</a>. Along with sub-Saharan Africa, the cultural arts of the western tribes, <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptian</a> artifacts, and indigenous southern crafts also contributed greatly to African art. Often depicting the abundance of surrounding nature, the art was often abstract interpretations of animals, plant life, or natural designs and shapes.</p>
<p>More complex methods of producing art were developed sub-Saharan Africa around the <a href="../../../1/0/t/10th_century.html" title="10th century">10th century</a>, some of the most notable advancements include the bronzework of <a href="../../../i/g/b/Igbo_Ukwu_b8a8.html" title="Igbo Ukwu">Igbo Ukwu</a> and the terracottas and metalworks of Ile ife <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze.html" title="Bronze">Bronze</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brass.html" title="Brass">brass</a> castings, often ornamented with <a href="../../../i/v/o/Ivory.html" title="Ivory">ivory</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precious_stone.html" title="Precious stone">precious stones</a>, became highly prestigious in much of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Africa_e6b4.html" title="West Africa">West Africa</a>, sometimes being limited to the work of court artisans and identified with <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_family.html" title="Royal family">royalty</a>, as with the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benin_Bronzes_9a3a.html" title="Benin Bronzes">Benin Bronzes</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/African_art.html" title="Edit section: Influence on Western art">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influence on Western art</span></h2>
<p>At the start of the twentieth century, artists like <a href="../../../p/a/b/Pablo_Picasso_5952.html" title="Pablo Picasso">Picasso</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Matisse_e2a5.html" title="Henri Matisse">Matisse</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Van_Gogh_ee92.html" title="Vincent Van Gogh">Vincent Van Gogh</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amedeo_Modigliani_f3b3.html" title="Amedeo Modigliani">Modigliani</a> became aware of, and inspired by, African art. In a situation where the established avant garde was straining against the constraints imposed by serving the world of appearances, African Art demonstrated the power of supremely well organised forms; produced not only by responding to the faculty of sight, but also and often primarily, the faculty of imagination, emotion and mystical and religious experience. These artists saw in African Art a formal perfection and sophistication unified with phenomenal expressive power. The study of and response to African Art, by artists at the beginning of the twentieth century facilitated an explosion of interest in the abstraction, organisation and reorganisation of forms, and the exploration of emotional and psychological areas hitherto unseen in Western Art. By these means, the status of visual art was changed. Art ceased to be merely and primarily aesthetic, but became also a true medium for philosophic and intellectual discourse, and hence more truly and profoundly aesthetic than ever before.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/African_art.html" title="Edit section: Traditional art">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Traditional art</span></h2>
<p>Traditional art describes the most popular and studied forms of African art which are typically found in <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum.html" title="Museum">museum</a> collections.</p>
<p>Wooden <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask.html" title="Mask">masks</a>, which might either be human or animal, are one of the most commonly found forms of art in western Africa. In their original contexts, ceremonial masks are used for celebrations, initiations, crop harvesting, and war preparation. The masks are worn by a chosen or initiated dancer. During the mask ceremony the dancer goes into deep trance, and during this state of mind he "communicate" with his ancestors. The masks can be worn in three different ways: vertically covering the face: as helmets, encasing the entire head, and as crest, resting upon the head, which was commonly covered by material as part of the disguise. African masks often represent a spirit and it is strongly believed that the spirit of the ancestors possesses the wearer. Most African masks are made with wood, and can be decorated with: <a href="../../../i/v/o/Ivory.html" title="Ivory">Ivory</a>, animal hair, plant fibers (such as raffia), pigments (like <a href="../../../k/a/o/Kaolin.html" title="Kaolin">kaolin</a>), stones, and semi-precious <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemstone.html" title="Gemstone">gems</a> also are included in the masks.</p>
<p>Statues, usually of wood or ivory, are often inlaid with <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowrie.html" title="Cowrie">cowrie</a> shells, metal studs and nails. Decorative clothing is also commonplace and comprises another large part of African art. Among the most complex of African textiles is the colorful, strip-woven <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kente_cloth.html" title="Kente cloth">Kente cloth</a> of <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghana.html" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>. Boldly patterned <a href="../../../m/u/d/Mudcloth.html" title="Mudcloth">mudcloth</a> is another well known technique.</p>

<p>Africa is home to a great and thriving <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_art.html" title="Contemporary art">contemporary art</a> culture. This has been sadly understudied until recently, due to scholars' and art collectors' emphasis on traditional art. Notable modern artists include Zerihun Yetmgeta, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Siangla/Odhiambo_Siangla" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Siangla/Odhiambo_Siangla" rel="nofollow">Odhiambo Siangla</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/u/Olu_Oguibe_c7cf.html" title="Olu Oguibe">Olu Oguibe</a>, Lubaina Himid, and Bill Bidjocka. Art <a href="../../../b/i/e/Biennial.html" title="Biennial">biennials</a> are held in <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakar.html" title="Dakar">Dakar</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senegal.html" title="Senegal">Senegal</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannesburg.html" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. Many contemporary African artists are represented in museum collections, and their art may sell for high prices at art <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auction.html" title="Auction">auctions</a>. Despite this, many contemporary African artists tend to have difficult times finding a market for their work. Many contemporary African arts borrow heavily from traditional predecessors. Ironically, this emphasis on abstraction is seen by Westerners as an imitation of European and American cubist and totemic artists, such as <a href="../../../p/a/b/Pablo_Picasso_5952.html" title="Pablo Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amedeo_Modigliani_f3b3.html" title="Amedeo Modigliani">Amedeo Modigliani</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Matisse_e2a5.html" title="Henri Matisse">Henri Matisse</a>, who, in actuality were heavily influenced by traditional African art. This became the first step of evolution in Western art where people started becoming more open-minded and came out of their shell to explore the different aspects of art. <a name="By_country" id="By_country"></a></p>

<p>These ceremonial masks each are thought to have a soul, or life force, and wearing these masks is thought to transform the wearer into the entity the mask represents.</p>
<p>Côte d'Ivoire has also modern painters and Ilustrators. <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_G._Groud_ee02.html" title="Gilbert G. Groud">Gilbert G.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/African_art.html" title="Edit section: Botswana">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Botswana</span></h3>
<p>In the northern part of Botswana, tribal women in the villages of Etsha and <a href="../../../g/u/m/Gumare.html" title="Gumare">Gumare</a> are noted for their skill at crafting <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basket.html" title="Basket">baskets</a> from Mokola Palm and local <a href="../../../d/y/e/Dye.html" title="Dye">dyes</a>. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through color use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for commercial use.</p>
<p>The oldest evidence ancient paintings from both Botswana and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. Depictions of hunting, both animal and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> figures were made by the <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khoisan.html" title="Khoisan">Khoisan</a> (Kung San!/<a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushmen.html" title="Bushmen">Bushmen</a>) dating before civilization over 20,000 years old within the <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalahari.html" title="Kalahari">Kalahari</a> desert.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/r/African_art.html" title="Edit section: Egypt">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Egypt</span></h3>
<p>Persisting for 3000 years and thirty dynasties, the "official" art of Egypt was centred on the state religion of the time. The art ranged from stone carvings of both massive statues and small statuettes, to wall art that depicted both history and mythology. In <a href="../../../2/6/t/26th_century_BC_5ade.html" title="26th century BC">2600 BC</a> the maturity of Egyptian carving reached a peak it did not reach again for another 1500 years during the reign of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramesses_II_04ce.html" title="Ramesses II">Rameses II</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of the art possesses a certain stiffness, with figures poised upright and rigid in a most regal fashion. Bodily proportions also appear to be mathematically derived, giving rise to a sense of fantastic perfection in the figures depicted. This most likely was used to reinforce the godliness of the ruling caste.</p>
