<p>"Tanorexia" isn't found in a formal dictionary, either -- yet. But it can be googled and is used by physicians. It's considered a legitimate word.</p>
<p>Again, Google the term "Africoid." It's everywhere -- and it's in learned use. Author and historical scholar Runoko Rashidi uses it throughout his works. And he's not the only scholar. Nigerian political scientist and historian Prof. Herbert Ekwe-Ekwe uses it: "Contrary to the dominant scholarly and popular cultural opinion at the time, Diop demonstrates in his research that Africans, Africoid peoples, were the indigenous peoples of Kemet who built the civilisation that has been a marvel to the world ever since."<a href="http://nigeriaworld.com/articles/2006/feb/270.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://nigeriaworld.com/articles/2006/feb/270.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Ekwe-Ekwe is also director of the Centre for Cross-Cultural Studies in Senegal. Dr. Molefi Kete Asante uses it throughout his writings also. About Asante: "Dr. Molefi Kete Asante is Professor, Department of African American Studies at Temple University. Considered by his peers to be one of the most distinguished contemporary scholars, Asante has published 61 books, among the most recent are Encyclopedia of Black Studies, (2004), co-edited with Ama Mazama, Race, Rhetoric, and Identity: The Architecton of Soul, Erasing Racism: The Survival of the American Nation, (2003), Ancient Egyptian Philosophers (2003), Scattered to the Wind, Custom and Culture of Egypt, and 100 Greatest African Americans. The second edition of his high school text, African American History: Journey of Liberation, 2nd Edition, (2001), is used widely throughout North America."<a href="http://www.asante.net/biography.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asante.net/biography.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>It's a commonly used term in some circles and appears in scholarly research/books published by mainstream publishing houses. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 22:16, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The first citation ou give is an afrocentrist diatribe, not a reliable source. It also doesn't support the text of the article as you've written it. The second citation doesn't mention "africoid" at all. Runoko Rashidi is an unnotable afrocentrist, again not a reliable source. If you didn't just make up the article why can't you provide any citations for where you got this definition? <a href="../../../j/_/j/User%7EJ_jackson_1b98.html" title="User:J jackson">J jackson</a> 22:41, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your attempt to dismiss these three gentlemen is absurd on its face. Their legitimacy as respected, widely read and published scholars doesn't depend upon your personal imprimatur. And, contrary to what some misguided "contributors" at this website wrongheadedly infer and seek to imply, the term "Afrocentrist" is not an inherently derogatory or dismissive term. I've provided ample proof that the term is in widespread use. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 08:06, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think J jackson has a good point. Wikipedia doesn't allow <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, so even if the term is in widespread use, if you can't find it defined anywhere, it cannot be allowed. Where did you find a definition or explanation of the term Africoid? <b>johnpseudo</b> 15:09, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>J Jackson hasn't said anything new that is worthwhile/valid. What he's done is slap a label on some prominent historians and scholars, challenging the existence of the term -- because he seems to have a problem with Afrocentrism, generally -- when it is quite clear the term is a legitimate one. He's simply and clearly a sock puppet of an existing user, or the alter ego of one who claims to have left the project, with the same old axe to grind about articles with which I'm involved, on black subject matter. With regard to the definition, I've already acknowledged the need for citations. See my comments to myself under "To do." But I'm in the middle of deadlines at the moment. Will get to it soon. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 15:22, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do see that J Jackson has a questionable user history, and I disagree with his assetion that no reliable sources refer to the term 'Africoid'. From what I've read, the terms 'Negroid' and 'Africoid' are indeed used widely in scholarly articles, and they seem to indicate different meanings. Although I've been unable to find a definition online, your definition seems believable enough to me, and you definitely deserve the benefit of the doubt. For the time being, it's my opinion that the "unreferenced" template is sufficient. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnpseudo_5ea4.html" title="User:Johnpseudo"><b>johnpseudo</b></a> 17:35, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Recommend keep for now in view of some mainstream scholarship in relation to the term Africoid. <a href="../../../e/n/r/User%7EEnriquecardova_b15b.html" title="User:Enriquecardova">Enriquecardova</a> 07:14, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Similarly, other black African peoples commonly considered Negroid, such as the Senegalese also may lack alveolar prognathism.</i></dd>

<p>...but can someone say what "alveolar prognathism" is? Please remember that the target audience can't be assumed to know the jargon of every field of study. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 01:53, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
