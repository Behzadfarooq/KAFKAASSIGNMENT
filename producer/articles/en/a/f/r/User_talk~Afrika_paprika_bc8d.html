<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deleting references</span></h2>
<p>Does it make you feel proud? Do you actually believe that by <i>deleting</i> facts you can just make them 'go away' and disappear forever? If you are that much annoyed with Serbs and their contribution to world's science, culture and history, why do you use those same Serbs to present them as something they never were - Croats? Serbs are Serbs, and if you don't like them as they are, stop forging the data about their ethnicity to make them more likable to your preferences, it is impolite. Marechiel 00:07, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not deleting "serbian references whenever possible". The facts are there, my goal however is to make the Tesla article more objective and neutral. It is you and the others who are constantly deleting and editing the fact he was born in Croatia and considered Croatia to be his homeland. User:Afrika Paprika 03:33, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have not posted a single cited fact in all of your contributions. In two instances that I'm familar with, you have removed cited statements and references again and again with no explaination on talk, or cited sources for why you are going to remove it.

<dl>
<dd>Yes I did. Both are undisputable facts. Tesla was born in Croatia and considered Croatia to be his homeland thus it deserves to be mentioned. My edits are seeking to make the article about him more neutral as it is opposed to chauvinist version you are pushing in now. Also Prso is a Croat, those are his own words. --Afrika Paprika 03:44, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is mentioned. You are just removing the mention of his ethnicity, and if you see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nikola_Tesla#Tesla_was_Serbian.2C_he_is_sometimes_referred_to_as_Serbian-American" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nikola_Tesla#Tesla_was_Serbian.2C_he_is_sometimes_referred_to_as_Serbian-American" rel="nofollow">talk page on Nikola Tesla article</a> shows what you are doing is vandalism. --Lowg 01:52, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry but no, I am not "just removing mention of his ethnicity" I am correcting the article. The only thing removed is at the start of the article which is irrelevant since the article explains in detail that he has been born into Serbian family in Croatia and that he took American citizenship. I wonder though what agenda do you have against more liberal and neutral article? It is what you are doing that is vandalism and not only that but trolling and revisionism. Afrika Paprika</dd>

<dd>Tesla <b>wasn't</b> born in Croatia, but in what was then Austria, and today Croatia, and didn't consider Croatia his homeland, but Yugoslavia.</dd>
<dd>At his time, and the time he spoke about it, Croatia was but a region in Yugoslavia, populated with <b>both</b> Serbs and Croats, and not a Croatian national state. Tesla isn't Croatian, as Heraclites isn't Turkish, nor Archimedes Italian, nor Josip Jelacic Serbian. His birthplace is in Croatian state, but it wasn't at the time of his birth. He lived to see independent Croatia only once in his life, when he was 85 (in 1941), and then he sided with Yugoslav King Peter II against his alleged "homeland". Tesla's homeland was, by his own words, Yugoslavia and Serbia, and his ethnicity Serbian and Yugoslavian, in the sense of integral Yugoslavism, where Yugoslavs are one people of the same race, language and tradition as Serbs.</dd>

<dd>Besides, it is more than clearly stated that his bithplace was at the time within Austria, and that today is in Croatia. Is there any dillema left for any reader not to know where Smiljan is? Tesla was born in Austria, on the territory that is today in Croatia. Should we play silly and add other "significant" facts that the area was originally Illyrian or Roman 2,000 years ago, that it belonged to Yugoslavia for more than 70 years, that it was/wasn't part of Serb Krajina in the 1990's, that the village was ethnically Serbian only 60 years ago, while today it isn't? Two dates are important: the time of Tesla's birth, to give the historical context, and present time, for the geographical accuracy. Tesla was born in the Military Frontier region of Austrian Empire, and his birthplace is today situated in Croatia.</dd>

<dd>Plus, what is so annoyng and frustrating with Serbian-American reference? (See the Discussion on Nikola Tesla page). Tesla was Serbian-American: an American of Serbian ethnic background, like there are Italian-Americans, Greek-Americans, African-Americans etc. He could not possibly be "Croatian-American", because he wasn't an ethnic Croat. And what's the thing with recent editing <i>Serbian-American</i> to <i>Serbian</i>? Are we clear with the subtle distinction in between nationality and ethnicity? Tesla was an American of Serbian ethnic origin, and with his political activities and active cherishing of his Serbian culture, tradition, language and connections, he fully deserves to be called a Serb wherever possible. Finally, it was <b>his wish</b>, for the whole world to know that his deeds are <i>"the deeds of a Serb"</i>. Marechiel 14:01, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry but no. Tesla was born in Croatia which was at that time part of Austrian Empire(Habsburg Monarchy), if we would follow your logic Vuk S. Karadzic was born in Otttoman Empire. Also at the time he spoke it is clear that he meant Croatia. Also your example of Jelacic is wrong since Jelacic was born in Croatia since Petrovardin was part of Croatia since 17th century. Also there is nothing frustrating about Serbian or American references what is frustrating and annyoing is that you are trying to remove and hide the fact the man was born in Croatia, considered Croatia to be his homeland and by that fact is Croatian scientist. The only thing with Serbia(where he was only one or twice) is the fact he considered himself a Serb.</dd>

<dd>And Vuk Karadzic <b>was</b> born in what was at the moment Ottoman Empire, in the region that soon afterwards became the state of Serbia. Tesla wasn't born in Croatia, his birthplace became a part of Croatian state when he was 85, before that it was part of Austrian and Yugoslavian state. What's the point in forging the facts and the name of the state? Any independent Croatian state has been nothing but extremely hostile to Serbs, and Tesla wasn't born in such a state, but in a Serbian-Croatian region of multi-national and tollerant Austria.

<dd>I see that you are hopeless. Tesla was born in Croatia, considered it his homeland and thus belongs equally to Croatia as much he belongs to Serbia as an ethnic Serb. As I said you can rant as much as you want facts are there and there to stay and no matter what you say, write or falsify.

<dd>Tesla wasn't born in Croatia, and isn't Croatian in any way, especially not in the way of modern Croatian state, which is a national <b>state</b> of Croats, while in Tesla's time, it was but a Serbo-Croat (not Croatian) <b>region</b> in a multi-national Empire. You should rather stop insulting nad take more interest in the man you are trying to present as a Croat - he was a unitarian Yugoslavicist and against any Croatian secession from Yugoslavia, and any perspective that would allow Croatian people to be any different from the Serbs. Plus, he was a supporter of Mihailovic's Chetniks. Presenting Voivod Djujic as Croatian would make more sense: he at least <b>lived</b> in Croatian state... Marechiel 11:09, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tesla was born in Croatia since more specifcally in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia which was at that time constitutive part of Habsburg Monarchy with it's own administration and regional parliament which was far more than any other region besies Austria and Hungary had in the Empire. He alone admitted Croatia is his homeland and that he is proud of it. Also I seriously doubt he supported fascists(Chetniks) or anything similar since he was humanist and pacifist. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika paprika</a>
<dl>
<dd>He did not "admit it", it was <b>one</b> courteous private message that meant nothing, since in all his public speeches he called Yugoslavia and Serbia his homeland, and denied Croats any right for exclusive state separated from Serbs and Serbia. In fact, much more times he called Austria-Hungary his homeland, than he spoke of Croatia. And he <b>did</b> support King Peter II and Mihailovic's Chetniks who fought fascists (Croats), since both of his Governments (USA and Yugoslavian) did. Moreover, the leader of Chetniks was a Minister in <b>his</b> Yugoslavian Government. Marechiel 14:31, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My edits are not in violation of anything. The "reliable source" you are talking about is wrong as Prso himself has stated that(which I have provided sources as well) he is a Croat and that everything else is bullshit. I think he is by far more reliable source than the article from some ignorrant.

<dd>Wikipedia does not present the <i>truth</i>. Rather, it presents reports by reliable sources. Since the AFP is a reliable source, we need to report on what it says <i>even if it is wrong</i>, not disregard it because of the error. The appropriate thing to do is to add that the AFP states ..., but (some other reliable source) states .... --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 11:57, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree that AFP is reliable source. It's a news service as any other and it makes mistakes. This is a mistake by them. I have reliable sources which repeat exact words of Prso saying he is a Croat....on more than one occasion. You and and some others here disregarded it which is your problem actually. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika paprika</a>
<dl>
<dd>They do make mistakes sometimes, yes. All sources do. But since that is apparently one of only a few sources on the subject, the discrepency should be noted in the article. Otherwise, if someone reads that article, and the Wikipedia article, they will most likely think that Wikipedia is wrong. Furthermore, I don't see the sources that you are talking about. You should add a reference in a similar manner to the reference to the AFP article if you have such reliable sources. I really have very little knowledge or interest in the matter of Serb/Croat ethnicity, which I think is quite childish on the whole. I just noticed that you seemed to be disregarding <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> in your edits, and other editors seemed to be disregarding the fact that you are not vandalising, and that their test templates were entirely inappropriate and could be seen as personal attacks. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 17:44, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is no discrepency, AFP article is just wrong and thats that. Both articles I have are in Croatian and have never been translated or mentioned in any foreign source(though for what reason is not clear to me), however they are there. One of the sources where Prso plainly states he is a Croat is still on the official site of Croatian Football Association(HNS - Hrvatski Nogometni Savez). The other with the title "I am a Croat and everything else is bullshit" has been published in 'Sportske Novosti'(Sport News) which is most distinguished sport news daily in Croatia. Both are mentioned in the talk page of the same article yet certain memebers disregarded this fact and continue to push for the false information....and may I notice these users are mainly Serbs who are also ashamed that certain Serbian sportsmen and other people were born in Croatia. Also there is nothing childlish with the matter of Serb or Croat ethnicity, at least no more than with any other ethnicity. And finally I have nothing against Serbs nor any other user here, I just want this article to be according to Prso's own statements and to be truthful. --Afrika paprika
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia does not report on the truth, it reports on what the sources for the article say. If your sources are not reliable sources or if they cannot be added to the article for some reason, then we must report that Prso is a Serb even if he isn't. That is just how Wikipedia is. Prso's own statements are not considered reliable unless they are published in a reliable source that is included in the article. The AFP is considered a reliable source. If the AFP article is just caused by a mistake, then feel free to contact AFP about it. Otherwise, we must report on what it says. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 02:38, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Honestly thats quite an idiotic policy. But anyway the articles: "Dado Prso:I am a Croat everything else is bullshit" - <a href="http://www.index.hr/clanak.aspx?id=172002" class="external free" title="http://www.index.hr/clanak.aspx?id=172002" rel="nofollow">http://www.index.hr/clanak.aspx?id=172002</a>&#160;; Interview after 2004 EC game with France - <a href="http://www.hns-cff.hr/vijesti.asp?id=56" class="external free" title="http://www.hns-cff.hr/vijesti.asp?id=56" rel="nofollow">http://www.hns-cff.hr/vijesti.asp?id=56</a> (official Croatian Football Association website).

<dd>Then when you make your edit to Prso, add something like "Although ... describes him as an ethnic Serb [reference], ... and ... describe him as ...[references]".

<dd>I don't care wheter you agree with him or not(although it was clear you are here to support this troll from the first moment you appeared here) nor you or anyone have validity to tell me I "need to modify my behaviou".

<dd>The worst thing about yourself is to claim neutrality and objectivity. I don't say that I am neutral. No one is neutral... nor objective (at least the way they should be). Except bots, ofcourse&#160;:D. Anyway, if you wish to head for neutrality and objectivity so fiercly, why don't you come and talk. Don't get me wrong, but starting a discussion and then abandoning it but continuing to push a version of an article is mostly self-evident as "oh no, I am wrong! well, anyway, I'll try to push it still" - a desperate user. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 18:29, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have been asked to express my opinion on this dispute. I admit I am not familiar with the subject but I could not fail to notice some issues. As far as I see this, you are disputing the article version reworked by him but have failed so far to provide any sources to back up your actual claim (i.e. some historians consider them as possibly Croats or non-Serbs). Another point to consider is whether giving both positions the same importance would result on <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undue_weight.html" title="Undue weight">undue weight</a>.

<dd>I am sorry but claiming that DAI is more 'credible' than LPD is just ridiculous. LPD is basically the transliteration of text from first hand...chronicles of people who lived there while DAI is chroincle of the hearsay of the future emperor who NEVER VISITED these areas and was writting down legends, hearsay and rumors. You still haven't answered me - if they were Serbs as you claim how come NONE of the Venetian sources mention them as such...we only have Croats and general 'Slavic' in their charters, chronicles, etc.? Can you explain that? <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika</a> 17:26, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Look:For example: LPD was discovered in the 16th century - there are no traces of its existence before (which cannot apply to the always-there DAI). The LPD was written in 1171-1189 by the Serbian Archbishop of Antivari Gregory and speaks of everything that happened in our lands from the beginning to its date. However, for the oldest of history, it sources a mysterioys "De Regno Sclavorum" (which isn't mentioned anywhere else in the world) from the year of 753 (!). Additionally, it is the Chronicle that is based mainly on the oral tellings of man-to-man that lived in Doclea, or even more stricly limited to the citizens of Antivari. On the other hand, DAI has been composed by a Roman Emperor (!), who took it mainly from various texts from the Imperial library as well as the tellings of his most trusted strategists, advisors and historians, which was written around 950 (so its closer to the years it tells about). LPD doesn't exist in its original form, but after at least 10 overwritings - whereas DAI is kept as an original. LPD was written (thus) in a poetic manner, fulling the romantic nationalism of the people (where lived 200 years after their sons) - as one of its soal goals was to be a propaganda pamphlet; it was written in the Serbian dialect of the Old Slavonic language and then translated to "pig latin"; the oldest known version of LPD (and there were tens of it) is that of a Croat linguist from the 16th century - and it bears <i><b>no mention of Red Croatia, nor Croats in the southern Dalmatian Principalities at all</b></i>. The latter Latin version is the only one that mentions Red Croatia (and as such its modern Serbo-Croat translation). On the other hand, DAI has been written in a masterful (Old) Neo-Greek language and it's written encyclopedicly; its sole existence is the Emperor's desires to educate his son. Whereas LPD never reached international recognition, DAI did and was the center of research of the Western Monarchies that modelled themselves with Roman infrastructure. LPD concetrates on only that thing - but DAI is a lot more wider (only its small bit deals with the history of Croats &amp; Serbs), whereas the rest deals with how to wage wars, the Orthodox Church, planned construction, politics &amp; war and generally, as its name states, <i><b>how to rule an Empire</b></i>.</dd>
<dd>We have <b>neither</b> "Croats" nor "Slavs" in any Venetian source that mentions them that way. We have simply "Marians" or the "Narentines" (hardly Slavic - as some Venetian sources even tended to openly consider them Illyrians). That is, if we disregard the modern Italian/Venetian sources from the Age of Nationalism that generally considered the Dalmatian population Serbian. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 21:15, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly, now read my previous comment. And also the modern Italian/Venetian sources did not considered Dalmatian population Serbian...that is greatly incorrect...and even if they did it has nothing to do with what happened 1000 years ago and even less to modern history since we know that Dalmatian population identified and identifies with Croatian...Neretvian descendants included. As for the matters about LPD and DAI I already said what I had to say....if someone would answer me these: Why does the DAI contradicts itself? Why does it goes against numerous other Byzanatine sources? Why doesn't any Venetian or Saracen/Arab chronicle or source from that time confirms what is written there? And most interesting question of them all - why do the Serbs discard LPD so quickly when there is a discussion about 'Croatia Rubea' but are quick to call upon it when there is a discussion about the supposed 'Serbian Bosnia'? Interesting. No? And you said it yourself most of DAI does not concerns Slavic populations...it's main theme are other matters concerning the empire. The things written about Slavic populations(Croats, Serbs, etc...) is something Porphyrogenitus didn't know much and was thus calling himself upon various legends, rumors, 2nd, 3rd, etc. stories. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika</a> 22:53, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes they did; search for <i>Serbo-Illyirans</i>. Ofcourse it has nothing to do. Neretvian descendents included? On what do you base that? My tutors tought me errourosly how the Narentines are simply Croats, simply because their descendents are (allegedly) Croats. The population of medieval Herzegovina was almost exclusivly Orthodox Serb. The majority of the old Zachlumians live now either in Vojvodina or in Timocka Krajina, or God knows (we can't trace 'em everywhere!&#160;:) DAI doesn't contradic itself. It doesn't go against a single Byzantine source. Because there were very little Venetian and Arab/Saracen (as I said some Venetian chronicles don't even consider Pagans Slavs - but Illyrians rather)... God knows - I can't answer that question, no one can. Why do Serbs do what because what? I'm sorry, what are you talking about? I don't belong there. Ironicly, Croats discard as fast when Serbian Bosnia is mentioned - but quickly call it upon when they dispute the southern Dalmatian Principalities&#160;:) - that's why I don't refer to LPD as a source (regarding those arguable parts). Not upon various legends, rumors, stories; but like I said - the Imperial library, Imperial advisors, historians and strategists. LPD on the other hand is based almost exclusivly on <i><b>oral</b></i> stories &amp; legends. For instance, did you know one of LPD's most interesting legends - the construction of Ragusa (Dubrovnik). It claims that Belo, the grandson of the Serb "King" Ceslav is the one who built Ragusa in the 9th/10th century from scrap, connecting it with a wonderful love story (oh and right - LPD claims that Serbs had built Dubrovnik, by the way&#160;:) --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 21:31, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Serbo-Illyrians? What is that? I hear this for the first time. I even tried Google it...nothing solid comes up...only articles related to Illyrian movement and other similar articles. And DAI does contradicts itself...you have still not answered my question why does Porphyrogenitus at one points writes that they are Serbs but in other instance he mentions Serbs and Paganians separately...with others such as Croats, Zaclumians, Docleans, etc...if they were Serbs as you claim why did he listed them separately? Also what of numerous other Byzantine sources that speak of Docleans and Zachlumians as Croats? And the main point is that Venetians who dealed with Neretvians more than anyne else never referred to them as Serbs...ever. All you base your claim is one highly doubtful and not very credible source. LPD is not very credible either....the whole point I am making is that there must be some neutrality towards these medieval principalities...they were neither Serbian nor Croatian and that is my whole point. Sure later they did acquire Croatian and Serbian character and identity but that was much later when most of these principalities were fused into Croatia or Serbia anyway. Show some good will and common sense man. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika</a> 00:13, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is just irridentist Italian (supported by Serbian) POV on the non-national Roman Catholic Christian population of Dalmatia based on the Serbian-nationalistic minority. I did respond - he does not seperate them in other stories, but in the same paragraph. Additionally, that can't refer to all Serbs, but just Pagans - accuracy. Just as one would say "Rascian" or "Doclean" or "Bosnian" instead of "Serb" for accuracy. DAI doesn't contradict itself. They are listed <i>as per Serb state</i>; Empress Anna, John Skylitzes, Kekauman (next to Porphyrogenitos), Constantine the Philosopher and numerious others; so what if they didn't? maybe they didn't know? Maybe they didn't want to generalize? There was often usage of "Dalmatian", but we all know that it meant "Croat". As a part of the international cultural historical bastion - its not doubtful and/or uncredible at all (at least not that much). LPD is far less credible - as its purpose is more to entertain, and not teach. I would like neutrality too - but I can't reach it with that kind of attitude of yours. Nonsence - they were either Serb-like or Croat-like (much lesser possibility the latter); their indiginousness is even more unsourced than the both; the southern Dalmatian principalities were always fused into a unfied Serbian state, except for some exceptions (Croat/Bulgarian/Byzantine occupations) until the loss of the western half to Bosnia in the 14th century (800 years after) and the final fall of Serbia in the 15th/16th centuries. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 22:46, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry but that is just ridiculous 'explenation'. Why would he in one paragraph write that they are Serbs and then in another he seprates them explicitly? Perhaps maybe because he doesn't know what he is talking about? Again DAI is just not credible enough to be considered a valid source...especially as I say it contradicts itself...other numerous sources contradict it as well including other Byzantine sources and Arab and Venetian sources which mention ne affiliation of Neretvians with Serbian identity. And no they were not always fused with Serbian state. Pagania especially. The only other valid alternative for a Serb would indeed be Rascian even though that may have designated a man from Rascia of any ethnic origin...same for Dalmatia(and Croatian medieval state within it). But to claim the same for Doclean or Bosnian is just absurd and goes along the lines of Serbian megalomania and revisonism. Rather strange for someone who claims to be apolitical to spread such propaganda around like yourself. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika</a> 01:07, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Afrika paprika, please <b>stop</b>. you are on a wrong path.</p>
<p>Regarding Ivana Milicevic article, please explain why is "Croatian actress" better than "Bosnian actress od <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croats.html" title="Croats">Croatian</a> descent". <b>Croatian actress</b> is ambiguous because it may relate to <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia.html" title="Croatia">Croatia</a> while <b>Bosnian actress od <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croats.html" title="Croats">Croatian</a> descent</b> precisely explains who she is. So, I really don't understand what are you trying to prove here. This issue is quite simple and I'm beginning to think that your only motive is to provoke other people (notably - Serbs and Bosniaks).

<p>Now, I must admit that I really hate stubborn users pushing their own POV here. I had clashes with few tens of POV-pushers here and they were mostly Serbs. I was really proud to see that great majority of Croats here are very nice and tolerant people, unlike wiki-Serbs, among whom, as you will propably agree, there are many radicals and vandals. If You were a Serb, I might even let you go with ewhat you do, because 15 or 16 vandal doesn't make much difference.

<p><i>A kingdom in the Balkan Peninsula, on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea; the territory was in ancient times a portion of the Roman province of Dalmatia. Emperor Diocletian made Southern Dalmatia a separate province, Praevalis (Dioclea, Dioclitia) with Dioclea as its capital. <b>From the seventh century the north-western portion of the peninsula began to be invaded by Slav tribes; one of these, the Serbs, settled in the territory which they still possess, and founded there several principalities (Zupanate), the most southern of which was called Zeta, or (after the ancient Dioclea) Duklja. From Zeta sprang the Nemanjiden family, under whose autocracy the Servian Empire attained its greatest power. Stefan I Nemanja was recognized as Chief Zupan by Emperor Manuel I, in 1165; having reduced into submission the stubborn lesser Zupans, he embraced the Orthodox Faith, and then began to organize the Servian Church. His youngest son, Sawa, or Sabas, after being appointed first Orthodox Archbishop of Servia in 1221, founded a see for Zeta in the monastery of St. Michael near Cattaro. In the Empire of the Serbs, each heir apparent to the throne was first appointed administrator of the Province of Zeta. However, under King Stefan Dusan (1331-55) a member of the Balscicz family was named Governor of Zeta. From 1360 to 1421 this family ruled in Zeta, notwithstanding the constant opposition of the Cernojevic family, settled in Upper Zeta. On the destruction of the Great Servian Empire by the Turks after the battle of Amsfeld in 1389 Zeta became the refuge of the most valiant of the Serbs, who refused to submit to the Turkish yoke.</b></i></p>

Additionally, Encyclopedia Britanica states that the father of Roger Joseph Boshcovich is a Croat - despite him being of Serbian/Bosnian origins, and a convert from Eastern Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism - however, it is thus proper that we style him as Croat - just as it is proper that we style Dado Prso as a Serb.

<dd><i>History.The history of Montenegro as an independent state begins with the battle of Kossovo (1389), but the country had enjoyed periods of independence or semi-independence at various epochs before that event. It formed a portion of the district of Praevalitana in the Roman province of Illyria, and, lying on the borderland of the empires of the West and East, it alternately shared the fortunes of either till the close of the 5th century. It was then conquered by the Ostrogoths (A.D. 493), but half a century later definitely passed under Byzantine rule, having already acknowledged the ecclesiastical authority of Constantinople, a circumstance which determined the course of its subsequent history. Illyria and Dalmatia succumbed to the great Serbo-Croat Slavic invasion of the 6th and 7th centuries; <b>the Serb race by which Montenegro is now inhabited occupied the country about the middle of the 7th century.

However, this is <i>not</i> what most Encyclopediae say - so it is unacceptable - just as that which you claim. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 21:53, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually both the Britannica and the German encyclopdia which is more-less transliteration and Gerrman version of the British one. Britannica when founded has some outdated and old data still present as they are not prone to change...it must be said here that this encyclopedia was just like the official British policy under the influence of the Serbian ally during the begining of the 20th century and Serbia excerted this advantage over Croatia which was part of Habsburg Monarchy and had no say...it was the enemy anyway. You will not find one neutral source which will claim Dubrovnik Serbian...in fact there are books from Italy in the begining of the 1th century showing Ragusan ships bearing Croatian coat of army....no encyclopedia can beat that. As for the few of the few in Dubrovnik who claimed such things they were really a minor element there. You see at the begining of the century it was the official policy and opinion of linguists and especially historians in Yugoslavia that chakavian was "true Croatian" and that shtokavian dialects are solely Serbian. This ridiculous and preposterous claim was soon after abandoned and we know today that it was not, it is not and cannot be true. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika</a> 09:44, 21 September 2006

<dd>Actually, Brockhaus is a lot more <i>against</i> the Serbs, as it keeps talking of Greater Serbia and puts the blame of the 1990s misfortunes at the Serb side (mostly, still refering to neo-fascism in Croatia and Kosovo and religious zeal in Bosnia and Kosovo), unlike Britannica which remains NPOV. Anyway, what are you trying to say? That no encyclopedia is OK? That all those encyclopediae are unreliable? --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 22:11, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is not 'against the Serbs' that IS NPOV. Are you going to claim 'Greater Serbia' claims are a myth? For gods sake the strongest party in Serbia still claims they will get the so-called 'historical Serbian lands' which it must be said were NEVER Serbian. As for the 1990s events we all know who started and who is to blame. I would claim that none of the encyclopedia has everything right...but Britannica mostly....referring to the South Slavic area which is of my immediate interest. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika</a> 00:54, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">All replies</span></h2>
<p>(from Pagania) It doesn't contradict itself. It isn't so easily disputable and arguably as you claim.</p>
<p>(from Please STOP). what do you mean <i>in another paragraph</i>?</p>
<p>At the paragraph about Serbs, the Emperor says: <i>And because present Serbia and Pagania and the land of the Zachlumoi and Travunia and the land of the Canalites were under the authority of the Emperor of the Romeii, and those lands were deserted by Avars, the Emperor inhabited in these lands the same Serbs and they were subject to the Emperor of the Romeii, the emperor baptised them bringing priests from Rome and, teaching them to correctly commit the acts of divinity, gave them the Christian though.</i></p>
<p>And then the paragraph on the Pagans says: <i>The land which is populated by the Pagans now was also held by the Romans [...] Those same Pagans descend from the unbaptised Serbs from the times of the archont that refuged to Emperor Heraclius [..] Pagans are called because they weren't batpised in the time all Serbs were...</i> etc.</p>
<p>Where does it contradict itself? What contradicts with it? Megalomania? Look, I just cite sources/quotations. If you continue claiming that - we'll reah nowhere. The Serbian national unification/birth of a unified state/awakening was achieved in 1166, when all southern Dalmatian principalities became a component of that state. The majority of the Serbian population lived along the coastline - while the hinterland (Bosnia and Rascia) were pretty much deserted. This just prooves that you didn't read what I already pointed out to you several times.</p>
<p>It's highly nationalistic pro-Croat to claim she's <i>Croatian and nothing else</i>. The concept of one being something is a lot <b>wider</b>. "Bosnian" means citizen of Bosnia or Bosnian-born. Additionally, it <i>is a nationality</i>. Predrag Stojakovic isn't a Croat because he is an adherent of the Serbian Orthodox Church; he is a declared Serb (not Croat). He isn't Croat because he was forced to flee Croatia because he was a non-Croat (or at least he was considered by those who opposed his people). He isn't a Croatian basketball player because he didn't/doesn't play in a Croatian basketball national team. He however is most definately Croatian (or better Yugoslav), and there is nothing he can do to change the place of his birth. Croatian is misleading because it connects Ivana to Croatia - but it should connect to Bosnia.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? Well then, if you approve Brockhaus' statement that Croats inhabited north of Cetina and Serbs south - then where's the arguement? I just said that it talks more bad about the Serbs than other encyclopedias (so it can't be pro-Serb); LaRousse encyclopedia for instance can't stop presenting the bad image of Croats, whereas Britannica's in the middle, but when it talks about Bosnia it tends to talk bad mostly about Serbs. Those are just some insignificant variations. Additionally, the "strongest party in Serbia" has no power in Serbia whatsoever; what do you mean by "<b>must be said were NEVER Serbian</b>" We don't <i>all know who started and who is to blame</i>. If you are refering to who started, then are you refering to the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Slovenia_72fb.html" title="Republic of Slovenia">Republic of Slovenia</a>? And when there's to talk who to blame - most are either in Hague or will be (is that what you though?) --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 10:59, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting - you yourself were a promoter of "Croatian Krajina" instead of the original "Military Frontier". The usage ofthe term "Krajina" is about 500 years years old, connoting the territories of Croatia that were mainly inhabited by ethnic Serbs up until 1995. The Military Krajina existed all the way until the late 19th century, and even if you admit the name - what, are you a Serbian radical and extremist? As for ethnic cleansing - well, the UN said that 250,000 Krajina Serbs fled either in fear, were exiled forcibly during, shortly before and shortly after Operation Storm. They also said that "<i>Almost the only people remaining were the dead and the dying.</i>". "Croats Burn and Kill with a Vengeance," Robert Fisk, The</dd>

<dd>The term Croatian Frontier(Hrvatska Krajina) which was component of Military Frontier(Vojna Krajina) is totally unrelated to this matter. 'Krajina' on it's own doesn't mean one thing besides simply meaning 'region', 'shire', 'county', etc. The usage of 'krajina' is as old as the language. The Military Frontier(Croatian and Slavonian parts) were in fact in majority inhabitated with Croats not Serbs and to claim otherwise is ridiculous. Associationg Military Frontier(Vojna Krajina) with the supposed 'Republic of Serbian Krajna' is in fact extremism and nationalism and has nothing to do with history. You have now revealed yourself completely. The teritories which Serbs inhabited were called Croatia and Slavonia(as part of Croatia). Even when Military Froniter was instituted it was considered Croatian and was referred as 'Military Croatia' as well. I think you should refer to Military Frontier pages and also the so-called 'Republic of Serbian Krajina' and read it well. As for your referrence to the UN there is nothing proven. Citing personal views of individual journalists won't do you any good and is not an argument. I can also post you numerous articles in favour of 'Operation Storm' and that would take forever. The point is the war didn't started in 1995. It started in 1991 when more than 250 000 Croats and other non-Serbs were exiled and expelled and at least twice as much in neighbouring regions displaced, Croatian cities and villaged bombed on daily bases from occuppied teritory(1/3 almost of whole Croatia). The 'Operation Storm' enabled the people to come back to their homes and effectively ended the war both in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 14:10, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arguements</span></h2>
<p>You said that claiming that there were more Serbs than Croats in Military Frontier is ridiculous. I present thee the 1790 Austrian population census of the Military Frontier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serbs (<i>42.4%</i>)</li>
<li>Croats (<i>35.5%</i>)</li>
<li>Romanians (<i>9.7%</i>)</li>
<li>Hungarians (<i>7.5%</i>)</li>
<li>Germans (<i>4.8%</i>)</li>
</ul>
<p>AFAIC, take a look of the same population census of Slavonia (and that <i>doesn't</i> include the Slavonian Military Frontier, but does include Srijem):</p>
<ul>
<li>Serbs (<i>46.8%</i>)</li>
<li>Croats (<i>45.7%</i>)</li>
<li>Hungarians (<i>6.8%</i>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, why are we arguing over that? It doesn't matter who held majority where. What matters is that whenever Croatian property is stolen or destroyed because they were Croats or whenever Serbs are torured or killed because they were Serbs, that's ethnic cleansing (and that did occur in Operation Storm(.

<dd>Again you are confused. This data is for the WHOLE Military Frontier including Banatian(now in Vojvodina) Frontier which had absolute Serbian majority due to Serbian migrations there. As for civic Slavonia as you say it doesn't includes Slavonian Military Frontier which had absolute Croatian majority but it does includes Syrmia which in it's eastern parts had absolute majority by Serbs. This has continuity to this day where Eastern Syrmia is by majority Serbian(and is in Serbia-Vojvodina) while the western part was and is by majority Croatian(and is in Croatia). I urge you to read carefully what I wrote and this time try to read it with understanding. And btw. that data looks "fishy" to me....Slavonia not having a substantial percentage of Germans?

<dd>The Serbian Military Frontier (Banat) was made of only one district - the Croatian had 8 and Slavonian had 9 disctricts. I don't know if you think that the whole Military Frontier was almost uninhabited - and then thickly inhabited in the small strip of Banat. As for Slavonia - most of Srem was a part of the Slavonian Military Frontier - then also you must consider the territory inhabited wholly by ethnic Croats - and then a tiny Vukovar, Ilok and Sremska Mitrovica with a population that exceeds all Croats! Be realistic. And yes, Germans formed 0.6% of Slavonia's population. See the image:</dd>

<dd>First there was no "Serbian Military Frontier" and second it doesn't matter of how many districts it was made of. Look at how big is Netherlands yet it has more people than Croatia and Hungary combined(f.e.). Observe the map and you will see that the Banatian Frontier is almost of the size of whole Croatian Frontier and do have in mind that Banat and Syrmia were always far more populated as they are fertile plains while Lika and Dalmatian hinterland(most of Croatian Krajina) is poor mountainas backward region. Also most of the Serbs in Slavonia(Syria more correctly) lived not in the cities you mention but in the villages. For example the city of Zemun had 98% majority of Croats, Petrovaradin 92% but Croats were way from being a majority in Eastern Syrmia. Later when Serbs started moving into cities Croats quickly became minority...same with Hungarians, Germans and Croats. We had the similar example in Dalmatia where when Croats started moving into towns the Latin/Italian majority was quickly relegated to minority...a small one at that. And I must say 0.6% Germans only in Slavonia sounds wrong to me....the number most definately has to be higher. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 22:59, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And now - OK, let's take an example. The largest (territorially) regiment of the Military Frontier was Lika. Lika's Serbian population according to the censi exceeded <i>70%</i> in the 19th century (this is not only the RSK East Lika - but the whole region). Note, please; that the 19th century is presented by constant immigration of Serbs to Free Serbia - because their own free state has been created. Now - if you really want, let's go to <b>figures</b>, and not just percentages. This is the Austrian 1840 population census of Croatia-Slavonia (1,605,730):</p>
<ul>
<li>777,880 Croats (<i>48%</i>)</li>
<li>504,179 Serbs (<i>32%</i>)</li>
<li>297,747 Šokci (<i>19%</i>)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Which makes it 67% vs. 32% in favour of Croats. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 23:18, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Notice the number of Serbs? Are you going to claim that they all lived in Eastern Srijem? Now, here's the Austro-Hungarian population census on the Lika-Krbava county of Croatia-Slavonia from 1910 (204,710):</p>
<ul>
<li>104,041 Eastern Orthodox (<i>51%</i>)</li>

<dd>I don't know what are you trying to say but I never stated that Serbs lived exclusively in Syrmia and Banatian Frontier...I said that that the reason why there were equal number of Croats and Serbs in the WHOLE Military Frontier is because it included large parts of Serbian populated areas that are later (and are today) part of Serbia. Read with understanding. I was referring to Croatian and Slavonian Frontier that are to this day part of Croatia and have been such for hundreds of years. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 23:02, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, the Lika Regimental Area (Donji Lapac, Srb, Udbina, Gospic, Medak, Bag, Gracac) had a 70% Serbian majority - I already mentioned that. The 1st Banate regiment (the Slunj regiment - Clunj, Cetin, Vojnic, Karlovac) had a 67% Serbian majority and the 2nd Banate regiment (Glin regiment - Zirovac, Topusko, Vrgin most, Glina) had a 62.2% Serb majority. In the Petrovaradin regimental area (Novi Sad, Titel, Sremski Karlovac, Slankamen, Pancevo, Zemun, Raca, Sremska Mitrovica, Kupinovo) had a 63.2% Serb majority.</p>

<p>Nothing. I don't know even what was the dispute. You were saying that Croats formed the majority of the Military Frontier - I prooved otherwise. You also said that there was no ethic cleansing in Operation Storm; however when I asked you if you agree that whenever a Serb/Croat is killed or tortured because he/she is a Serb/Croat or whenever property of Croats/Serbs is stolen or destroyed because it was owned by Croats/Serbs is ethnic cleansing, you did not respond - these two were the things I was explaining to you. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 14:33, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I never said Croats formed the majority in Military Frontier but in PARTS of Military Frontier....namely Croatian and Slavonian Military Frontier speciically the ones that are part of Croatia to this day. And the issue was wheter the 'Operation Storm' had it's goal and consequence of 'ethnic cleansing'...the answer is no.

<p>No one said that Operation Storm's goal was ethnic cleansing. It most certainly was not. However, you cannot both agree to my definition of "ethnic cleansing" and claim that it didn't occur in Operation Storm - it's illogical. Even at the end, when Tudjman entered Knin, he expressed satisfaction how Serbs will never exceed 3-4% of Croatia's population anymore - indirectly meaning (<i>good we ethnicly cleansed enough of them</i>).</p>
<p>If you don't see what's wrong with "Greater Serb shit" - than you heave a problem, not me. As I remember, you said that your <i>sole goal is neutrality and objectivity</i>.

<dd>It is not me "disagreeing" with your definition but that the sources and overall view does not agrees with you. It is not proven that it was an ethnic cleansing as you claim. Operation Storm was a legal military action to free occuppied teritory of a sovereign nation. It was confirmed by both the UN and the international community. Also Tudjman never said no such thing.

<p><a name="Ante_Gotovina" id="Ante_Gotovina"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Ante Gotovina</span></h3>
<p>Ante Gotovina is charged atrocities against Croatian Serbs during the Yugoslav Civil wars, including the murder of 150 in Krajina. Gotovina is charged with responsibility for the alleged murder of about 150 Serbs, persecution, and the deportation of thousands. About 200,000 Serbs - many elderly - were forced out of the region during the offensive.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes 150 including cows and people who were still alive when the indicment was wrote or are alive still. Ridiculous. Many have stated the obvious - the indicment against Gotovina is political. He was a minor figure in all of that. Let them actually prove it. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 23:43, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The UN representatives said about Gotovina: <i>Gotovina knew or had reason to know that forces under his effective control were about to murder Krajina Serbs,</i> and <i>Gotovina failed to take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent the commission of such acts or punish the perpetrators thereof.</i></p>
<p>These are the points of the 14-page long indictment of Gotovina by the ICTY:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds, deportation and other inhumane acts (forced displacement) - three counts of crimes against humanity</li>
<li>Other inhumane acts - one count of crimes against humanity</li>
<li>Murder - one count of violations of the laws or customs of war</li>
<li>Plunder of public or private property and wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages - two counts of violations of the laws or customs of war</li>
</ul>
<p>BBC clearly confirms Gotovina's acts as ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>From BBC: <i>Although Operation Storm was a considerable military success, it was accompanied by the exodus of nearly 200,000 Serbs. <b>Hundreds of Serb civilians were killed - mostly elderly people who stayed on after their families had left.</b></i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Where do you see "ethnic cleansing" in this quote? And when is BBC as something you can refer to such issue? How did they came up with the term "hundreds of civilians killed" when the UN sources say explicitly that the casualties were MINIMAL? <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 23:44, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>In two days, Croatia retook all the territories where rebel Serbs had succeeded in setting up a self-proclaimed state - the Krajina Republic - four years earlier.</i></p>
<p><i>Hundreds were killed by the advancing troops.</i></p>
<p><i>The United Nations War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has indicted three Croatian military officers for crimes against ethnic Serbs in the 1995 offensive.</i></p>
<p>Your claim of cleansing 250,000 from Krajina is a harsh overestimate. Krajina had a population of more than 78,000 Croats and about 2,000 Muslims in 1991. So how could you exile 250,000 citizens? Also - at the start of the Croatian War of Independence - over 200,000 ethnic Croats have been displaced and over 300,000 ethnic Serbs altogether in Croatia (up to 1993).</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. There is no "Krajina"...never was never will be. 2. I cited you above the data of the occuppied territories...there were more than 205 000 were Croats and this was confirmed by that same UN you call upon yourself. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 23:45, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Gotovina is alleged to have failed to prevent the murder of 150 Serbs killed by <b>shooting, stabbing or burning</b> during Operation Storm, the August 1995 push against Serb forces in Croatia's Krajina region.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Again there is no "Krajina region". Find me a historical map with this supposed "region"....just one. And second 'alleged' is the key word. You have to prove it first....but you don't have proof. In fact we have documents from the leadership of Serb terrorist which order full withdrawal of all (para)military AND CIVILIANS. Most of those who decided to leave never even saw Croatian soldiers as their "exile" begun 2 days before 'Operation Storm' even took place. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 23:48, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It has to do that MOST of the ransacking, looting and killing was made on the Serbian and the fact that the Serbian side was the FIRST TO INSTIGATE such behaviour.

<p>Even if we sum up all of yours, we would get 200,000 - not 250,000 - and Croats remained a strong minority in RSK during the war, and remained a majority in the east. I <i>do not</i> count the East UNPA, It has been controlled by Yugoslav forces and Miloshevich's authority, wasn't included in the later RSK census and had very little common things with RSK (aside from officially being a part of it). Additionally, there were <b>6,864</b> Croats in UNPA West; so that's altogether 78,000 Croats in RSK.

<p>Also - I noticed you were discussing how the Croatian state was born in Dalmatia (Croatia) and Slavonia (Pannonia). Well, we place that the inhabitants of the Principality of Pannonia were ethnic Croats - and yet, no such Croatian state was born there. Dalmatia's Duke Tomislav Trpimirović defended it from Hungarian invasions and annexed it to his Croatian Kingdom in 925. Barely a century later, in 1027, it was taken over by the Hungarians who made it into a Slavonian Banate ruled by a native family. Although it was reunited with Croatia throughout the 1070s, it immediately recognized Hungarian rule at first chance in 1091 (over a decade later). After centuries (during which Slavonia was even a part of Serbia for a while), Slavonia was subjected to Croatia in 1476. It was lost (mostly) to the Ottomans after 1526. In 1699, the "Kingdom of Slavonia" was reorganized, vassalaged to the Kingdom of Hungary; while the Slavonian Krajina was independent. Croats are registered as a minority throughout this period in Slavonia. In 1848 Croatia conquered Slavonia, but it became independent in 1849. Slavonia joined Croatia into a personal union in 1868 and Slavonian Krajina was annexed in 1881. Slavonia was a seperate entity - the Osijek Oblast in 1922-1929 and became a part of the Sava Banate in 1929-1939 - when it was made a part of the Croatian Banate. It was a part of the Independent State of Croatia in 1941-1945 and a part of Croatia till the present.</p>
<p>However, where's the birth of the Croatian state there in the early history? --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 15:06, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see that your knowledge of history is not your better part. I never argued that Croatian state was born in Slavonia(Pannonia) so I don't know where did you get it but you certainly didn't saw me arguing such a thing. The DAI and Porphyrogenitus, to which you like to call yourself upon when mentioning the supposed Serbian population in the southern Dalmatian medieval princiapalities, also mentiones Croats a chapter before that and says the same for Croats (regarding the mentioned Dalmatian princiapalities) but he also talks about one part of Croats going back north and settling in Lower Pannonia (later Slavonia). Slavonia however was at that time region of today central Croatia (area around Zagreb, Moslavina, Zagorje, upper Karlovac region and most of todays westernmost Slavonia region....Medjimurje not included). The part which is today commonly known as Slavonia (mostly) was actually Syrmia and part of Hungary and often disputed between (in early times) Byzantium, Bulgaria and Hungary (of which [Hungary] it was the most part of). Slavonia (early medieval) became part of Croatian Kingdom while as mentioned Syrmia (most of today Slavonia) remained part of Hungarian domain. King Dmitar Zvonimir who was of junior Trpimirovic dynasty (Svetoslavic) came from this early medieval Slavonia for example. Later after the Turks conquest and liberation of from the Turks (end of 17th century) most of what is today Slavonia (then nominally Kingdom of Slavonia) and Syrmia formed a new region-kingdom of Slavonia. Although Slavonia was treated as separate crown land it was united with Croatia since 1476 in a single ruler and parliament. The 'Military Frontier' mentioned was formed as a buffer zone for better defense against Ottomans and was never independent (including 'Slavonian Frontier') but rather teritory of mentioned crown-lands (Croatia, Slavonia, Banat of Temes) under direct command of Vienna and military. Also I don't see how the 45.7% of population (by the 1790 census which didn't include 'Slavonian Frontier' and included mostly Serbian inhabitated western Syrmia) can be classified as "minority" as you put it. Also I fail to see how this has to do with anyhing. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 04:30, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I cuoted the BBC - there were 80,000 non-Serbs in Krajina in 1991. The RSK 1993 census indeed seems to be incorrect; it noted only 7% Croat population, while I think we all agree was a lot larger (which again, if you don't agree - goes <i>against</i> your arguements - Croats remained as a minority and stayed <i>as a majority</i> in the east).</dd>

<p>I still don't understand what you mean - are you saying that we should say "Croatian Krajina" or "Serb Krajina" all the time? Geez, man; that's just saving words "Krajina" - one less word instead of two. You can see the map in 1990-1995 when it was a political entity. And it is a geographical entity since the 16th cenutury. Every country has its own Krajina region - Serbia has Timocka Krajina - Montenegro has Kraja - Croatia has this Krajina - Macedonia has some - you're overreacting. I'll compare: "There is no "Russia", tell me, where did you ever see a "Russia" that's just some Russian propagandist garbage!" Do you understand?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually we should not say neither 'Croatian Krajina' since it was abolished in 19th century nor "Serb Krajina" which never existed. The teritory is simply Croatia. Was, is and will be. The "political entity" you speak of was not recognized and officially it did not exist...only Croatia was recognized and still is at the UN and will remain as such. In short Croatia has no "Krajina" and no such region exists...it is simply Croatia proper, it has however 'Sinjska Krajina', 'Imotska Krajina', etc. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 15:47, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Like I said: Byzantine sources call Pannonians Croats (and Upper Dalmatians moslty Serbs). On this Wikipedia, we place that the population of Pannonia (Posavina) was ethnicly Croat. And a state <i>was born</i> in Pannonia in the fisrt half of the 9th century - however, it didn't have a strict Croatian national like the latter movement in Dalmatia, nor did it last.

<p>In 1034 Stefan Vojislav, a descendent of the old Doclean House of Vladimir (currently sanctified by the Serb Orthodox Church, in the manner of the Nemanyiden). Stefan liberated Duklja; in this 11th-12th centuries period, Byzantines glorify the Serbs of Dalmatia, calling Stefan Voislav "Archont of Serbs", his land "Serb land", "populated by Serbs" as well as his two great successors: Mihailo and Bodin ("Serb Egzarchs", "rulling over the Serbs"); there is only one one instance when it is said how Mihailo is "the one who rules the Croats"; although the same paragraph contains "Croats, who're also called Serbs". This free state expanded to and liberated the whole Bulgarian Empire, annexed Travunia, Zachlumia and finally Rascia and Bosnia. Ever since, those entities remained united under one rule. A branch of that rulling family, the "House of Vukan/Uros" became the hereditary ruling dynasty of Rascia and Doclea, Travunia and Zachlumia for a while. The next branch of this dynasty, "Nemanjics", went to Rascia and seized control over it and ruling a unified Serb state for two whole centuries. Stefan Nemanja, a member of the Doclean ruling dynasty and founder of the Nemanjics was born in Ribnica, the largest continental town of Duklja. Zeta remained as the HQ of the Serbian state up to the late 13th century when it was replaced by Macedonia and Kosovo. Another great Serbian dynasty, the "House of Brankovic", is from Travunia; the House of Mrnjavcevic (to whom Marko Kraljevic belongs) is from Zachlumia. Even later, this continued, as the Karadjordjevichs and Obrenovichs came from Montenegro to Serbia. The Petrovic-Njegoshs are from Herzegovina (anciently known as Hum-Zachlumia). Tell me, what am I propagating?</p>

<dd>And you woul be laughed out. The problem is this: Croatia was federal part of Yugoslav Federation, as such it had the right to secede if the people in Croatia wanted so.

<p>BiH was in 1991 under influence of neutrality (despite under strict Izetbegovic control), allowed JNA forces to pass to Croatia and many Bosnians participated in it. The Republic of Macedonia is <i>the only</i> Republic that seceded constitutionally.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Neutrality but acceppted secession of Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia if they wished so. The cause for their neutrality was because they thought they could go without conflict...they were wrong. Also I don't see how Macedonian secession was legal and constitutional and Slovenian and Croatian wasn't.

<p>According to you, half the globe are "Serb sympathizers".</p>
<p>Serbo-Croatian existed since the early 19th century up to present-day. It has many variations, East Herzegovinian being the largest (which I proudly speak) or dialects such as Iekavian (being the largest and that which I speak). If anyone sees the map, he/she will notice that seperations on 3 (or 5) languages is just <i>a political</i> creation, and not linguistical (which most other encyclopeadias agree: Britannica, LaRousse, Brockhaus, etc... all still use "Serbo-Croat".</p>
<dl>
<dd>It never existed. Croatian and Serbian languages were always two separate entities which grew and developed independently. The fact they were based on similar base and that they were brough a bit closer even during struggle against Habsburg Monarchy doesn't mean they were the same. Even during Yugoslavia there was clear distinction between the so-called "western variant"(Croatian language) and "eastern variant"(Serbian) and if you for example confused these two in school while writing an essey you would get an F big as a house. The point is the "Serbo-Croatia" is a diasystem....a dialectal continuum spanning from Slovenia to Bulgaria....and this dialectal continuu can be actually enlarged to Slovenia and Bulgaria and the transition phases in dialects can be easily observed. All today standard languages are "political creations".<a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 21:57, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There were more than 11% Serbs in Croatia (and a heck more before). I nowhere mentioned equal terms, but <b>Law and Constitutionality</b>. Constitutions might've been wrong, <i>really bad</i> anywhere - but hey, Constitution's a Constitution, you must admit! Anyway - it's sole purpose was to prevent the imposition of will of the bigger people, <i>contrary</i> to the interests of the lesser people (which after the 1990s became true, as Croat people dominated over the Serb people). If you didn't know, this system was (since 1974) and is <i>still</i> used in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<dl>
<dd>By which census? The ICTY or the 1991 Croatian census? Make up your mind already. At one point you refer to ICTY sources(wrong) and at one point at official 1991. census. The 1991. census says there were 205 000 Croats in the so-called "RSK" and more than 70 000 other non-Serbs. Make up your mind. Also Croatian people had every right to dominate in Croatia....it was after all - Croatia. What would you like instead that 11% domaintes over 79% of others? Don't be ridiculous. Also Bosnia-Herzegovina is totally unique case and cannot be compared. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 22:02, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Croatia's Constitution says "<i><b>Croatia is the nation-state of the Croat people...'</b>"; its the national state of Croats wherever they live, and not a state of its citizens; later it mentions minorities (Serbs, Hungarians, Italians, etc.) The Constitution further mentions the so-called "</i>hrvatska povijesna prava<i>", which was interpreted as an amends for a "Greater Croatia" over BiH and parts of Serbia and Montenegro by some; it talks about a "</i>tisućljetnja tradicija <i>and it talks about the</i> national fight for self-determination<i>. AFAIC, it is the Constitution of Serbia that defines Serbia "<b>The state of its inhabitants</b>" and</i> still today <i>defines the Serbo-Croatian language the official language of Serbia. ;)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>And it continues "...and all of it's citizens...". Take a look at any other constitution in Europe. You will find the same terminology. Serbia included. Why couldn't the Croats be "constitutional people" in Serbia for example? And what does that mean anyway? I am asking you again....would it be right that 11%(now 4.5%) dominates over 79%(now 95.5%) of other people living in one state? Don't be ridiculous. Also I am talking about the new Serbian constitution soon to be adopeted(it already went through some procedure as I heard yesterday on the news) not the old communist Serbian constitution. As for the the rights it speaks of autchtonous Croatian people living in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Vojvodna/Serbia and Montenegro. You will find same terminology in other constitution...even more radical such as Irish constitution or the new Serbian constitution(if Kosovo become indepedenent). <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 22:05, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>12.2% according to the 1991 Croatian population census, yeah. How's the situation in Bosnia different? Also, Croatia is defined as the <i>nation-state of the Croat people</i>. It <b>nowhere</b> mentions/continues "and all of its citizens". Its the Croat nation-state and the state of Croatia's minorities (Serbs, Muslims, Slovenes, Czechs, Slovaks, Italians, Hungarians, Jews and others). The Republic of Macedonia's seccession was constitutional and legal because it yielded a mass majority "for" in its 1991 referendum for macedonian independence and in the Presidential seat it was <b>8:0</b> for its secession.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So you acceppt Croatian 1991 census? Why do you then call yourself upon iCTY incorrect data? Is it maybe because the numbers of Croats are smaller? Don't answer that...it's a rhetorical question. And yes the Croatian constitution actually does mentions that Croatia is homeland to Croats and all people living in it including the Serbs. The original draft had one whole division speaking only about Serbs in Croatia and their rights. The Croatian and Slovenian referendum also had huge majority....I don't have the exact figures now but if one looks closely one can come to the conclusion that even the relative majority of Serbs voted pro indepdence despite for calls to ignore the referendum by the Serbian extremists. If Macedonian secession was legal so was Croatian and Slovenian. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 21:23, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Serbian and Croatian were always one language. In the 19th century the Serbian language and Croatian language were created, only to be subsequently (Croatian after several years - Serbian being a bit younger united even <i>before it was created (-X years)</i>). The Serbo-Croatian language slowly expanded to Bosnia and finally applied to Montenegro and Serbia with the unification. Ever since then until the present (with few gaps) it has been one language. Besides, as I said, the world doesn't divide the languages, and there are so many Serbo-Croat dialects that's impossible to draw an evident line on the soil of the Serbo-Croatian states.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Serbian and Croatian were never one language...if they were they would be referred as such and they never were through history. Both developed on it's own and matured on it's own. It is in fact the opposite...only in recent times(late 19th century and most of the 20th century) the two languages were started coming closer with the goal of ultimately uniting them but that never took place and will never took place as you cannot enforce such a thing. The so-called "Serbo-Croatian" is a diasystem, a dialectal contiuum similar to Macedonian-Bulgarian, Swedish-Norwegian-Danish, Czech-Slovak, etc. Furthermore the term "Serbo-Croatian" is outdated and is politically incorrect. The correct term today is Central-South Slavic diasystem.

<p>Your comparison of Southern Dalmatia with Greece cannot be applied. First off, Serbs lived in Greece for only a short time when they came (Macedonia); not counting the numerious populace that later came as a result of expansion; whereas they live in Doclea, Zachlumia, Travunia with Konavli and Pagania since the beginning and have their own states there. Greece cannot be craddle, as the majority of the Serbian Medieval ruling dynasties (or better, the majority <i>of Serbs</i>) come from southern Dalmatia, and <b>none</b> come from Greece. While in the 11th century the Serbian state was reborn percisely in the southern Dalmatian coastal areas, no such state was born in Greece. Whereas those states remained under Serbian rule for most of the time since the beginning, Greece was much later <b>conquered</b> and remained a part <i>for a short time</i> in the 14th century. Plus, it is Zeta who was the HQ of the Serbian state up to the 13th century, and not Greece, which was martially conquered.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually my comparison can be applied very well as it is the same thing. Also Rascia is Southern Dalmatia as well...at least in the terms Porphyrogenitus refers to it, along with Franks. As for Zeta I do agree to some point with you, but claiming that Dioclea, Travunia and especially Zachlumia and Pagania were Serbian in just absurd and ridiculous. A claim which you cannot confirm...at least not without contradiction. That is why I called upon a consensus and NPOV version while you use dirty tricks in enforcing your nationalistic version of history. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 21:35, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't <i>accept</i> anything. I just read &amp; cite. The ICTY statement refers to the war-time, while the Croatian census was at the beginning of the year. You have misinterpreted the errorous ICTY's results that are presented by (only) the Croatian government as the 1991 population census of the Republic of Croatia. i repeat, it <b>is not</b> mentioned that Croatia is the state of its citizens, but that its the nation-state of the Croat ethnic group; Serbs are mentioned as <i>a minority</i>. over 80% of Croatia's population voted for independence - and yes of course, a <i>large</i> number of Serbs voted for independence. <b>Only if the Presidential Committe unitedly agrees</b> - which happened only in Macedonia's case (not counting Montenegro's recent secession).</p>
<dl>
<dd>The ICTY does not refers to "war-time" but pre-war population. However from where they got their numbers only they know. Perhaps they looked into a crystal ball. And please stop repeating the same bull over and over when it is obvious you don't know nothing about Croatian constitution. As a citizen of Croatia I know quite well what the constitution says and it clearly says "Croatia is a state of Croats <b>and all its citizens</b>". The presidency of Yugoslavia was 4:2 in secession of Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia. If Slovenia's and Croatia's secession was illegal so was Macedonia, if Macedonia's was legal then was Slovenia's and Croatia's. You cannot have one and another...if its black then its black, if its white then it's white.

<p>You said that a comparison with Greece would be identical - however, it is impossible.

<p>You cited "the state of its citizens" - you <i>misquoted</i>. It's the nation-state of the Croat ethnic group, while some ethnic groups have been granted (or downgraded to, as with the Serb case) the status of minorities. It has <i><b>nothing</b></i> to do with Croatia being a non-national state, the citizen-state of all its citizens (which it's not); like the case with Serbia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems you do have problems with thought process. Perhaps if you read that passage for some 200-300 times maybe eventually it will get into your head. The passage is clear - Croatia is a country of all of it's citizens living in it. Of course that the constitution will define it also as a country of Croatian people - it is called Croatia after all. Observe constitutions of other countries. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 00:31, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Croatian, and a little later Serbian were forged in the 19th century, only to be called Serbo-Croatian, up to only recently. As far as I see Serbo-Croat has existed (or better, exists) for longer than either of the two languages. Also, are you saying that all those people have had irridentist opinions, that they're all somehow <i>wrong</i>, and that the present nationalistic political minority view outguns them?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Really? So let me understand if I got this right...Marko Marulic in 15th century wrote in "Serbo-Croatian"? I thought he wrote in Croatian? Gundulic also? You see you have been deeply affected by pro-Serbian Yugoslavian propaganda and brainwashed to the death. The facts are that such a lanaguage never existed and never will. I already said even in Yugoslavia there was clear distinction between two version of this supposed "Serbo-Croatian": the western variant(actually Croatian language) and the eastern variant (Serbian language). If you mixed those two in school you would flunk the test/essey/whatever. Croatian and Serbian were always separate and it is the other way around - Croatian and Serbian started coming closer at the end of the 19th centur and in begining of 20th century. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 00:35, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You didn't. You just compared it to Greece, claiming that it's practicly the same thing, while Serbs have had nothing to do with Greece except the short-lived 14th century conquest (you even said that this makes Greece craddle of the Serbian civilization).</p>
<p>I'm glad that you're reasoning.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Greece is not "craddle of Serbian civilization"....thats why my comparison is right in the place because Dioclea and southern Dalmatian principalities (Croatia Rubea) are no more "craddle of Serbian civilzation" then Greece is. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 00:37, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Croatia is nowhere near Africa. Tesla was born in the Military Frontier of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (per Tesla). Present -day Croatia did not exist when Tesla was born. Telsa spoke several languages. [He was far smarter than you (or me)]. One of them was Serbian, which was his ethnicity. It was spoken the same as present-day Croatian. They were not two separate languages. Paprika is a favorite spice in my household. Thanks for your interest in Wikipedia. P.S. the octagon -shaped warning is not of my doing.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 04:50, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tesla was born in <b>Croatian</b> part of Military Frontier and Croatia very much existed....you can observe it in the very title (Austrian Archduke later Emepror was King of Croatia), there was separate ruler for Croatia (Croatian Ban-&gt;Viceroy) and there was separate Croatian parliament. All that very much means that - suprise, suprise - <b>it existed!!!</b> Croatian and Serbian were always two separate languages and perhaps you should refer to the articles regarding this matter on this very website to learn some facts.

<p>There have been many claims on Wikipedia that some dialect of a language is a separate language, as part of nationalist aspirations of residents of some region, who want to be a separate country. The United States were indeed separate and equal states before forming the United States. When the Confederate States sought to dissolve their union with the United States in 1861, very curiously, there was no claim put forward at all that they spoke a separate language, even though anyone could instantly recognize their speech as different from that of a northerner, in accent, in grammar, and in vocabulary. The Southern speaker uses a familiar plural pronoun unused in the north, "Y'all," short for "You all," as in "Do y'all need some help? And "help" would have been pronounced like "hep." Instead of "This farm" they might say "This here farm," pronounced like "Thishear famm." This is likely due to African influences in the Southern speech. Someone from Boston, on the other hand, like President Kennedy, would pronounce "I parked the car on the Harvard yard and went to Africa" as "I pahked the cah on the Hahvahd yahd and went to Afriker." Because of these differences in American speech, it is not a compelling argument for separate languages in other countries when someone says that in a few sentences one can tell whether someone is from one or another region of former Yugoslavia. In a few sentences, one can tell if someone grew up in Chicago or in a suburb of the city, or if they grew up in Brooklyn versus Queens or Manhattan in New York.

<p>I repeat - Greece had no Serb population. Southern Dalmatia received an influx in the first half of the 7th century, where they founded their own states. <b>ALL OR MOST SERBIAN DYNASTIES ARE FROM SOUTHERN DALMATIA</b> (Mrnjavcevic, Nemanjic, Vojislavljevic, Vojinovic, Brankovic, Balsic, Crnojevic, Visevic, etc...) , and scientificly the majority of the Serb populace; whereas none are from Greece (evidently - there were none there). There was no Serbian statehood movement (while there <i>was</i> in southern Dalmatia) and essentially, while southern Dalmatia has throughout the Middle Ages been component of a Serb state one way or another - Greece <i><b>was conquered in the 14th century and then subsequently lost</b></i>. I remember that you often criticized my knowledge of history - but how about yours?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dioclea, Pagania, Travunia and Zachlumia although at times closely under control of Serbia are not core Serbian lands nor in fact were they "Serbian lands". You are right - Serbian statehood originated in Southern Dalmatia but in the province of Rascia. You can rant as much as you want those are the facts. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 19:46, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Croatian language's main father was Ljudevit Gaj. Serbian language's main father was Vuk Stefanovic Karadzic - <i>both</i> subsequently joined it into the Serbo-Croat. I do not know what you're complaining.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Croatian language does not have a "father". Tell me this...if Serbian and Croatian were the "same language" why then the need to <b>join them</b> by Gaj and Karadzic?!? Explain to me this paradox? The fact is Croatian and Serbian were two similar but different languages, in 19th century two standard languages were brought even more closer but they were <b>NEVER</b> "the same" and will never be the same. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 19:48, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was just citing the Constituion. I did compare it to the Serbian and Montenegrin - which mention no nationality/ethnicity at all, and define the two states <b>CIVIC-STATES</b> - i. e. states of their citizens; whereas Croatia is a <i>nationalist state</i> "<b>NATION-STATE OF THE CROAT PEOPLE</b>". I don't need to read your posts for hundreds of time - <i>you</i> need to read the Constitutions, my friend. ;)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You were referring to the old communist Serbian and Montenegrin constitution. Refer to the new one - if there is anywhere where you can check it from first hand. Check any other consitution of any other country and you will see that there are small differences between the Croatian consitution and these constitutions. It is common pratice in democratic Europe. Croatia is land of Croatian people and all of it's citizens and the constitution is clear as day on this. <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika Paprika</a> 19:50, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You <i><b>did</b></i> call Krleza's and Budak's writings propaganda.

<p>You were editing <i>not logged on</i>, as an annon.</p>
<p>I was defining your rather wrong comparison of southern Dalmatia with Greece - without <i>anything</i> common whatsoever. Rascia might've been at times the place of gathering of the Serb peoples (it became the core of the Serb state in the Late Medieval Ages); however so was Doclea and partly Bosnia before; and Doclea remained the centre afterwards.</p>
<p>I am refering to the <b>current</b> Constitutions of Montenegro and Serbia - why are they "old"? And why are they "Communist"? Additionally, the hypothetical new Constitution of Serbia is that which you say - in its first paragraph <i>State of the Serbian People and all of its citizens</i>; while on the other hand Croatia's constitution clearly states that it's a nationalist-Croat state with minorities. That's it. If it would be <i>anything</i> close to what you claim, than it would be something like the hypothetical proposition for the new Constitution of Serbia - but, <b>it's not</b>.</p>
<p>Where did I lie? I mentioned Krleza (the greatest modern Croatian writer) and Budak and you said that you don't read that propaganda. That's what happenned.</p>
