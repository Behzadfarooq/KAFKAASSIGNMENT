<h2><span class="mw-headline">Etymology of boor</span></h2>
<p>The following (italicized) was removed as POV:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A few words and phrases in standard English are derived from Afrikaans, such as "trek" and "boorish"<i>, which originally was a derisive comparison to the supposed ill manners of the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boer.html" title="Boer">Boers</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The etymology of "boor" given above is incorrect and offensive. The OED gives the first known use of the word "boor" meaning "rude and ill-bred" in 1598. This is half a century before the foundation of the first Dutch settlement in South Africa in 1652, and 2 centuries before Afrikaans or Afrikaners came into existence. Etymologically, "boor" and "boer" are utterly unrelated. Other common Afrikaans words that have found their way into English are</i> "veld", "spoor", "<a href="../../../b/r/a/Braai.html" title="Braai">braai</a>", and, of course, "apartheid".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Both <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?boor" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?boor" rel="nofollow">Merriam-Webster</a> and the <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/48/B0394800.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/48/B0394800.html" rel="nofollow">American Heritage Dictionary</a> give the Dutch word <i>boer</i> as etymology of <i>boor</i>. The modern Dutch word <i>boer</i> still has the meaning of <i>a rude, unmannered person</i> (see <a href="http://www.vandale.nl/opzoeken/woordenboek/?zoekwoord=boer" class="external text" title="http://www.vandale.nl/opzoeken/woordenboek/?zoekwoord=boer" rel="nofollow">Van Dale's Woordenboek</a>). The removed text seemed to me to be incorrect; the first in stating that <i>boor</i> derived from <i>Boer</i> (the colonists) and the second in stating that <i>boor</i> is unrelated to <i>boer</i> (Dutch: farmer). For more etymology, see the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/b4etym.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.etymonline.com/b4etym.htm" rel="nofollow">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>.</p>
<p><br />
From the OED:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A word of involved history in and out of English, though the ultimate etymology is clear enough. The 16th c. bour, boore, may possibly have been native Eng., repr. an earlier *búr, short for OE. ebúr 'dweller, husbandman, farmer, countryman' (Bosw.), a deriv. of búr 'dwelling, house, cottage, BOWER', f. the verb root, b to dwell: cf. the compound neighbour:ME. neebur:OE. néahebúr 'nigh-dweller', also modern East Anglian BOR 'neighbour' as a form of address.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The etymological entry goes on to note that the modern usage may have been derived from the Dutch "boer". The first-usage date given in the original removed text is correct - by no stretch of the imagination can the modern English word "boor" have anything whatsoever to do with either the Afrikaans language or the Afrikaner identity. I am removing "boorish" from the list of words derived from Afrikaans, because I stand by my original assessment that the implied link is both incorrect and offensive.</p>

<p>Well, i am danish and i live in the netherlands currently, so i've been kinda surprised by the similarities of danish and dutch. I already knew some existed, but it's quite alot actually and i saw a pattern in the dutch words that were different from afrikaans in the examples. The article suggested that they were more similar to english, while i seem to see the pattern that they are more similar to english actually:</p>

<p>There is curiously no mention of dialects derived from Afrikaans (in particular, Kaaps).</p>
<p>I am not a linguist, so this is not an "expert" opinion. The little I have read on the subject seems to be complicated by the exact meaning of the term "creole". I have recollection of an article on this subject by Prof. Edith Raidt in her book, "Historiese Taalkunde", in which she takes another scholar, one Valkhoff, to task. Raidt shows how several features of Afrikaans, which were thought by Valkhoff to be evidence of "creolisation" which took place subsequent to the arrival of Europeans in southern Africa, to have existed in 17th century (and earlier) Dutch and Low Germanic dialects in Europe.</p>
<p>The book reference is: Raidt, Edith Hildegard. Historiese taalkunde&#160;: studies oor die geskiedenis van Afrikaans. Johannesburg&#160;: Witwatersrand University Press, 1994. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-86814-265-5</a> 203.51.118.211</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Redundant title</span></h2>
<p>This article should really be listed under "Afrikaans" and not "Afrikaans language"; the word "language" is redundant because Afrikaans cannot be anything than a language (unlike, for instance, English or Italian).

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><i>"white"</i> vs <i>White</i> and <i>"coloured"</i> vs <i>Coloured</i></span></h2>
<p>I don't like the recent copyedit which changed <i>"white"</i> to <i>White</i> and <i>"coloured"</i> to <i>Coloured</i>. The apartheid-era SA government used <i>White</i> and <i>Coloured</i> as though they were natural, accepted, distinct, well understood terms describing proper racial groups. Those officially classified <i>Coloureds</i> encompassed people indistinguishable (except on the whim of the official who administered the arbitrary tests) from those categorised <i>Black</i> and others indistinguishable from those qualified <i>White</i> and others who were evidently of far-Eastern heritage. Now, I am not in favour of politcial correctness for its own sake, but what is the PC approach we should be taking here? Certainly I know the term <i>Coloured</i> (especially capitalised) is offensive to many of those so classified. In anti-apartheid circles in the 80's typically the term <i>so-called "coloureds"</i> would often be used. The <i>Coloureds</i> were a SA apartheid-era political construct, nothing more. I believe we should use quotes to show the dubiousness of the categorisation as in: <i>Mr Jones and his "wife" went to a hotel.</i> In my view there are similar issues with the term <i>White</i>, capitalised. That, once again, was the SA apartheid-era legal way of referring to those so categorised.</p>

<p>To PC or not to PC, that is the question. The "post-apartheid" ANC regime seems to be happy to take over the apartheid system of race classification, lock, stock and barrel, in order to promote its own racist polices under the banner of "affirmative action." <a href="http://www.sairr.org.za/wsc/pstory.htx?storyID=350" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sairr.org.za/wsc/pstory.htx?storyID=350" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.sairr.org.za/wsc/pstory.htx?storyID=352" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sairr.org.za/wsc/pstory.htx?storyID=352" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.sairr.org.za/publications/pub/fof/2000q4/pleb.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sairr.org.za/publications/pub/fof/2000q4/pleb.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.sairr.org.za/publications/pub/ff/200408/momentum.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sairr.org.za/publications/pub/ff/200408/momentum.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> 203.51.118.211 20:46, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Paul, I removed the Flemish reference because of these reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As I understand it, Afrikaans is linguistically largely derived from the dialect of Zuid-Holland, which is a Netherlandic dialect</li>
<li>Flemish as such is either one of two Belgian Dutch dialects (East- and West-Flemish) or generally a umbrella name for the kind of standard Dutch used in Belgium. As far as I can see, the Southern Dutch (= Belgian) dialects had little to do with the development of Afrikaans, as long before Van Riebeecks foundation of Kaapstad the southern Dutch Provinces had split from the United Provinces, remaining under Spanish rule — another contributing factor for the current many small differences between Netherlandic and Belgian Dutch.</li>
<li>Except maybe for (geographically) fringe dialects such as Gronings or Limburgs, *all* bits of Dutch and Afrikaans are mutually understanding, and so singling out Flemish seemed random, especially considering points 1. and 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>I honestly thought the Flemish reference was trivial. But, of course, I should've discussed it first before deleting. <a href="../../../c/w/o/User%7ECwoyte_e24a.html" title="User:Cwoyte">Cwoyte</a> 11:58, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am an English-speaking former South African whose Afrikaans was never particularly fluent. However, having been to Amsterdam and to Bruges it seems to me Flemish (as spoken and written) is closer to Afrikaans than is Dutch. That there might be other variants of Dutch to which Afrikaans is even more similar I do not know. But I think Flemish is closer to Afrikaans than Dutch. You are right, Afrikaans speakers make themselves understood in Amsterdam, but I bet they find it easier in Bruges or Antwerp.</p>
<p>My knowledge of history is poor but remember that the Dutch have been in SA continuously since 1652. In that time there have been many changes in Europe. Belgium has only been an independent state since 1830 and it is only since 1820 that English speakers went to SA in any numbers. So I am not persuaded by your geopolitical argument.</p>
<p>But maybe I am wrong. Judge for yourself: <a href="http://www.rsg.co.za/" class="external text" title="http://www.rsg.co.za/" rel="nofollow">Afrikaans radio online</a></p>

<p>Believe me, I am Belgian, and I speak Dutch. <i>Flemish</i> is not a language, it is a word that refers to a collection of dialects. Flemish is not written any more than cockney is. And just between you and me, an English-speaking South-African who has visited Bruges is hardly a specialist. It is true that West-Flemish (one of the Flemish dialects) has some similarities to Afrikaans, but that can't be said for Brabants, or East-Flemish (two other Flemish dialects). And in Antwerp, they speak Brabants, in Bruges, they speak West-Flemis. The difference between the two dialects is overwhelming to say the least. If they can easily be understood in Bruges, they in fact SHOULDN'T be understood in Antwerp. --81.245.189.152 00:29, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<i>Where I spoke of Belgium, I meant "the territory that now is called Belgium but before that was called Austrian Netherlands (1713-1793) and Spanish Netherlands (1583-1713)" because it seemed less unwieldy. Belgium-in-that-sense has seen a separate development since the fall of Antwerp (1583), which means that, apart from Protestant refugees going north, there was no Belgian input in the settlement of the Cape. Having said that, the Belgians have clung to many words and idioms that Netherlandic speakers would consider old-fashioned (i.e. closer to the point where Netherlandic Dutch and Cape Dutch/Afrikaans separated), so I can see what you mean. <a href="../../../c/w/o/User%7ECwoyte_e24a.html" title="User:Cwoyte">Cwoyte</a> 07:40, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>Also you say you "Removed an alleged similarity to German that is not unique - informal Dutch has the same (meer a[l]s-constructie))". Yes, perhaps, I do not know if that is correct. <b>But</b> why delete the info? If it isn't unique remove the bit that says it is unique. If (on the other hand) the article doesn't say it is a unique similarity what is the problem? If you want to <b>add</b> the info that it is not a unique similarity then maybe you should. But why <b>remove</b> the info? <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 00:07, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>As it appeared to me, the "meer as" construction was roped in to show a similarity with German. Since it is not unique to German, but also common to colloquial Dutch (much to the exasperation of Dutch teachers, who for centuries have vainly tried to impose P.C. Hooft's arbitrary "meer dan" rule), its use (bringing in German as an influence on Afrikaans) had gone. And since it was established earlier that Dutch and Afrikaans share many features, it seemed superfluous to randomly mention one of those. But that's my interpretation. <a href="../../../c/w/o/User%7ECwoyte_e24a.html" title="User:Cwoyte">Cwoyte</a> 07:40, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>OK. Upon reflection I was wrong on the "meer as" point. I am trying to find out from where in Dutch-speaking Europe the settlers who became the Afrikaners came. Unless you have evidence to the contrary I think to say "not Belgium" may be premature. Listen to the Afrikaans radio station, you are in a position to judge as you are a Dutch speaker. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 09:11, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Regarding the sentence: "There are also similarities with German, in that 'more than' in Afrikaans is 'meer as', similar to 'mehr als' (literally 'more as') in German, whereas in Dutch this would be 'meer dan' ('more than')." that you erased: How sure are you that the "meer as" construction does not come from the German influence in Afrikaans (which I think that the sentence was actually referring to, not claiming that it was unique to those to two languages, for all we know something similar may exist in say, Danish, as well), rather than the (colloquial) Dutch one? Are you a linguist?</p>
<p><i>I do know for certain that through the ages, 'meer als' has been the preferred construction for Dutch speakers anywhere but on the written page, where it is 'meer dan'. In fact, the confusion between what's said at home and what's taught in school had led some people to say 'even groot dan' ('as big than') because they cannot tell the difference between equal and comparative anymore. I do think 'vulgar Dutch' should be considered as the basis for comparisons, not (just) standard Dutch, if only because when Afrikaans separated from Dutch, there was no such thing as a standard language, just a dozen or so dialects.</i> <i>I do not doubt the German influence on Afrikaans. I would very much like someone to devote a sentence or two to that influence. I can't do it myself because I know little of the German influence on Afrikaans. I do think, however, an unambiguous example should be used. German and Dutch are rather similar, and so there are lots of examples, the above included, which can't be exclusively attributed to either.</i></p>
<p>I guess I just also have a problem when somebody completely erases something in an article that is (in your own words) an interpretation - rather than a provable fact. If you have a problem with that specific example, may I suggest that you replace it with another one, and not just erase the whole paragraph, as the German influence on Afrikaans is a known fact and should be mentioned in such an article.</p>
<p><i>I have pointed out the problems with the current example, and also that German influences must be mentioned. It was in no way my intention to downplay the German influence, and if it appeared so, my apologies. It's just that I, a native Dutch speaker, found that this example wasn't clear-cut. I should, of course have asked if someone knew another, unambiguous example.</i></p>
<p>As a compromise, we could change the sentence to "in <i>standard</i> Dutch this would be", although in five years of living in The Netherlands I have certainly not heard anything other than "meer dan" used.</p>
<p><i>I think it's very important in comparative diachronic linguistics to have a clear view of what your sources are. Standard Dutch, especially</i> modern <i>standard Dutch, which from the mid-nineteenth century has seen wide distribution through the educational system, cannot entirely be considered a good comparison source. The Cape was settled by people who didn't much care for some literary person's arbitrary decision to use 'dan' instead of 'als' in unequal comparisons. Indeed, it wasn't until well into the nineteenth century that 'dan' finally won the battle for official use.</i> <i>I must say the circles you move in contain careful speakers of Dutch. Walk into a market, switch on the telly, you'll hear plenty examples of 'hun hebben' (similar to Afrikaans, btw), 'meer als', &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Another point: you mention "no Belgian input in the settlement of the Cape". Stipulated, the VOC was a Dutch company, and I suppose a large number of its employees were actually from the country that we currently call The Netherlands. However, that does not rule out that Belgians (including some of my own ancestors, by the way) actually came to and settled in South Africa under the auspices of the VOC, and may have influenced the language as well.</p>
<p>So, while there was no input by Belgium by a country as such, there was certainly an input by Belgians, So I find your comment to be incorrect.</p>
<p>(I realise that you do mention "refugees going north", but I don't agree that that necessarily follows, they may have just been ordinary employees/emmigrants, looking for a better life, like another of my ancestors - from Switzerland - who came to SA as an employee of the VOC and was certainly no refugee.)</p>

<p><i>Well, it would've been hard for Belgians (in the sense as mentioned earlier) to have anything to do with any of the emerging colonies after the fall of Antwerp. It</i> is <i>true that many thousands of Belgians fled north, and influenced the culture and dialects of the cities in Holland. But apart from them, I seriously doubt many Belgians found their way to the Cape. There was a war between Spain and the Republic until 1648, which left relations soured to the point of non-existence. Belgians would've been viewed with suspicion. But I'll say I'm no expert on Belgian history, and leave</i> this <i>bit of the discussion at that.</i> <a href="../../../c/w/o/User%7ECwoyte_e24a.html" title="User:Cwoyte">Cwoyte</a> 08:17, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>As speculation is rife may I suggest that protestant Belgians would flee North for the same reason as French Huguenots and that, as you suggest, that they might have been viewed with suspicion and "encouraged" to emigrate to the Cape. But I wish someone who knows (the facts) would get involved and that the editing of the article should NOT be influenced by speculation. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 13:52, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>I agree wholeheartedly. My knowledge of the 'Belgian' question as it arises from these discussions is too small and from that I withdraw hoping someone can shed more light on it. As for the German discussion, I hope someone can bring an unambiguously German influence to the text, as I believe the German language's influence</i> should <i>be credited. <a href="../../../c/w/o/User%7ECwoyte_e24a.html" title="User:Cwoyte">Cwoyte</a> 18:02, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>Belgians: the Dutch have been in SA continuously since 1652. Belgium has only been an independent state since 1830. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 07:56, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>(From a South African of mixed Boer-British ancestry- I use those terms specifically) Surely any consideration of German influence on Afrikaans should consider which form of German is meant? VOIC colonists from what is now North Germany, would have been speakers of Nedersaksisch/Plattdeutsch, NOT Hochdeutsch. The grammar would be very close to Dutch, especially in informal, slangy use; the vocabulary would be similar and the pronunciation also very close (no Second Germanic Sound Shift, etc.). Speakers of this language could have switched from speaking "German" to speaking "Dutch" without many changes in their actual speech. The boundaries between languages and dialects were probably considerably more blurred during the formative years of Afrikaans, and differences in the modern regional speeches in Europe are a very shaky basis for drawing conclusions. As regards the "meer als" versus "meer dan" debate- the standard form in Afrikaans is "meer as". That indicates that it was the most popular usage among the speakers of Afrikaans- the people who worked to formalise the language would not have chosen an obscure construction, especially one considered incorrect. The fact that Dutch was referenced as a standard for Afrikaans, which might have led to the adoption of "meer dan" in the case of conflicting usage, points this up even more strongly. (David Franklin 11:51 South African Standard Time, 29 Sep 2005)</p>
<p>Giving the percentage of German ancestry is anachronistic and not meaningful if it simply refers to people who came from what is today Germany, as Germany did not exist as a country during most of the formative years of Afrikaans. Such statistics are only meaningful if they refer to settlers who were ethnically German (ie German-speaking) because as David said above settlers from much of what is today northern Germany would have spoken a dialect more like modern Dutch than modern German. In fact saying that "N % of settlers were German" is misleading if it is anachronistic as it would suggest German could have had a much larger input into Afrikaans than it actually has.

<p>Afrikaans has only fairly recently been formalised. Spelling was only standardised in the 1930s. Dutch was the language of government in the Afrikaner republics, Dutch initially was one of two official languages of the Union of SA (1910 onwards) until supplanted in the 1930's. "ZA" is not the only anomaly in the ISO list: Cambodia is KH. And SA is the code for Saudi Adabia. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 21:38, 5 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>In Afrikaans "Afrikaans" and "Afrikaner" mean "African". Compare "Suid-Afrikaans(e)" = "South African" (adjective) and "Suid-Afrikaner" = "South African" (somebody from South Africa), or even "Amerikaner" = "American" and "Amerikaans(e)" = "American" (adjective). If the terms "Afrikaner" and "Afrikaans" were not used in their present meanings in Afrikaans it would have meant "African". The term "Afrikaan" is sometimes used in Afrikaans to mean "African" (somebody from Africa), but, indeed, it has a somewhat artificial feel. There is no single Afrikaans word for "African" and usually one elaborates, by for instance saying something like "mense in Afrika" ("people in Africa"). The adjective "Afrikaans(e)" can be used to refer to something from Africa if coupled with an orientation, for example "Wes-Afrikaanse olie" = "West African Oil" but, generally, "Afrikaans(e)" is not used to refer to Africa in general. Usually the noun "Afrika" will be coupled with the noun that needs to be described as "African", e.g. "Afrika-lande" = "African countries".</p>
<p>By the way, the term "Afrikaner" is not used as much in South Africa. Someone would rather be described as "Afrikaans" than as "an Afrikaner".</p>

<p>Would it be interesting to mention something in the sociolinguistics section about Afrikaans-speakers' relation to Dutch and vice versa? I believe that Dutch under the Apartheid regime was appreciated as a part of the Afrikaander cultural heritage, and that consequently Dutch was taught in secondary schools (I read that many Afrikaanders read Dutch children's books in the original version, like <i>Koning van Katoren</i> by <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Terlouw_3d61.html" title="Jan Terlouw">Jan Terlouw</a>) and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_RSA_34e1.html" title="Radio RSA">Radio RSA</a> (the South-African external service) prominently broadcast in Dutch. Obviously (or not?) this affection was increasingly refuted by the Dutch during the 60ies and 70ies and declined after the end of apartheid. I also heard that in the apartheid days, some Dutch modern literature was banned, like books by <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Wolkers_ae15.html" title="Jan Wolkers">Jan Wolkers</a>. How widely did people have acces to progressive literature, ideas through Dutch, and what was the government's attitude to this?</p>
<p>Perhaps also the changing role of Afrikaans literature (mostly poetry) within the Dutch literary world is worth mentioning (first: an expression of Dutch world influence, now: something that needs translation in order to be read, yet increasingly popular). As you will have gathered, I only have some notions of this, but I would like to encourage anybody who can write about this with some authority&#160;:)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Meer als / dan.</span></h2>
<p>Cwoyte states that for Dutch speakers everywhere, 'meer als' would be the preferred phrase, with 'meer dan' only used in written form. I strongly disagree. The phrase 'meer als' is incorrect and sounds uneducated. When I was in primary school, saying 'meer als' resulted in a friendly correction. Saying it twice would result in an angry correction, and after a the third offence you were made to stand in a corner for a while. I still cringe whenever I hear 'meer als'.</p>

One of them is the article <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_weak_verb.html" title="Germanic weak verb">Germanic weak verb</a>, where the conjugation of the Afrikaans verb needs to be added to the table.

This will require someone to go through the list of Afrikaans strong verbs at the end of a dictionary and find in each case which class they belong to - it will always be the same class as the Dutch cognate! - and list them.

<dd>Afrikaans has lost the strong verb, for example "he sang/has sung" is <i>hy het gesing</i> rather than the ancestral Dutch <i>hij heeft gezongen</i>. "We have left" is <i>ons het vertrek</i> rather than <i>wij waren vertrokken</i>. I will add the Afrikaans to the Germanic Weak Verb page. I think this illustrates very well how much more analytic Afrikaans is than Dutch, even more so than English. Booshank 12:01, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Bertus. I don't think it should list writers - there's already a separate <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Afrikaans-language_poets_724c.html" title="List of Afrikaans-language poets">List_of_Afrikaans-language_poets</a>. Will add a link in the article. There's probably also a need for a list of Afrikaans novelists, or other forms of writers - I suggest these be separate articles. I'm not sure of the relevance of mentioning that Afrikaans has a bible - I'm sure almost every language in the world has one. If the translation was particularly noteworthy (and I seem to remember it was, with the move from Dutch), perhaps something can go in the History section.

<dd>There is a difference: the Shaheed Minar ("Martyr's Monument") is dedicated to the people who were killed in 1952 by Pakistani police, while protesting for recognition of the Bangla language. Of course, it's intimately associated with Bangla history, language and culture, but it was not dedicated directly to the language itself.</dd>
<dd>By contrast, the Afrikaans language monument is specifically and primarily dedicated to language itself, and not to some wider culture. This is strongly evident in the monument's symbolism (various parts of it symbolize the various linguistic roots of Afrikaans), and the passionate poetic inscriptions, which concern themselves with the origin, growth, and future of the language, without regard to some wider idea of culture, nationality, ethnicity, or whatever. This, as far as i know, is what makes the monument unique.</dd>

<dd>I think the question that needs to be asked is: would this statement be misleading? I beleive that it is misleading to say that Taal Monument is the only monument to a language. The Shaheed Minar is seen as being a monument to the language as much as to those who died protesting about language rights. I'm sure the Taal Monument also has comes out of a political context, which it, perhaps, acknowledges in more subtle way. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 17:11, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Contrast this with the Taalmonument, which you cannot call anything <i>but</i> a "language monument" without being misleading.

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><i>Sounds Harsh</i></span></h2>
<p>I think the bit about Afrikaans being guttural and sounding harsher than Dutch and Flemish should be dropped or re-written in less potentially offensive terms. As an Afrikaans speaker, Dutch sounds much, much harsher to me than Afrikaans. I'm not so sure about guttural either - German sounds guttural to me, but not Afrikaans. So I think the problem is that the article might currently be describing what Afrikaans sounds like to (some) Europeans (or perhaps even just what they think it should sound like given its associations with boorishness, apartheid and so on). Apologies to Dutch and German speakers if this comment gave offence.</p>

<p>Dear editors, do comments like those about the esthetics and supposed sounds of a language as perceived by others belong in an encyclopedia article? Those are most likely to be highly subjective impressions, more than likely coloured by prejudices. My first impressions when I came to live in Holland 13 years ago, whas that the Dutch language sounded harsh and broad to my ears (e.g. the loud and flat, open 'a', and the gutteral 'ch' and 'r'. Compare for instance the Afr. 'skraap' or 'sker' with the Dutch 'schraap' and 'schaar'. Add to that the plethora of Dutch swear words using diseases like cancer (kankerkop), cholera(krijg de klere), tuberculosis(krijg te tering), typhoid (krijg de tifus),the pest(pesthekel), the pox (pokkewijf), etc. Added to a habit of speaking extremely directly and openly in a way which comes across to a foreigner as offensively confrontational, even ordinary speach seemed void of the politenesses I was taught as a child in South Africa. In contrast the Flemish dialects had for me the familiar softer tone and musicality I grew up with and a clearer and easier to understand pronounciation of the diphthongs, which sounded like the Afrikaans ones, in contrast to the very complex and 'whiny' sounding Dutch 'ui' 'ij' 'eu'. Also, I often hear people comment that Afrikaans is somehow 'Old Dutch', as if magically preserved in an ancient state. I usually respond that I can understand that impression, because Afrikaans uses many words that have fallen out of use in Dutch. But the reverse is also true, Dutch still uses many words that have fallen out of use in Afrikaans, and which sound endearlingly old fashioned when we hear them used. Afrikaans has not stood still since the 1652. It developed within its own framework of different influences on another continent by speakers of all races and backgrounds. Therefore both Dutch and Afrikaans stem from 17th century Dutch, but neither of them remained there. Interesting stuff. Keep up the good work of a free encyclopedia for all.

<p>I'm not trying to upset anyone here, but I don't think it's fair to say that the language issue was only a catalyst for the Soweto uprisings. I think it was an issue in itself. Afrikaans was (despite the fact that it is a predominantly Coloured language, that fact was never really celebrated until the 1990's) associated with the Apartheid regime (English was considered more neutral) and the Nat government. There was resentment towards Afrikaans as a symbol of oppression which is only dissipating recently. <a href="../../../j/o/z/User%7EJoziboy_398a.html" title="User:Joziboy">Joziboy</a> 4 March 2006, 22:28 (UTC)</p>
<p>--- I live in South Africa and am still learning Afrikaans. An Afrikaner is usually a rude term for an Afrikaans-speaking person or Afrikaans looking person (yes it is possible to 'look' Afrikaans, once you've lived here as long as we have you know) and is usually used in a downing way, such is the same with the term 'boer' which is usually used as an offensive slang due to the fact that many farmers (i.e-boers) treated their black or coloured workers very harshly during apartheid times!</p>

<dd>Zulu is not the most commonly understood language in South Africa. Zulu is the language with the highest number of mother-tongue speakers in South Africa. Xhosa is second, Afrikaans is third. But that's not the issue, is it? The question is not the number of mother-tongue speakers, but the number of speakers altogether. Unfortunately current South African census figures do not include second and third languages, but I'm under the impression that Afrikaans is most widely spoken (i.e. understood and spoken at conversational level by the largest number of South Africans). -- leuce 10:37, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That sounds ludicrous to me. Zulu is spoken in a relatively small area of the country, as are most tribal/native (whatever you want to call them, I'm not trying to be offensive) languages. What about Xhosa and S/N Sotho? They also have large tribal populations, and there are a myriad of smaller competing languages. Unfortunately, I don't think the SA Census tracks second language (the logical place to look for such data). Afrikaans and English used to be the only official languages. It seems logical to me that more people would speak them as everyone used to have a need to, whereas, for instance, Tshwana sure as hell didn't see a need to learn Zulu.

<dd>Agreed. I can't think of a case where i wouldn't translate an English "warm" to an Afrikaans "warm". (Not that they're exactly the same (the Afrikaans word roughly encompasses both English's "warm" and "hot"), but it's usually clear from context what kid of temperature is implied; if not, there are always modifiers like "louwarm" (lit. "lowwarm") and "brandwarm" (lit. "burnhot").) --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiet_Delport_08f7.html" title="User:Piet Delport">Piet Delport</a> 00:55, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">International view of Afrikaans</span></h2>
<p>Is this really appropriate for an encyclopaedia? Unfortunately it is rather common for speakers of one language to regard another language with contempt. I don't think that Afrikaans in a unique position; in my experience many English-speakers regard French, German, Arabic, Chinese and a whole list of languages as ugly or contemptible, mainly out of pure ignorance and/or prejudice. This seems rather like a hostile POV being smuggled in under cover of being a 'widespread opinion'.</p>
<p>I was just about to post on this. I think this section is pointless and inflammatory. It needs to be removed, or at least completely rewritten to present only factual data (which will be very difficult). Statements such as "Nevertheless, the language is sometimes regarded with contempt by Anglophone persons from a less-educated background, especially from South Africa." are completely inapproriate. Jsimkins 20:24, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also feel that this section requires a rewrite, but in the mean time I added a "citation required" tag to the line which reads "It is however more likely that the withdrawal was done for business reasons and not in support of Afrikaans", which to me seems like original research at best and an untrue statement at worse. If no citation is given to verify this I will remove that sentence. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumDude_37ba.html" title="User:SumDude">SumDude</a> 08:00, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Status of Afrikaans in relation to Dutch</span></h2>
<p>To avoid further conflict on this page with User:Ulritz, notorious for edit and unreferenced claims, allow me to explain the status of Afrikaans linguistically.</p>
<p>Afrikaans developed from the vernacular of <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_people.html" title="Dutch people">Dutchmen</a> and women who settled around the Cape of Good Hope. Over time the Dutch spoken there evolved into a new language: Afrikaans. In Dutch linguistics, as wel as Germanic linguistics, Afrikaans is treated as a semi-creole. With Dutch as the strong parent language. Unlike most creoles, Afrikaans has been thoroughly studied, has a standard form, is acknowledged, is taught in schools and is thé language of one of South Africas dominant ethnic groups but most importantly is very close (for a creole) to the parent language: <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>. Afrikaans is not a dialect of Dutch, nor is it a full creole but Afrikaans should be classified as it is now. Simply because Afrikaans did develop from 17th century New Dutch. <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">Rex</a> 21:36, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't have a strong personal opinion on the matter, but the current classification seems to go against other Wikipedia articles (<a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_languages.html" title="Germanic languages">Germanic languages</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Franconian_languages_63a6.html" title="Low Franconian languages">Low Franconian languages</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Template%7EGermanic_languages_8927.html" title="Template:Germanic languages">Template:Germanic languages</a>), which seem to consistently treat Afrikaans besides Dutch and its other dialects, rather than within them. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiet_Delport_08f7.html" title="User:Piet Delport">Piet Delport</a> 01:11, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suppose it is undisputed that Afrikaans derives from Early Modern Dutch. To be on the safe side, we could link to <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Dutch_3c54.html" title="Middle Dutch">Middle Dutch</a> in the genealogy box. I <i>imagine</i> Ulritz wants to argue that Afrikaans arose by Creolisation rather than 'regular' language change, which would mean that it has <i>several</i> ancestors, not just Dutch. We would need a citation arguing for creole status of Afrikaans. If we did have such a citation, the genealogy box would still progress from Low Franconian to Middle Dutch, but an additional "by creolisation" could be added in a footnote. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:46, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, I see, I am sorry, the box doesn't say "genealogy", it says "language family", and of course Middle Dutch is the <i>ancestor</i> of Afrikaans, not its language family. The question is then, "is Afrikaans considered 'a Dutch language' or 'a Dutch dialect'?". Seeing <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Franconian_840d.html" title="Low Franconian">Low Franconian</a>, this is not the case. The "Low Franconian family" <i>consists</i> of Dutch dialects and Afrikaans. If Afrikaans <i>were</i> considered a dialect of Dutch, "modern Low Franconian" would just be equivalent to "Dutch". It is undisputed that Afrikaans is very <i>closely related</i> to Dutch, which however itself implies that Afrikaans is not, itself, Dutch. Thus I am afraid I'll have to agree with Ulritz here. But I do deplore that Ulritz appears to be unable to argue his own case on talkpages like a civilized Wikipedian&#160;:( <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:52, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Afrikaans derives from New Dutch, not <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Dutch_3c54.html" title="Middle Dutch">Middle Dutch</a>. The Dutch settled the area around 1650, 150 years after Middle Dutch. Because of its semi-Creole status, the current is the best classification. On wikipedia it is customary to describe the linguistic classification of Creoles as like with <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tok_Pisin_54f4.html" title="Tok Pisin">Tok Pisin</a> which simply says "<i>English-based Creole</i>" in the current classification we use a kind of <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid.html" title="Hybrid">hybrid</a> between a regular and a Creole classification.<a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">Rex</a> 12:21, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Like I said Afrikaans is a semi-creole, it's special, not a "regular" language like Dutch or English. 15:51, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>yes, Afrikaans derives from (early) Modern Dutch. If we're going to draw a tree, it will look as above. But the infobox isn't about trees, it is about <i>language families</i>, and Dutch isn't a language family, in the sense that Afrikaans isn't considered "a Dutch language". As I said, I don't think this is a big deal either way, but it is less confusing to <i>not</i> list Afrikaans as "a Dutch language" in the infobox. Of course, people who actually read the article will learn what we agree on here, namely that Afrikaans historically derives from Early Modern Dutch. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 16:26, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I should have paid attention to this earlier. The reasons for Johan Rupert withdrawing his ad is shrouded in mystery. Just on the face of it, it is at least an attempt to influence editorial policy. Personally I believe that the entire reference to it should be removed. If it stays allowance should be made for a different interpretation of the actions. Just because Johann Rupert says he did for the love of Afrikaans doesn't mean it is the real reason. This should rather be added to his Wikipedia entry</dd>

<p>English too is a semi-creole: it was fully Germanic (with a few foreign borrowings) only until 1066 A.D., when French became the official language of government, the courts, and the nobility. Under a couple centuries of that influence, English not only replaced a large percentage of its native words with French words, but shifted its grammar to a more Middle-French word order and semantics. Nonetheless, English is still classified as a West-Germanic language, and so is Afrikaans. (Linguists classify Afrikaans and Dutch as equal members of the Low Franconian sub-branch of West-Germanic, regardless of their origins.) I suggest you take a look at Ethnologue to settle these kinds of arguments, since the folks there have already done the research. <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90434" class="external free" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90434" rel="nofollow">http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90434</a> LMP-UCLA 00:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Surely the term "semi-creole" is not particularly useful. Creole languages by definition arise from pidgins where the normal descent of language from one generation to the next is broken. Few argue that this ever happened in the development of Afrikaans. Instead it is argued that long-extinct Dutch-based creoles influenced the language in its early development. I would argue that either a language is clearly a creole (eg. Tok Pisin) or simply one with a larger degree of influence from other languages (eg English and Afrikaans - Afrikaans in case retains far more of its Germanic content than English, with far fewer French/Latinate influences). To me "semi-creole" is contraditory, either something is a creole or it is not a creole. If we take the opposite view then just about all languages would be "semi-creole" to a greater or lesser extent. Booshank 18:14, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

It seemed as if the paragraph was stating that english speaking persons in particular have a problem with the Afrikaans language. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliwalla_253d.html" title="User:Aliwalla">Aliwalla</a> 09:57, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">External links</span></h2>
<p>Just cleaned up the external links a bit, but I'd like to see one that goes directly to a tv broadcast. Personally I find myself most interested in a language when I can actually see people speaking it to each other. There's a video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lKnY8Pyv20" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lKnY8Pyv20" rel="nofollow">here</a> that's a good example, but it's a bit old. Anybody know one better? Just a five-minute video of people talking to each other in clear Afrikaans would be fine, and without the need for Windows Media Player or Real Player or anything else. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMithridates_47c8.html" title="User:Mithridates">Mithridates</a> 10:05, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The section on Orthography might be clearer on whether the alphabet used in Afrikaans is the same as the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_alphabet.html" title="Dutch alphabet">Dutch alphabet</a>. One would assume so, but what about the ij digraph? I doubt a whole article would be necessary on the subject, but perhaps a sentence or two with link to the Dutch alphabet article. --<a href="../../../a/1/2/User%7EA12n_b0f6.html" title="User:A12n">A12n</a> 04:02, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Afrikaans alphabet is exactly the same as the English one. All other "characters" or whatever are actually normal letters with punctuation. It also does not recognise digraphs in the alphabet, but counts the letters contained within them separately. <b><font face="MS Reference Sans Serif" color="#FF0000">► <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdriaan90_c198.html" title="User:Adriaan90">Adriaan90</a> ( <a href="../../../a/d/r/User_talk%7EAdriaan90_05bd.html" title="User talk:Adriaan90">Talk</a> ♥ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adriaan90_3a39.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adriaan90">Contribs</a> ) ♪♫</font></b> 18:24, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Afrikaans in Namibia</span></h2>
<p>The Afrikaans article needs more information about the use / history of the language in Namibia. The following web link and book reference may be appropriate to include in an updated version of the page. Crucially through the work of Stal and Ponelis the history of Afrikaans goes back almost 350 years, not to the mid / late 19th Century that many still assume was the case.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Double negative</span></h2>
<p>Someone has recently added the assertion that the double negative in Afrikaans originates in Middle Dutch. However, I do do not believe that there is any general agreement on where the double negative originates. French and Hottentot origins have also been suggested. This article used to state this, but now presents the theory of a Dutch origin as a generally agreed fact when I do not believe it is. Booshank 18:16, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A lot of things were said to "come from French" in the earlier days of research into the origins of Afrikaans. The double negative is one of them. I agree that there is no agreement, and perhaps both should be mentioned. -- leuce 10:30, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">African?</span></h2>
<p>A simple question which maybe difficult to answer: Is Afrikaans an African language? <a href="../../../a/a/k/User%7EAaker_43ac.html" title="User:Aaker">Aaker</a> 16:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hehe&#160;:) It's generally considered to be, though some disagree, as it formed in Africa, and is only really spoken in Africa.<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenman_c61e.html" title="User:Greenman">Greenman</a> 11:53, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes and no, depending on what you want to say. Is Indogermanic a European or an Asian language? Is English a European or a North American language? Let's face it... Afrikaans didn't originate in Europe and it has never been spoken in larger numbers in Europe than it was spoken in Africa. But if someone says "African language", they might mean to include Afrikaans, or not, and there's no scientific way to pin it down. When Thabo Mbeki says "African language", he probably excludes Afrikaans; when Kortbroek says it, he probably includes it. So, first define "African language", "European lanuage", "North American language" etc, and wel'll continue this discussion. -- leuce 10:28, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Norwegian language</span></h2>
<p>I don't think Norwegian merits a separate section here, as it really isn't any more similar to Afrikaans than Swedish or Danish, and as many of the similar words aren't "genealogically related", but borrowings or calques from <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Low_German_6738.html" title="Middle Low German">Middle Low German</a> during the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanseatic_League_7714.html" title="Hanseatic League">Hanseatic League</a> trade. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 14:57, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the words are remotely similar, then I'd say keep it, if only for interest sake, even if it aint linguistically "valid" to make the comparison. It does no harm to keep it. If you're concerned that readers may become confused because Norwegian isn't related to Afrikaans, why not indicate that in the headings of the columns (something like "Not West Germanic"). -- leuce 10:21, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
