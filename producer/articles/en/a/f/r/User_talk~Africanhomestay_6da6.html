	    <p>African cultural home living is a specially designed program that gives you an opportunity to live with an African family. The program is ideal for those visiting Africa for a period of between 1 week to 3 months but don’t want to spend a lot on expensive food and hotel accommodation. You will be accommodated in African homes either in the cities or in the countryside depending on your choice. You will be under no obligation to help your host with any work but you will be free to lend a hand in any kind of work that you would personally like to help in.However,you are encouraged to do voluntary work in the community.</p>
<p>Africa has a diverse rich culture, made from the customs, traditions and practices .While you will be visiting the continent, you will have a chance to live with a family and interact with the people from these different tribes and experience the richness of their culture.</p>
<p>Before your date of arrival in Africa we will arrange for a family to host you for the period you will be staying in the continent.

<p>On your arrival date</p>
<p>On the date of your arrival , we will pick you from the airport and drive you to the home of your host. If the family will prefer it, they will themselves pick you from the airport. You will come into the continent on a tourist visa. Before your departure from your country, please make sure that you have the necessary insurance cover for the period of your stay in Africa.</p>
<p>About your security</p>
<p>When finding you a family to host you, security consideration will be of paramount importance .However, you will be required to observe some basic family rules, like the latest time you can come into the house. This is for the sake of your security and the security of the family too.</p>
<p>About Tours and Excursions</p>
<p>We will help you arrange for tours and excursions to game parks, museums and other sceneries that you would like to visit.</p>
<p>Keeping in contact</p>
<p>On your arrival , we shall give you a cell phone that you need to keep connected all the time. You are required to use the phone to keep in contact with us and the host family.

<p>Should you feel uncomfortable with your stay in your host’s house, you are required to inform us immediately so that we can change the host for you. If need be, we will immediately move you to a guesthouse or hotel before we find you another family to host you.</p>
<p>How much it will cost you</p>
<p>While you live with the host family, you will be required to each week give the family a small amount as your contribution for food and accommodation. The amount of your weekly contribution will depend on where your host family lives but will not exceed US $75.

<p>There is a site,http//www.africanmatters.net, where anyone with interest in Africa can write news,views,stories and other items to promote the"Africa Matters' theme. It is a project of <a href="http://www.africanhomestay.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.africanhomestay.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.africanhomestay.net/</a> that allows internet users to submit materials for publication at anytime from anywhere in or out of Africa. Materials submitted are not censored or re-written .The site focusses on the many cases of struggles against odds to survive in the face of despair,the hospitality of the African people and development opportunities around the continent. Bearing in mind that most of the international media report on African wars,famine,disease,poverty,despair,hopelessness and dejection; users are asked to tell stories of achievement and hope-stories of triumph and victory of African spirit. Basically,the site provides news,information and analysis for everyone interested in Africa. This is a clear forum for Africans to tell their story and uplift images of Africa because Africa Matters,isn't it?</p>

<p>My stay with Japanese people in 1994 courtesy of the Japanese government enabled me to conclude that the Japanese culture and African way of life have several things in common.</p>
<p>After exchanging cultural views with the Japanese during my home-stay with Kunimi Sakamoto's family and aboard the Nippon Maru Ship for World Youth for 45 days, I found that Japanese and African cultures compare well. Despite the fact that there exist over 200 ethnic groupings in Africa with cultural and linguistic differences, one can still talk of an African traditional culture.</p>
<p>African and Japanese ancient histories show that hunting wild animals with bows and arrows and gathering wild fruits and vegetables were practised in both societies. African history records the Dorobo of Kenya and the Hottento of South Africa as hunter-gatherer communities. There existed traditional metalworking, tanning, canoe-making and weaving industries. The use of stone implements, production of earthenware containers for cooking and food storage was part of African and Japanese society.</p>
<p>The two socieites were organized into kingdoms or fiefdoms and civil rivalry was evident. African kingdoms had clashes just like those of the Minamoto and Taira. The Maasai believed that all cows belonged to them, so they fought and stole cattle from other societies. African religions, like Shinto, had their roots in animistic beliefs, with local temples for household and local guardian gods. Africans worshipped the gods of their ancestors much like the Japanese, by making offerings, animal sacrifices and prayers.</p>
<p>African and Japanese festivals are both linked to agricultural production. Prayers are held for good harvests and thanksgiving made for good yields. Dances, music and games were staged during festivals and new produce was offered to the gods. African music and dance was informative, educational and entertaining. Wrestling, like sumo, was very popular in Nigeria as a way of choosing leaders or winning brides and personal pride. A wrestler was expected to be a "cat" whose back never touched the ground. Games started with rituals as a sign of purification and blessing, like the salt thrown in the dohyo. The music of stringed instruments, drums and bamboo flutes accompanied the events. Folk songs were classified according to situation and function. Local brews like saké were part of the meals during festivals and ceremonies. One needed to master ceremony rituals, as is the case with the tea ceremony. Raw and cooked foods were eaten. Thanks were given to the ancestors and the host before and after meals.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
African traditional houses were made of mud and wood with thatched roofs. Materials were fitted together using ropes and bark. Africans used mats for sleeping and sitting on. There were no beds, although some communities like the Turkana of Kenya sat on small stools made of wood. Painting on walls and floors conveyed certain ideas. Skins from animals were used as clothes, tied in a unique way like the obi ties a kimono. Skin slippers like zori were used on rough ground and in the bush.</p>
<p>Certain plants and animals, in the African context, had special meanings. The owl was seen as a sign of misfortune and bad luck or death. Some trees were believed to be the homes of evil spirits, like the loquat tree in Japan. The hare was shown as clever and mischieveous; the elephant as stupid and the hyena as arrogant and stubborn.</p>
<p>Apart from being kind and humanistic, Japanese and most African languages have similar forms and structures. Some words like the exclamation "ee!" have the same meaning in Japanese and Kiswahili. Kiswahili, spoken in East Africa, is one of the most widely spoken African languages and is used in international media, including Radio Japan. Words with similar pronunciation but different meanings are used in both languages, "juu", "kata" and "mimi". The use of "yes" and "no" is similarly ambiguous in Kiswahili and Japanese; communication is indirect and proves confusing for non-native speakers.</p>
<p>The family as the basic unit of society is the same in Japan as in Africa. Traditional Japanese and Africans lived in extended families with relationships ruled by a rigid heirarchical system with strong parental authority. Fathers were respected as the head of the family, and married women were expected to respect their parents-in-law. Displays of affection like kissing and embracing were not made in public. The division of labour was gender-based, women were tied to the household and gathering chores and were never regarded as equal to men.</p>
<p>Although Western culture has invaded both our societies, our cultures remain similar.</p>

<p>I believe in hope for Africa to eradicate poverty and raise the general prosperity of the continent in ten years,just like it happened in India and China(with a combined population of 600 million). This can be achieved by investing in Africa so that investment becomes profitable and sustainable to generate further investment. Business in Africa must be pro-poor and pro-consumer,like my African Homestay pro-poor tourism enterprise.African business must not exploit the poor but must create the basis for the poor to come out of poverty.Africa needs to develop products and services that are affordable to Africans by using technology that reduces the cost of production,like use of solar energy. Business in Africa needs to be pro-development with emphasis on human capacity development.Africa needs investment in education and skills(especially information technology) transfer We need African business to be about partnerships with skills, companies, governments and communities. Africa has all the natural and human tools to overcome poverty-our natural and human resources.</p>

<p>I was born in Kisii District, 300 Kilometres west of Nairobi, Kenya’s Capital City, some 80 Kilometres south east of Lake Victoria, Africa’s largest Lake.</p>
<p>The Kisii tribespeople keep their culture intact and sometimes in secret; changing only when they want to. To become adults Kisii boys are initiated. This means they must be circumcised at age 10.</p>
<p>The ritual marked my entry into adult life. Therefore, before circumcision I was still a child; there is no respect for the uncircumcised.</p>
<p>Among the Kisii, initiation takes place towards the end of the year. Thousands of boys of my age are circumcised. The kids don’t refuse once their parents decide that they must undergo the rite of passage.</p>
<p>Circumcisors do booming business; circumcising up to one hundred kids per session - charging close to three Dollars a kid. There are mobile circumcisors who charge even less. Fortunately, the Kisii people don’t practice traditional circumcision where circumcisors used one knife for any number of boys. Nowadays, hospital support staff, who use hospital operation materials, are the ones in this business.</p>
<p>What I experienced during my circumcision last year is far more than a cut of the flesh - removal of the foreskin. It was a ritual preceded by 3 weeks of education and training on a whole variety of societal rules.</p>
<p>This kind of training and education was being reinforced by a lot of torture and seclucion. -I suffered a lot of aggression. As soon as schools closed last November, I had to basically do a lot of preparations for my ceremony. I had to look for firewood from the forest and fetch enough water for cooking.</p>
<p>On the eve of circumcision day, a lot of people gathered at our home for the night ceremony. For me there was nothing to celebrate. I was isolated in a small hut full of men and boys older than me. This is where the ritual hazing to prove my manhood took place.</p>
<p>For close to five hours I was being taught to be muscline and stronger to face physical challenges. This training was done with a lot of drama, physical and psychological impact, without challenging anything.</p>
<p>These men carried out a mock circumcision operation on men. They forced me to remove all my clothes. One of them got hold of the foreskin and tried to cut it using a blunt sword. I suffered a little bruising.</p>
<p>Then they dug a small hole on the floor of the house and forced me to demonstrate to them how my parents made love. I did not know what to do and this annoyed them and they beat thoroughly. They forced me to name all my girlfriends and when I refused to they poured very cold water on me and forced me to lie down on the cold muddy floor for one hour as they abused and called me names. They even laughed at my body structure, the size of my manhood and even forced me into erection!</p>
<p>I was in a very difficult and unfriendly situation as this was a very vigorous stage of hazing.</p>
<p>I was not supposed to show fear or pain but brave the sexual stimulation and humiliation. To show fear or pain is to humiliate myself forever in the community. During the ordeal, I could hear my parents and other merrymakers in the compound sing ululate in dance.</p>
<p>At midnight I was permitted to sleep. I staggered to bed and fell into the deepest sleep ever, only to be forced out of bed at four in the morning. Cold water was poured on me (still naked) and young boys led me to the circumcisor. I walked for about two kilometers and at the site I was forced to lie (face down) on tall dewy grass while queuing for the operation. I was restrained from raising my head up to see whatever was going on and I saw nothing for 1 hour until when I was led and laid on the circumcisor’s table. My eyes were blocked from seeing how the foreskin was cut.</p>
<p>Fortunately my operation was not done with quick strokes of a sharp knife. It was done with surgical scissors and bleeding vessels were tied with a gauze bandage after application of antiseptic powder.</p>
<p>I was hidden away from the joyous crowd while walking home into my seclusion hut to recover from the ordeal. In my hut, my parents, my aunts and uncles were forbidden to see me. Food and drinks were brought outside my room for my attendant (only 2 years older that me) to pick into the room.</p>
<p>I was not expected to bathe during my seclusion period of 3 weeks. I was smeared with ash, never combed my hair and never brushed my teeth and remained half-naked (with my shirt only). It is during this time that older boys taught me practical values like men don’t cry like women,, being brave, aggressive and demanding towards women (ever wondered why husbands beat their wives?).</p>
<p>To test my physical endurance and bravery, I was forced to rub my hands and underparts of my body against stinging leaves to show that I can stand the pain. I even picked sticks from the burning fire using my mouth. To check whether I had healed, young beautiful girls were brought into the hut and played with my manhood into erection. My attendant checked for any cracks and bleeding and found none and therefore qualified to end my seclusion. Early in the morning on the day I ended my seclusion, my attendant took me to the river where I took a bath and back at home for shaving and dressing up. Then I was presented to the whole family as adult man. Now as an adult man, I wonder why circumcision is the only way of eloquently learning to be a man. Is the cut of the foreskin any necessary? If it is, why was I not consulted in decision making involving the removal of part of my body? Why is everybody against female genital mutilation and not male genital mutilation and its related rituals?</p>
<pre>
Circumcision is wrong when undertaken on a child who can’t make a choice. Principles of mental and physical health together with the integrity of the body and privacy are fundamental in the human rights charter
