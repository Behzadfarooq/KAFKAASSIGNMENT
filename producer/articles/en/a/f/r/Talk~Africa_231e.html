<li>Demographics section: <s>no other continent page gives attention to skin color for its own sake.</s> Possible subtle racism and may just need to be removed.

UPDATE: Section severely cut down and renamed following the movement for the short segment on religion to the appropriate section. Also added comment on significance of skin color. Still an unusual amount of discussion about race for a continent article.</li>
<li><b>History section: this section is pitifully short for the continent that's considered the cradle of civilization. Also, almost nothing is mentioned about the civilizations that called Africa home before the rise of colonialism. There is a separate History of Africa article, but the main article could use at least a little more detail. The fact that the real discussion of Africa's history begins with colonialism (again, utterly neglecting the peoples that had lived there for thousands of years before)seems awfully eurocentric.</b>* Geography section: should discuss such topics as climate, soils, and drainage. An accurate count of countries is needed; already stated numbers vary radically. Should mention major geographic features (sahara desert, great rift valley, mountain ranges)</li>

<p>The section on Colonialism is very inadequate. No sources are cited. I recommend that the following be added:</p>
<p>To speak of the "scramble for Africa" is to begin a debate centuries old. In the words of Robert Collins, "The explanations [for the colonization of Africa] are nearly as unsatisfactory as they are numerous. The misconceptions are as enduring as they are erroneous. To scholar and student alike, the search for understanding this dynamic period, which resulted in European colonial rule in Africa and dramatically altered the future of a vast continent, is the Problem of the Partition of Africa."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>By 1870, many European nations were interested in the African interior, and began moving up the rivers. Generally, except for a few cases, foreign powers could not move beyond "small coastal enclaves."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> But from the years of 1880-1900, the European <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperial</a> powers engaged in a major <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scramble_for_Africa_83c3.html" title="Scramble for Africa">territorial scramble</a> and occupied most of the continent, creating many <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony.html" title="Colony">colonial</a> nation states, and leaving only two independent nations: <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberia.html" title="Liberia">Liberia</a>, an independent state partly settled by <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African Americans</a>; and <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church_1c2e.html" title="Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church">Orthodox Christian</a> <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopia.html" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> (known to Europeans as "Abyssinia"). Colonial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, when all colonial states gradually obtained formal independence.</p>
<p>The scramble came from the rising of a new world from old Europe. Until this point, Britain had been the undisputed leader in the industrial realm. They could produce more manufactured goods than any other country, and at the lowest price. Britain promoted the idea of "free trade" in Africa, the idea that no European countries would interfere with one another while freely trading in Africa. Britain had no worries until the 1860's when "France, Germany, and the United States had caught up with Britain in terms of industrial technology and manufacturing."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a result of this industrialization of the world, there was a shortage of markets to sell to. many European countries, as a result, looked to Africa as a potential client. Some believed when diamonds were discovered in 1869 they "provided the incentive and capital for a large influx of Europeans."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> The creation of the Suez Canal "not only made the East African coast more accessible but also became the great pivot in British imperial strategy."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Above all else, we must look at this imperial world pragmatically and not ideologically. Until this point, "military and political relations between Africans and Europeans concludes that Africans controlled the nature of their interactions with Europe. Europeans did not possess the military power to force Africans in any type of trade in which their leaders did not wish to engage."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>But a new world, as noted above, had begun. Because of new competition in the trading industries of Europe and the Americas, Britain now had rivals for trade in Africa. Even smaller countries sometimes wanted to get involved looking for quick cash and to find ways to sustain their countries. Within the hubris of the European nations was the ideal of "national prestige," an idea that holding African colonies would increase the power of a nation.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> New technology as well in the form of the "repeater rifle" and the "maxim-gun" gave Europeans new advantages over Africa. There had been trade of guns with Africa before this era, but as Hilaire Belloc put it:</p>
<p>Whatever happens we have got</p>
<p>The Maxim gun; and they have not.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>But the main question that we must decide is how the partition of Africa began. What was the primary catalyst for "the scramble?" Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher argue that the British occupation of Egypt began the process.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> Robinson and Gallagher refer to an old "gentlemens agreement," cited above as Britain's policy of "free trade," that essentially all the European powers would stay out of each others way. When the British invaded Egypt the broke this agreement, and "France came out in open oppostion to the new regime in Egypt toward the end of 1882."<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Others trace the origins back to the French, who made plans to crate a railway from Dakar to their holdings in Senegal. The British responded to these French claims by recognizing Portugal, and their claims to parts of Angola and the Congo. With a series of complicated alliances being created, France and Germany looked to one another to stand against the British. Germany, not wanting to be left out, laid claims to Togo, Kamerun, and South West Africa.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<dl>
<dd>"The main question that we must decide"&#160;??? What kind of writing is this? Sounds like something from the 1911 Encyclopedia, writing in the "royal we" no less... I think the whole section needs some work and may be better suited to a subarticle, since we don't want half of this article to be a discussion on things like the Maxim gun. This is supposed to be a generalized and brief discussion of Africa concentrating on the highlights of African civilization, not devoted to the political manouvering by European powers. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 23:53, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, I'd like to thank Mister Stephen Colbert for including Wikipedia on his most recent July 31, 2006 episode of his hit TV news show, the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colbert_Report_e7c8.html" title="Colbert Report">Colbert Report</a>. However, he also mentioned its downsides - such as its editability and suceptability to malicious vandalism.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and did I mention - he reccomended that every single memeber of the audience log on to Wikipedia and edit the Africa article to say the elephant popu;ation had tripled.</p>
<p>Probably something to look out for.</p>

<p>He actually mentioned no good side of wikipedia. The Colbert Report is a parody, and Stephen Colbert plays a character on the show.

<p>I don't know why they chose an article for the Article Improvement Drive that can't be edited by unregistered users.....stupid vandals.&#160;;(. Anyway, these are some things which registered users can do to improve the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geography: ".....one of the three great southward projections....." I don't know why, but that just doesn't sound good. It sounds like it was written from the point of view of someone who lives in the Northern Hemisphere, and Wikipedia is a worldwide institution.</li>
<li>History: This has been mentioned before, but Africa HAD A HISTORY BEFORE COLONIALISM!!!!! What about Ancient Egypt? What about the Zulu Nation, and the other alliances which formed as a result of it? I mean, come on, if Africa is the place where human civilization began, then why does its history only start in the 1400's with European exploration? And there's no mention of slavery, even though the article is eurocentric. If they removed the vandalism protection thing, then I could do a lot of this stuff.</li>
<li>Modern History: There are vague references to civil war and corruption, but there needs to be specific examples, like Rwanda and, more recently, the Sudan. And the apartheid, which is vital but is not included.</li>
<li>Culture: A pitifully small section for a continent with so many cultures. Mention the main ones and some of their features. Also, the last paragraph is on music, which should be included in the music section.</li>
<li>Demographics: Still too much emphasis on skin color. It's really not all that important. Take it out. Entirely.</li>
<li>Language: The language map says that Afrikaans is the main language of South Africa, and Xhosa is the main language of the area northeast of it. In fact, Zulu is more widely spoken than Afrikaans in South Africa, and Xhosa is largely present in this country as well. You can see that just by reading the "South Africa" article right here on Wikipedia. There are probably other errors, too, that I didn't recognize. Africa has about a hundred languages -- do you really want to put only fifteen or so on the map?</li>

<p>Give me some feedback on these suggestions, adding and subtracting as needed. --Ellie</p>

<p>I agree with Ellie. A lot has to be done on this article. It is very unsatisfactory in it's present form. But maybe initially this should only be a portal linking to other articles. When the more specific articles have ripened into good articles, one can try to summarize them to give some flesh to the Africa article. I suggest we start with the more specific articles. For example, I am currently working on the African Music and African Dance articles and I am planning some even more specific things like e.g. an article about Amadinda music from Uganda. Only after the main articles have become really good can the Africa article become really good. It is far too early to try to bring this article to featured article status. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENannus_11ce.html" title="User:Nannus">Nannus</a> 21:54, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm 25 miles from the nearest really big library, so do Africa by Evans Lewin and Merriam Webster's Geographical Dictionary really state those longitudes and latitudes, or just the approximate measurements across the continent? I looked at satellite images at <a href="http://www.Terraserver.com" class="external free" title="http://www.Terraserver.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Terraserver.com</a> and I get 37°21' N, 34°50'0" S, 17°31'46" W and 51°24'55" E. I confirmed this on Google Maps - I couldn't get Google Maps to register latitude and longitude directly, but if you zoom in on something and it doesn't move then you're in the right place. So if we correct the latitude and longitudes, do we keep the references, or am I missing something? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 21:25, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fair enough. Remember tho that the white workforce is still the most skilled part of the SA workforce, as a result of deliberate discrimination through law and education during the Apartheid years. This will no doubt not be true in the future as the effects of Apartheid are rolled back.</p>
<p>Or, more realistically, "South Africa" will slide into third-world anarchy and chaos, as "deliberate discrimination" is "rolled back". I love the way people on this site spout the Marxist propaganda, without having any idea what the truth of the matter is.</p>

<p>You make good points. Yes colonialism can be very harmful, but it by itself is not a direct cause of poverty. United States, Ireland and Hong Kong were all colonies and yet they are not in poverty. In many cases colonialism brings with it new technology, better education, and bureaucracy. If you would like to add specific instances of colonialism in Africa causing poverty then go ahead and add them, but colonialism in general does not result in poverty. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayson_Virissimo_02c4.html" title="User:Jayson Virissimo">Jayson Virissimo</a> 22:10, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Colonialism gave backwards 3rd world countries a chance to catch up with the rest of the world. Whether that chance is utilized (as was the case in Asia), or not (as is the case in Africa), is up to the natives, and their brain capacity...</p>

<p>I recently added a good deal of info to the history section. When supplying dates I used BCE rather than BC, shortly thereafter another individual came through and changed them all to BC. I'm curious as to whether there is a standardized practice for this. The use of BCE has become dominant in academic fields over the last couple of decades and now is by far more common in any academic texts, while BC is still common among more public texts. However, given the association of BC to Christianithy it seems to have at least some minor POV issues (though very small, I admit), which is why BCE was adopted by academics in the first place. I'd like a consensus as to which is more appropriate; I prefer BCE but if the majority of people don't I'm fine with that. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 17:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. you must be new here... There is no single thing that has been more disputed on wikipedia, to the tune of hundreds of Megabytes and scores of talk page archives. THe people who claim like you do that BCE is "dominant" are a slight minority, while the other 55-60% in every poll ever taken here claim that this is PC nonsense being pushed by a vocal minority. The only compromise that has been adopted across the board is that both are officially acceptable, but articles that are written in one style should be consistent and not be changed to the other, or vice versa. (Unless there is no objection to do so on a specific article). This article was already a BC article, so under the terms of the "ceasefire" (about a year and ahalf ago this was proking massive edit wars all over the place that we don't want to flare up again) this is a "BC article" and will remain so unless everyone should agree to change it. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 18:06, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm new to editing history articles. I'm fine with whatever decision there has been, but BCE is common in academic texts; if you pick up a modern history, anthropology or archaeology text or journal it's quite likely to be used in it. Don't want to re-ignite an old argument, though, so I'll stick with what has previously been decided. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 22:36, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I want to question Codex's edit to the sentence about the Sahara undergoing increased desertification circa 4000 BCE and get some consensus. It's a small edit, so I don't want to make a big deal about it and I really don't want to be nuisance, but I'm not understanding how this 'violated NPOV.' Saying that the Sahara region began to dry up is no different from articles saying that the So and So River changed course or agriculture began to take place at a particular time in history. It's just as valid as any other historical view regarding a particular change in climate and I don't see how this, more than anything else in any history section, pushes a certain POV (especially with a view that is so widely held in anthropology, history and geography: one can find numberous sources regarding this; in fact that statement was already there when I started editing last night, I just added a citation because I had a source that discussed it, with a minor change in date [4500 BCE to 4000 BCE]). The idea of an in-text citation, which is also there, is so that one can cite without 'dirtying' the article with stating what source makes this claim and this statement already has a citation, it doesn't need a second one written in prose. This statement is no more POV than any other single premise in any historical article on Wikipedia including this one, yet we don't require more than an in-text citation for these other premises. If you still have a problem with it, could we say something along the lines of "It is believed that the Sahara began to dry and undergo an increased speek of desertification in 4000 BCE?" I'd just like to know what the reason is for asserting that this one sentence is more POV than any others in the history section, thus necessitating the inclusion of "According to the Oxford Atlas of World History..." (As a note, this particular historical atlas is pretty much the best in the field) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 22:43, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason my edit was NPOV is because, if you're going to cite a source that authoritatively states that such and such happened in the year 4000 BC - a year for which there are absolutely no records whatsoever - without even offering the slightest explanation of how they came about this knowledge, or at least presumed to - then it's far better not to make a bald statement of fact that such and such happened in the year 4000 BC, but rather state that "according to source xyz, such and such happened in the year 4000 BC". I don't care how good you think the source is. Many people do not simply accept everything they are told to, without being told any reason why. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 02:25, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no mention of the Arab slave trade in East Africa which is estimated to have enslaved as many black Africans as the slave trade in Western Africa. No mention whatsoever of the Islamic Jihad that swept over Africa, and the hardships suffered by the indigenous Africans. Over one thousand years of brutal history are missing from this article; it is as if it never happened.DearGod 05:21, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that there is a contradiction between this article's etymology section and Africa's <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Africa" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Africa" rel="nofollow">wiktionary entry</a>. This article claims that the name came from a Proto-Kordofanian language, and the Wiktionary entry claims that it came from the Latin word Africa (which in turn derives from a Carthagenian word). Which one is true? Neither claim seems to have a reference. —<a href="../../../m/s/i/User%7EMsikma_222d.html" title="User:Msikma">msikma</a> &lt;<a href="../../../m/s/i/User_talk%7EMsikma_e16b.html" title="User talk:Msikma">user_talk:msikma</a>&gt; 14:14, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Kordofanian stuff was added only recently by an anon, which is why I added the unreferenced section tag myself. It should probably be removed, along with both tags, IMO.

<p>I must agree with the first comment: this is not an encyclopedic tone. It's a much more literary sound, which is jarring in this context. Sure, slavery and colonization were both tragedies; it wouldn't be outside the bounds of encyclopedic tone to call them that. But the particular phrasing is...well, too "novel" or nuanced. The same would be true if I described a <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peanut_butter_and_jelly_sandwich.html" title="Peanut butter and jelly sandwich">peanut butter and jelly sandwich</a> as "Twin slices of bread slathered with creamy peanut butter and shimmering jelly." It's just not the literary style in which encyclopedias are written. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 14:20, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was in the entymology section. What was wierd is that it showed up in the article, but when you went to edit it out, it wasn't in the "edit" section. I'm not sure how the person did it, but copying the original text into wordpad, then copying it back into the wiki editor seems to resolve the issue quite nicely.</p>

<dd>An image vandal has been hitting a LOT of templates recently, formatting the images to float in thousands of articles at a time, and causing a lot of confusion among users who can't find its origin. If you see an image pop up but it doesn't seem to be originating in the article, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ARecentchanges&amp;namespace=10" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ARecentchanges&amp;namespace=10" rel="nofollow">template recent changes</a>. Once you find the origin of the vandalism, revert, ask for the offending image to be placed on <a href="../../../b/a/d/MediaWiki%7EBad_image_list_054b.html" title="MediaWiki:Bad image list">MediaWiki:Bad image list</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">request</a> that the template be protected. Admins, it's probably worth being proactive and implementing an appropriate level of protection on high-use templates in the articles you watch. For an example of how to use template documentation subpages and the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProtected_template_c3cf.html" title="Template:Protected template">protected template</a>}} tag, see {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert_3e75.html" title="Template:Expert">expert</a>}}. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 17:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am appalled at the state of this section. And in such a major article, too. I'd change it, but frankly, my knowledge of African culture is limited to intro-level courses. I <i>am</i> suspicious of claims that it's a fairly homogenous culture; my impression was that African geography has produced far more local variance than in Europe. But maybe that's changed in recent years.

<p>Quite Clearly I did mean that referring to one "Africa" as being the definitive one, whilst placing others(including the real meaning) under the disambiguation page is prejudiced. True there is a disambiguation page for "Africa" but when one types "Africa" into the Go/Search box, one is directed to this page. This would seem to indicate that this page is the definitive "Africa", and only people who click on the "go to disambiguation" link will see the other uses. This is my problem. I suggest that when somebody enters "Africa" in wikipedia, there should be a single "disambiguation"-style page with links to all the different uses. By using this as the main "Africa" page, wikipedia is showing bias and a complete lack of neutrality.
