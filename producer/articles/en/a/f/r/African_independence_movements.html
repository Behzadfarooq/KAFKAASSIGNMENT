<p>In Guinea-Bissau, the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Party_for_the_Independence_of_Guinea_and_Cape_Verde_3929.html" title="African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde">African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde</a> (PAIGC) started fighting in January 1963. Its <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerrilla.html" title="Guerrilla">guerrilla</a> fighters attacked the Portuguese headquarters in <a href="../../../t/i/t/Tite.html" title="Tite">Tite</a>, located to the south of <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bissau.html" title="Bissau">Bissau</a>, the capital, near the Corubal river . Similar actions quickly spread across the entire colony, requiring a strong response from the Portuguese forces.</p>
<p>The war in Guinea placed face to face <a href="../../../a/m/%C3%AD/Am%C3%ADlcar_Cabral_01ef.html" title="Amílcar Cabral">Amílcar Cabral</a>, the leader of PAIGC, and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ant%C3%B3nio_de_Sp%C3%ADnola_575b.html" title="António de Spínola">António de Spínola</a>, the Portuguese general responsible for the local military operations. In 1965 the war spread to the eastern part of the country and in that same year the PAIGC carried out attacks in the north of the country where at the time only the minor guerrilla movement, the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frente_de_Luta_pela_Independ%C3%AAncia_Nacional_da_Guin%C3%A9_6caf.html" title="Frente de Luta pela Independência Nacional da Guiné">Frente de Luta pela Independência Nacional da Guiné</a> (FLING), was fighting. By that time, the PAIGC started receiving military support from the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Bloc_ee5d.html" title="Socialist Bloc">Socialist Bloc</a>, mainly from <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, a support that would last until the end of the war.</p>
<p>In Guinea the Portuguese troops mainly took a defensive position, limiting themselves to keeping the territories they already held. This kind of action was particularly devastating to the Portuguese troops who were constantly attacked by the forces of the PAIGC. They were also demoralized by the steady growth of the influence of the liberation supporters among the population that was being recruited in large numbers by the PAIGC.</p>
<p>With some strategic changes by António Spínola in the late 1960s, the Portuguese forces gained momentum and, taking the offensive, became a much more effective force. Between 1968 and 1972, the Portuguese forces took control of the situation and sometimes carried attacks against the PAIGC positions. At this time the Portuguese forces were also adopting subversive means to counter the insurgents, attacking the political structure of the nationalist movement. This strategy culminated in the assassination of Amílcar Cabral in January 1973. Nonetheless, the PAIGC continued to fight back and pushed the Portuguese forces to the limit. This became even more visible after PAIGC received <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-aircraft_weapons.html" title="Anti-aircraft weapons">anti-aircraft weapons</a> provided by the Soviets, especially the <a href="../../../s/a/-/SA-7_0f0e.html" title="SA-7">SA-7</a> rocket launchers, thus undermining the Portuguese air superiority.</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozambique.html" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a> was the last territory to start the war of liberation.

The fighting later spread to <a href="../../../n/i/a/Niassa.html" title="Niassa">Niassa</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tete.html" title="Tete">Tete</a> at the centre of the country. A report from Battalion No. 558 of the Portuguese army makes references to violent actions, also in Cabo Delgado, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_21.html" title="August 21">August 21</a> 1964. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">November 16</a> of the same year, the Portuguese troops suffered their first losses fighting in the north of the country, in the region of Xilama. By this time, the size of the guerrilla movement had substantially increased; this, along with the low numbers of Portuguese troops and colonists, allowed a steady increase in FRELIMO's strength. It quickly started moving south in the direction of Meponda and Mandimba, linking to Tete with the aid of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malawi.html" title="Malawi">Malawi</a>.</p>
<p>Until 1967 the FRELIMO showed less interest in Tete region, putting its efforts on the two northernmost districts of the country where the use of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmines.html" title="Landmines">landmines</a> became very common. In the region of Niassa, FRELIMO's intention was to create a free corridor to Zambézia. Until April 1970, the military activity of FRELIMO increased steadily, mainly due to the strategic work of Samora Machel in the region of Cabo Delgado.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization_of_African_Unity_74bd.html" title="Organization of African Unity">Organization of African Unity</a> (OAU) was founded May 1963. Its basic principles were co-operation between African nations and solidarity between African peoples. Another important objective of the OAU was an end to all forms of colonialism in Africa. This became the major objective of the organization in its first years and soon OAU pressure led to the situation in the Portuguese colonies being brought up at the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_Security_Council_53d3.html" title="UN Security Council">UN Security Council</a>.</p>
<p>The OAU established a committee based in <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dar_es_Salaam_5a1c.html" title="Dar es Salaam">Dar es Salaam</a>, with representatives from <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopia.html" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algeria.html" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>, <a href="../../../u/g/a/Uganda.html" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanzania.html" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/i/Zaire.html" title="Zaire">Zaire</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinea.html" title="Guinea">Guinea</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senegal.html" title="Senegal">Senegal</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, to support African liberation movements. The support provided by the committee included military training and weapon supplies. The OAU also took action in order to promote the international acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile (GRAE), composed by the <a href="../../../f/n/l/FNLA_d919.html" title="FNLA">FNLA</a>. This support was transferred to the <a href="../../../m/p/l/MPLA_67f6.html" title="MPLA">MPLA</a> and to its leader, <a href="../../../a/g/o/Agostinho_Neto_c15c.html" title="Agostinho Neto">Agostinho Neto</a> in 1967. In November of 1972, both movements were recognized by the OAU in order to promote their merger. After 1964, the OAU recognized PAIGC as the legitimate representatives of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde and in 1965 recognised <a href="../../../f/r/e/FRELIMO_5d62.html" title="FRELIMO">FRELIMO</a> for Mozambique.</p>

<p>Although the ANC and others opposed to apartheid had initially focused on non-violent campaigns, the brutality of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharpeville_Massacre_e9ef.html" title="Sharpeville Massacre">Sharpeville Massacre</a> of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_21.html" title="March 21">March 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> caused many blacks to embrace the idea of violent resistance to apartheid. However, although the ANC's armed wing started its campaign in 1961, no victory was in sight by the time that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Biko_5ef5.html" title="Steve Biko">Steve Biko</a> was a medical student in the late nineteen-sixties. Even as the nation's leading opposition groups like the ANC proclaimed a commitment to armed struggle, their leaders had failed to organize a credible military effort. If their commitment to revolution had inspired many, the success of the white regime in quashing it had dampened the spirits of many.</p>
<p>It was in this context that black students, Biko most notable among them, began critiquing the liberal whites with whom they worked in anti-apartheid student groups, as well as the official non-racialism of the ANC. They saw progress towards power as requiring the development of black power distinct from supposedly "non-racial groups." They formed the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_Students%27_Organization_3391.html" title="South African Students' Organization">South African Students' Organization</a> in 1969, an all-black student group, and from this grew an increasingly militant Black Consciousness Movement, including the formation of a non-student organization, the Black People's Convention (BPC). This new Black Consciousness Movement not only called for resistance to the policy of Apartheid, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>, and more rights for <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_ad90.html" title="South African">South African</a> blacks who were oppressed by the white Apartheid <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regime.html" title="Regime">regime</a>, but also <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_pride.html" title="Black pride">black pride</a> and a readiness to make blackness, rather than simple liberal democracy, the rallying point of unapologetically black organizations. Importantly, the group defined black to include other "people of color" in South Africa, most notably the large number of South Africans of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asians_in_South_Africa_afbf.html" title="Asians in South Africa">Indian</a> descent. The movement stirred many blacks to confront not only the legal but also the cultural and psychological realities of Apartheid, seeking "not black visibility but real black participation" in society and in political struggles. <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Africana"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/f/r/African_independence_movements.html#endnote_Africana" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/f/r/African_independence_movements.html#endnote_Africana" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The gains this movement made were widespread across South Africa. Many black people felt a new sense of pride about being black as the movement helped to expose and critique the inferiority complex felt by many blacks at the time. The group formed Formation Schools to provide leadership seminars, and placed a great importance on decentralization and autonomy, with no person serving as president for more than one year (although Biko was clearly the primary leader of the movement). Early leaders of the movement such as <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bennie_Khoapa_e670.html" title="Bennie Khoapa">Bennie Khoapa</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_Pityana_b2ab.html" title="Barney Pityana">Barney Pityana</a>, Mapetla Mohapi, and <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mamphela_Ramphele_7ea9.html" title="Mamphela Ramphele">Mamphela Ramphele</a> joined Biko in establishing the Black Community Programmes (BCP) in 1970 as self-help groups for black communities, forming out of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_Council_of_Churches_b13b.html" title="South African Council of Churches">South African Council of Churches</a> and the <i>Christian Institute</i>. They also published various journals, including the <i>Black Review</i>, <i>Black Voice</i>, <i>Black Perspective</i>, and <i>Creativity in Development</i>.</p>
<p>On top of building schools and day cares and taking part in other social projects, the BCM through the BCP was involved in the staging of the large scale protests and workers strikes which gripped the nation in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, especially in <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durban.html" title="Durban">Durban</a>. Indeed, in 1973 the government of South Africa began to clamp down on the movement, claiming that their ideas of black development were treasonous, and virtually the entire leadership of SASO and BPC were banned. In late August and September of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, after holding rallies in support of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frelimo.html" title="Frelimo">Frelimo</a> government which had taken power in <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozambique.html" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, many leaders of the BCM were arrested under the Terrorism Act and the Riotous Assemblies Act. Arrests under these laws allowed the suspension of the doctrine of <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habeas_corpus.html" title="Habeas corpus">habeas corpus</a>, and many of those arrested were not formally charged until the next year, resulting in the arrest of the "Pretoria Twelve" and conviction of the "SASO nine", which included Maitshe Mokoape and <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosiuoa_Lekota_bbb4.html" title="Mosiuoa Lekota">Patrick Lekota</a>. These were the most prominent among various public trials which gave a forum for members of the BCM to explain their philosophy and to describe the abuses that had been inflicted upon them. Far from crushing the movement, this led to its wider support among black and white South Africans. <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_trial"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/f/r/African_independence_movements.html#endnote_trial" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/f/r/African_independence_movements.html#endnote_trial" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p>The Black Consciousness Movement heavily supported the protests against the policies of the apartheid regime which led to the <a href="../../../s/o/w/Soweto_riots.html" title="Soweto riots">Soweto riots</a> in June of 1976. The protests began when it was decreed that black students be forced to learn <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaans.html" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>, and that many secondary school classes were to be taught in that language. This was another encroachment against the black population, which generally spoke indigenous languages like <a href="../../../z/u/l/Zulu.html" title="Zulu">Zulu</a> and <a href="../../../x/h/o/Xhosa.html" title="Xhosa">Xhosa</a> at home, and saw <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> as offering more prospects for mobility and economic self-sufficiency than did <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaans.html" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>. And the notion that Afrikaans was to define the national identity stood directly against the BCM principle of the development of a unique black identity. The protest began as a non-violent demonstration before police opened fire on the crowd, killing hundreds of youths. The government's efforts to suppress the growing movement led to the imprisonment of Steve Biko, who became a symbol of the struggle. Biko died in police custody on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>. It should be noted that Steve Biko was a non-violent activist, even though the movement he helped start eventually took up violent resistance. White newspaper editor <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Woods_42d7.html" title="Donald Woods">Donald Woods</a> supported the movement and Biko, whom he had befriended, by leaving South Africa and exposing the truth behind Biko's death at the hands of police by publishing the book <i>Biko</i>.</p>
<p>One month after Biko's death, the South African government declared 17 groups associated with the Black Consciousness Movement to be illegal. Following this, many members joined more concretely political and tightly-structured parties such as the ANC, which used underground <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covert_cells.html" title="Covert cells">cells</a> to maintain their organizational integrity despite banning by the government. And it seemed to some that the key goals of Black Consciousness had been attained, in that black identity and psychological liberation were growing. Nonetheless, in the months following Biko's death, activists continued to hold meetings to discuss resistance. Along with members of the BCM, a new generation of activists who had been inspired by the Soweto riots and Biko's death were present, including Bishop <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desmond_Tutu_a927.html" title="Desmond Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a>. Among the organizations that formed in these meetings to carry the torch of Black Consciousness was the <a href="../../../a/z/a/AZAPO_4d87.html" title="AZAPO">Azanian People's Organization</a> (AZAPO) which persists to this day. <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Brewer"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/f/r/African_independence_movements.html#endnote_Brewer" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/f/r/African_independence_movements.html#endnote_Brewer" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span> Almost immediately after the formation of AZAPO in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, its chairman, Ishmael Mkhabela, and secretary, Lybon Mabasa were detained under the Terrorism Act. In the following years, other groups sharing Black Consciousness principles formed, including the Azanian Confederation of Trade Unions (AZACTU), Congress of South African Students (COSAS), Azanian Student Organization (AZASO) and the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organization (PEBCO).</p>
<p>While many of these organizations still exist in some form, some evolved and could no longer be called parts of the Black Consciousness Movement. And as the influence of the Black Consciousness Movement itself waned, the ANC was returning to its role as the clearly leading force in the resistance to white rule. Still more former members of the Black Consciousness Movement continued to join the ANC, including <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thozamile_Botha_ce0e.html" title="Thozamile Botha">Thozamile Botha</a> from PEBCO. Others formed new groups. For instance, in 1980, Pityana formed the Black Consciousness Movement of Azania (BCMA), an avowedly <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> group which used AZAPO as its political voice. Curtis Nkondo from AZAPO and many members of AZASO and the Black Consciousness Media Workers Association joined the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Democratic_Front_422e.html" title="United Democratic Front">United Democratic Front</a> (UDF). <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Gibson"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/f/r/African_independence_movements.html#endnote_Gibson" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/f/r/African_independence_movements.html#endnote_Gibson" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span> Many groups published important newsletters and journals, such as the <i>Kwasala</i> of the Black Consciousness Media Workers and the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> based BCMA journal, <i>Solidarity</i>. And beyond these groups and media outlets, the Black Consciousness Movement had an extremely broad legacy, even as the movement itself was no longer represented by a single organization. Indeed, while the Black Consciousness Movement itself spawned an array of smaller groups, many people who came of age as activists in the Black Consciousness Movement did not join them. Instead, they joined a plethora of other organizations, including the ANC, the Unity Movement, the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Africanist_Congress_f831.html" title="Pan Africanist Congress">Pan Africanist Congress</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Democratic_Front_422e.html" title="United Democratic Front">United Democratic Front</a> and trade and civic unions.</p>
