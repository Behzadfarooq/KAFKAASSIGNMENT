<p>I haven't read Geneva Smitherman's <i>Black Talk</i>, but I think these derivations are questionable, particularly for 'jive', supposedly from Zulu. There were essentially no slaves taken from what is now South Africa, so this seems unlikely to me. For 'hip' and 'dig' my Shorter OED lists the former as 'unknown etymology' and lists the latter under the standard definition of dig, with no African origin. I don't know how reliable Smitherman is, but if anyone has access to this book, could you please check these derivations? <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> 19:09, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do have access to this book. Smitherman is not and does not claim to be an etymologist. Her etymologies are few, casual, and tentative. The place to look is the splendid new multivolume American dialect dictionary whose title eludes me for the moment. (<i>DARE</i>, maybe?) I have access to that as well -- or rather, I have access to the part of it that has been published; it's still incomplete.

<dd>As a student of the Zulu language, I'd like to note that words beginning with the prefix "i" (such as the 'ijaiva' example previously posted) are words borrowed from other languages -- usually English.

<dd>My impression is that a lot of this African etymology stuff is, and will likely remain, at the level of educated hunches. For all I know some proponents of Ebonics (in Williams's original sense of that word) too lightly added a pile of far-fetched derivations, but those aside there does seem to be a small number of words that a number of serious scholars dispassionately think may well have come from Africa. What they can't do is show enough evidence for this to impress the editors of <i>DARE</i> or the <i>OED</i>, both of which (a) are reluctant to add anything smelling of folk etymology, and (b) usually present no etymology rather than a dubious etymology. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:14, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm making this here because discussing how the Cosby quote should be put into the article above was too difficult to navigate through all of the unrelated material. Joe says that Joe is opposed to the Cosby quote being called "famous". The fact is it did get a lot of media attention when it was said and caused a basic uproar among afrocentrists who criticized Cosby. It does fit the definition of "famous".<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 19:50, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"famous" has other meanings besides "well-known" that tend to rub off on it: 1 a&#160;: widely known b&#160;: honored for achievement 2&#160;: EXCELLENT, FIRST-RATE &lt;famous weather for a walk&gt;, according to Merriam-Webster. We already have "notably" doing the job you want "famous" to do. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeldl_5ca1.html" title="User:Joeldl">Joeldl</a> 00:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not liking the new place for the par mentioning Cosby. It's a (half a?)paragraph ultimately describing criticisms in a section that doesn't deal explicitely with criticisms.</dd>
<dd>I agree with arguments against using the word "famous." It's a notable example, partly because it's recent, but it's not famous. Also, Hoary, I think if you'd like to illustrate that Cosby doesn't know what he's talking about, I feel it would be appropriate if you somehow indicated that <i>most</i> critics of AAVE don't know what they're talking about. This would, of course, be told in as objective a manner as one possibly can objectively state that another is ignorant. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 01:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Saying "Most notably, in his Pound Cake Speech..." doesn't give the implication that the pound cake speech itself was notable. "widely reported" doesn't have the same "zing" to it either. The Pound cake speech was "famous" or "memorable". Not to imply "good" but to imply it was well known and received vast media attention.

<dd>Okay, I don't want to get involved in dtermining the extent of media coverage, except to say that I remember hearing about it when it happened. I didn't know the speech had a name, though. I don't think there's any reason to give it zing. If it is established that it received considerable media attention at the time, I don't see why we would go beyond just saying that. I heard about it the same way I heard about the Japanese guy winning the hot dog eating contest. I think "well known" confers a degree of permanent relevance on the speech that isn't in keeping with the ephemeral nature of the media coverage. I could be proven wrong if WDM could establish that it's continued to be written about a lot in the media and elsewhere the same way Bush's "mission accomplished" speech has been, say. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeldl_5ca1.html" title="User:Joeldl">Joeldl</a> 04:54, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>New Cosby version: <i>Most notably, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Cosby_9aa1.html" title="Bill Cosby">Bill Cosby</a>, in his <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_Cake_speech_8ff0.html" title="Pound Cake speech">Pound Cake speech</a>, criticized members of the African American community for various social behaviors including exclusive use of AAVE[.]</i> Three points:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Behavior" is uncountable in my idiolect.</li>
<li>If Cosby's rant is the most notable criticism there is, the level of such criticism must be even feebler than I'd imagined.</li>
<li>This is a euphemistic description of what Cosby said, which clearly referred to AAVE (and not just exclusive use of it) as "crap". It increasingly seems that the article is designed (a) to pump up Cosby as some sort of notable pundit on the use of AAVE, which he isn't, yet (b) to gloss over what clearly shows that he's full of the crap he sees in others.</li>

<p>Me, above, on the citation of Bereiter and Engelmann, <i>Teaching Disadvantaged Children in the Preschool</i> (1966):</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On the book (which I haven't read): I'll take your word for it that it argues that AAVE is somehow deficient. I note that its publication predates the huge majority of serious research into AAVE. Citing this book may explain how public opinion was or has been molded. As for its value in presenting a present-day argument about AAVE, it seems a bit like citing a description of the moons of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn.html" title="Saturn">Saturn</a> from a work on astronomy, however seriously researched, that predated the sending of <a href="../../../v/o/y/Voyager_1.html" title="Voyager 1">Voyager 1</a> to take a closer look at Saturn.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Æµ§œš¹ in response, above:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>As for B &amp; E, if I remember correctly, there actually</i> had <i>been plenty of linguistic research on AAVE and the concept that languages cannot be "better" than others had been accepted by linguists well before then. So B &amp; E ignored the linguistic consensus just as much as people do today.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>They ignored one linguistic consensus, but they could very reasonably have been unaware of a second one (or, if you prefer, of the application of the first one).</p>
<p>I wrote that <i>I note that its publication predates the huge majority of serious research into AAVE.</i> I knew that there was good analysis in the 60s but was hazy about which was which and precisely when it all took place. Some more reading of Baugh's excellent <i>Beyond Ebonics</i> reminds me.</p>
<p>The major work of scholarship that examined and described the intricate grammar of AAVE was William Labov's "The Logic of Nonstandard English", a forty-plus-page paper published in volume 22 of something with the not obviously made-for-Hollywood title of <i>Georgetown Monograph Series on Languages and Linguistics</i> in 1969. Well over thirty years later, its effect clearly hasn't reached at least one of the most vociferous editors of this page. But we should give it two or three years to reach the sleepier of university linguistics departments. As for pedagogy, even the kind that gets published by Prentice Hall, we should perhaps give it five years and certainly no less than two years.</p>
<p>Let's be stringent and say two years. That's 1971, five years after the publication of <i>Teaching Disadvantaged Children in the Preschool.</i></p>
<p>I don't say that Bereiter and Engelmann ignored (let alone refuted) what we -- uh, well, most of us -- now know about AAVE. They can't be expected to have known it.</p>
<p>There's no point in citing books from the 60s as examples of what is intelligently believed now. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:49, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I said above, B &amp; E aren't a good source for what they're connected to since they're more an example rather than a verification. Your criticisms of the age of their work also prevents serious use of it as a source. However, I believe it does show, if nothing else, that the attempts to use schools to change AAVE usage has been going on for quite some time. One possibility is to mention their work in the article, which would beef up the criticism aspect and compare it to the beliefs held now by educators/people. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 07:13, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aw, please. . . . Here's what the article says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>AAVE has been the center of controversy on issues regarding the education of African American youths and the role it should play in public schools and education, as well as its its place in broader society. Educators have held that attempts should be made to eliminate AAVE usage through the public education system. Criticisms from social commentators and educators have ranged from asserting that AAVE is an intrinsically deficient form of speech</i> [Note that cites an example that's over forty years old and predates Labov's paper] <i>to arguments that its use, by being considered unacceptable in most cultural contexts, is socially limiting.</i> [No citation] <i>It is usually argued that incorporating AAVE in schools would only impede the academic progress of young African American children</i> [Note that cites an "English 101" paper by some nincompoop who talks of AAVE as "this speech deficiency" and "this mutilation of the English language".]</dd>
</dl>
<p>At least three citations are needed, two are supplied. One is so old that its writers can't be blamed for lacking an elementary understanding of AAVE; the other by somebody so crass (and bigoted?) as to choose remain ignorant of AAVE and whose criticism of the role/use of AAVE is clearly related to his ignorance of AAVE itself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, mention that Middle America's beloved Cosby referred to AAVE as "crap" is expunged.</p>
<p>As it stands now, the article presents no evidence for what it suggests: that there are reasoned objections to the <i>use</i> of AAVE. It gives the wrong impression that the objections it cites are well informed, whereas almost certainly they're to a large degree the result of excusable ignorance (Bereiter and Engelmann) and willful ignorance (Govero). -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:37, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe I've said that it's fine to discuss the quality of all criticism. Focusing just on Cosby is a bit unfair to him because it would then imply that he is the only critic who doesn't know what he's talking about. If you somehow can't use Baugh (a source you say discusses criticism) to do this and you <i>really</i> feel that Cosby's inadequacies in the matter should be addressed then the way to do it is to say it in the article, not imply it with selective quotations. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 13:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I haven't yet seen on the page <i>any</i> criticism of the user of AAVE that's worth more than a glance. I don't say it exists; I just haven't yet seen it. I find it hard to believe that there could be any recent criticism of AAVE itself that's neither ignorant nor stupid.</p>
<p>Bereiter and Engelmann can hardly be expected to know what they're talking about (which is not their fault), Cosby doesn't know what he's talking about, Govero doesn't know what he's talking about. Cosby strikes me as going gaga and Govero as a batshit insane Little Lord Fauntleroy, but it seems that we're compelled to present the goofball "side of the story". If for some reason we can't simply quote Cosby and Govero uttering the idiotic comments ("crap", etc.) that explain their motivation for the part of what they say that's less obviously wacko, then how about this:</p>

<dd>OK. The big problem, though, is that these "criticism of AAVE in education" seem inextricable from criticisms of AAVE itself. As an understanding of AAVE gradually reaches all but the staunchest of sticklers for truthiness, the remaining critics seem to be no more than flakes.

<dd>In your PoV, what you term "basic NPOV" trumps what you regard as a "conceited concept" of an insistence on reliable sources. Your enthusiasm for presenting a variety points of view, admirable in itself, seems to extend to unsupported assertions in op-ed pieces, comedy routines, etc., based on lazy assumptions disproved decades ago: assumptions that are quickly dispatched in such very introductory and "reader-friendly" books as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Language-Myths-Laurie-Bauer/dp/0140260234" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Language-Myths-Laurie-Bauer/dp/0140260234" rel="nofollow">this one</a> (recommended). -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:24, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Based on myths about language in general and based on myths about AAVE in particular. Yours is an interesting idea, but it would mean that Wikipedia would incorporate an encyclopedia of discredited ideas. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I don't think it's something that should be started so lightly. Let's consider an example from the article. We read: <i>Criticisms from social commentators and educators have ranged from asserting that AAVE is an intrinsically deficient form of speech<sup>[20]</sup> to.....</i> That note 20 cites something written by <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Manguel_c8ca.html" title="Alberto Manguel">Alberto Manguel</a>, a novelist and essayist (hardly a "commentator", and certainly not an "educator"). I haven't read that piece and have never claimed to have read it; I'd guess that nobody else here has read it either, as nobody has dug up its title. Pullum writes of it: <i>[Many people] also think [AAVE is] an impoverished version of English with a lot of grammatical mistakes. Alberto Manguel wrote [...] that black English is 'nothing but a vastly impoverished version of Standard English.' He gives no evidence for that at all.</i> Now, Pullum may have been lying to the enthralled Australians as they huddled around their wireless sets. Let's assume for a moment that he wasn't. If Pullum wasn't lying, what Manguel says is at about the same level as my saying that your sister is ugly: their truth-values aside, both remarks are offensive, and say more about the speaker than the putative subject. Back to the truth value of what Manguel said. It may take as much as twenty minutes of sustained reading effort to figure out how utterly wrong it is; it takes about twenty <i>seconds</i> in any of a pile of books about language to see that (to take one of many examples) AAVE <i>adds</i> a use of "been" to refer to the distant past; ergo, the assertion that it's "nothing but a vastly impoverished version" of SE is simply wrong. Why should any encyclopedia article present "criticism" as obviously dopy as this? (Incidentally, my apologies to your sister, rudely coopted for rhetorical purposes.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:30, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's sometimes claimed on this talk page or in the everchanging article itself that certain "educators and social commentators" (or similar) have no particular beef with AAVE itself but criticize the extent of its use. (After his telltale word "crap" is politely removed, Cosby is made to sound like this.)</p>
<p>I'm willing to believe that such people and such opinions exist, and I'm willing to have them presented in a Wikipedia article. But I haven't encountered them yet. It's my impression that if you investigate what appears to be criticism of the <i>use</i> of AAVE, you pretty soon find that it's based on the same old ignorance of AAVE itself. It argues from false premisses.</p>
<p>This isn't just my impression. The entry for "Black English Vernacular" in <i>The Oxford Companion to the English Language</i> rightly accords the criticism/controversy stuff a small place at the end, immediately before the conclusion. Here's what it says:</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">

<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">[M]any misconceptions about BEV prevail, especially that it is simply 'bad English' and that it holds African Americans back in education and employment opportunities because of this. The dominant issue for BEV is a stereotype that equates non-standard usage with stupidity. Its negative consequences continue to affect the prospects of black American children. Because BEV is devalued and misunderstood, uninformed citizens (including many teachers with excellent intentions) continue to denigrate it in favour of standard [American English]. Few such educators, whether or not they have a training in linguistics, have learned about the history and nature of African-American English, and fail therefore to appreciate its diversity and logical integrity as a long-established variety of the language.</td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>(Mention of "diversity" reminds me of a major shortcoming in the WP article. By contrast, diversity is emphasized in the BEV article within <i>OCEL.</i>)</p>
<p>That criticism of the "use" of AAVE stems from misunderstanding of AAVE itself seems to be a lot more than a mere hunch: the <i>OCEL</i> article presents it as a straightforward fact. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 00:49, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All right, with the right references, it seems appropriate to me to give the reactions of some linguists to the worst things you hear about AAVE, like that it's "intrinsically deficient". <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeldl_5ca1.html" title="User:Joeldl">Joeldl</a> 01:02, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Er . . . OK, but I was making a different point: that what's purported to be criticism of the extent to which AAVE is used is often based on prejudices about AAVE itself. I had thought that this was so; the <i>OCEL</i> says it <i>is</i> so. (Or anyway was so: the book is now about 15 years old.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:10, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The popular belief that lower-status speech forms are "mistakes" is not limited to AAVE. You find the same prejudice about a lot of nonstandard dialects. I think something about what linguists think is already in the section "social context". What information are you proposing including that's not mentioned there? <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeldl_5ca1.html" title="User:Joeldl">Joeldl</a> 06:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC) I think the OCEL allows authors to be more argumentative than an encyclopedia would.

<dd>Yes, most encyclopedias (e.g. <i>Britannica</i>) have signed articles, and yes <i>OCEL</i> does too. But its articles seem pretty bland to me, certainly not argumentative. Yes, Joeldl's right about popular stigmatization of basilects in general. What I'm suggesting is that (a) either articles are found that make critical comments about the use of AAVE while not criticizing AAVE, or (b) the article shows that critical comments about the use of AAVE are based on beliefs that AAVE itself is somehow bad. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 13:52, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Currently the section about criticism of AAVE and the use of AAVE is located in the "Education" section. However this isn't the right place for it. When Cosby criticized the use of AAVE in his speech he wasn't criticizing it's use in education but it's use in general. Having his speech and other criticism in the "education" section doesn't make sense. Moreover, Why keep removing the actual quotes from his speech? Why can't they be included? The reader needs to get an idea of exactly what Cosby was saying and from the mouth of Cosby himself and needs to make an interpretation of it that way.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 03:17, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover I object to the paragraph starting with "Changes in formal attitudes regarding the acceptance of AAVE as a distinct dialect correlated with advancements in civil rights." appearing right after the section of criticism of use of AAVE including Cosby's criticism. Cosby didn't make any implications that AAVE isn't a distinct dialect or any such thing. So having such a section about "Changes in formal attitudes regarding the acceptance of AAVE as a distinct dialect" doesn't make sense.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 03:22, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is why I suggested you write an overview section dealing with controversies within black culture in general. Im not sure any of us is in fact up to the task, but certainly thats whats required. I know Joe and others have suggested that education be the only focus of criticism, but that would only exclude all other matters of culture. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 03:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the phrase "eliminate AAVE through the education system" shows that the topic of the section is appropriately named. I challenge others to find criticism of AAVE that is <i>not</i> related to education (Cosby's is since he was speaking at an event in celebration of brown vs board of education and his only credential on the matter is his doctorate in education). Until then I'm proven wrong, I'll be maintaining that there isn't formal criticism of AAVE outside the context of education. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 03:46, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Originally, through lack of attention, I hadn't realized to what extent Cosby's criticism was related to education. This quote: "Where did these people get the idea that they’re moving ahead on this?" is almost certainly an indirect reference to the debate about AAVE in education, since that's about the only place anybody has tried to "move ahead" on AAVE. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeldl_5ca1.html" title="User:Joeldl">Joeldl</a> 06:41, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An interesting and non-trivial challenge.

<dd>Well, "AAVE itself" obviously doesn't include that, but "post-1980 education-related or other criticism of AAVE" does. NB I'm not saying that no such criticism exists. It's not a matter of you not coming up with any and me then crowing "Nyah! You lost, I won!" Indeed, I think such criticism does exist.

<dd>Dude Man, your citation to support the claim that "Criticisms from social commentators and educators have ranged from asserting that AAVE is an intrinsically deficient form of speech" is of a piece by Alberto Manguel. I believe that it is <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Manguel_c8ca.html" title="Alberto Manguel">this Alberto Manguel</a>. He's a writer of fiction and essays (who incidentally didn't go to university and whose CV shows no sign that he has studied language to the degree necessary needed to assert intelligently that anything is an intrinsically deficient form of speech). How is he a social commentator or educator? I'm surprised that you don't mention the title of his piece within this magazine. Have you not read it? I haven't read it, but I have read Pullum's description of it. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 10:37, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll not refrain from reverting anyone if I believe it's warranted. Even if Manguel were credible and had said more than one sentence-worth of material on the subject (both things that are not true), that is not the place to use him as a citation. I've already explained why in the talk page. I've also explained why the title of that section is appropriate and needn't be changed. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 14:03, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, as has been pointed out previously, that since the relevant point here is the <i>extent</i> of criticism, it's more appropriate, if possible, to have a citation from a reputable academic source (satisfying Wikipedia criteria) <i>surveying</i> criticism of AAVE and/or its use in education or elsewhere, than to have an illustrative example of the criticism. This could also serve the purpose of evaluating the quality of criticism, although we should be careful to choose language, insofar as possible, that is reflective of a consensus of such surveys. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeldl_5ca1.html" title="User:Joeldl">Joeldl</a> 15:37, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am suggesting using references, if possible whose reputability is not questioned, which themselves effect a synthesis of the most prominent views expressed concerning AAVE, instead of us having to do it. I think you can find extreme views on just about any topic. (Somebody gave the example of the earth being flat.) Citing an example of such a view is not proof that it is widespread or representative. What is proof, in the sense of an encyclopedia article, is a citation of a respected researcher who says that it is widespread or representative. If such references can be found, they are the best we can use. If those sources think certain proponents of one point of view are notable or representative, that would be good reason to mention those primary sources as well. All of this is assuming such sources are available — I think other editors here are likely to be better able to identify them than I am. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeldl_5ca1.html" title="User:Joeldl">Joeldl</a> 08:10, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hoary is missing the entire point(as usual). I get tired of repeating myself over and over just so I can be ignored and strawmen created from my arguments. Cosby isn't my source! Obviously "Cosby" himself would not be a reliable source for an article on linguistics. If I were to say "AAVE is crap" and cite Cosby for evidence of this that would violate RS. However the only thing I'm doing is saying "Cosby said this". I'm not making any assertions about AAVE in the article, I'm only making assertions about the controversy surrounding AAVE and what people have said about it. Cosby is not my source. The source is the publisher of his speech. Which is a very reliable source. The same applies for the rest of the sources of controversy surrounding AAVE.

<dd>If you didn't consider Cosby to be your source, then you wouldn't cite him as such in the article. I understand the distinction you are trying to make but it comes off as misleading and nitpicky. Cosby is the intellectual authority you are appealling to when you quote him and that is what makes him your "source." At the moment, I can't really think of a more appropriate word. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 02:35, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm gonig to assume good faith on that comment, Æµ§œš¹. I'm going to just assume you aren't intentionally ignoring my posts and you simply overlooked what I posted. To clear things up i'll repost what I said so you might be able to catch it this time. I'm not making any assertions about AAVE in the article, I'm only making assertions about the controversy surrounding AAVE and what people have said about it. Cosby is not my source. The source is the publisher of his speech.

I would like to note some of the new policy regarding sources, and how it relates to this article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A questionable source is one with no editorial oversight or fact-checking process, or with a poor reputation for fact-checking. Such sources include websites and publications that express views that are widely acknowledged as fringe or extremist, are promotional in nature, or rely heavily on rumors and personal opinions. Questionable sources may only be used in articles about themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think Bill Cosby is known for his fact-checking. I would also like to note what Jimmy Wales has to say about "Crackpot articles":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(b) if those are *known* and *popular* crackpot ideas, then we should have an article about them, identifying them *as* ideas that are completely rejected by the consensus of leading scientists or NPOV verbiage to that effect (c) if those are *individualized* crackpot ideas, i.e. stuff made up by one anonymous crank, then after some time on 'votes for deletion' they should just be deleted, not for being false, but for failing the test of confirmability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Cosby quote seems to fall under (b). <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> 04:24, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dude Man, nobody will dispute your assertion that you have repeated yourself.</p>
<p>You say: <i>Cosby's ideas are not crackpot.</i></p>
<p>What, the "pound cake" stuff again? They are so confused that it's hard to derive any sense out of them. But <a href="../../../a/f/r/Talk%7EAfrican_American_Vernacular_English_Archive_3_f7b7.html#Cosby_quote" title="Talk:African American Vernacular English/Archive 3">here they are</a>, with commentary. A quick reminder for those too busy to click that link:</p>
<ul>
<li>He appears to claim that he's doing something that he says he can't do.</li>
<li>He says he doesn't know who the people are that he's talking about, but then claims to talk from first-hand experience about a family that exemplifies them.</li>
<li>He twice appears to imply that AAVE isn't English (an assertion that would put him together with the original promoters of <a href="../../../e/b/o/Ebonics.html" title="Ebonics">Ebonics</a> in the original meaning of that term, but almost nobody else); he tacitly admits that code-switching is possible, but his whole schtick seems to deny that code-switching is possible.</li>
<li>He appears to confuse (a) the organizational constraints of flight-control English with (b) linguistic requirements for communicating flight-control information. The former is a (very sensible) conventionalization of the latter.</li>
<li>He appears to assert that a speaker of AAVE cannot be a doctor, but (of course) presents no evidence for this. Or maybe he asserts that AAVE isn't up to the task of doctoring, another assertion for which he presents no evidence.</li>
<li>Taken literally, he equates (a) AAVE, an abstraction, with (b) feces, a substance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, Dude Man, if his ideas (crackpot or otherwise) are moderately coherent, perhaps you can summarize them for us here, and also point out where I've gone wrong in my description of them above.</p>
<p>Are they perhaps "not crackpot" because, in his incoherent way, Crosby appears to feel the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">truthiness</a> of your own nutty notion, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:African_American_Vernacular_English&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=100881863" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:African_American_Vernacular_English&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=100881863" rel="nofollow">expressed a month ago</a>, that <i>AAVE is rudimentary compared to basic English. The complexity of AAVE words are</i> [sic] <i>limited and you rarely see polysyllabic words used in AAVE</i>, and that AAVE has a <i>lack of complexity and ability to effectively deliver complex ideas</i>? Even if we take "basic English" not as <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_English_33a0.html" title="Basic English">this</a> but instead as an attempt to express the concept of "Standard American English", ideas such as this will be brushed aside by anybody who has read any of dozens of well-informed books about language. (Try Bauer and Trudgill's <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Language-Myths-Laurie-Bauer/dp/0140260234" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Language-Myths-Laurie-Bauer/dp/0140260234" rel="nofollow">Language Myths</a>.</i> It's really easy to read.)</p>

<p>You have claimed dozens of times that Cosby is not your source, but we have all expressed our disagreement. If we accept your logic, then quoting a book is using the publishing company as a source, not the author.

<dd>Yes, I did some digging, too. Walker has no academic credentials and is principally know for his involvement in a couple of right-wing propaganda organs.

<p>Well said.</p>
<p>I examined three books by Smitherman's and found every "Smitherman" quote to have been (very scrupulously) taken from just one of them. Something similar has to be done for Romaine, Coulmas, and Trudgill. Each of these three has written quite a lot; finding the quotations may not be a trivial task. If you see a book by one of these three authors that is the source for one or more of the quotations, of course adjust the article accordingly. But if it isn't the source, please edit what follows in order to save work for others.

Odd things are going on at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>. This, in case you're not up to date on such matters, is pretty weighty stuff: <i>This new merged policy page has replaced Wikipedia:Verifiability and Wikipedia:No original research</i> (which, you'll recall, were often cited as two of the three pillars of WP, the other being NPoV). And yup, <i>This page is an official policy on the English Wikipedia. [...] When editing this page, please ensure that your revision reflects consensus.

<li>04:20, 24 February 2007 Stevertigo "restore - take it to talk if you have an issue"</li>
<li>04:21–04:33, 24 February 2007 Stevertigo series of six edits in the section "Reliable sources", none with an edit summary</li>
<li>04:56, 24 February 2007 Gerry Ashton "Revert material that belongs on talk page, not in the policy"</li>
<li>09:41–09:43, 24 February 2007 Stevertigo series of three edits, one of which has the edit summary "Explain the ambiguity. The subjective nature of the definition need to be acknowledged and clarified"</li>
<li>10:41, 24 February 2007 Marskell "rv rambling essay"</li>
</ul>
<p>So what's it all about, then? That last set of three edits by Stevertigo replaces one paragraph with eight (one of which is a quotation from elsewhere). Here's the last but one of the paragraphs that our mediator wants to get in:</p>

<p>Ah. Let's suppose for a moment that Pullum et al. are in the minority in believing that AAVE is just as fine a linguistic tool as Standard American English. (I really don't know if this is true, but my inner Ambrose Bierce would not to be so surprised to find it was indeed true.) Then, per Stevertigo, it's quite OK to say that Pullum's is the minority opinion. The "other side" of this topic? Step up Alberto Manguel. Apparently Manguel wrote in 1998 that AAVE is "nothing but a vastly impoverished version of Standard English". Now, it seems to me that "crackpot" is a pretty good term for somebody who either ignores or chooses to remain ignorant of easily available knowledge on a subject that he writes about so publicly. (It's not that he doesn't like books: <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Manguel_c8ca.html" title="Alberto Manguel">His WP article</a> tells us that he has thirty thousand of them. But then again maybe he just likes the sight of their serried spines.)</p>

It is, however, very close to something that the "mediator" is simultaneously (and so far unsuccessfully) trying to insert within a different policy page.

Yet <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish people</a> rightly does not present this "side" of a "controversy" about Irish people. That's because no sane, sober person attempts to <i>argue</i> it. The alleged stupidity of Irish people, the alleged defects of AAVE: the two notions have about the same significance. It's probable that nobody continues to argue <i>for</i> either PoV in anything worth citing, though crackpots continue to argue <i>from</i> one of these goofy notions and perhaps from the other as well. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 11:54, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

How silly are we? They have all the force of irrationality behind them, and irrationality <i>trumps</i> reason all too often. More specific to your post, your Irish example is precisely why I'm opposed to even a "controversy" section in this article (or any article dealing with a people, or a culture, etc.) - it's nothing more than having a section devoted to bigotry related to the subject, in this case, <i>Bigotry directed towards AAVE and its speakers</i>. Is there something <i>notable</i> about the fact that there are people who are thoughtless enough, stupid enough or selfish enough to adopt such bigotries (about any given people/culture)? Do we have to quote such people too? And for <i>balance</i>?

<p>Well, that hole thing was a lot of fun; now can we fix the article? I also oppose a controversy section, for basically the same reasons, but I think the article should emphasize the popular opinion of AAVE, because this is an important part of its speakers' experience of it.

Naturally I dont have anything fancy or clever to say in retort, nor am I much interested in their complete obliviousness to NPOV on such a basic and elementary Wikipedian principle. Mediation has not succeeded and rather I think arbitration is in order.

<dd>Well look at if from their point of view. Theyve been over this a thousand times, but they are still holding to the view that Cosby is an immaterial source as far as linguistics is concerned. For them, the context is the study of language, not the common discourse or misconceptions. Those dont need to be explained or dealt with. Where I agree with them, the pompous airs notwithstanding, is that some consensus on the article's development has to take precedence over someone with an agenda who wants to make a point rather than explain things. Face it, you do come across as someone with a WP:POINT , even if I think NPOV backs you up in this case to some limited extent. In that respect it would be best if you left it alone, or sought help from the Arbcom based on OWN and NPOV. Even though NPOV might favor inclusion, their greater focus will be on the matter of your POINT. Naturally the other side feels personally attacked by attacks on AAVE, and as such the discussion for the most part been polarised and noncomunicative. You're speaking different languages. The language of cultural poltics and the language of linguistics are different enough to be scary to the other.</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately youre not approaching this from a sociological view. It may be better to focus on studying the area you are interested in more, and approach it from a sociological perspective. It is of course ironic that Wikipedia loves memes, and the Cosby comments are no doubt a meme of sorts. You would think that your opposition would know well enough how to deal with such comments such that they could write enough context to frame them. But that gets into the discussion of whether Cosby is ignorant - something they naturally dont want to deal with, because for all his claimed ignorance, Cosbys comments represent a view which is popular, or at least funny.

<dd>Im not so sure. I suspected not, but chose to suspend that assessment in accordance with AGF etc. For example what do you mean by "prevent undue weight?" What weight can a trivial piece of info like the Cosby bite have in relation to the formal study of how languages evolve. It has relevance, no doubt, but unless its framed in <b>precisely the right way</b> its easy to see that piece of information as extraneous. If you are not approaching the subject from a neutral point of view then everything you add will appear suspect. I suggested adding context simply because that would require you and them to meet in the middle on the issue of social context. If they are not interested in that aspect, its incumbent upon you and your language skills to make its relevance apparent to them. I for one am not going to make that task a priority. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 09:30, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Cosby quote is far from trivial. I would like more emphasis on it and more emphasis on criticism of the use of AAVE but it seems the other editors don't. "preventing undue weight" means making the implication in the article(by refraining from putting anything contrary) that there is no controversy surrounding AAVE and there are no people who critique it's use. What the other editors are "interested" in is not my concern. My concern is making this article neutral. My concern is the readers.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 09:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm reluctant to see the discussion go to the wayside without the potential for an easy compromise. There is no doubt that discussion of AAVE as "unrefined" is notable. However, the closest the article comes to discussing the "controversy" is discussion of Oakland, yet the situation in Oakland was purely one of educational standards and treating "Ebonics" as an individual language. It had nothing to do with social criticisms of AAVE.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cosby has long been a critic of certain social mores prominent in poor African-American communities, including so-called excessive childbearing, failure to refrain from AAVE use, and reliance on welfare. Now, ignoring for the moment the question of his authority on the matter, he is lending a voice to a very real controversy: people think that AAVE sounds "ignorant" and bidialectal users should not use it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best solution here is to provide an accurate summary of the real issues at hand. There is a <b>non-academic</b> belief that AAVE is "unsophisticated" and "ignorant." A proper encyclopedic entry would discuss that view and detail the division between experts in linguistics and the general population. This is an excellent example of when the uneducated public is simply wrong, and this article would be lacking if it failed to address this point.</p>
<p>Then Wikidudeman can throw his Cosby reference out there and those who know the facts surrounding AAVE use can demonstrate that it is not "ignorant," "unsophisticated," or whatnot. This article can discuss the controversy more than what is found in the last paragraph of the "Social Context" section, and we can all get on with our lives and have a better Wikipedia at the end.</p>

<dd>There is no Cosby quote to remove from the article right now. If you mean mention of Cosby then I can agree to that. I'm not of the opinion that mention of Cosby should be altogether removed but you are sadly incorrect if you think that omitting mention of him would remove neutrality. There is already mention (although scant) of the social context and Cosby is simply the only example. This is much more a matter of depth, not neutrality, and even if it were, Cosby is not going to fix that. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 14:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I probably have no more appetite for reading through that stuff than you have, Dude Man.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I remember, you seemed to start by saying there was something seriously wrong with AAVE and that Cosby gave voice to this idea: that (i) to say AAVE was inherently as good a language/lect as any other was to express a pro-AAVE opinion and (ii) to show that it was "unsophisticated", "rudimentary", etc. was to express an anti-AAVE opinion of more or less equal significance in a "controversy" over AAVE.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If this were indeed so, then not mentioning the alleged "rudimentary" nature of AAVE and its lack of "sophistication" would indeed constitute a breach of neutrality in coverage of the "controversy". The trouble is that nobody except those who are doggedly ignorant<span style="background-color:transparent; color:#c00">*</span> still believes that it's a matter of opinion. It's not mere opinion, it's theory; and it's theory only in the sense that evolution is theory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#c00">*</span> You may get the impression that I think you are ignorant of these matters. If so, I regret to say that you're right. I don't like to be under this impression. I'd be happy if this impression evaporated. Yes, do please prove me wrong: <i>please tell me which books you have read about AAVE.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, do you concede that there is no such "controversy" over the quality of AAVE (which in itself does not imply that there are no controversies surrounding AAVE), or are you the linguistics equivalent of a creationist or flat-earther?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The former, I hope and for now presume. Now we move on to another reason you have given for quoting Crosby: that regardless of the quality of what he said, he is "notable" and it got into the news and therefore it too is "notable". I disagree with that too, but just for the extent of this one paragraph I'll concede that you're right here. How is its omission a breach of neutrality?

My response: Rubbish, I feel nothing of the sort. But anyway this kind of thing is not debatable.

(If I want US humor, I'll take Pryor or Colbert.) Sure I can deal with a discussion of whether Cosby is ignorant: so far as he is even understandable, either (i) he is ignorant, or (ii) he's acting ignorant (I really don't care which). But he's not very understandable, and this alone is sufficient reason for his comments not to merit attention. I can frame Cosby's comments, but I really don't see that they merit the effort. Why?

<li>SV says: <i>What weight can a trivial piece of info like the Cosby bite have in relation to the formal study of how languages evolve.</i> That's not exactly how I'd phrase it, but it's good.</li>
<li>SV says: <i>You're speaking different languages. The language of cultural poltics and the language of linguistics are different enough to be scary to the other.</i> Not true. I've been reading Baugh's book <i>Beyond Ebonics</i>; it combines both. I happen to have studied sociology, which is relevant to cultural politics.

<p>You talk of contexts. Right then, the contexts are those of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a conspicuous basilect (and basilects are stigmatized)</li>
<li>a conspicuous ethnolect (and the US remains racist)</li>
<li>generations of ridicule of Black talk</li>
<li>increasing understanding of lects among those who actually read (and write) books about them</li>
<li>popular ignorance of, or ignoring of, code-switching</li>
<li>de facto segregation of US education (worse, failure even to honor <i>Plessy v Ferguson</i>) and chronic poor educational opportunities for Blacks</li>
<li>recognition of particular problems in the acquisition of literacy by Black kids</li>
<li>innovative attempts to overcome these problems</li>
<li>the intellectually dubious (if well intentioned) formulation of the [original] notion of "Ebonics", with its rather unfortunate naming</li>
<li>the rush to ridicule "Ebonics" (in more or less its original meaning), largely by those who show little sign of knowing what it's about</li>
<li>the lazy misunderstanding (or deliberate misrepresentation) of what the proponents of "Ebonics" (in the original sense of the word) actually wanted in schools</li>
<li>chronic tension between assimilationist and separatist factions within Black US society</li>
<li>the correct understanding that recognition of "Ebonics" (meaning AAVE) as a distinct first language would cost US education systems a pile of money</li>
<li>rosy myths about the ease with which earlier generations of people speaking different languages or lects learned standard English and integrated within mainstream US society</li>
<li>anti-intellectualism in American life [hmm, that phrase has a familiar ring to it], and the lack of interest in reading or hearing what actual linguists (etc) would say about AAVE, and the dismissal of these people as pointy-heads, etc.; the insistence by those who haven't read and thought that the truthiness as revealed to them by their moms, TV stars, tabloids, etc., is as worthy as are facts approached by others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just a few of the contexts, off the top of my head. Given a few hours, I might tinker with them, aggregating one or two, deleting one or two, adding more. And even after that, I might not have got them right: I don't claim to know all the answers on the status of AAVE and am open to intelligent arguments. I'm sure that, given time, the contexts can be reformulated and summarized by people who are at least averagely intelligent, well read, and energetic.

<dd>? If so, note that he/she has just retained the earlier source, possibly checking it to make sure that this new bit is in it, possibly not.

<dl>
<dd>Putting aside your very reasonable point about concentrating on the mesolect, this way of referencing sucks. What we have here is an entire book (likely to have at least 200 pages), within which perhaps just one unspecified page says what an earlier editor claimed it says, and which may or may not also say what Topses implies that it says.</dd>

<dd>Yeah, Wardhaugh is a sociolinguistics text that deals very briefly with the phonological features of AAVE. Topses' edits contradict the source (which may itself be inaccurate).

<p>I've fixed (?) it according to Green. Green says flatly that word-initial /θ/ is realized as [θ], which disagrees with Wardhaugh (as he/she is (mis?)cited) and certainly accords with my own casual impressions of AAVE. Disappointingly, Green doesn't comment on the difference between realizations of the two SE "th" phonemes as (a) interdental or (b) plosive. (Perhaps it's in part a geographical matter, but she doesn't say.) Green also says nothing about lengthening the vowel.</p>

<p>Sorry to ask what may seem like a dumb question, but in a sentence like "Ain't no white cop gonna put his hands on me," (I took this example from <i>Linguistics: An Introduction</i> by Radford <i>et al.</i>) does <i>ain't</i> mean "there isn't" or "doesn't"? Also, somebody included the example "I ain't know that". Can <i>ain't</i> be used instead of <i>didn't</i> in any construction or are there constraints on its use? The Merriam-Webster writes that <i>ain't</i> used for <i>don't</i>, etc. is restricted to <i>some</i> varieties of Black English.

<p>Must mean "there isn't": i.e., there is no white cop capable of/who would dare&#160;; I would never suffer any white cop to, etc. The other example sounds regional. Moulv i 00:25, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The idea that AAVE is a "degradation of English", although commonly held by the public, is rejected by linguists. See citations elsewhere in the article (such as Labov) for this. Perhaps the word "unfounded" is a poor choice. But as it stands, the text is more informative than without it. Readers should know what is merely a popular belief, and it is possible and desirable for an encyclopedia to reflect the facts here. Please find a better formulation conveying this information to the reader rather than just doing away with "unfounded". <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeldl_5ca1.html" title="User:Joeldl">Joeldl</a> 04:04, 20 March 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeldl_5ca1.html" title="User:Joeldl">Joeldl</a> 04:04, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that the anonymous user's comment "The point is, 99% of us blacks know proper English. So don't think that this is the way we speak all the time." highlights a muddle in the article that <i>may</i> be one reason some people think it is inaccurate. I do not think the article is inaccurate as such (but I am no expert either) but it is <i>limited</i>. Specifically, the article takes the perspective of <a href="../../../d/e/s/Descriptive_linguistics.html" title="Descriptive linguistics">descriptive linguistics</a> and as Futurebird says seems to do a pretty good job of providing a scientific account of AAVE. What it does <i>not</i> do is provide the perspective of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociolinguistics.html" title="Sociolinguistics">sociolinguistics</a>. Whereas descriptive linguistics looks at the phonology, morphology, and syntax of a dialect/language, sociolinguistics looks at the behavior of members of a speech community (i.e. how an actual group of people use language). from a sociolinguist's point of view, what the anonymous user I quote above is saying is that 99% of blacks (more precisely, speakers of AAVE) are also fluent speakers of "standard" (or whatever) English and are skilled at code-switching. This was documented by sociolinguist <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Labov_e0da.html" title="William Labov">William Labov</a> and several of his students who researched AAVE. I am sorry I cannot provide any citations - I can look into it. The question for active editors on this article is, do you want the article to limit itself to a descriptive linguistics account, and leave the sociolinguistics of AAVE for another article, or should both be here? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 15:23, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Peter Auer, ed. <i>Code Switching in Conversation</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The point of course is not that there is a "proper" English which Blacks do or do not know. The point is that like most languages English exists only in the form of many different dialects (each equally "good" at being a language) and that many Blacks are competent (meaning, have mastery in the rules that enable one to produce intelligible utterences) in more than one of these dialects.</dd>

<dd>This kind of subject certainly belongs in WP. I think that if this article does justice to it and other matters, the article will need to be broken up, but that would not necessarily be a bad thing.</dd>

<dd>I haven't studied discourse (anything above the sentence level) or sociolinguistics and I'm neither well qualified to work on this aspect of AAVE or (sorry) particularly interested. (One can only be particularly interested in so much.) But I'd very much welcome the input of other editors who have read up and fully digested worthwhile, reliable sources, who know what they're talking about, and who will cite their sources. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:41, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This chart isn't really very useful. AAVE has a very different aspect system than standard English, so many of these forms have no direct equivalent in AAVE. Also, your examples are all quite formal. For example, simple future would more likely be "I'm going to walk" than "I will walk" in everyday speech. The above unsigned post is a perfect example of the mindset we're trying to avoid with this article.

<p>Try to think of it this way. Imagine a hypothetical person standing somewhere who speaks only, say, <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_American_db80.html" title="General American">General American</a>. And he or she says, "I'll walk to the store." Now replace that hypothetical person with a different hypothetical person who has the same <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_mood.html" title="Grammatical mood">mood/intent</a> and is in the same circumstances and is identical except that he or she speaks only AAVE. What would that person say? Once we know this, we can fill in the simple future row.

<dd>While it may be useful to some people, I think putting a chart like this in the article would be a bad idea, because it is an oversimplification. For example, for StEng "I'm walking", AAVE could have "I'm walkin" or "I be walkin" with different meanings that both fit under the StEng equivalent. For the present perfect "I done walked" and "I bin walked" both fit into StEng "I have walked", again with different meanings. It's better to simply define these forms for themselves than to try to "translate" them into StEng. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> 03:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
