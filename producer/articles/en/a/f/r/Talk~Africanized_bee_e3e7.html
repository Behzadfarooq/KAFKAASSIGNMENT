<p>Removed the two tips below because they apply to wasps, not to honeybees (Africanized or otherwise). 1) Honeybees do not nest in the ground. 2a) Honeybees very, very rarely seek out sodas. The carbonation, acids and other ingredients make them very unattractive to honeybees. 2b) Even if a honeybee were trapped, it would not sting to get out of the soda can because the act of stinging will kill the bee. Honeybees sting to defend the queen or the hive. They almost never sting while foraging.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested, these comments can be pasted into the appropriate article about wasps. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a></p>

<p>The low freqency sounds of an engine driven mower can be especially disturbing to bees. Look around for swarms or nests before starting. Yellowjackets will often nests in holes in dry ground.</p>

<p>People are often stung on the lips or throat (a potentially dangerous sting) when returning to a neglected can of soda pop. Often a bee or wasp will enter the can and be unable to exit.</p>

<p>Changed paragraph regarding evolution of aggressiveness/defensiveness of African (not Africanized) bees. Previous version emphasized human actions over environmental forces; replaced "selective breeding" with "natural selection". <a href="../../../j/h/c/User%7EJHCC_e2b8.html" title="User:JHCC">JHCC</a> 20:24, 18 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Selective Breeding is a good thing Look we can get a very superior bee if we gentled down the Africanized bee but not to much since the anger management issue of the Africanized bee makes it what it is. So breeding is okay but let some of the bad selections escape into the wild so that they can turn into a new style of bees so there is a greater but significantly wider choice for beekeepers.</p>

<p>Leonard (or anyone else), can you cite references for your paragraph on "assassin" bees? When they were first released in the Americas, this was the story that went around, but, as I recall, it was later determined to be more myth than fact. Please support this, if it is really true.

<dl>
<dd>I had a long discussion with our local international bee expert - a retired engineer and beekeeper, he has traveled to South Africa and Brazil and is well aquainted with both bee lore and bee facts. I have rewritten the paragraph to couch it as lore, rather than fact, and have substatiated the lore with supporting facts - facts provided by to me by this expert. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 03:21, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

If there is an assasin bee I would vote for wasp or hornets even though they aren't bees (most non bee-keepers don't know much of the difference any way) but the Apis Scutellata are a more aggresive defensive bee than any thing and also want more land to get food just like the conquers of America in the 15 century.</p>

<dd>1. It looks so nearly identical to the European bees that it takes either a complex series of measurements under a microscope, or a DNA analysis, to determine which is which. In other words, you can't tell the difference in a picture. 2.-An alternative answer -- if I ever get back to an Africanized bee area, Wikipedia WILL have a picture.

<p>Yes, I read it in german. It's exactly like you said or translated. Brother Adam didn't know either. He didn't have the tools that we have now in terms of genetically identifying a subspecies. The new gene identification tools may bring some changes.

I'm sure we have something like that already. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lengis (<a href="../../../l/e/n/User_talk%7ELengis_8ee0.html" title="User talk:Lengis">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lengis_9142.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lengis">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>They are not that dangerous. The media makes money playing to people's fears but choose to ignore that many people successfully live side-by-side with Africanized bees (first in Africa and for decades now in Central America). They are somewhat more aggressive than European honeybees but still less aggressive than your average yellowjacket.</li>
<li>Anything you use to kill them wholesale will also inevitably kill beneficial insects. It is actually incredibly hard to create a chemical weapon that is narrowly targeted. Most chemicals affect entire phyla. It is virtually impossible to develop something targeted to a single species.
<ul>
<li>To make matters much worse, remember that you're not even trying to narrow to a single species - you are talking about a single race. It would be like trying to find something to affect <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Shepherd_Dog_83e7.html" title="German Shepherd Dog">German Shepherds</a> but not <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labrador_Retriever_e5a5.html" title="Labrador Retriever">Labrador Retrievers</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any chemical weapon of that sort will also do drastic harm to other animals (including humans). See, for example, the lessons of <a href="../../../d/d/t/DDT_2889.html" title="DDT">DDT</a>.

<dd>You have some points, but I should correct you on DDT. DDT has never been known to be toxic to humans. They even conducted a test where a group of people injested a certain amount of the chemical every day for about a year or so. No side effects occured at all.
<dl>
<dd>My example was unclear. My point was that such chemicals have demonstrated significant unintended consequences in other animals (of which, humans may or may not be one). The toxicity of DDT to raptors and fish is well documented. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 18:00, 12 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, DDT has caused harmful side effects to birds of prey, and fish. But it's also a fact that DDT saved the lives of millions of people due to the culling of mosquito populations in the countries it was used in, and as a result, cases of malaria went down drastically. If the goal justifies the means, then the negative aspects are negligible.</dd>

<p>I have been very successful in eradicating several bee colonies on my property. The first one was a large hive in an enclosed ceiling over my deck. It was about six feet by nine feet by six inches. I came up with a simple idea to get rid of them. I put the nozzle of a shop vac right at the entrance. All the bees came out to defend the nest and were promptly sucked in. All the bees out in the field came in and tried to attack the offending hazard to the nest and were also sucked up. After about two hours there was no further activity. While the nozzle was in place the bees were not interested in anything but the entrance to the hive. No one got stung and no bees came afterwards. There was about five gallons of dead bees in the canister.</p>
<p>I have eradicated several other hives in the same manner. It has worked on hives of all kinds and sizes I have encountered. It has occurred to me that for larger nests, a vactor truck could even be used.</p>
<p>Although I have no reason to believe the bees I used it on were Africanized, I suspect that being even more aggressive, they would be just as likely to attack the offending nozzle as a priority to defend the nest, if not more so.</p>
<p>The method is selective in that it targets only the specific hive and is pretty much eco-friendly. No poisons, no innocent victims. It's also cheap. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by FAMiller (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_FAMiller_5742.html" title="Special:Contributions/FAMiller">contribs</a>) 01:17, 10 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Professionals will sometimes use a variation of that technique as a start but tend not to use it as the only means to remove the colony. First, it will only remove the guard bees. The queen, some nurse bees and whatever field bees were out of the nest when you do your vacuuming will still be left and might be able to reestablish the colony. Second, if the colony was inside the walls of a structure (like the siding of a house) and if you <i>are</i> successful at killing off the colony you still have a sticky mess inside the walls. The honey and rotting larvae will attract other pests, some of which are much worse than the bees. The moisture in the walls is also really hard on plaster and drywall.</dd>
<dd>By the way, I've never heard of a colony of honeybees that could support 5 gallons of bees. A really healthy swarm <i>might</i> be a gallon or so - the full colony no more than double that. If you really had a colony that productive, then it was a shame to have to kill them. Are you sure it was honeybees? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 06:41, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I read somewhere that killer bees will never go above the southern 1/3 of the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, but I just read here that they may be able to survive <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter.html" title="Winter">winter</a> climates. You see, I live up in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a>, and I'd like to know if they'll ever get up here. Personally, I'd be more comfortable with <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobra.html" title="Cobra">Cobras</a> living here than killer bees living here. Sgt. Bond 18:44, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, I'd urge you to read up on the actual behaviors of Africanized honeybees. The name "killer bee" is far more media hype than reality. Mexico, for example, is not in danger of being depopulated just because the Africanized honeybees have driven out essentially all the European honeybees. Beekeepers have to adapt their management techniques but still many beekeepers still keep bees in fully Africanized areas.</dd>
<dd>As another point of reference, Africanized bees are about as aggressive as <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowjacket.html" title="Yellowjacket">yellowjackets</a>. (Arguably, less aggressive but it depends who you talk to.) More people die each year from yellowjacket stings than <u>all</u> the deaths ever traced to Africanized honebees. Yellowjacket nests are common all across North America but you never hear about them.</dd>
<dd>Your core question, though, was whether you will see Africanized bees in New England. Africanized bees are still generally thought to have more trouble overwintering than European strains in areas with long, cold winters. Because they are more likely to abscond (find a new home part-way through the summer, which means abandoning any stores they've built up so far), they tend to go into winter with less stores. They also tend to consume their stores at different rates through the winter than the other races of bees. So unless they are artificially supported (with supplemental food or a particularly protected micro-climate), I would not expect to see an Africanized colony survive up north on a regular basis. But the research on that is still being developed. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 21:00, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, that reassures me a bit more. I did also read that the term "killer bee" was just hype. However, whether <a href="../../../b/e/e/Bee.html" title="Bee">bee</a> or <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wasp.html" title="Wasp">wasp</a>, I am very afraid of stinging insects due to being stung by one in the 1st grade. Now that I know more than I did then, I guess I'm more afraid of wasps (also <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hornet.html" title="Hornet">hornets</a> &amp; <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowjacket.html" title="Yellowjacket">yellowjackets</a> because I know that bees produce useful items such as <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honey.html" title="Honey">honey</a> (mmmm...honey) &amp; <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beeswax.html" title="Beeswax">beeswax</a>, but I know of no useful items produced by wasps. Seriously, what good have wasps done us, eh? Name me <i>at least</i> 1 useful item produced by wasps (besides paper, because I don't think <a href="../../../p/a/p/Paper_wasp.html" title="Paper wasp">paper wasps</a> actually produce paper). P.S., Wikipedia rules! You're the man, Jimbo! Sgt. Bond 18:47, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>During the spring and early summer, most wasps are predators, keeping the population of many other insects under control. Some of those other insects are harmful to humans or to crops. At other points in their lives, wasps are pollinators of certain plants - sometimes very specialized pollinators and no other insect will do. So, yes, wasps do perform a useful service to humans. (But I still don't want them building their nest in the walls of my house.) <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small></dd>
