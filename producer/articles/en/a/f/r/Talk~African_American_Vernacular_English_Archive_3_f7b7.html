<p>I removed the questionable claim that multiple negation “can be traced to West African languages”—indeed, I’m sure there are many West African languages that use double negatives (that ain’t my area of expertise) but many, many other other non-standard Englishes (to which the first American black speakers of English would have been exposed) also do. And don’t other dialects of English similarly use “to be” without conjugation?</p>

<p>This article seems to have a lot of controversy, so I just thought I'd explain my edits, so they don't seem malicious.</p>
<p>I changed the line on code switching, because it sounded like it was saying code switching is only using different dialects for different social groups. Every time I've heard it used before, it was in reference to bilingual people switching back to their native language in a foreign country for convience (frequently in mid sentence) This seems to be the more common usuage of the word. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAltarbo_e672.html" title="User:Altarbo">Altarbo</a> 05:40, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Metathesis</span></h2>
<p>Are there other common examples of metathesis apart from ask becoming aks? I ask because that particular example is not restricted at all the AAVE - it goes back to Old English. If we're only talking about isolated examples like that, then it's probably wrong to include metathesis as a feature of AAVE specifically - all English speakers do (and have done) it from time to time. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarik_9c52.html" title="User:Garik">garik</a> 23:52, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You know, garik, good point. I've heard <i>aks</i> is inherited from non-standard forms of English, and was part of prestige dialects as late as, like, the 18th century or something. In fact my first encounter with it was from a white kid. Accordingly, I'm excising that li'l tidbit. —<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWiki_Wikardo_6749.html" title="User talk:Wiki Wikardo">Wiki Wikardo</a> 20:24, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, as Garik correctly pointed out, <i>aks</i> is inherited from standard Anglo-Saxon. If anything, <i>ask</i> is the metathesized form inherited from substandard dialects. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 20:35, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, but if you check an etymological dictionary, you'll find that <i>graps</i> is Old English as well. Apparently that was originally the only form, though both were current in Middle English. Of course, many aspects of AAVE are shared with other dialects. Maybe we could add something like 'retention of non-standard <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metathesis.html" title="Metathesis">metathesised</a> forms like...' I know that technically the standard forms are the result of metathesis, but that may be unnecessarily pedantic for this article. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarik_9c52.html" title="User:Garik">garik</a> 09:09, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Because it might be. We don't know for sure that they're <i>not</i> examples of metathesis; just because they're in Old English doesn't mean they didn't arise anew in AAVE. The other thing is that there must be other examples of non-standard archaisms retained in or borrowed into AAVE, and it's a bit weird to only have two examples that look like metathesis (besides, if it's not metathesis, it shouldn't be listed under phonology). So we either keep 'metathesis' plus health warning or we stick them in with some other archisms (though not under the heading of Phonology). For now, the first option seems best to me.

<p>This article analyses the grammar and phonetics of ebonics in a way that would be completly incomprehensible to anyone who speaks that language. Similar to when a bunch of white men get together and transcribe Coltrane solos, then write "jazz education" essays about what he was "going for" at the time.</p>
<p>Ebonics is not some well-conceived design of a language. It's an accident--the natural evolution (or degeneration)of American English as spoken by African Americans over many years--and shouldn't be presented as anything else. To dissect the grammatical variations of this speach pattern is to miss the point completely. This language is entirely based on NOT understanding the rules of grammer, and on making mistakes and keeping them in the language. No one sat down and designed any of the rules that this article focuses on, and if you discussed this with a native Ebonics speaker, he wouldn't have the first clue what you're talking about.</p>
<p>This article is written about Ebonics, by people who don't speak Ebonics, for people who don't speak Ebonics. Solid.</p>

Most research articles are written from the etic perspective, that is the prespective of the researcher. Second, all language develops by modifying old grammar rules or creating new ones; and almost never is this done intentionally and willfully. AAVE does use a different grammar, which has roots in English (among others). But to say it is simply English misunderstood is not more correct than to say American English is really Latin misunderstood.</dd>
<dd>For example, I can say "I wrote an agenda for the meeting." However, the word <i>Agenda</i> is plural in Latin (singular Agendum); over time people have made it singular in English. This does not mean that English speakers are incorrect; they have simply modified usages over time. AAVE is no different. --<a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeaDrinker_0ad2.html" title="User:TeaDrinker">TeaDrinker</a> 19:58, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only languages that may have completely explicated grammars are ones that have been constucted. All descriptive grammars of 'naturally occuring' languages are in fact assembled by deriving the rules from examples of the language in use. The idea that Ebonics is somehow a dengenerative form of English because a written grammer doesn't exist belies this fact. However, I do think Ebonics might be something of a special case because of its perhaps unique origins and its widespread use. It seems to shares attributes (to my laymen's mind) with creoles, a class-based dialect, and perhaps a cant( in that it may be used by the minority to exclude the majority). <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 20:05, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regional (i.e., southern) slant to definition of AAVE?</span></h2>
<p>The definition and the application of AAVE seems to associate with southern African-Americans and descendents of southern African-Americans. Does the definition of AAVE <i>not</i> apply to those African-American individuals whose roots were principally outside of the south, such as individuals whose ancestors lived in the north prior to 1865? Perhaps some of the speech of these individuals might be measured in communities having concentrations of such individuals, e.g., <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oak_Bluffs_76bb.html" title="Oak Bluffs">Oak Bluffs</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nantucket_Island_e962.html" title="Nantucket Island">Nantucket Island</a>, off <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Cod_3538.html" title="Cape Cod">Cape Cod</a>, Massachusetts.

<dd>Regional slant? You bet there is! I am African American, but I remember nearly falling out of my chair each morning when our (White) assistant principal read the "Mo'nin 'nountmint'" every day over the loudspeaker. It sounded like a defective P.A. system, but when the next speaker (usually a student volunteer) took over the mike, it came through just fine. There was not static in the system; it was all in the man's Ca'lineh Low Contreh accent. This is the accent that I hear in a large number of African Americans in the Washington, D.C. area. (Remember Marion Barry talking about the District of Columbia's 'Amalas suvis?' being slow to respond to 'emuj'cies?' Black, White, Indian immigrant - That's just the Carolinas, which is also the source of the some of the more colorful content of the speech. I have Black and White relatives from the low country; their accents are indistinguishable. And charming. An somtahm dowhrah lahius. (Say it a few times, you'll get it). Also, some of the colloquial speech and idioms of Southern African Americans show up in mainstream Southern folklore (e.g., 'They's people dyin' ain't never died before!' after a rough spell, or 'I feel like somethin' sent fo' and couldn't come.')</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>AAVE is often erroneously perceived by members of mainstream American society as indicative of low intelligence or limited education. Furthermore, as with many other non-standard dialects and especially creoles, AAVE sometimes has been called "lazy" or "bad" English by those unfamiliar with creolization, or the role of null phonemes, or by those who do not understand AAVE's use of aspect for tense in some cases. Such appraisals also may be due, in part, to racial or ethnic bias. However, among linguists there is no such controversy</i><sup>[citation needed]</sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems that the editor who put that {{fact}} tag there wants evidence for the lack of a controversy.</p>
<p>Somewhere there may indeed be an authoritative book whose author credibly asserts that there is no controversy. But I don't think authors of related books would bother to say this. And they don't bother because they routinely, straightforwardly and convincingly demonstrate how AAVE is not "bad". Or anyway, it's easy to show people who are willing to read and consider the arguments presented in three pages or so of text. You'll find one example on pp 29-31 of the Morrow hardback (first) edition of Pinker's <i>The Language Instinct.</i> (The pagination of a paperback is probably different. Well, look near the start of chapter two.) In fact Pinker isn't even a linguist (he's a psychologist), but no linguist is likely to disagree with him here.</p>
<p>If there is a controversy among actual, working, present-day linguists (as opposed to linguists of decades ago, or people from other specialties dipping their toes in linguistics, or the occasional prematurely senile linguist, etc.), where is it? Until this controversy is shown, I'm deleting this request for a citation. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 10:29, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd be surprised if there was a controversy, for the simple reason that the question whether a particular way of speaking is "bad" is not open to scientific investigation. Any discussion presented in the language of morality ("bad English" vs. "good English") cannot reasonably be resolved by a rational argument, hence it's not something that scholars or scientists worry about. One has to take one step back and ask whether people have certain attitudes about AAVE (which they certainly do) to be firmly within the realm of the behavioral sciences: describing which groups of a population hold the belief that AAVE is or isn't "good English" is a valid scientific endeavor; trying to determine authoritatively what is and isn't "good English" is not. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 01:23, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Crack open any introductory linguistics text, especially a sociolinguistics one, and they're bound to say very early on about how there is no good or bad language.

<p>Well said, with very minor reservations. (Linguists can and do point out and discuss problems with the way particular people speak. See the literature on specific language impairment, for example. But they don't assert that sociolects are linguistically deficient.) I'm tired of the demand to give any space to any contrary "point of view" that's merely the recycling of ignorance, perhaps encouraged by the effusions of blowhards who often pride themselves on their lack of curiosity. There are indeed very big questions in linguistics (for example, nativism has recently come under intelligent and reasoned attack), and for these, contrary points of view should be presented; there's no comparable question here. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:40, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the AAVE word "bogus" comes from the Latin word "bogus" which is cognate with the English word "bogus". Either that or every word of AAVE is actually derrived from various Niger-Congo Group A language words which are both homonymous and synonymous with English by pure coincidence. Perhaps this is a situation that calls for Ockham's razor.</p>

<p>Something in this article stinks of not following NPOV. Take the following example:</p>
<p>"Despite the clear linguistic evidence, the American public and policymakers remain divided over whether to even recognize AAVE as a legitimate dialect of English, perhaps due to unfounded feelings that AAVE is a degradation of the English (which may, in turn, be an indication of underlying racial determinism)."</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure about calling the evidence "clear," though what concerns me more is the accusation of public feelings as being "unfounded." 67.9.36.176 16:16, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The evidence, at a bare minimum, is simply the linguistic definitions of <i>accent</i>, <i>dialect</i>, and <i>language</i>. I suppose they are unfounded because there's really no evidence to indicate that it is a "degradation" of English any more than modern English is a degradation of Old English. Do you have a better word than <i>unfounded</i>? <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 22:54, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV Concern</span></h2>
<p>Reading through this article, I can't help but feel that it was written with a distinct pro-AAVE bias. The following lines especially struck me as non-neutral:</p>
<p><i>Furthermore, as with many other non-standard dialects and especially creoles, AAVE sometimes has been called "lazy" or "bad" English. Such appraisals may be due, in part, to racial or ethnic bias. However, among linguists there is no such controversy, since AAVE, like all dialects, shows consistent internal logic and structure.</i></p>
<p>To dismiss negative appraisals of AAVE as being due to racial or ethnic bias (even with the "in part" thrown in as some sort of disclaimer) is, in my opinion, irresponsible and even a bit dangerous. I'd like to know which published study or paper found that, without a doubt, "racial or ethnic bias" was behind some people's opposition to AAVE.</p>
<p><i>The overwhelming controversy and debates concerning AAVE in public schools insinuate the deeper, more implicit deterministic attitudes towards the African-American community as a whole.</i></p>
<p>Insinuations, especially ones that explain away opposition to a topic by accusing those opposed of "deterministic attitudes towards the African-American community as a whole," have no place in an encyclopedia. Such insinuations (assumptions, whatever you want to call them) are very dangerous in a politically- and racially-sensitive article such as this one. Statements like this really need to be cited, or else omitted altogether.</p>
<p>Finally, I noticed that something written by Smitherman was cited quite frequently throughout this article; however, the source was not correctly &amp; explicitly cited in the References section. Without the actual Smitherman article to read, I can only assume that it is also written with a strong pro-AAVE bias.</p>
<p>In light of these issues, I've very tempted to tag this article with an NPOV warning. I'll wait for responses to my comments before doing so.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong - despite these concerns, I still found the article to be thorough, informative &amp; well-written. It definitely answered my questions. <a href="../../../r/h/r/User%7ERhrad_5e7f.html" title="User:Rhrad">Rhrad</a> 16:23, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I absolutely disagree with the contention that opposition and criticism of AAVE has to be racist. It is a fact that AAVE is rudimentary compared to basic English. The complexity of AAVE words are limited and you rarely see polysyllabic words used in AAVE. It is also true that the vast majority of AAVE speakers are uneducated and come from urban areas. Criticizing AAVE for it’s lack of complexity and ability to effectively deliver complex ideas has absolutely nothing to do with “race”. I also see absolutely nothing in this article about the fact that a large number of Caucasians also speak something very similar to AAVE. Especially those who are interested in the so called “hip hop culture”.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 15:34, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I agree that opposition to recognition of AAVE is not necessarily racist, I disagree completely with the characterization of AAVE as "rudimentary". No modern linguist or even scientifically-oriented person should say that one speech form is 'rudimetary' while another is not. These valuations are based solely on history and sociology: if Blacks had enslaved and transported Whites to Africa, we might have a page about 'Caucasian-African Vernacular Swahili' (or any other African language) and someone would post about how simple and uneducated it is. Second, linguists recognize that all concepts conceivable by the human mind can be expressed in any language. Complex ideas can be effectively portrayed in any speech variety. Third, AAVE and 'Black slang' are not the same thing. The 'many Caucasians who speak something very similar to AAVE' are mostly copying this slang as part of hip-hop culture, as was noted in the previous post. AAVE is an independent variety of English with a distinct grammar from other forms of English. Fourth, to say that criticizing AAVE has nothing to do with "race" is like saying that criticizing Black music (jazz, blues, rock, funk, soul, the list goes on...) has nothing to do with race. AAVE is a central part of Black culture and identity: that's why almost all Blacks still speak it despite having lived amongst speakers of different White dialects for decades and being spread across the whole country. Fifth, saying that AAVE doesn't have polysyllabic words is a) irrelevant, and b) not true. Using polysyllabic words does not make you intelligent, or show your intelligence, or even sound better most of the time. Most style guides recommend using shorter words wherever possible. Whether a certain language variety uses polysyllabic words has nothing to do with its sophistication or intelligence. Chinese, for example, is overwhelmingly monosyllabic; does it also "lack...complexity and ability to effectively deliver complex ideas"? I don't believe that the previous poster was being consciously racist, just culturally insensitive. By looking at language in an unscientific manner, one can easily be caught by racist attitudes that prevail in society.</dd>

<dd>I'll refute what you said piece by piece. 1. I don't know any 'modern linguists' so I can't tell you what they would say but I myself am a scientifically-oriented person and I consider AAVE to be rudimentary English. However to make it easier for discussion I will say that what I mean to say is I consider AAVE to be "unsophisticated English" by the fact it is 'without complexity or refinements' compared to American English and British English. 2. What the hip hop artists and rappers use is a form of AAVE. It uses the same syntax and grammar. 3. Even assuming AAVE is a 'central part of African American culture" criticizing it doesn't have to have anything to do with race. 4.AAVE does NOT have many if any polysyllabic. People who speak AAVE tend to use simple words that can not convey much complex meaning. Give me one example of an AAVE polysyllabic word that isn't also a word in AmE or Bme. 5. I'm not saying that a language is unsophisticated due to lack of polysyllabic words. Chinese is a separate example due to it's number of words and it's grammar. It can't be compared to English.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 07:05, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>It is a fact that AAVE is rudimentary compared to basic English.</i> What is this "basic English"? Do you perhaps mean standard American English? And what do you mean by "rudimentary" -- morphologically impoverished, or something else? <i>The complexity of AAVE words are limited...</i> I'm a bit lost here. Can you tell me what the subject of this sentence is? "Complexity" perhaps? If so, it seems you've interestingly simplifed the paradigm of BE, so that the third-person singular as well as plural form is "are". Or are you taking the noun that's the closest antecedent to be the syntactic subject? Either way, most interesting! <i>[Y]ou rarely see polysyllabic words used in AAVE.</i> Really? I'd thought that the rap CDs I possess were in AAVE and that there were a lot of polysyllabic words in the lyrics. (Copyright considerations prevent me from reproducing a sample here.) <i>It is also true that the vast majority of AAVE speakers are uneducated and come from urban areas.</i> You're onto something with education: read <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Kozol_85e7.html" title="Jonathan Kozol">Jonathan Kozol</a>. And urban, yes. So? The vast majority of, say, Japanese speakers a couple of hundred years ago were uneducated; does this mean that their Japanese was rudimentary? Just what do you want to say about the relationship between language and education? <i>Criticizing AAVE for it’s</i> [sic] <i>lack of complexity and ability to effectively deliver complex ideas has absolutely nothing to do with “race”.</i> Really? What else has it got to do with? (Incidentally, the standard way to write the genitive pronoun is "its", no apostrophe. At least among the better educated.) <i>I also see absolutely nothing in this article about the fact that a large number of Caucasians also speak something very similar to AAVE.</i> That's a sad omission. I hope that it will be rectified by some intelligent person who has studied language. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:32, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1. It has nothing to do with 'race' because both African and Caucasian Americans use it. 2.

<dd>Do you dispute a claim that the overwhelming majority of speakers of AAVE are people normally termed African American? If so, I'd like to see your evidence (from a solid piece of sociolinguistics research, please). If not, then I think we can accept that AAVE has something to do with race. The opprobrium with which it's greeted may very well be something else too: African Americans are overrepresented in the US underclass, and urban lects are for some reason traditionally stigmatized; race aside, it's hardly surprising that this urban basilect is looked down on by some. <i>Criticizing my grammar due to 1 apostrophe and saying that it is how the "better educated" use it is not only desperate and pathetic but its</i> [sic] <i>also an example of you being in agreement with me.</i> I only criticize the linguistic abilities of those who gratuitously and uninformedly criticize that of others. This time you omitted an apostrophe that would be required in, say, any scientific journal; but apostrophe use is indeed a minor concern: it's merely a matter of orthography, unlike, say, your earlier <i>complexity ... are....</i> You are of course free to ascribe desperation and pathos to my comments. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:59, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, Wikidudeman, but being "scientifically oriented" is no substitute for <i>reading actual linguistic discourse</i> regarding AAVE and linguistics in general. Pointing out that scientific journals aren't published in AAVE completely neglects the complex sociolinguistic relationship that AAVE has with other dialects of English. While you and others certainly have an opinion regarding AAVE, it has no place in an article like this (which seeks to discuss linguistic aspects of this dialect) any more than my opinions on Australian English do on that dialect's page. Wikipedia is based on sources and unless you've got a scholarly source, the exclusion of "criticism" regarding AAVE usage (which doesn't exist btw) does not belong in the article. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 08:41, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The spelling mistake in 'rudimentary' was mine, though I agree that pointing out the mistake with its/it's is unnecessary. Many well-educated writers have difficulty with that rule, and the meaning was perfectly clear. That said, I disagree with nearly everything else Wikidudeman has posted. 1. You don't actually 'refute' my point in any way: <i>I myself am a scientifically-oriented person and I consider AAVE to be rudimentary English</i>. Find a legitimate linguist of the past fifty years who says that AAVE is a rudimentary form of English, then post your viewpoint with citations from that source. Many British English speakers feel that American English lacks 'complexity and refinements', and the French feel the same way about the British, etc. Everyone considers their speech form in some way better than others; this in itself is not necessarily a problem. The scientific study of language is meant to overcome these natural prejudices and allow us to learn more about other people and their cultures by learning about their language. People are of course free to make aesthetic judgements about languages, but to say that one is rudimentary compared to another is to belittle the culture of that language's speakers. 2. Perhaps I didn't explain properly what I meant about slang. Yes, rappers use AAVE, but the main elements picked up by Whites are the slang elements. Many older people with no interest in slang speak AAVE, and many Whites with little knowledge of AAVE use slang that has its origins in Black language nonetheless. 3. I must again stress that AAVE and Black culture are intrinsically tied to Black identity and are therefore connected to race. If someone were to say that the Indo-European language family is rudimentary compared to the Afro-Asiatic, or any other, this is an attack on European culture, and by definition, European identity. This issue is of course more sensitive for Black culture, because it has only been (partially) recognized as legitimate within the last 40-or-so years. 4. AAVE is a dialect of English and uses nearly all words that General American does. To exclude all these words from its vocabulary when searching for polysyllabics is ridiculous. How many polysyllabic words does General American have if you don't count all the ones that it shares with British English? And to say that AAVE words have simple meanings is also ridiculous. If anything, it is the wide range of meanings that AAVE applies to standard English words that separates it from other Englishes. The behaviour known as signifiying constantly applies new meanings to old words. This is also the way that slang works, and AAVE has been one of the greatest sources of slang in the US. Again, I must point out that linguists consider all languages (or language varieties) equally capable of conveying complex ideas. Since AAVE uses nearly all the same words as other Englishes, to say that it cannot convey the same meanings is nonsense. I am glad at least that Wikidudeman can recognize that Chinese is not rudimentary, despite is few polysyllabics; why then can't AAVE be recognized as a 'separate example'? I will keep my posts short if Wikidudeman stops providing me with material. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> 03:59, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> is missing an essential point. He's comparing the forms of AAVE that are most divergent from Standard English to formal varieties of Standard English, and calling them rudimentary. The thing is, the strongly divergent forms of Black English are always used in <i>informal</i> contexts. In formal contexts, Blacks in the US use forms of English that are closer to Standard English. I'm white, and when I'm speaking informally to friends, I don't use a lot of polysyllabic words, or use particularly complex grammatical constructions. In that sense, my English is every bit as "rudimentary" as AAVE. It just so happens that the simple grammatical constructions I use informally are <i>possible</i> in formal English, in which more complex ones are used as well, while some of the corresponding simple grammatical constructions used in informal AAVE are <i>not</i> possible in formal English. That doesn't mean that the more complex forms also present in formal Standard English are part of my everyday language. Just because a word like <i>plenipotentiary</i> exists in Standard English doesn't mean that I'll use it in the same informal contexts where AAVE is used. So I really think Wikidudeman is comparing apples and oranges, and being unfair to Blacks who use AAVE. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeldl_5ca1.html" title="User:Joeldl">Joeldl</a> 04:09, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't understand your particular dissatisfaction here. A quick look at the article shows that (i) for the most part it uses the author–page system (a well-established version of the author–year–page system), but (ii) it adds a couple of footnotes for sourcing. This combination of (i) and (ii) is odd, and for this reason alone (and perhaps for other reasons too) something needs to be done. But what are these citations that "seem to be based on numbers which have no corresponding link"? I suspect that you're referring to (i); but if so, this is odd, as it's a well-established system. (True, it doesn't agree with <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREF_ecd4.html" title="WP:REF">WP:REF</a>, but the latter is only a guideline, not a policy; and its recommended "Harvard referencing" is distinctly unhelpful when long papers or books are cited.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:42, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The first part of the first paragraph of the article says "About “80 to 90 percent of American blacks” speak AAVE “at least some of the time” (Smitherman 2". This type of referencing system is totally unhelpful if it doesn't provide any other information. Who is "Smitherman"? Where is his work found? What pages? Etc.

<dd>This criticism of yours is well founded. There's nothing wrong in principle with the method of citation, which is to page 2 of a work by Smitherman, but there's plenty wrong with all these citations of Smitherman's work, because, as you point out, it's not in the list of references. I'll try to go back through the history of the article (a dreary job, what with the number of times it has been edited unnecessarily) to find who mentioned Smitherman, and then write to that person.

<p>I'm aware that a number of editors say that the article is biased.

<p>Incidentally, I'm not happy with the article either. Here's an example, chosen pretty much at random: <i>For instance, if a child reads "He passed by both of them" as "he pass by bowf uh dem", a teacher must determine whether the child is saying passed or pass, since they are identical in AAVE phonology.</i> (i) Why transcribe in this way, in which for example the "w" in "bowf" exaggerates the oddness? (ii) Why neither mention that the /t/ is commonly dropped by speakers of fast standard English nor say that this is a feature of deliberate AAVE? (iii) How is this a matter of phonology rather than morphology? More broadly, I think an article about a lect of English should primarily discuss the features of that lect, whereas this article burbles on and on about the consternation that AAVE excites among certain non-speakers -- not a non-issue, but a side issue. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:14, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article gives undue weight to the contention that Ebonics should be accepted in everyday speech and is somehow equal in sophistication to proper English. This article contains no references or criticism of Ebonics in any shape or form. This article needs to contain information concerning criticism of use of Ebonics including facts that speakers of Ebonics are generally less educated than speakers of proper english. Some references could be Bill Cosbys "pounkcake speech". It's very shameful that this article does not even mention Cosby's criticism of Ebonics.

<dd>Oh really? I'll agree that it's expressive, but it's not expressive in the way Cosby probably intended. Let's take a look at it.
<dl>
<dd><i>I can’t even talk the way these people talk. “Why you ain’t where you is go, ra.”</i>
<dl>
<dd>(i) If we take him literally, he seems to have contradicted himself. Is this the way they talk? Then he's talked the way they talk. Is he <i>not</i> talking as they do? Then we don't have to pay attention to this bizarre example. (ii) I'm not familiar with any lect that's quite what's sampled here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>I don’t know who these people are.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Huh? Come again, Bill?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk. Then I heard the father talk. This is all in the house. You used to talk a certain way on the corner and you got into the house and switched to English.</i>
<dl>
<dd>If he's saying that the street corner black urban patois of his youth (more or less resembling AAVE of today) wasn't English, he's plain wrong; as is carefully explained in any of a great variety of elementary linguistics texts. Interestingly, though, he's admitted the possibility of code-switching.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>Everybody knows it’s important to speak English except these knuckleheads.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Bill, you knucklehead, AAVE <i>is</i> English.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>You can’t land a plane with, “Why you ain’t…”</i>
<dl>
<dd>You can and you can't. Tell it to any speaker of L1 American English, and he'll understand it as either "Why you aren't" or "Why you haven't", depending on what follows. I don't claim to be an expert in the language for communication with flight control, but I'd guess that "Why you ain't" is indeed a no-no. I'd guess further that most examples of fully grammatical, fully idiomatic, impeccably <i>standard</i> English are also no-no. That's because conversation at this point is highly formalized, a fact that's irrelevant to which lect one normally speaks.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>You can’t be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth.</i>
<dl>
<dd>(i) Calling a lect "crap" is at best a cheap way to get a laugh. (ii) I see no incompatibility between speaking AAVE and being a doctor. As even Cosby admits, people speaking nonstandard lects can and do code-switch. AAVE is just as good a tool for medicine as is any other lect, AAVE is just as good for communication with a fellow speaker of AAVE as (say) Boston English is for communication with a fellow speaker of Boston English; speakers of any lect can and do modify their speech according to interlocutor, situation and purpose.</dd>

<dd>Dude Man, AAVE is a matter of <i>language.</i> Language is in the province of <i>linguistics.</i> There is indeed considerable disagreement within linguistics, but no linguist I can think of trifles with views such as Cosby's, the wrongheadedness of whose little tirade is stunningly obvious to any intelligent adult who (unlike you, it seems) has spent more than thirty minutes reading a relevant linguistics (even pop linguistics) text. Linguists' disagreements with Cosby, crudely summarized in my disagreement with him expressed above, are not mere quibbles: he's not slightly but completely wrong. (Far be it from me to be rude about this much-loved American entertainer, but I'm tempted to say that when it comes to language he's got his head up his ass.) As I don't much care whether Cosby made this speech, I'll accept that he made it; yes, its existence is thus verifiable. It tells us no more about AAVE than what the fantasies of "creationists" tell us about the history of the universe. And that's why I took the trouble to refute what he said, above.

His criticism of Ebonics has a place in this article. I don't need to or have time to 'refute your refutation'. Your refutation is irrelevant and is original research.

<dd>There has been widespread misunderstanding in the United States of AAVE, both of its characteristics and of how it is used (see Mufwene et al., 1998). This misunderstanding has had a number of unfortunate consequences. Many educators regard the various distinguishing characteristics of AAVE as deficiencies: black children were deficient in language ability because their language did not have certain features of the standard, and the consequence of that deficiency was cognitive deficiency... In the late 1960s, this view led to certain proposals to teach black children the standard variety of the language... In this view, black children suffered from 'verbal deprivation' or 'had no language,' and it was the duty and responsibility of educators to supply them with one. This view also found support among many African Americans who looked down on AAVE. Lippi-green (1997, p. 200) has observed that 'It cannot be denied that some of the most scornful and negative criticism of AAVE speakers comes from other African Americans.'</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>... That such children need 'compensatory education' for their lack of linguistic ability is a complete misinterpretation of the facts. (pp. 343-4)</dd>

<dd>Since this introductory text (which is balanced in its description of controversies and disagreements among linguists) characterizes criticisms of AAVE use as "misunderstanding" then it's not just the dominant view in linguistics. It's the only view. It's quite ambitious that you would like to alter the discourse regarding AAVE to include criticism, but Wikipedia is <a href="../../../../wo/n/o/r/NOR_11d4.html" class="extiw" title="wo:NOR">not the place to do that</a>. And if you're going to do that, I suggest you brush up on the current discourse so you can at least look like you know what you're talking about. I recommend the sources at the bottom of the article as well as <i>English in Black and White</i> by Burling (1973). <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 21:17, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree somewhat with Fordmadoxfraud [lovely username!]. First, Cosby's comments are, in a sense, sociological, in that they fall in the domain of sociology. The trouble here is that as sociology they're worthless. Further, public criticisms such as those made by Cosby do, I suppose, have a place in WP; they're just as wrongheaded as "Creationism", but like "Creationism" they have a non-negligible impact. To say that they're worth noting is not at all the same as saying they're worth elevating to a status comparable to that of the standard linguistics perception of AAVE. (Neither should every article have a section on "Criticism", as Dude Man seems to think.) I'm also less than enthralled by the WP idea of "consensus"; I find it easy to imagine a situation where a right-headed editor is hugely outnumbered by wrong-headed editors, and as Dude Man earlier seemed to relish making refutations of what he saw as wrong, I've invited him to continue doing so. I'll read any such refutation with interest and am willing to be persuaded that I am wrong; but I note that Dude Man seems to have lost his enthusiasm for refuting that with which he disagrees. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also disagree with Fordmadoxfraud. I put back the controversy again. Deleting a section entitled "controversy" is not the way to show that there is no controversy. The facts that Cosby is or is not a linguist, is or is not a sociologist, does or does not make a point eloquently, uses or does not use AAVE himself, is or is not a well-known public figure - these are all relevant to his credibility, but not to whether his comments have a bearing on the subject. You guys who keep deleting it - are you suggesting that there is no way to quote public comments on the subject, not even to show that there is controversy? I find it hard to believe that educated people hit writer's block so hard when they see something they personally disagree with. Before you stick me with your branding iron, take a look and see whether I've <i>taken a position</i> with regard to what AAVE is. Language vs. dialect? Should or should not be taught in schools? Language variant or sloppiness? The position I <i>have</i> taken here is that the reading public should be informed. How does Wikipedia do that without telling them? <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECbdorsett_98d9.html" title="User:Cbdorsett">Cbdorsett</a> 05:23, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, I'm all for even-handed criticism, but using a popular entertainer (with no qualifications in, well, pretty much any field except acting) as a critical source smacks of tabloidism to me. Why not call up Chris Tucker, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, see what they have to say about it? Can't we find an actual authority here? Cosby's comments--taken out of context, as a quick scan of the "Poundcake Speech" article shows--would be easily derided as racist if he wasn't himself black. If that doesn't automatically make them POV, it at least makes them highly iffy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At the very least, including the quote is utterly POV, by the nature of its very informality. My suggestions for a consensus compromise here: 1) leave the Cosby dissent, ditch the rambling quote. 2) Find <b>someone else</b>. Anyone. (Well, anyone who isn't a member of the <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_Brotherhood_6878.html" title="Aryan Brotherhood">Aryan Brotherhood</a> or something.) Find some other dudes who have uncomplimentary things to say about AAVE. Because right now, the article reads as a broad consensus of professional sociologists and linguists in one corner versus...one American actor. Not much of a balanced dissent. If that consensus does not actually exist, please, for the love of god, dig up some citations that don't come from a comedian. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 05:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What do you mean by "consensus", FMF? The <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German language</a> article doesn't have a "criticism" section, even though it's easy to find schoolkids learning German as a foreign language who'll tell you that German is too difficult, sounds horrible, is illogical, stupid, etc etc etc. If you're looking for some other dude to ridicule German, you need look no further than <a href="http://eserver.org/langs/the-awful-german-language.txt" class="external text" title="http://eserver.org/langs/the-awful-german-language.txt" rel="nofollow">Mark Twain's</a>. Should the article on German thus acknowledge that there is a "controversy" about German? Well, if WP is a <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_Received_Ideas_2e13.html" title="Dictionary of Received Ideas">resource of received ideas</a>, a kind of distillation of unthinking cliches and stupidity, then certainly it should.

<dd>It's simple, really. AAVE is a lect. Lects are the province of linguistics. No linguist who's taken seriously claims that any lect is defective; ergo AAVE isn't defective. I believe that there's a consensus on this among thinking, well-informed people; I'm open to persuasion that I'm wrong.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Oh, sure his comments have bearing on the subject. They have a bearing on the subject just as the comments of a "creation scientist" have a bearing on an article on cosmology. Bluntly, they're worthless. Yes there is a controversy (in the sense that there's a controversy over whether creation of the universe took six days). Yes the reading public should be informed about it somewhere. No, the right way to do that is not to throw in a slab of nonsense from Cosby. Instead, the right way is to summarize the "criticism" in a way that makes the criticism coherent. (And, of course, to present the counterarguments.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And I also believe that the right place to do all this is not in this article, which should be stripped of its political and pop-linguistic ingredients and link prominently to an article about these, which I'm willing to accept needn't be titled "Irrational criticisms of AAVE".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Language vs. dialect?</i> The former. <i>Should or should not be taught in schools?</i> This is an interesting question (raising other questions, such as "taught" in which sense, and taught to whom), but if it belongs anywhere it belongs in that second article. <i>Language variant or sloppiness?</i> The former, as is simply explained in any of dozens of linguistics texts. (Can you name a reputable linguistics text that says that no, it's sloppiness?) The "sloppiness" allegation can also be summarized and dealt with in that second article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Or of course Wikipedia can remain studiedly "neutral" about these "controversies".

<dd>Again, not opposed to the discussion of controversies. But controversy here seems more like Cosby's than AAVE's. At least, 95% of the media coverage the speech received was on the order of "Bill Cosby Has Lost His Damn Mind", and <i>not</i> a thoughtful discussion of AAVE. Criticisms and counter-arguments <i>should</i> be presented.

Æµ§œš¹. Wikipedia is not a democracy. consensus means everyone agreeing on the format of the article not majority vote. Also, The "Scientific method" has absolutely NOTHING to do with this discussion. Cosby is not discussing the validity of Ebonics being a dialect as i've stated 3 times already. The only one being 'strong headed' would be you. Quoting random linguistic books and posting totally off topic passages from them won't get you anywhere. ALso your link is not a wikipedia article.

<p>Bill Cosby's quote in this article is as relevant as can be. Currently this article is so POV that it's absurd. This article does nothing put present Ebonics in a positive light and does not provide any alternative viewpoint of Ebonics or criticism of ebonics. Not only does this article (as i've established) use false sources to make incorrect points.

<dd>Hoary, I'm not interested in the "linguistic" aspect of Ebonics. I'm interested in the sociological aspects of it. I have read this article very clearly.

SMITHERMAN, ROMAINE, COULMAS, and TRUDGILL are used in the body of the text as a cite several times, but it is not anyhwere else (refs section), so we only have their name and a page number. We need title, publisher, etc to turn this into a proper footnote. These appear to be books or academic papers and someone familiar with them need to supply the info so proper refs can be generated.

<dd>Smitherman was easy enough to find, Trudgill has published numerous works. I've included the most likely source since Coulmas' and Romaine's were introductory sociolinguistics texts and Trudgill mainly publishes books about English English dialects.

<p>Hoary, Wikipedia citations should be formated so that someone doesn't have to google it to find out who the person is and do extensive research just to see what publication the sources is coming from. That's not how wikipedia works. Moreover, Yes, I incorrectly cited that website. If you didn't fix it I will (when I re-add it since you erased it). Attempting to "refute" op pieces from websites criticizing a highly controversial subject such as AAVE as an attempt to exclude all criticism from the page is absolutely POV and very bias.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 22:33, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Wikipedia citations should be formated so that someone doesn't have to google it to find out who the person is and do extensive research just to see what publication the sources is coming from.</i> Yes, I agree with you. (Again, I don't want to defend those particular citations. And neither do I deny that many citations should be improved.) ¶ <i>Yes, I incorrectly cited that website. If you didn't fix it I will (when I re-add it since you erased it).</i> No, you didn't cite it incorrectly; you cited it less helpfully than you could have done. I don't think I deleted mention of it (even though I thought it near worthless and thus deletable). ¶ <i>a highly controversial subject such as AAVE</i> no, Dude Man, AAVE is not highly controversial; or anyway not among thinking people. It's a lect. There are controversies about it, just as there are controversies about English in general -- unexciting example: Is the "it" in "It's misleading to claim that AAVE is controversial" expletive [null] or cataphoric? -- and indeed controversies about iguanas and Newfoundland (see Pinkville's splendid explanation below). There are also controversies (much hot air, but some cool and reasoned thinking as well) about the degrees to which AAVE and SAE should be encouraged for the education of students for whom AAVE is the native lect; these controversies have nothing to do with the intrinsic quality/value of AAVE, other than in the minds of people who are (and sometimes seem to choose to remain) ignorant of very elementary linguistics. When non-trivial, genuine controversies about AAVE deserve representation in the article. When they are (perhaps unfortunately) significant to the wider world, pseudo-controversies about AAVE and very uninformed silly ideas about AAVE deserve a mention too, but they certainly do not merit treatment comparable with that given to reasoned thinking. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:15, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>is an example of where I was changing the formating of that, I didn't put it in originally. The references I erased were erased for a purpose as I explained three times already. They are 1. Not in format with how wikipedia uses references (doesn't use them in the article body) 2. They already have components in the end of the article in the 'references" section. 3. Only citations should be used in that form where each statement or sentences is cited. That's why I removed them. I hadn't removed all of them YET but I was getting it before you pointlessly reverted it. Your assertion that Cosby is not "qualified" is nothing more than your personal opinion.

<dd>I'm sorry that you feel that describing historical "changes in formal attitudes" is a refutation of criticisms (and they are not strawman arguments.

It is a fact that [some] people have been trying to eliminate AAVE usage longer than [some] people have been countering against this and attempting to foster formal acceptance. Perhaps an expansion of that paragraph is in order, but Cosby is not the way to do that and even if Cosby <i>were</i> qualified, there would need to be people who are <i>more</i> qualified (i.e. educators, scholars, linguists, sociologists). <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 00:23, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AAVE is a language, a specific form of the language faculty which all humans possess. It isn't a position that some people have put forward, it's not a social or a political movement, it's not a point of view, it's not a style, it's not an element of a cultural production (like violence in a film). It isn't something that can be argued with or against. <i>So it cannot be met with criticism</i>. "Criticism of AAVE" is a logical absurdity, on the order of "criticism of the Sun", or "criticism of iguanas". It's meaningless. There are people who have claimed that reptiles, such as iguanas, are inherently evil on some level, and there are some who have railed against the Sun, but such moments of individual or collective psychosis are not regarded as meaningful, except as examples of irrationality or insanity. An example that cuts closer to the bone might be a hypothetical suggestion to include "criticism of Newfoundlanders" in the article on <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_4e85.html" title="Newfoundland and Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a>, but such an idea would be quickly and rightly dismissed as both an absurdity and racist. However, properly contextualised, such "criticism" could reasonably be included in the article <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfie.html" title="Newfie">Newfie</a>, which plainly deals with <i>criticism</i> of Newfoundlanders, though in a less euphemistic manner: "Usage as a derogatory term". Incidentally, the article <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland_English_07d5.html" title="Newfoundland English">Newfoundland English</a> does not possess a section dealing with "criticism of Newfoundland English", although the dialects of the island have often been regarded with hostility by outsiders and been the subject of (ongoing) campaigns to undermine their extistence. Might there be a lesson there? <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 23:38, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually language can easily be argued for or against and is a cultural production. Comparing criticism of 'use of language' to the 'sun' is absurdity. However, If you want to play semantics Pinkville and say that AAVE as a 'language' can't be criticized then let me rephrase. This article needs criticism of the <i>use</i> of AAVE. Since people 'use' aave in numerous circumstances and the use of the 'language' can easily be criticized and has been. Rather than accusing other users of racism who happen to disagree with you and want the article to become neutral perhaps you should assume good faith and think twice about your faulty position.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 00:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And what, precisely, does it mean to talk of "criticism of the use of a language"? What's the important distinction between a language and its use? One implication of such a notion is that languages without users are beyond criticism, so dead languages like <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linear_A_04b5.html" title="Linear A">Linear A</a> are safe from judgement. I don't know that that's what you had in mind. The obvious distinction between a language and its use - the one we all take for granted - is shown in specific examples of language use: speeches, songs, novels, the CNN news ticker... These can all be criticised, if one feels so inclined. But again, that's not what you were thinking of, is it. There's also the performative aspect of language, how well individuals use their mother tongue, which is dependent on physical, mental and environmental variables too numerous to begin listing... and irrelevant because they have bearing only on the abilities of individuals, not on the general "use of a language" that you are interested in. Elsewhere on this page:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>you refer to AAVE as "rudimentary" and "unsophisticated"</li>
<li>you assert that "people who speak AAVE tend to use simple words that can not convey much complex meaning"</li>
<li>you claim that "the vast majority of AAVE speakers are uneducated and come from urban areas"</li>
<li>you are skeptical of finding "a science journal using AAVE", etc.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Though these claims have been addressed in the appropriate places above, I've plopped them together here to get a better look and see how they represent your interest in "criticism of the use of a language". 1 is a claim for an intrinsic property of AAVE; it says nothing of "use". The claim is false. 2 is a claim for the verbal habits of AAVE speakers; it makes no claim for the language itself and is a specualtion that would have to be examined and, if someone could provide any evidence or study results, might reasonably be included in an article on the sociology, neurology or psychology of AAVE speakers, but not on the language. 3 again makes a claim about speakers of AAVE and not about the language, but it's worth noting that the vast majority of speakers of all languages are not linguists or grammarians, and certainly the majority of speakers of all languages are not university-educated... is there some way in which the observation has a bearing on this discussion? I don't see how. As for "come from urban areas", it's mildly interesting to recall a time when urban dwellers were considered sophisticates and people living in outlying regions and rural areas were considered hicks. 4 is a claim for AAVE exceptionalism. Scientific journals - even linguistic journals - employ a formal register of English that, for example, I don't use in my day-to-day life, and nor does anyone else (unless they are quite peculiar). But you're not talking about register, you're talking about a particular language that for whatever reason (its rudimentary and unsophisticated nature, as I understand it) is unlikely to appear in a scientific journal. But I'd be just as amazed to find an article in, say, the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancet.html" title="Lancet">Lancet</a> written in Newfoundland English (I have a vision of a published study of child-rearing practices, <i>I'm After Using Fig Tits for Infants</i>...). <i>Register</i> doesn't have any direct bearing on this discussion either.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By your own admission you "don't know any 'modern linguists'", and the only reference points you mention for your knowledge of AAVE are hip hop/rap and Bill Cosby, so I'm guessing you don't actually speak AAVE, and it's just your <i>scientific orientation</i> that leads you to conclude that "people who speak AAVE tend to use simple words that can not convey much complex meaning". But note - maybe it's just a slip - that in that passage you actually pass judgement on the people who speak AAVE and not on AAVE itself. We'll let that slide and return to your most recent comment: "<i>This article needs criticism of the</i> use <i>of AAVE. Since people 'use' aave in numerous circumstances and the use of the 'language' can easily be criticized and has been.</i>" Odd that people use their own language in "numerous circumstances", what is the preferred alternative? Yes, there are many examples of AAVE - and many other languages (and their speakers) - being attacked, often with quite ingenious scientific-sounding justifications, but such rantings, however dressed up in the trappings of science, common sense, religious doctrine, stand-up comedy routines, etc. still do not constitute criticism, which is a rational (and not necessarily antagonistic) approach to a subject that is the product of human agency, creation or development. One can criticise a use of a particular construction or expression (e.g. I could argue against the usage present in "Honey, I <i>Shrunk</i> the Kids", vs. <i>shrank</i>), one can criticise a use of inappropriate register (e.g. "possessing an amicable colleague, such as yourself, is most gratifying"), and so on, but one can't criticise a language in itself, unless a proposition like, "the human digestive system is rudimentary and unsophisticated" has meaning. All languages are founded in the same set of linguistic operations with only minor variations. No language is more or less "rudimentary" or "sophisticated" than any other. Specific fields of human enquiry have their own jargons, which is a different matter. If one wants to describe the properties of photosynthesis, then AAVE - or Newfoundland English, or Bostonian... - is inappropriate; similarly, if one wants to discuss <a href="../../../k/r/u/Krumping.html" title="Krumping">krumping</a> styles, only AAVE has the necessary complexity, subtlety and vocabulary to do so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At base, you seem to be asserting that AAVE is not a language or a lect, but rather a faulty, crude and obstinate approximation of Standard American English* and that, on that basis, criticism of it is justified. Do you have <i>authoritative</i> sources to back up that assertion and that criticise AAVE in those terms? I don't believe you'll find any. Any such sources would not be linguistic sources, but political, and therefore inappropriate for an article describing the properties of AAVE. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 14:32, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some good points there, Pinkville. One clarification (?) and one quibble. ¶ <i>And what, precisely, does it mean to talk of "criticism of the use of a language"? What's the important distinction between a language and its use?</i> I've a hunch Dude Man wants to say something about where lects should and should not be used, e.g. AAVE may be used among chums but not in class. (If so, I disagree with him; but this is by the way.) ¶ <i>If one wants to describe the properties of photosynthesis, then AAVE - or Newfoundland English, or Bostonian... - is inappropriate; similarly, if one wants to discuss <a href="../../../k/r/u/Krumping.html" title="Krumping">krumping</a> styles, only AAVE has the necessary complexity, subtlety and vocabulary to do so.</i> I'd disagree on both. I see nothing inappropriate about the use of AAVE to discuss photosynthesis. It would be unlikely and surprising (and also needlessly confusing for observers [let alone participants] for whom English was an L2); but among speakers of AAVE, why the hell not? Like any lect, AAVE has unlimited access to the lexicon of standard English, certainly any terms needed to discuss photosynthesis. Likewise, Newfoundland English and so on are perfectly capable of discussing krumping styles, though of course they may have to borrow items from the AAVE lexicon in order to do so. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 17:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Chums vs. class is certainly the sort of distinction I imagined was being considered. Thanks for the photosynthesis clarification. You've come much closer to what I had hoped to say. Conventional wisdom posits barriers between AAVE and discussions of photosynthesis, but of course such barriers do not exist linguistically. I don't know if there's any East Coast krumping, but there are some fine East Coast hip hop artists. And I've seen jig steps used in American street dance... <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 20:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pinkville, It's impossible for me to address everything you said with this type of format. I can't go in and pick out every single sentence and then refute it without actually quoting your post and then making this talk page completely incomprehensible (Sort of like AAVE). However I will address one or two things. You claim that "No language is more or less "rudimentary" or "sophisticated" than any other." No, Not many people use scientific English in their everyday speech but the fact remains that standard english can easily be used in a scientific context and the same rules apply to it.

<dd>Here is another SIMPLE question that requires a short and simple answer. Would you consider it ok if I simply switched to AAVE and used non-complex AAVE in all of my posts? <i>Wat up, jigga?

<dd>Dude Man, your use of <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye_dialect.html" title="Eye dialect">eye dialect</a> (e.g. "u" for "you") is really too silly. But despite your worst intentions, your question in cod-AAVE actually makes perfect sense. So yes, if you want to keep writing in cod-AAVE on this talk page, by all means do so. Since you repeatedly bring up the matter of the adequacy of a particular kind of English for expository purposes, I'll say that your cod-AAVE may be more comprehensible than some of your attempts to write standard English, in which you perpetrate sentence fragments, failure of verb agreement, elementary orthographic errors, etc. ¶ Better still, stop writing here while you go off and educate yourself about AAVE. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 23:56, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As has been clearly explained above, Cosby is a non-expert who is not taken seriously and is here speaking nonsense. You haven't explained that he is an expert or that he's taken seriously (other than by saying that he's Black and famous) or that he is here making sense. What would "meeting you halfway" imply -- sprinkling the Cosby quote with explanations in "[&#160;]" so that he doesn't come off as such a fool? More broadly, you appear to be writing from premisses that are utterly uninformed and wrongheaded, and you show no interest in reading even the most elementary book of real linguistics (or, it seems, sociology). ¶ <i>Someone neutral to this cause</i> -- what "cause"? Me, I'm neutral about AAVE. Its grammatical and other differences from standard American English I view as dispassionately as I do those of Newfoundland English, Boston English, etc. I'm not a proponent of AAVE and I haven't praised it. All of this makes me a pretty normal editor of and commenter on this article, on a subject of which I am not at all an expert but <i>about which I have read actual linguistics books.</i> ¶ I'm happy to hear that you have stopped making edits to the article: the break may give you time to go to a large library and do some serious reading. Not little op-ed pieces by disgruntled businessmen or (would-be) civic leaders, not the rants of uninformed comedians, but careful expositions (from university presses or other non-fringe publishers) written by people who have spent years studying these matters. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 23:44, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now that's a reasonable request for the article. It's particularly reasonable as a reaction to this part: <i>Pronunciation of the dental fricatives [...] changes depending on position in a word. [...] The rule for AAVE can be expressed in standard phonological rule notation:</i> plus graphic. I regret that editors here who have some interest in a dispassionate description of AAVE have been so distracted by silly requests as to be unable to attend to this. The red link in the bit I've quoted is unsatisfactory, and the casual reader can justifiably complain about having this phonological jargon shoved at them with neither explanations nor links to explanations.</dd>

<dd>Let's consider the phonology first. The redlink should have gone to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinctive_feature.html" title="Distinctive feature">distinctive feature</a>, and I have so rewritten it. It's not possible to link from within the generated graphic, but I was going to add a footnote pointing out that features such as <i>sonorant</i> are all explained within <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinctive_feature.html" title="Distinctive feature">distinctive feature</a>. However, although <i>consonantal, continuant</i> and <i>sonorant</i> are explained, <i>alveolar, dental</i> and <i>labiodental</i> are not. Of course I know what the latter three mean: they're standard <i>phonetics</i> terms. But are they arbitrary additions to the binary features listed in the article? Are they binary features that were previously thought to be fundamental but that were fairly recently disposed of in favor of more fundamental alternatives? (Sorry if these questions are stupid: remember, I never claimed to have more than a primitive grasp of phonology.)</dd>

<dd>(Actually the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinctive_feature.html" title="Distinctive feature">Distinctive feature</a> article implies that its own treatment is out of date: <i>in recent developments to the theory of distinctive features, phonologists have proposed the existence of single-valued features. These features, called univalent features, can only describe the classes of segments that are said to possess those features, and not the classes that are without them.</i>)</dd>

<dd>Yes, phonology. Why the phonology/grammar distinction? I'd thought that phonology was regarded as an essential part of grammar.

I like the article and hope you can quickly come to an understanding about the point you are currently held up on. The referencing needs attention: that is obvious. The range of academic sources referred to seems good, though. I would suggest that, apart from referring briefly to where AAVE is spoken, when and by whom, the article should start with the linguistic aspects. I was interested in knowing more about the dispute between linguistics experts on the origins of AAVE and how much it shares with other dialects of English, how much is derived from African languages and how much is a result of language mixing. Then the article would come onto the sociolinguistics questions. In a section that could be headed "attitudes" commentators like Cosby could be mentioned. The notable point is of course not that Cosby, a non-expert, holds these views but that the media takes an interest in his views. "Schools" could be a sub-heading under "attitudes". The article could have a to-do list on the talk page, starting with the referencing. I'm not watching the page, but please post on my talk page if you want me to contribute further.<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 23:02, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll agree that <i>African American Vernacular English</i> is not a very widely known term, and that neither is <i>AAVE.</i> However, the consitutents <i>African American</i> and <i>English</i> are now standard, and <i>vernacular</i> is widely known among educated people (not only those who are educated in linguistics). Whether <i>African American Vernacular English</i> (below, <i>AAVE</i>) is the best of all terms is not something I want to explore here; because the only suggestion has been to rename it <i>Ebonics,</i> let's instead consider the merits of <i>Ebonics.</i></p>
<p>Coined some time between 1973 and 1975, <i>Ebonics</i> was a very little-known term until December 1996, when the Oakland (Calif) school board put it in the news. (Even the <i>OED</i> 2nd edition of 1989 didn't bother with it.)</p>
<p>It's still not very well known, it seems. I looked for it among English dictionaries of 1997 and later; here's what I found. (The criticism might be raised that it's a proper name and many dictionaries give space only grudgingly to proper names; I therefore name the proper names that bracket the place where <i>Ebonics</i> ought to be.)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary</i> (1991). <i>Ebonics</i> not mentioned; the dictionary does list the proper names <i>E-boat</i> and <i>Ebro.</i></li>
<li><i>The Canadian Oxford Dictionary</i> (1998). <i>Ebonics</i> not mentioned; the dictionary does list the proper names <i>Ebla</i> and <i>Ebro.</i></li>
<li><i>New Oxford Dictionary of English</i> (1998). Glosses <i>Ebonics</i> as <i>American Black English regarded in its own right rather than as a dialect of standard English.</i></li>
<li>John Ayto, <i>Twentieth Century Words</i> (OUP 2000) explains that <i>Ebonics</i> was coined in 1975 and means <i>African-American vernacular English, especially as considered to be a language in its own right rather than a non-standard dialect.</i></li>
<li><i>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</i> 4th ed. (2000). <i>Ebonics</i> is merely a cross reference to <i>AAVE</i> and a pointer to a "Usage Note" at <i>Black English.</i></li>
<li><i>New Oxford American English</i> (2001). Identical entry to that in the <i>NODoE.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>For those who don't know the word, <i>Ebonics</i> is hard to parse. (Bizarrely for a word meaning a dialect or language, it's partly derived from <i>phonics</i> used to mean phonetics.) Meanwhile, <i>AAVE</i> is easy to parse (or at least it is for those who know the word <i>vernacular</i>).</p>
<p><i>AHDEL</i> is careful to make <i>AAVE</i> its primary term.</p>
<p>Not a single dictionary that I encountered presents <i>Ebonics</i> as a normal and neutral term for the way that many US Blacks speak. <small>(Note for more theoretically inclined linguists: I very much regret this phrase "the way that [XYZ people] speak" with its emphasis on performance rather than competence: I'm trying to avoid "language" and "[dia]lect" and also linguistic jargon.)</small> Instead, it's shown to be a loaded term: it implies that this way of speaking is somehow independent of English, even that it is a separate language. It could be argued that <i>AAVE</i> is similarly a loaded term, implying that this way of speaking is merely a form of English. You may then wish to coolly consider the facts, which are that the overwhelming majority of linguists regard this way of speaking is a dialect (or lect) and not a language, and that the great majority of speakers of other kinds of English have little trouble understanding this way of speaking, certainly much less than they encounter when trying to understand, say, Dutch.</p>
<p>I also speculate that the term <i>Ebonics</i> is particularly beloved by blowhards (on both sides of the "controversy") and that <i>AAVE</i> is less likely to scratch their itches.</p>
<p>Even if I put aside that speculation, I strongly oppose any notion of renaming this article "Ebonics". -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 13:44, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm puzzled by your revert, aeusoes1, as this destroyed all mention of "Ebonics" having a much broader meaning than "AAVE", and its theoretical baggage. (I happen to think that the baggage is rather batty, but that's beside the point.) I've therefore resuscitated the article, making it clearer that what people are most likely to be after appears instead in <i>this</i> article. Meanwhile, I've reverted your alteration to <i>this</i> article too, not least because although "Ebonics" does indeed come from "phonics", it does <i>not</i> come from "phonics" as explained in the article <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonics.html" title="Phonics">phonics</a>.</dd>

<p>I'm hardly a linguistics scholar - I have a "lay" interest in the subject - but I'm well aware of the distinction between <i>Ebonics</i> and <i>AAVE</i>. If I did not already know of an article in Wikipedia called "African American Vernacular English", I would search for "African American English" or "Black American English" or something similar, but it wouldn't occur to me to search under "Ebonics", unless, not finding any of the other possibilities, I turned to it in desperation (maybe it's just my idiosyncrasy, but I suspect I'm not alone). The trouble is that "Ebonics" is a political term, which is perfectly fine in <i>that</i> field of human activity and thought, but not fine in the context of the study of language... It's a term that is complicated by the assertions of its advocates that it should be taken as a linguistic term, but without the support of linguists. Hoary's argument on the related point makes perfect sense to me, that "Ebonics" is intended to suggest a language independent of English vs. "AAVE" which explicitly makes the connection to English. Regardless, "AAVE" is the term for the dialect, "Ebonics" is the political term used by certain people making claims for a particular conception of African American culture. Consequently, two articles would be best, with redirects as appropriate. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 01:58, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm an African-American, and I don't use the term "Ebonics." In fact, <i>no one</i> I know uses it, except in a dismissive and offhand manner, referring to the ignorance, bias and backwardness of those who, in fact, use it dismissively/demeaningly and as a class- or ethnically charged pejorative. "Ebonics" is, in fact, a recent, colloquial, politically charged term that is unencyclopedic and inappropriate in an academic or scholarly context. Those of us who have studied "Black English" for some time now recognize the label "Ebonics" as a flavor-of-the-month sort of naming convention. It's a term made popular by the recent media fracas in Cali (and elsewhere), but is neither an acceptable nor accurate substitute for "AAVE." (This has been discussed here before.) Given the pervasiveness of the electronic media and the decreasing literacy of particularly American society, we should be wary of affixing shallow, hot-button, media-driven labels to phenomena simply because certain segments of the population (often young and/or not very well-read on a particular subject) may not be aware of them by any other name. That is, in part, what wiki redirects are for. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 02:18, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Believe whatever you will. I'm a well-read, learned African-American who understands the power of words, and that's just the way I roll. I'm not here to convince you that many consider "Ebonics" a racist term. What I'm telling you is that there are many who consider it so; that's hardly a news flash. "AAVE" is, in fact, value-neutral and is, therefore, far more preferable to "Ebonics." Furthermore, I find your assertions that AAVE is "rudimentary" and monosyllabic hilarious. AAVE is vivid; complex; rule-driven, structurally (like other dialects); often metaphorical; powerful and creative -- precisely why so much of American English (and other languages, as well) is shot-through with our contributions, why the popularity of the African American spoken word is a worldwide phenomenon. Lotsa luck proving <i>that</i> ridiculous assertion. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 02:49, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

What exactly is "many"? Who specifically considers "ebonics" to be a racist term? How do these people represent "most english speakers"? You're copping out by calling anyone who uses "ebonics" opposed to AAVE uneducated. Maybe they are and maybe they aren't, It's irrelevant.

<dd>The intent to convince is predicated on one's faith that the other is willing to engage in the sort of discussion that might lead them to change their mind. There's little evidence on this page that you might be so willing. However, in the spirit of the forlorn hope... some points. You're reluctant to accept one African American's word that the term "Ebonics" is offensive to many, yet you claim to know the minds of "most English speakers"... As for Wikipedia guidelines and conventions... generally it's perfectly right to use the most commonly used term for the title of an article, but it's not (as you insist) a hard and fast rule, there are many cases (and they must be judged on a case-by-case basis) in which a lesser-known alternative is better for a variety of reasons. A casual glance at the numerous articles dealing with topics in Israel, Palestine, the Occupied Territories, etc. should make that quite clear. But that's not the issue here. "Ebonics" and "AAVE" do not refer to the same thing. Some people - a tiny minority - have advocated for "Ebonics" to be regarded as the "proper" name for AAVE, but even they (as I understand it) have loaded the term with additional meanings that lie outside the bounds of linguistics. To take an even more tightly tangled knot of intertwined and dangling meanings, consider the various ways in which the term "postmodern" is used, depending on the context; thus, there is a series of articles dealing with postmodernism in literature, architecture, globalisation, critical theory, etc. In our case, we have the advantage of there being different terms for different subjects, "Ebonics", the poltical construct, and "AAVE", the dialect. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 03:31, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Mock Ebonics" in the wake of the 1996 controversy is a topic that has been studied academically. I refer specificallty to an article, "Mock Ebonics: Linguistic racism in parodies of Ebonics on the Internet", published in August 1999 in the <i>Journal of Sociolinguistics</i>. The authors explain their choice of terminology, "We use the term Ebonics, which is often associated with Afrocentricity and political correctness, because both the Oakland Board of Education and the Ebonics parody pages themselves use this term." (I can e-mail this to whoever wants it.) In other words, it's a term used by one political group in promoting Afrocentricity, and by another, what the authors call the "Anti-Ebonics Ideology", in mocking it. Most linguists for most purposes will use AAVE, and most ordinary people use "Black English" or something. To most people "Ebonics" has political connotations: to a small group of Afrocentric activists (not all, certainly) positive, to many more people negative. We try to avoid terms with negative connotations in titling ethnic articles; i.e. we have <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma.html" title="Roma">Roma</a> rather than "Gypsy".--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 03:39, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the source I gave above, the authors specifically felt they had to justify using the politicized term "Ebonics", because of its usage in the controversy. Obviously Afrocentrists are in the minority (probably even of African Americans), and the usage outside of that context, as explained, is generally pejorative. I would consider "Black English" or "Black American English" to be far better names than "Ebonics", certainly, but AAVE seems to be the accepted name and our general demographic article isn't at "Black American".--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 03:56, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It could also be pointed out that there is a controversy right here, for what Wikipedia squabbles are worth. <i>Would you consider "Black English" to be a better substitute to rename this article to?</i> Certainly not, because AAVE is quite distinct from, say, Jamaican or Trinidadian English. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:21, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pharos, You evaded what I posted. What you said was that "To most people "Ebonics" has political connotations: to a small group of Afrocentric activists (not all, certainly) positive, to many more people negative." How could the authors you posted support this assertion? Did the authors do some sort of opinion poll for the term "Ebonics" vs "AAVE"? No. You're asserting that "Ebonics" is a controversial word and has a negative meaning to most people simply because "mock ebonics" websites have popped up in the past decade. I don't see how such a conclusion can be made. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 05:51, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This is what i'm questioning because this is what you asserted to defend this article remaining "AAVE" opposed to "Ebonics".

The preponderance of opinion here (as well is in previous discussions here -- see the archive) is that the article title should remain as-is. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 16:22, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's probably true, Deecee. But an edit conflict meant that I'd already written this: ¶ <i>the assertion that "Ebonics" is commonly understood to be a "political" word and has negative connotations to many people</i>: the evidence for this assertion is presented with considerable detail and care by John Baugh in his book <i>Beyond Ebonics: Linguistic pride and racial prejudice</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000; <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-19-512046-9</a> [hard], <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-19-515289-1</a> [paper]). As for the other things Dude Man says, they've already been addressed. ¶ I wonder whether Dude Man has yet managed to read a single intelligent book about AAVE, and if so, which. Baugh's book is slim and goes very easy on technical terms; it's quite palatable even for people who find it hard to read books. On the other hand, it's probably quite beyond those people who find it hard to read anything whatever that disagrees with what they already happen to believe. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 16:33, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Looking at this, the conclusion is that it seems best to me to keep the article title at the current place. Quite simply, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that aims to be based on - largely academic - reliable sources. Seeing as those reliable sources are <i>not</i> using the term "Ebonics", it is probably correct for this page to remain separate, as the term which those sources <i>are</i> using. Nothing wrong with a separate article on the history and usage of this term Ebonics, which, as google shows, is clearly notable in its own right. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletionism_9106.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletionism">Deletion!</a></sup> 15:23, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Should <a href="../../../e/b/o/Ebonics.html" title="Ebonics">Ebonics</a> be merged with AAVE?</span></h2>
<p>While I agree that the article should keep the title 'AAVE', discussion of the name 'Ebonics' might be useful as well. Hoary, I think rather than having a full article devoted to it, the term might be better explained in this article. I haven't read this book by Baugh, but if it has some information on the social/cultural uses of the term, that would be helpful. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> 21:38, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You, Pinkville, Pharos, Deeceevoice, numerous others, and I agree that <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_Vernacular_English_5350.html" title="African American Vernacular English">African American Vernacular English</a> is a much better title for an article on this ethnolect/sociolect/language than is <a href="../../../e/b/o/Ebonics.html" title="Ebonics">Ebonics</a>. Even those who disagree (is there more than one?) must concede that there's no consensus (even in the odd WP sense of that word) to change the title.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The question then becomes that of what to do about <a href="../../../e/b/o/Ebonics.html" title="Ebonics">Ebonics</a>. Until a few days ago I had no idea that "Ebonics" would be a worthwhile article: though I did know a more than negligible amount about AAVE (or whatever you want to call it), I knew virtually nothing about the term "Ebonics". Since Dude Man insisted on making it an issue, I decided to look it up -- and what I read surprised me. Although its main denotation (let's forget its connotations for a moment) is the same as that of AAVE, its original denotation is very different from that of AAVE. So what should one do about this? It seems an excrescence within an article on AAVE that follows the mainstream (and to me, blazingly obvious) line that AAVE is <i>English,</i> probably influenced to some extent by African forebears but genetically no more "African" (Niger-Congo?) than, say, Wolof is Indo-European. This is no reason to ridicule the original notion of "Ebonics", whose context (back in 1973/75, let alone 1996) was clearly that of an effort to recognize as systemic what we now call AAVE, for excellent educational purposes. If we now reconsider the connotations of "Ebonics", perhaps a discussion of the term might be put within an article on AAVE (in a section on the history of perceptions of AAVE). But even if it did indeed belong within AAVE, this would be no excuse for simplistic talk such as "AAVE and Ebonics just mean the same thing" (unsaid addition: "and I've no interest in any argument to the contrary, let alone the notion of <i>reading up</i> entire printed pages about the subject"). Moreover, the resulting single article on AAVE would eventually become immensely long. I'm already sure that the kerfuffle about pedagogy and the Oakland School Board (etc etc) would be better placed in some independent article rather than in the main AAVE article, and with the term "Ebonics" we have a clear opportunity to hive off content elsewhere, even if, as I doubt, this content were suitable for the AAVE article. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:46, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose that would make the article rather long. You suggested earlier having 'Ebonics' disambiguate to this page and one more focussed on the social/cultural/educational issues around AAVE. That seems like a good idea (if there is enough sourced material for the second page), but I'm not sure 'Ebonics' is the best title for it. As explained above, Ebonics is not a particularly widely used term, and it is also not 'transparent' or easily understandable based on its constituent elements. Since the name is literally 'Ebony phonics', users may be confused into thinking a) that the article is primarily about phonetics/phonology and b) that this is the normal term used for this lect. While the article would surely explain otherwise, many readers will skim the article unattentively, and miss this point. Something like 'AAVE in American Society' or 'Language in African-American Culture' (ugly as those titles are) seems better to me. The section in this article on the Oakland decision could be moved there. My only concern is whether there is enough material to create a whole article on this topic without simply quoting one or two authors at length. There is a broad variety of viewpoints on the subject; hopefully enough of them have reliable sources to make the article balanced and informative. Even if there isn't enough material for this article, one dealing only with the Oakland schools decision would help shorten the article and focus it more on the language itself. My ultimate target for this article is to have something along the same lines as Scottish English, Australian English, etc., where the lect is simply described in its own right. (Let's not forget that AAVE probably has more speakers than either of those varieties!) Splitting this article into a more descriptive one and a more sociolinguistic one would help move toward that goal. (By the way, it's he). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakerowner_365b.html" title="User talk:Makerowner">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Makerowner_0b42.html" title="Special:Contributions/Makerowner">contribs</a>) 04:29, 7 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>We agree a lot more than we disagree. First, yes, I agree that the article on AAVE should primarily describe it. As a description merely up to the sentence level takes up well over a hundred pages of Green's textbook (recommended!), I'm sure that, presented informatively, this would be enough for one article. I'm also pretty sure that a lot of what is already in this AAVE article should be out of it and elsewhere. But unlike you I see more than two subjects here (quite aside from "Ebonics"). Very tentatively, these are: (i) the lexicon, phonetics and grammar of AAVE; (ii) distinctive discourse features of AAVE (signifying, etc.); (iii) varieties and degree of usage of AAVE; (iv) pedagogical issues of (and panic and hysteria about) AAVE. The second and third of these are sociolinguistics, which I think I can understand but which I've never studied, and the fourth combines education, mass psychology, media studies, US politics, etc. I hope a real sociolinguist will chime in. Even if none does, just one hour from now I may have a different tentative classification: I'm just putting these up to spark intelligent discussion -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:51, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ebonics backlash, language samples</span></h2>
<p>Ebonics was presented as a label for AAVE to prevent black children being told their speech was "defective" and to instill pride, and to make teachers understand that the student was not simply speaking English badly. This reportedly led to efforts or plans in Oakton, CA to instruct children in Ebonics, which led to people making fun of it, with purported vocabulary lessons. I did not see reference to this backlash. Also it would be enlightening to let people hear how persons in West Africa with limited English experience pronounce English words. From George Mason University, <a href="http://accent.gmu.edu/howto.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://accent.gmu.edu/howto.php" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> is a series of recordings and phonetic transcriptions demonstrating some of the sources of AAVE, mixed in against the speech samples from around the world. You hear West Africans say "axe" for "ask" and "wif" for with when reading a standard paragraph with agood sample of English speech sounds. It might be a good addition to the article, but it has people from around the world as well, so the listener needs to know which languages are from where. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 04:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV?</span></h2>
<p>From a purely linguistic perspective, AAVE is no "better" or "worse" than any other dialect of English. It is no less capable of conveying complex information, nor is it any independent indicator of intelligence. It is as richly complex a dialect as "Standard American" and has no deficiencies whatsoever as a means of verbal communication. And there is not a credible linguist who will tell you otherwise.</p>
<p>Any and all criticisms of AAVE rest squarely on dialectic bias and social assumption. The lack of AAVE use in scientific journals or major publications is more a matter of <i>author and audience</i> rather than the capacity of the dialect to convey the same information discussed in <i>Nature</i> or <i>Scientific American</i>. Furthermore, non-speakers of AAVE frequently have a great deal of trouble understanding it because of verb aspect difference with Standard American which precludes using it as a common medium of communication.</p>
<p>Overall, if this article adds any criticism of AAVE, it ought to be labeled clearly as "social criticisms" and must not be represented as linguistic criticism. UMassCowboy 14:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikidudeman has once again decided that he knows more about sociolinguistics and AAVE in particular than the all the other editors of this article combined and all <i>scientific</i> researchers in the field.

<dd>Articles...may not include tiny-minority views at all (by example, the article on the Earth only very briefly refers to the Flat Earth theory, a view of a distinct minority).

To give undue weight to a significant-minority view, or to include a tiny-minority view, might be misleading as to the shape of the dispute.</dd>

<p>Well excuse my confusion due to your use of similar words. The fact that I failed a RFM the first time is irrelevant. I learned from my mistake and now I am filing another RFM and hoping the involved participants in the dispute at least make an attempt to resolve this dispute. Proclaiming "I'm right and you're wrong" and trying to rant themselves out of the dispute with paragraphs of unrelated evasions simply won't work. A mediation might work, It's worth a try. I'm taking steps to resolve this dispute. If you think that's a waste of time then perhaps wikipedia isn't the right place for you.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 03:43, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm hoping I won't have to say another word on this point. I made a suggestion to you as to how you - and any other interested editors - could best use our time by <i>going ahead right now with what we do agree on</i>, i.e. citations. Is there anything controversial about that? I made a point of suggesting that you hold off on the other discussions until the citations were done. Again, anything problematic about that? Your actions quite clearly have not had the desired effect of helping to resolve this dispute; I was suggesting a way that might do so - if that is of real interest to you. Once more, is that obstructionist? not civil? failing to assume good faith? - or any other evil you've implied/stated I (and others) am guilty of? <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 03:56, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

But leaving that aside, I'm asking that you give those of us who perhaps have more difficulty than you in tackling numerous problems at once the chance to combine our efforts on one problem now and then move on to the others without those dangling citations bothering us. Again, in dealing with the citations you may see the discussions on this page in a different light - you might even find that you can argue from a better fortified position than is now the case.

<p>Wikidudeman, I don't think there is a real, contested issue here to warrant a NPOV discussion. Cosby might have some interesting personal opinions of AAVE, but he's a psychologist, not a sociologist. He doesn't have authority sufficient to warrant a real debate here. We've all hashed over the various "social" debates here: that it "sounds ignorant," that it isn't "widely used," et cetera, et cetera. Unfortunately, that doesn't address anything discussed in the article. The article is clearly a linguistic discussion, not a sociological discussion. I imagine this is because of the absolute lack of real sociological substance on this issue. The sociolinguistic implications of AAVE are documented, but I have yet to stumble across support of any sort that would constitute a need for "NPOV" balance.</p>
<p>I'd give up this fight. It isn't worth the energy. There isn't anything here. If you feel like you've found something credible and Wiki-worthy, post it here and we'll review.</p>

<dd>Not an unreasonable question, Dude Man. Actually the book, being a sensible book by a knowledgable person (rather than a trashy screed by for example a racist blowhard) does not criticize the use of AAVE. It does include criticism. I might use it. I do not rush to use it and write up this stuff because I find it much less important and interesting than the nature of AAVE itself, because I find the material depressing (as does Baugh), because writing it up in a fair, intelligent and of course plagiarism-free way demands sustained concentration, and because I have no appetite whatever for writing up anything that seems likely to invite immediate "improvements" by at least one person who seems more dangerously uninformed than I am (I have never studied sociolinguistics and it's a long time since I studied sociology, but I am at least aware that these are drawbacks). Once this talk page has reverted to being a place for a dispassionate discussion of how best to write up AAVE, then I shall consider making major changes to this part of the article. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:43, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

He demonstrates <a href="http://www.llp.armstrong.edu/watermarks/981011st.html" class="external text" title="http://www.llp.armstrong.edu/watermarks/981011st.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> knowledge of the issues regarding the Oakland decision.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Negation</span></h2>
<p>Someone recently edited the section on negation to indicate that "ain't" can be used where GAm has "will not". I'm not sure if that is correct. I am not a native speaker of AAVE, but to me, "I will not (won't) go home," and "I ain't go home," are not equivalent. Can anyone either provide a source documenting this use or remove this from the article. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> 14:35, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I noticed that edit and let it slide because I know that one can use ain't to indicate a future negation but then your comment made me think about it and I realized that it would only be in cases like "I ain't gonna" so I've removed it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Antebellum Northern speech</span></h2>
<p>As AAVE is clearly related to Southern English, I am wondering about the speech of historically Northern African American communities. To what extent has this been studied, how different was it from AAVE, and does it still exist anywhere?--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 19:32, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was just reading about this today. According to the author (whose name I can't remember) the pre-Migration Black communities in the North spoke basically the same way as their White neighbours. Of course, it would be very difficult to tell because the vast majority of northern Blacks moved from the south around WWI, and there were few if any studies on AAVE before the Migration. There does seem to be a difference between modern northern AAVE and southern AAVE, but it is also based on the urban-rural differences as well (Blacks in the South are largely rural; in the North, urban). These differences are also diminishing over time, with city-centred features spreading to the surrounding countryside. I'll see if I can find the author's name for you. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> 01:17, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some parts of the North had surprisingly large African American populations in the time of slavery– Kings County, New York was I think 1/3 African American in 1790. I would be surprised if their speech was completely assimilated at such an early period.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 04:50, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's the only source I've seen that claimed complete assimilation of northern Black speech, but it would make more sense linguistically. Even in areas of high Black population, the social dynamics were different in the North. Blacks in the North were often personal servants and were therefore in close contact with Whites; they were also in the minority in all their areas. In the South, large groups of Blacks lived together with little interaction with Whites (depending on the exact location). The southern Black population was augmented by importations from Africa and the Carribean, meaning that there was greater possibility of first-language interference in English learning. These processes were strongest in the South Carolina area where rice became one of the biggest crops, and Gullah developed as a result. I don't have any hard sources to back it up, but it makes sense that divergence from standard American English would have a correlation with African and Carribean (ie. Creole-speaking) influence and a negative correlation with White English influence. Gullah was most isolated, and diverged the most; AAVE speakers had much more contact and diverged much less; northern Blacks probably would have had more contact with Whites than other Blacks and would have diverged the least. This is all conjecture based on some of the historical settlement patterns, so I could very well be wrong. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> 05:54, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Explanation of "Undue Weight"...</span></h2>
<p>Wikipedia clearly states that articles should not have "Undueweight" towards one specific POV and should present <b>ALL</b> POV's equal. The only exception is if one POV is supported by such a tiny minority of people that it does not warrant inclusion I.E. people who believe in a flat earth represent such a tiny minority their views would not be represented in the "Earth" article. However people who are critical of Ebonics like Cosby and other authors I've mentioned do not represent such a small minority and warrant inclusion in this article. If this article mentions ANYTHING about the sociological aspects of Ebonics then it must mention those who criticize it. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> himself has stated...</p>

<li>If a viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;</li>
<li>If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, <b>then it should be easy to name prominent adherents</b>;</li>
<li>If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it is true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not.</li>

<dd>Prominent adherents is something I can easily name. Not only that but the source I mention in no way go against <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>. So far the ONLY arguments that have been brought up are evasive criticisms of the sources themsleves not their verifiability which is a big difference. Their criticism of the "factuality" of the opinions of Ebonics or the authority of those who hold them may be justified but their refusal to add them into the article is not. Wikipedia clearly states "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth." <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> Their criticism does not coincide with wikipedia policy and they have no justification for their refusal to add criticism of Ebonics into the article.

<dd>Since the mediation has been accepted I will comment on this. Nowhere in <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> does it say that your source must 'back up their data'. Not only that but the source in question should not be Cosby himself. <b>Bill Cosby is not my source.</b> Cosby said what he said and no one questions that. The source in question if you are even questioning the source should be americanrhetoric.com which is where I quoted the speech from. The speech happened and americanrhetoric.com does qualify as a reliable published source. Criticism of the use of AAVE should not be presented in the article as if it's right or wrong. It should simply be presented as existing since it fits the criteria of <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUndue_weight_9fd9.html" title="WP:Undue weight">WP:Undue weight</a>.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 07:13, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One of the main policies of wikipedia is to let the <b>facts speak for themselves.</b> This means presenting all of the relevant facts in an article. It is a <b>fact</b> that Bill Cosby and others have criticized the use of Ebonics. No one questions this fact. This fact is very relevant and therefore must be presented in the article. In order to maintain neutrality. It does not matter if you think what Cosby said is 'wrong' or inaccurate. He said it and many others agree including myself. Adhering to <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUndue_weight_9fd9.html" title="WP:Undue weight">WP:Undue weight</a> it should be presented in a neutral tone as a fact that occurred. Nothing more. Since wikipedia says to let the facts speak for themselves we can allow the readers to judge whether Ebonics is indeed 'bad' to speak or not. However refusing to provide any mention of any criticism of the use of ebonics in any sort of a neutral tone is simply in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a><a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 07:23, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, Dude Man, it is a fact that ignoramuses such as Cosby have criticized the use of Ebonics. It's also a fact that well-intentioned people have done so; if you read a <i>book</i> about the issue you might find some. Cosby is not a significant commentator on AAVE as <a href="../../../a/f/r/Talk%7EAfrican_American_Vernacular_English_1fbc.html#Cosby_quote" title="Talk:African American Vernacular English">what he says is self-contradictory, blatantly ignorant, or asinine</a>. Arguably there's a certain significance in the fact that people such as him can talk such tripe and not be met by instant ridicule, and it may well be that of demonstrating how little many people know about language (which is not troubling) and how much they think they know (which, to me, is).

<dd>The fact that such a criticism exists and is well-documented does not automatically make it relevant. Actor David Duchovny is well documented in having criticized the weather in Vancouver while filming the X-Files there; does this mean that the article on Vancouver should include a section called "Social Criticisms of Vancouver". Bill Cosby is no more qualified to make this analysis of AAVE than David Duchovny is of Vancouver. As far as I can tell for Wikidudeman's posts, his sole qualification is being a "Black professional". <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> 17:22, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure if "Clinton Chronicles" is on the same level of notability as the Pound Cake speech nor am I certain of whether comparing that to the Clinton article is fair either. The Clinton article is so large and contains so many offshoots that it's relevance to that article is really tiny compared to other controversies mentioned in that article which bring up basically the same stuff. You need to look at the notability of Bill Clinton compared to the notability of the "Clinton Chronicles" and the disparity is huge while the notability of AAVE compaired to Bill Cosby's criticism of AAVE is nowhere near the same. A simple google news search will show the disparity of notability [<a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>] 18,106 results for "Bill Clinton" 0 for "Clinton Chronicles" while there are 0 results for "African American Vernacular English" and 1 result for "Pound Cake speech".<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 04:28, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We may be starting to get somewhere, Dude Man, in that you're starting to use your noddle. It's not transparently daft to argue that an analogy is inappropriate. The problem is your use of the newsworthiness metric. The fact is that AAVE is a dialect (or lect, or sociolect, or ethnolect, or conceivably even a language). Dialects (and languages) do change over time, whence the field of <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_linguistics.html" title="Historical linguistics">historical linguistics</a>. But they change awfully slowly by news standards, and certainly no change presents as dramatic, quotable or potentially telegenic image as Bill Cosby publicly demonstrating that he's ignorant, that he's lost his marbles, that he got carried away with himself, or that he'll say anything for a cheap laugh. AAVE is no more newsworthy in itself than is the dialect that you or I happen to speak, and a news search engine is as odd a place to find out about AAVE as it is to find out about most other aspects of language, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_aspect.html" title="Grammatical aspect">aspect</a> itself being pretty typical. The place where we adults read up out about languages is <i>books.</i> I happen to have four relevant books with me, but as it happens none was published after Cosby's outburst so I can't directly compare the authors' coverage of Cosby with their coverage of AAVE as a whole. Can you name a "post-Pound-Cake" <i>book</i> on the subject? Even if nobody can locate a copy, Amazon's search facility may let us see how much space within it is allotted to Cosby. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:37, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Let me say it again... <b>If you want me to address any other points you might of made then briefly sum them up for me.</b><a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 07:07, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Points restated</span></h2>
<p>Just so that it doesn't get lost to evasions like so much of what I have said in the past has, I will restate your points and my rebuttals...</p>
<ul>
<li>You claimed that Cosby's speech IS relevant to AAVE but it should not be presented in the article anyway because a video called "Clinton Chronicles" isn't mentioned in the Clinton article.</li>
<li>My rebuttal was that they are hardly comparable. The disparity of notability between Clinton and the "Clinton Chronicles" is evident from the fact that there are 18,106 results for "Bill Clinton" 0 for "Clinton Chronicles" while there are 0 results for "African American Vernacular English" and 1 result for "Pound Cake speech" Meaning that the comparison simply doesn't work.</li>
<li>Your response was basically an evasion that didn't address my prior post and my response was all that I could get from your post to address. I asked you to Sum up anything else that I couldn't comprehend to actually address.</li>
<li>Your abusive response was to say that I can't read.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of yet no one has given a viable explanation for why criticism of aave and the Pound Cake speech can't be mentioned. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 07:15, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, Dude Man, no one has given an explanation that you have bothered to read and consider. ¶ On to your points: <i>You claimed that Cosby's speech IS relevant to AAVE but it should not be presented in the article anyway because a video called "Clinton Chronicles" isn't mentioned in the Clinton article.</i> Wrong. I presented that as a thought-provoking part-analogy. ¶ <i>My rebuttal was that they are hardly comparable. The disparity of notability between Clinton and the "Clinton Chronicles" is evident from the fact that there are 18,106 results for "Bill Clinton" 0 for "Clinton Chronicles" while there are 0 results for "African American Vernacular English" and 1 result for "Pound Cake speech" Meaning that the comparison simply doesn't work.</i> As I said, you're comparing newsworthiness, but language is not intrinsically newsworthy. ¶ <i>Your response was basically an evasion that didn't address my prior post and my response was all that I could get from your post to address.</i> So you couldn't read it. ¶ <i>I asked you to Sum up anything else that I couldn't comprehend to actually address.</i> I was writing that, but there was an edit conflict. ¶ <i>Your abusive response was to say that I can't read.</i> You may regard it as abusive; I regard it as a simple inference. ("You can't and won't read" is shorthand for "It appears that you can't and won't read and digest anything longer than a couple of sentences that disagree with your fixed beliefs.") This is something I've thought for several days, but I have until now tried hard to avoid saying this obvious truth. ¶ What are the points I want to put across? They're simple. Go away. Read some books. At least start to become <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">the "automath" that you claim to be</a>. The first twenty pages of any of dozens of good books about language will tell you that you are worse than completely uninformed about this subject, you are grievously <i>misinformed</i> about it. A very easily digestible book about language is <a href="http://www.palgrave-usa.com/catalog/product.aspx?isbn=1403936285" class="external text" title="http://www.palgrave-usa.com/catalog/product.aspx?isbn=1403936285" rel="nofollow">Bauer, Homes and Warren's <i>Language Matters</i></a>. Though temporarily out of print in the US, it should be obtainable via a library. You'll find a detailed description and short review (though one aimed at teachers rather than likely readers) of the book <a href="http://linguistlist.org/issues/18/18-211.html" class="external text" title="http://linguistlist.org/issues/18/18-211.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. When you've become a genuine automath on these matters, come back and edit! -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:38, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Done for now...</b></p>
<p>I addressed Hoary's above comment but I accidentally X'd out of my browser before posting it so it all got erased. It doesn't matter anyway because not much of he said addressed my actual points anyway. However, I talked to a member of the mediation committee and apparently our case might not actually go through mediation for a few more weeks even though the committee accepted it, no member of the committee has yet decided to accept it as mediator. Therefore I am going to wait until the case starts going through with mediation before I spend anymore time arguing it. I will however state my final points which have not been addressed as of yet. Wikipedia clearly states that articles should not have "Undueweight" towards one specific POV and should present <b>ALL</b> POV's equal. The only exception is if one POV is supported by such a tiny minority of people that it does not warrant inclusion I.E. people who believe in a flat earth represent such a tiny minority their views would not be represented in the "Earth" article. However people who are critical of Ebonics like Cosby and other authors I've mentioned do not represent such a small minority and warrant inclusion in this article. If this article mentions ANYTHING about the sociological aspects of Ebonics then it must mention those who criticize it. So far the ONLY arguments that have been brought up are evasive criticisms of the sources themselves not their verifiability which is a big difference. Their criticism of the "factuality" of the opinions of Ebonics or the authority of those who hold them may be justified but their refusal to add them into the article is not. Wikipedia clearly states "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth." <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> Their criticism does not coincide with wikipedia policy and they have no justification for their refusal to add criticism of Ebonics into the article. Criticizing Cosby himself and throwing insults at him really has nothing to do with his speech being mentioned in the article. I will say it again <b>Bill Cosby is not my source.</b> Cosby said what he said and no one questions that. The source in question if you are even questioning the source should be americanrhetoric.com which is where I quoted the speech from. The speech happened and americanrhetoric.com does qualify as a reliable published source. Criticism of the use of AAVE should not be presented in the article as if it's right or wrong. It should simply be presented as existing since it fits the criteria of <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUndue_weight_9fd9.html" title="WP:Undue weight">WP:Undue weight</a>. Since I spoke with the person who accepted this case on behalf of the mediation committee he has informed me that it could be a while before any committee member accepts this case to actually mediate it. So until then I will go back to what I said earlier...I won't spend my time arguing back and forth in circles with those specific editors who believe this article deserves absolutely no mention of the pound cake day speech or any other criticism of AAVE. I will wait for the mediate process to go through before I make any more efforts with this matter.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 07:54, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">African American Portal - Pan African Flag</span></h2>
<p>This image of the United States filled with the Pan African Flag is used very liberally.</p>
<p>African Americans do not accept this flag as representing them. Why must African Americans be seperated from all other Americans?</p>
<p>It seems that this is a politically charged image to use, and by using it, we are advocating that African Americans accept a seperate nationhood to that of the United States.</p>
<p>I hope we will stop using this image and include African Americans with all Americans.</p>
