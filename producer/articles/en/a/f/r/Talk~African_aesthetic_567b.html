<p>This page should have been called "African aesthetic<b>s</b>", as thats the proper grammar. Also, Zoe, as an administrator, I'd like you to allow for the creation of a page at African aesthetics, as we already have <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_aesthetics.html" title="Japanese aesthetics">Japanese aesthetics</a> and whatnot.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 08:20, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zoe is not omnipotent. And given her actions in this matter, I think it best if she not act to do <i>anything</i> further with this article. She should be completely hands-off. Once the undelete is accomplished -- which Zoe is on record as opposing (why not? she's the one who obliterated both "Cool (African aesthetic)" despite the failed Vfd <i>and</i> this one, without discussion), then your suggestion can be addressed. It's not a "spelling error"; there is a distinction. I'm for keeping it as-is -- and for good reason: <i>aesthetic</i> (noun) 1&#160;: <b>a branch of philosophy</b> [emphasis added] dealing with the nature of beauty, art, and taste and with the creation and appreciation of beauty. (Merriam-Webster online) Another source, more appropriate to this matter, defines it as: "noun - <b>a set of principles</b> [emphasis added] underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement." "Aesthetic" -- without the "s" is more appropriate here. The African aesthetic is considered a <i>collective</i> - and not just a bunch of random aesthetic principles grouped together. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 08:45, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Last time I checked though, there are multiple philosophies throughout black Africa-- so wouldn't there be multiple branches; multiple aesthetic<b>s</b>?--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 08:57, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The purpose of this article is to elucidate that <i>particular cluster</i> of aesthetic values and philosophical constructs that are commonly regarded as an overarching (not universal) "African aesthetic." There is room for values differing starkly from those encompassed by this aesthetic to be mentioned, and room to clarify the limits of this universe of cultural values. I didn't do so, because the article was deleted before I got the chance. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 07:05, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm going to read up more on this. From what I've learned thus far, it seems as though a lot of scholarly opinions run contrary to Thompson: the popular opinion of the academy, and of the press, appears to be that cool is purely a result of oppression of Africans in America-- African influence is almost never discussed in a lot of theories. So if this page, or <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28African_aesthetic%29_f096.html" title="Cool (African aesthetic)">Cool (African aesthetic)</a> is restored, then that would have to be addressed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, I'm sorry if I've disrespected you at previous points-- you've been through a lot more than me, and I really need to respect my elders. I'm still sorting out my views on a lot of this stuff. Although I don't agree with you in a lot of ways, I admire your dedication and scholarly knowledge.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 08:35, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's usually because they're simply confining themselves to expressions of cool as evidenced among, usually, male African Americans and they know nothing of traditional African cultures. To read them, you'd think only black <i>men</i> exhibit cool. And I'm livin' proof it ain't so.&#160;:p It's got nothing to do with gender. Yeah, I've read a couple of pieces where cool is written of in strictly reactionary terms -- but that's commentary born of ignorance. African art, African culture isn't their bailiwick, and they're writing only from what relative little they know. In short, it's cultural myopia. Nothing more. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 21:09, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh. The issue is that, we still have to explain their opinions on the subject, even if they're wrong-- along with an explanation of why they're wrong (if that can be verified), because its a very notable view on the subject, wrong or not.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 09:35, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven't really even <i>begun</i> the research on this subject, but when I do, my focus will be on those knowledgeable of the subject matter and how best to write with clarity about some fairly abstract notions.

<p>What do your questions have to do with the specific material presented in the article? I don't see the connection. Kindly discuss the affixing of a tag in discussion before doing so.

<dd>My specific concern is that scholars and other writers recognize several of these African aesthetics as actually being African-American in origin. Until this view can be proven verifiably wrong (which I doubt it can), this article can't be considered verified or npov.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 12:35, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whatever your specific concern is, please do not voice it in the future by slapping a wholly inappropriate tag on the article. The information that has been presented thus far is accurate and properly sourced. Again, my concern in writing this article is, for the moment, an elucidation of that set of values and standards that comprise a widely recognized African aesthetic. Further, a discussion of certain aspects of African-American culture in solely an African-American context does <i>not</i> obviate a discussion of where those elements plausibly originated, based on objective observation of their existence among indigenous African societies, many members of which were kidnapped, sold into chattel slavery and brought to these shores. After all, Africans brought their culture with them. While the racist propaganda of the time said otherwise, they weren't savages without culture arriving in the Americas; they were never stripped completely of their values, mores, traditions, language, etc. Nor was African-American culture created out of whole cloth on this continent -- any more than Chinese-Amercan, Italian-American and American Jewish culture suddenly sprang, newborn, in the New World. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 13:54, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Proponents of the theory that "cool" originated with African-Americans don't claim that the Africans had no culture, or anything like that. They merely claim that the specific aesthetic of cool is African-American in origin-- a response to oppression.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As a sidenote, it appears to me as though this article and the one on cool kind of "cherry pick" various parts of scholarly opinions. For example, when Thompson says something about African cool that conflicts with another scholar thats sourced elsewhere in the article(see below example given by CoYep), the contradiction is ignored and the article appears as verifiable as any-- but its not.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 16:27, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>What may "appear" to you may not be the case. Again, what <i>specific</i> passage(s) are you writing of? And if you have a specific passage that contradicts the material presented, and it is sourced, then present it <i>here</i> before affixing the disputed tag. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 19:38, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My specific dispute is that certain things are claimed as African which are more often recognized as African-American in origin. Also, I think that there are accuracy issues brought up by CoYep's analysis(which mentions specific passages).--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 07:20, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You don't seem to understand the function of a dispute tag. The text as provided is accurate and properly sourced. If you want to include text about another perspective, then you're perfectly entitled add it, citing appropriate sources, of course. Further, I've addressed CoYep's concerns. The list isn't complete, and he's been invited to include or revise items on the list has he sees fit. So far, he hasn't done so. (I'm waiting to see if he intends to contribute constructively to the article or simply criticize.) If you have any further questions regarding the issues CoYep has raised, then feel free to join the discussion below.

<p>Where is the "Caucasian aesthetic," the "Latin aesthetic," the "Asian aesthetic"? I'm sure a member of any of those races would include self-promoting and confidence-boosting "traits" such as: luminosity of motion ("looking sharp"), youthfulness, smoothness (patina), clarity of form and detail, complexity of composition, and composure of the face. All of those are easily replicated in any other race by any member of it who is keen to body language and who has a quick wit and a boatload of confidence. It seems to me that the "African" aesthetic is not so much "African" as it is "rap music video." While this, "The mask of the cool, or facial serenity, has been noted at many points in Afro-American history," is certainly interesting, the elders of any culture no doubt have similar traits and to color the entire continent of Africa (and those who derive from it) with a bulleted list of supposed "aesthetic traits" is bordering on insult and hasty generalization.

<p>IMO, Francis Tyers' response was dead on. Your post is snide and clearly implies that the elements of the African aesthetic are not real, but some sort of ersatz, "self-promoting and confidence-boosting" mumbo-jumbo. If you see a need for a new article, there is a place on the website where you can put the topic on an ever-lengthening list of articles to be created. You would do well to read my post to <a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">User:Urthogie</a> above. You call yourself an "amateur hip-hop producer." Then, perhaps, you should take some time to understand and appreciate the deeper origins of certain elements of African-American culture that you apparently appreciate. And you would do well to read the lead paragraph again. It makes no assertion that the African aesthetic is universal among all African peoples. In the future, why don't you do some research before jumping to unfounded and insulting conclusions? And one more thing. Latino is not a "race." *x* <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 14:01, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In your opinion? Then it holds about as solid a validity as my opinion that the moon is made of cheese?

It doesn't matter if the article was about whites, spaniards, or orientals. I'd still make the same cricism that an aesthetic a bulleted list does not make. "You should take some time to understand and appreciate the deeper origins of certain elements of African-American culture that you apparently appreciate." Thanks for the hasty suggestion. I could care less what you think I think about African culture (-American? How PC). I know enough and I don't sit on my laurels all day researching it, I go outside and see what's happening. How many times a day do you see black folks? By the time you spend on Wikipedia, I'm guessing not a lot. Go outside sometime, that "fore and aft" rocking is long gone and all those ego-stroking vague compliments thinly disguised as traits are barely present in the average black person. And as I review the lead paragraph again, I not only reaffirm my original point, I come to another conclusion: the African aesthetic is so generic it has no "African" in it. Thank you for making me see the light that this article is a sham to begin with.

Suffice it to say I'm in a far better position, as an African American and someone who has studied both African and African-American history and culture for a very long time, to comment on the matter than someone born and raised in Russia who seems unable to trace African-American cool beyond a phenomenon that is a scant few decades old. I find that pretty amusing. Despite your obviously strong convictions, I see your remarks as founded on ignorance and relatively limited observation -- nothing more.

<dd>I don't think you've ever heard of "ad hominem," but I doubt it'll help much. Regardless, where did I originally assume you're not black? I think it's extremely obvious you're black. If not, you're a very dedicated "scholar" of a different race. And since when did I trace this "phenomenon" in rap (which I assume is what you're vaguely referring to)? I don't think you've ever heard of a "straw man" either. I'm in no disagreement that your being black and (apparent) stature in age play an important role in your contributions, but your character, attitudes, and zealotry take away from the relevance and wisdom one would assume an educated African-American would have. Also, how is it that I'm unable to trace "cool" beyond rap? Where did I ever prove this to be true? You're putting words in my mouth, attacking straw men you build, and insult my intelligence based on my place of origin. Since you say you're African-<b>American</b>, this implies you were born in the United States. What in the hell would you know about <b>Africa</b> or its people? Just because I'm born in Russia doesn't mean I know millions of details about my culture or people, nobody Russian does who isn't a dedicated academic scholar (and you are definitely not, seeing as you're hellbent on personal attacks, logical fallacy one after another, and perpetuating a victim attitude beyond comparison). I've lived long enough in America and imagine that, have heard of black people back in Russia (yes, the <b>American</b> variety) to make a few observations, connect enough dots, and distinguish dogmatic propaganda from undisputed truth. Whether or not my "observation" is limited (And to what extent? Yours is too) plays no important part. Whether I've immersed myself in the black culture for 2 or 8 years is irrelevant, as long as it has been longer than the hours most people have been immersed in it. You falsely generalize anyone who disagrees with you as an ignorant peon who watches Viacom television 24/7, buys every Top 40 charting rapper's CD ever, propagates ignorance and social retardation (via rap music, of course, but that's a logical fallacy as well), and then gets mad when a supposedly informed black person disagrees with their stereotype of African-Americans.

<dd>I believe that won't be necessary, although it is a kind and noble gesture on your part. DCV has been previously involved in a myriad of Africa-related controversies and if her reign of terror hasn't been stopped yet, why attempt the impossible now? Even after she's "quit" Wikipedia, she's come back full force, inserting her uninformed opinions into everything African, regardless whether or not it's true or even relevant. This is, after all, a talk page, where the (relative) diplomacy of the Main namespace is shed for real talk.

1. Susan M. Vogel's luminosity refers to the "smooth surface" of most African figural sculptures, and not to "looking sharp" or to a "luminosity of motion". Quite the opposite:</p>
<p><i>"Excerpts from For Spirits and Kings, African Art, by Susan Vogel, reveals that most African art was made not for the mere admiration of people but in the service of spirits and kings. It is functional, not decorative. It was, and still is, made to express and support fundamental spiritual values that are essential to the survival of the community. <b>For this reason, African sculpture is seldom concerned with movement, gesture, or anecdote, but rather seeks to portray a timeless essence."</b></i> <a href="http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2002/08/04/20020804art01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2002/08/04/20020804art01.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Davisart supports this notion: "<i>The human figure is usually carved in <b>a formal, motionless pose</b> which reflects the spiritual composure of the ideal member of society."</i> (AFRICA: WEST AFRICAN SCULPTURE)<a href="http://www.davis-art.com/Portal/DAI/SlideSets_Default.aspx?curPage=ProductDetails&amp;ModelNumber=8-266" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.davis-art.com/Portal/DAI/SlideSets_Default.aspx?curPage=ProductDetails&amp;ModelNumber=8-266" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>2. Why was "Self-composure" modified to <i>"composure of the face"</i>? (see spiritual composure above)</p>
<p>3. <i>"smoothness (patina)"</i> belongs to "luminosity" and/or "Clarity of form and detail, complexity of composition, balance and symmetry, smoothness of finish"</p>
<p>4. Why was the aesthetic element "Resemblance to a human being" not included in the list? <a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoYep_5bfa.html" title="User:CoYep">CoYep</a> 15:00, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When I wrote the intro, I was (and still am) under some fairly tight deadlines. The article was started and composed somewhat hastily to prevent what I viewed as the hijacking of the subject, as well as certain text, from "Cool (African philosophy)" to an inappropriate venue, that of <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28aesthetic%29.html" title="Cool (aesthetic)">Cool (aesthetic)</a>, an article expressly devoted to pop-culture cool. I had looked at two or three sources, had only one in front of me, and was working pretty much from memory regarding the rest. I think I've already said above (or in the voluminous discussion elsewhere on this piece) that the list is partial. Before I could return to it, it Zoe had deleted the article. That's why the list is partial. Also, the language used varies from list to list. If you'd like to add or otherwise modify the list (I think "self-composure" is better, because it's more general), then feel free.</dd>

<dd>"Looking smart" and "luminosity of motion" are from Thompson, "of motion," because in that particular context Thompson was referring to movement (the work from which that information was taken being <i>African Art in Motion</i> in which, among other things, he comments on dance; however, he does also address "smoothness" in static art and clarity of form, as well. (In approaching this subject, one must be careful not to think in terms of only the static expressions, or plastic "art" in the Western sense, but of <i>utilitarian</i> art, which means it is, indeed, frequently in motion; it is danced -- like a mask, for example, or the dance itself. So, while a statue may be a still pose, certainly this would not be so in dance, or walking, or the process of sitting or standing. This subject, as the lead states, is also about comportment, human interaction, standards of beauty (in itself a complex thing encompasssing not just the physical), etc. What you're addressing is the fact that the list of attributes/concepts varies among authors somewhat in the way they are organized/grouped and named, which is to be expected. If you have a strong preference one way or the other, that's fine; I don't. The elements as listed aren't actually in conflict with one another. One more comment: the "of motion" can be omitted because, like "of the face," it is specific, rather than general. And the article really <i>should</i> go from the general to the specific. There's ample room to discuss the specific aspect of facial composure later on.

<i><b>"Cool (aesthetic), an article expressly devoted to pop-culture "cool." (Deeceevoice)</b></i></p>
<p>The article is named "Cool (aesthetic)", not "Cool (pop culture)", that it is "expressly devoted to pop culture" is your interpretation only.</p>
<p><i><b>"I had looked at two or three sources, had only one in front of me, and was working pretty much from memory regarding the rest." (Deeceevoice)</b></i></p>
<p>I would like to have a look at the other lists you were looking at, especially the one you had in front of you when you wrote this passage, since it obviously wasn't the Vogel list. Can you provide the links please?</p>
<p><i><b>""Looking smart" and "luminosity of motion" are from Thompson, "of motion," because in that particular context Thompson was referring to movement (the work from which that information was taken being African Art in Motion in which, among other things, he comments on dance" Deeceevoice)</b></i></p>
<p>Exactly, Thompson is talking about elements of African dance, Vogel is talking about African sculptures - apples and oranges. They have one common denominator, along with Christian and Hindu Iconography (the latter also expressed in dance), namely the interpretation of religious and spiritual symbolism. But the displayed elements vary, and are expressed differently in dance or sculptures or masks. Also, the Orisha communities, for instance, display different spiritual values with different symbols and different elements than, lets say, members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, while the African Muslims do not manufacture these kind of sculptures or masks at all since icon-making is strictly forbidden in Islam.</p>
<p>That leads me to another question: The article states:</p>
<p><code><i>"certain standards of beauty in artistic expression and physical appearance, of propriety of comportment and demeanor are held in common among various indigenous African societies and <b>are not exclusive to any one tribe or society</b>"</i></code></p>
<p>Source: Adams, M. (1989) "African Visual Arts from an Art Historical Perspective" in African Studies Review</p>
<p>As far as I know, in this paper Adams analyzes "Sub-Saharan" art. Can I have an accessable source which supports the article's assertion? Thanks in advance. <a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoYep_5bfa.html" title="User:CoYep">CoYep</a> 02:20, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The lead paragraph states very clearly that the African aesthetic is held in common across "various" peoples; it does not say it is a universal phenomenon across Africa. Finally, African masks are not "icons," <i>per se</i>. The applicable injunction here is against making a representation of the human form, since only God can make man. In Islam, such a practice is <i>haram</i>, or forbidden. Still, there is a considerable and varied body of art, across traditional African societies, from ancient times through to the present day -- granery doors, stools, masks, jewelry, house posts, sculpture, textiles, gold weights, etc. -- in which the human face and form are clearly in evidence. Many traditional African societies, despite being Muslim, still retain their indigenous cultural practices (other Muslims produce such art as purely an economic enterprise) -- and others have remained essentially animist, rather than Muslim. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 06:59, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<i><b>"I didn't bookmark them, but if you Google "African aesthetic," there are listings of the various attributes. They are all pretty much similar, so it shouldn't be too difficult to come up with a list that reasonably includes all of them in some form or fashion" (Deeeceevoice)</b></i></p>
<p>So you can't tell what list you were looking at or where to find it or who wrote it?</p>
<p><br />
<i><b>The lead paragraph states very clearly that the African aesthetic is held in common across "various" peoples; it does not say it is a universal phenomenon across Africa. (deeeceevoice)</b></i></p>
<p>The lead paragraph doesn't state that this is <i><b>NOT</b></i> a universal phenomenon across Africa, it states the opposite, that it is <i><b>not exclusive to any one tribe or society</b></i> and that <i><b>Collectively</b></i>, these values and standards have been characterized as comprising <i><b>a generally accepted</b></i> African aesthetic.</p>
<p><br />
<i><b>"Finally, African masks are not "icons," per se" (Deeceevoice)</b></i></p>
<p><i>Africa is a land with many different tribes and many different customs. It consists of tiny villages and communities scattered amongst each other. Yet while these tribes all have different beliefs and ways of life, many believe in the wonderful and magical power of masks. African masks are the resting place for spirits of any kind. The appearance of the mask and the way it is made indicates what type of spirit resides in it. Masks are very highly respected because of this. There are many different types of spirits, like the harvest spirits, or the spirits of childbirth. Each spirit has a different value and some are more important than others.[Willet pg. 177]</i> <a href="http://www.ccds.charlotte.nc.us/History/Africa/02/mlee/mlee.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccds.charlotte.nc.us/History/Africa/02/mlee/mlee.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<p><i>In traditional Africa, masks were considered to be very crucial objects because they played the essential role of the spirits in the African belief system. The original intent in creating an African mask was to create it for a particular ceremony or societal ritual. Unlike the Western concept in which a mask is considered to be the means of "representing" a spirit, masks in traditional Africa were understood to be where a spirit is "created". In other words, when a person wears the mask along with a costume that conceals him from head to foot, the masked person actually "becomes" the figure whom the disguise is intended to represent, bringing it to life through his gestures, sounds, activities, and often his possessed state. Therefore, African masks are tangible beings transformed from the abstract concept of the spirits' images among African people. African masks are not seperable from African masquerades, which can be described as a process of the mask possessing a spirit.</i> <a href="http://arts.osu.edu/ArtEducation/kplayground/masks.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://arts.osu.edu/ArtEducation/kplayground/masks.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>

<dd>One of the basic tenets of good writing is that it is affirmative -- meaning that it states what something is, rather than what it is not. The passage states that these values and standards "are held in common among <i>various</i> [emphasis added]] indigenous African societies" -- which clearly indicates not "all." If the lead is not sufficiently precise for your taste, then you are, of course, perfectly free to modify it. And because you are free to modify it, as with all article content (for the most part, anyway), if you choose <i>not</i> to modify it, then presumably it is acceptable to you. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 10:56, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wrote the lead to <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28aesthetic%29.html" title="Cool (aesthetic)">Cool (aesthetic)</a> quite some time ago, and it has remained through successive edits, because it states accurately and succinctly the nature of cool as a pop culture phenomenon, which is the commonly accepted subject of the article. Until the information from the now defunct "Cool (African philosophy)" was added after its illegal deletion, that is also what comprised the body of information presented in the article itself. Now that that erroneously inserted information has been removed, pop-culture cool is once again what is covered in the article. Again, this is echoed by the text disambiguation page -- <s>which, incidentally, I did not write</s>. (I checked the edit history. I did! Almost two months ago.&#160;:p The same with the article itself. If people disagreed, there has been ample time for people to change the wording. But they haven't.

<p>Yes, that may be. Or, it may be that all edits by other editors, among them the attempts to broaden the definition of "cool", were removed by <i>one</i> certain editor since day one.

<i><b>"What are you trying to get at by simply reproducing paragraphs of text about the (rather well known) significance of masks?" (Deecceevioce)</b></i></p>
<p>I just thought it might be helpful to provide some informations since this <i>"rather well known) significance of masks"</i> slipped of your memory a few paragraphs above.</p>
<p><br />
Back to topic: It is impossible to separate the anthropology of African religion from the aspects of African aesthetics per Vogel or Thompson. Unless, of course, you drop Vogel and Thompson in favor of Welsh Asante's africentric approach. But then, Welsh Asante has made up her very own set of African aesthetic elements, unfortunately, without the concept of "mystic coolness", which should, according to <i>your</i> opinion, be the foundation for your articles. By the way, do you remember where the concept of "mystic coolness" has it's origins? <a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoYep_5bfa.html" title="User:CoYep">CoYep</a> 10:57, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, no. To say the subject "slipped of [my] memory [sic] a few paragraphs above" is a complete misinterpretation/mischaracterization of my comments. To say that masks are not icons, <i>per se</i>, is not to say they do not have spiritual significance or that they do not, in many cases, represent spirits. The spiritual and religious significance of masks in African art and life is widely recognized/known, but my statement is correct. They are, indeed, <i>not</i> icons in the traditional, European sense of the term; people do not pray before them or offer up prayers to them. My point was that the specific Islamic stricture against masks and figural sculpture is related to the notion that it is <i>haram</i> to produce representations of the human form, as only God can make man. That is all. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 13:17, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>And precisely. That is why I have urged you not to think of "aesthetics" in simply the context of plastic art (which is what you seemed to be doing in your comment about the static poses of traditional sculpture and the notion of "art in motion," or performance art) and why it extends to human interaction and comportment, physical movement, concepts of propriety and beauty, etc. Further, the goal of <i>this</i> article is to examine the "African aesthetic" in its complexity and totality. Here, it is removed from Thompson's overarching rubric of "cool" and its component parts as Thompson has grouped them (as well as others), examined as independent elements, with composure (and "cool") as one of those constituents. As a consequence, I believe this piece is more aptly named and probably less confusing than using Thompson's original rubric of "cool" -- which he seems to have altered somewhat (this speaks to grouping and organization of the constituent elements, but no change in the nature of the elements themselves) in subsequent years. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 13:23, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Murphy American Ethnologist November 1998, Vol. 25, No. 4, pp. 563-582</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this ethnography of politics, the theory of the sublime is used to clarify the aesthetics of power among the Mende of Sierra Leone. A key formal dimension of this aesthetics is the dialectic of extraordinary visible effects caused by powerful hidden means, which is analyzed through the cultural analogy of dance and politics. This dialectic is also shown to link the aesthetics of the sublime with the politics of charisma as expressing similar logics of expressive power. Aesthetics is treated as an ethnographic heuristic for understanding political power and agency. The Mende political sublime raises broader questions for social theory about the relationship between aesthetics and agency as modeled by the opposition in aesthetic theory between beauty and the sublime. It also addresses the implications of this aesthetic opposition for the typology of agency found in the period ization of premodern, modern, and postmodern social conditions, [the sublime versus beauty, aesthetics of power, charisma, West African political culture, premodern versus postmodern agency]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary Linking concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Words for beauty and goodness often intersect, as Susan Vogel has noted among the Baule peoples of Côte d'Ivoire and others have discerned among the Lega and Songye of the Congo and the Igbo, Edo, and Ibibio of Nigeria, among others.</li>
<li>External perfection and internal moral excellence are linked</li>
<li>Physical perfection and ideal social order, also linked.</li>
<li>For many African cultures, how an object looks is related to the way it works, according to strict aesthetic specifications, for protection, healing, communication, mediation, or empowerment.</li>
</ul>
Terms(All these terms imply a power-knowledge relationship):
<ul>
<li>For Bantu-speaking peoples of central, eastern, and southern Africa, a power called <a href="../../../n/k/i/Nkisi.html" title="Nkisi">nkisi</a> is manifest in sculpture and other expression</li>
<li>For Mande-speaking peoples of western Africa, secret and instrumental knowledge is called nyama.</li>
<li>For African Muslim mystics, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baraka.html" title="Baraka">baraka</a> is a blessing energy emanating from saintly tombs, written and spoken verses, and visual forms.</li>
</ul>
Occult knowledge(These can be highly esoteric and understood only by the initiated):
<ul>
<li>As is true for many other African philosophies, <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yoruba.html" title="Yoruba">Yoruba</a> aesthetics also privilege knowledge that is allusive, indirect, and enigmatic, through: Patterns in textiles, designs on ceramics, houses, and sculpture, graphic inscriptions on walls, masks, and the body, and verbal arts such as proverbs, epics, and songs.</li>
<li>Geometric patterns on Bamana bogolanfini textiles from Mali encode women's herbal medicinal recipes.</li>
<li>In other cases, patterns connote resistance, as did the surreptitious painting of African National Congress colors on homes by southern African women during apartheid.</li>
</ul>
Another characteristic of many African aesthetic systems is that objects, narratives, songs, and performances are interpreted by audiences in many different ways through <i>intentional</i> semantic variability.
<ul>
<li>Among Luba peoples of the southeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, thrones and staffs embody beauty and royal authority but are also mnemonic devices stimulating the making of history.</li>
<li>The process of making art is often more valuable than the final products, and such dynamism is the essence of aesthetic experience.</li>
<li>Objects may have ephemeral usage before being destroyed or progressing to the next phases in layered histories.</li>
<li>An anti-aesthetic is also common, as in certain satirical masquerades among the Mende of Sierra Leone and the beauty-beast performances of the Igbo and Ibibio of Nigeria.</li>
</ul>
Recent study of African aesthetics includes two critically important thrusts:
<ul>
<li>popular urban arts</li>
<li>diasporic art forms of the black Atlantic, and an Indian Ocean world linking eastern Africa with South Asia</li>
</ul>
As Karin Barber notes, African popular arts fall between the cracks of "traditional" and "elite" or "modern" art. The hybridized forms of Africa's dynamic popular urban arts reflect not only constant absorption of ideas from the outside but also long-standing adaptive processes through which Africans have always been innovative players in world forums.</blockquote>
