	    <p>Afectz [Af-ectz v. uh-fektz; n. af-ektz] - A Music Producer who's real name is Luis Meza was born and raised in North East Los Angeles by his Father after his mother decided to pick up and leave. his dad worked as a pro photographer and owned his own Studio. As a kid Afectz grew up learning to play piano from a Christian pastor whose church he attended with his family but was never really able to finish his last few lesson because his father would bounce from church to church through out most of his childhood. Finally his dad settled down in a church called “Koinonia” when he was around the age of 8. Afectz still showed great passion for music at church with all the other kids at Sunday school he started to develop a love for music he says “I remember playing in a room with a whole bunch of kids and we would grab some of the toys and pretend we where the church band one would play the guitar another the drums and so on. We would all sing along as we would bang on whatever we would find to make an instrument”. His desire for music grew more as he grew up as a teen. But then again he would have another person really close to him leave him behind and have a greater impact in his life then his mom did. So he turned to music and gangs as an outlet in result to this his name soon was starting to get know cross radio stations in the areas of Los Angeles and New York where his beats would be played in the background while Dee-jay’s did there shout outs and morning shows. Sooner or Later Top Dogs like “Snoop Dogg” and “Daddy-V” where hitting him up for beats and mix tapes together with a lot of other artist and labels in the Hip-Hop and R&amp;B music biz. But Louie “Afectz” was not able to pursue a lot of this due to the fact he got locked up this would have him off the map for 6 months Louie “Afectz” states “During the time I was locked up I noticed I had strayed from the path I was suppose to be on God’s path so I made a vow to stay faithful to him”. After getting out Louie “Afectz” started from scratch again and with the help of a few Dee-Jays that where still around on the radio got some radio play again in both towns LA and NY but was not really going anywhere and just when he was about to give up on it all a guy called “Freddie Foxxx” which is affiliated with a group called “Gang Starr” stepped in and boosted him up and showed him the ropes to the music game. After applying everything taught and told by “Freddie Foxxx” Louie “Afectz” started began seeing results and reactions from artist and major labels. He got signed to a Major Hip-hop Label in 2001and after being there for 3 years has left and is now working with Christian musicians and artist “I feel and know this is where God wants me and where I belong my goal is to make Gods name know through Good music hip-hop, rock, punk, ska, R&amp;B whatever genre you can think of and let young people know there is a God and good Christian music out there and bring this sound and message to ears of non-believers and believers”.''''''''''</p>
