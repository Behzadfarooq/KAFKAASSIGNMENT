<p>We're on the brink of edit wars here with respect to genre, so let's get all the arguing out of the way here. We've had various edits and reverts labelling AFI as punk, punk rock, hardcore, hardcore punk. I think there's definite reason to mention a gothic influence encompassing all hallows to the art of drowning, too. -- <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdowland_630e.html" title="User:Jdowland">Jon Dowland</a> 08:27, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There ya' go! Gothic music is practically defined by horror imagery and themes (though I don't mean to downplay it's other attributes and structural differences from punk). AFI has DEFINATELY had horror themes and imagery as a mainstay since All Hallows (at least). You simply can't deny the influence. - <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzo_Dragon_58af.html" title="User:Enzo Dragon">Enzo Dragon</a> 10:03, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yep, definately can't be labelled as hardcore, maybe gothic/punk? Musically wise they seem to have a punkish sound, but lyrically definately goth 222.154.66.70 07:08, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AFI started as a hardcore punk band, and those roots echo in their music right up to Decemberunderground (best example is Kill Caustic). AFI themselves have confirmed this. Therefor, the hardcore label stays. - <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzo_Dragon_58af.html" title="User:Enzo Dragon">Enzo Dragon</a> 17:59, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the genres listed now are OK. Though people need to stop adding emo. <a href="../../../d/w/n/User%7EDwnsjane2_ef71.html" title="User:Dwnsjane2">Dwnsjane2</a></p>
<p>They started as punk/harcore, then expanded their sound, most notably incorporating elements of gothic rock. I have no idea where the emo tag comes from; in fact i've never heard anyoe outside of Wikipedia call them emo. The current genre terms (alternative, punk, hardcore) are fine by me. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 01:43, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Though AFI seem to have dropped the horror imagery for the most part, they've turned around and picked up some cyber-goth tricks. Best example is 37mm. - <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzo_Dragon_58af.html" title="User:Enzo Dragon">Enzo Dragon</a> 13:15, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think goth/punk is fine I guess.-Leandreamo</p>
<p>Whoever wrote the new label is wrong. AFI isn't emo. Their myspace (yes I'm a myspacer) labels them as rock/rock/rock. I think they should be labeled as rock or gothic rock, because they definitely aren't emo. No offense to emos, but labeling AFI as emo is an insult to AFI.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The term "emo" is PURELY a market-based term now, anyway. AFI is listed under their label as punk/alternative rock. Their myspace claims they are rock. MTV (though I hate to cite them) refers to them as punk rock. The only people claiming they are emo are misinformed, worthless magazines that have little or no understanding of what the tag "emo" refers to. <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzo_Dragon_58af.html" title="User:Enzo Dragon">Enzo Dragon</a> 10:03, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yet, the article you are citing is, itself, a collection of the writer's opinions on AFI, not neccessarily facts. Such writing style is fine for magazines like "People", but Wikipedia is not a magazine. It is an encyclopedia, and so the content is expected to be fact, and not just some person's opinion. If you're going to make claims that AFI incorporates elements of "emo" and treat it as fact in an encyclopedia article, you'd better have a citation better than a magazine based around opinion. I think for such an accusation to be made and treated as fact, you'd need to be able to cite the band itself. - <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzo_Dragon_58af.html" title="User:Enzo Dragon">Enzo Dragon</a> 12:04, 26 August 2006 (UTC) <small>Stop signing my posts for me, kid.</small></dd>

<dd>Classifying music into genres is inherently a matter of opinion anyway, since the classifications are just agreements between listeners. "AFI is rock" is opinion, at its core. If you're going to deny the cited claim, the burden is on you to find a "better" citation. (Citing the band itself is still citing an opinion: the band members' opinion.) -- <a href="../../../j/h/u/User%7EJHunterJ_08ee.html" title="User:JHunterJ">JHunterJ</a> 11:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose I can't delete because the emo note because it is sourced. As long as that mention doesn't justifly the genre being changed to emo or emo being added as a genre. Because obviously the term emo should only be applied to the emotional hardcore bands (Rites Of Spring, Moss Icon etc.) and the post-/indie emo that were influnced by them (Sunny Day Real Estate, Get Up Kids etc.). <a href="../../../d/w/n/User%7EDwnsjane2_ef71.html" title="User:Dwnsjane2">Dwnsjane2</a> 23:11, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will only be okay with an emo label if the band members themselves would confirm it. Otherwise they're alternative rock. There's a dozen labels that could be attributed to this band, since their music is somewhat unique in comparison to other bands of the same "alternative" genre. Remember, because they have a song called "Endlessly, She Said" doesn't qualify an Emo label. Remember, Evanescence got the Christian label with their song "Tourniquet" because of the lyrics. So in the mean time, I think it would be best to keep the genre as Rock or Alternative. And I agree, it may be okay to add that some songs have emo elements, in addition to gothic and punk. --<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPrezboy1_6ff2.html" title="User:Prezboy1">Prezboy1</a> 16:12, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why should AFI be classified as gothic. The only reason one would classify them as that genre, if can even call it a genre, is because of the way they, or should I say the way Davey looks.--Ahlymel 01:33, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Though I wouldn't go as far as to say that AFI is "gothic rock", they have noted bands of both the post-punk and gothic persuation as influences, and every album since Shut Your Mouth has had a tint of trad goth in it, whether it be in the sound or imagery they use in their songs. <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzo_Dragon_58af.html" title="User:Enzo Dragon">Enzo Dragon</a> 10:03, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AFI shouldn't be classified as gothic. I was just pointing out that while some elements of different songs have been called "emo", there are just as many songs that could be classified as having gothic undertones. As I said before, AFI is either Alternative or Punk... and until the band members classify their genre as something else then I believe it is okay to change it. --<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPrezboy1_6ff2.html" title="User:Prezboy1">Prezboy1</a> 20:30, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's a lot of emotion in a lot of different bands lyrics, doesn't make them "Emo". Give me a break. As for Gothic Rock, yes Davey has been influenced by a few trad Goth bands, but doesn't make the band Gothic Rock at all. Their latest release has Rhonan Harris (SP?) of VNV Nation doing samples, but that doesn't make them FuturePop. I see more elements of Industrial/EBM (in their latest stuff) than Gothic Rock in any of their stuff. JanderVK</dd>

I'd say A Fire Inside was/is/has been an emocore (REAL emocore, not the MTVfriendly pop rock bands that whore themselves as being emo), punk, gothic hardcore and alternative band. First 2 albums are definitely emocore/emocore-influenced punk. The next 3 are more gothic-influenced punk/alternative/rock. Sing the Sorrow a Gothic Hardcore/Alternative album. And finally DecemberUnderground a Modern Rock/Alternative Pop/Gothic album.</p>

<dd>The state of the term "Emo" is a joke. Bands acredited to supposedly have started Emotive (Fugazi, Rites of Spring) have at one time or another openly admitted that they had done nothing but write punk rock, and often wonder why they had been put under a new genre.</dd>
<dd>At any rate, until you started abusing the edit feature, the genre section had genrely settled. It is in wide concurance that AFI is now Alternative Rock, and AFI themselves only state Rock as their genre (take a look at their myspace). The song Kill Caustic, and, to a lesser extent, Affliction, are both "Hardcore Punk" songs. Davey has stated this (read pre-release interviews), and the music itself reflects the stylings of hardcore punk music.</dd>
<dd>I strongly suggest you refrain from kicking this silly little edit-war farther - the changes will continue to be reverted by everyone else. <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzo_Dragon_58af.html" title="User:Enzo Dragon">Enzo Dragon</a> 21:47, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AFI have certainly been a hardcore punk band since they formed, and the hardcore sound is evident right up to DU. But i think that some songs on "The Art of Drowning" and much of "Sing the Sorrow" would be best classified as melodic hardcore. Listen to Dancing through SUnday.</p>
<p>Ok, this is my take on things, and take it from someone who actually knows what they are talking about. AFI started out as a hardcore punk revival band. With All Hallows and The Art of Drowning they were still punk, but they were now starting to lean towards emo with gothic influence. With Sing the Sorrow, the completely became an emo band. The lyrics reflect emo lyrics and their musical style blends melodic vocals with screaming, as emo is apt to do sometimes. Granted there is significant hardcore influence, most notably in the speed of the songs, but it is still emo. With DU, they became even further emo, incorporating elements of New Wave in to their music. That is simply what they are. I have changed some of the article at the beginning to reflect this, but I haven't touched most of the latter portions of the article. I am a fan of AFI, and use the term emo as a completely objective term, not the derogative term it has become in recent years. Emo is simply what they are. Sing the Sorrow is easily one of my favorite albums of all time (though DU is one of my least favorite). →(unsigned)</p>
<p>^emo as a term is a load of bullshit. sorry, it just has to be said. you just can't use emo as a description, it's a derogatory term to describe certain genres of rock which its detractors don't like and to describe the people that like it. if you're referring to the original emotional hardcore, call it emotional hardcore and P!ATD/AFI/Paramore/Aiden style emo isn't real emo anyway. i hate all this stuff with genres anyway, afi were right to put "rock/rock/rock" down on their myspace profile, afi's music is unclassifiable, you may as well list "Various incarnations of AFI style punk depending on where davey, jade, adam and hunter want to take their music" as its genre. --<a href="../../../g/p/m/User%7EGpmuscillo_6985.html" title="User:Gpmuscillo">Gpmuscillo</a> 22:27, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hm-hm! I think it's so cute to see you guys argue like this. AFI has no genre. Davey has said this many times before. I don't recall them ever saying they were emo, emocore, punk, hardcore punk, or alternative. I really think that we should just classify them as rock or, at the very least, punk/alternative rock. Honestly, AFI fans should remember all the insances in which not just Davey, but even the others, have stated that they do not belive in classifing their music in a genre. They really do not want a label. So don't give them one. They have NO GENRE. Sorry if I sounded at all like a bitch at any time during my rant. I just really like AFI. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloramage_5423.html" title="User:Floramage">Floramage!</a> 17:13, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>AFI Has specifically stated that their music is not emo. They said if you had to give it a genre, give it rock. AFI's new music from Decemberunderground can be comparable to stuff from Depeche Mode, NIN, The Smiths, U2, none of these bands are emo. Therefore Rock fits the best genre. Plus EMO Music needs the music style and the lyrics, though AFI's lyrics are darker than normal, they are certainly not very emo. 142.161.32.96 17:03, 26 January 2007 (UTC)Corey</p>
<p>OK.The Genre paragraph I create was non encyclopedic and unsourced.But I've read all the discussions here and in other places and wrote what people think.And I think there should be 'Genre' section about their genre in the article because their music is complex and is mix of many styles.I think in the article should be mention that.:) Also I know people who think AFI have never been hardcore punk or punk.

<dd>Such as AFI. <small>"Correctly or not, emo has often been used to describe such bands as AFI, Alexisonfire, Brand New, Bright Eyes, Coheed and Cambria, Death Cab for Cutie, Fall Out Boy, From First to Last, Funeral for a Friend, Hawthorne Heights, My Chemical Romance, Panic! at the Disco, Senses Fail, Something Corporate, The Starting Line, Story of the Year, Taking Back Sunday, Thursday, The Used, and Underoath.[8] The classification of bands as "emo" is often controversial. Fans of several of the listed bands have recoiled at the use of the "emo" tag, and have gone to great lengths to explain why they don't qualify as "emo". In many cases, the term has simply been attached to them because of musical similarites, a common fashion sense, or because of the band's popularity within the "emo" scene, not because the band adheres to emo as a music genre. (The revulsion of some bands from the term emo is not unlike the retreat from the genre by the bands in the indie emo scene near the end of the 90s.)"</small></dd>

<p>I beg to differ. Although their music and lyrics sound emotional, I highly doubt that the band would agree with you on labeling them as "emo". They have already stated that they are ROCK, not EMO. Really, listen or read one of their interviews and you'll see that they have never stated that they were emo, only rock.

<p>most definitely not emo. yeah, sure, even though more often then not emo is deregatory, it kind of is if you call AFI emo. they do mention suicide and dark, macabre details but don't make droning ballads about lost love and ending life. isn't it enough that they were insulted when they were told that they were considered so, and denied it? LollyLo 04:37, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Stop kidding yourself they are the definition of emo</p>
<p>They have NEVER been Emo.They have never been true emo, they have NEVER been MTV Poseous Emo.They have no connection with Emo! They are punk/alternative band.Although they often are said to be emo...</p>
<p>--Regardless of whether or not they're "true" emo, I think AFI can be described emo pretty accurately. "Emotional hardcore". That pretty much sums up AFI's sound. And their newer material pretty much has all the basic characteristics of what emo sounds like. Now I realize that emo is a pretty broad, widely applicable nowadays, but I think there are certain things that most people can agree sound emo. The thing is, since emo has a negative affiliation for a lot of people, people often attempt to dissociate whatever music they listen to from that label. I think it would be best if people could just accept that maybe they like an emo band, so what, get over it. I like Silverstein, and I consider them to be emo. (Oddly enough I'm commenting on this and I don't even like AFI).

<p>no man, they are most definitely emo... who said the danzig haircut? that was from when he was in the Misfits, to my understanding that was emo as anything. Gothic? Please, they aren't gothic, and are far from hardcore punk. Alt rock is the closest thing next to emo(which is the right one). Lyrics:emo. Video(MIss Murder anyone?): Emo.

<dd>AFI is not Death Rock. "Deathrock" is NOT simply "between punk and goth". Deathrock describes a certain brand of goth rock, more specifically goth rock from the second wave (in retrospect).

<p>Do not change AFI's genre again. AFI is not alt rock. That's stupid. For one, alt rock is way to broad of a term. If you called something alt rock, they could play anything from red hot chilipeppers type crud, to yellowcard type crud, to fricking black flag type crud. It's too broad of a term. Second off, whichever little fan boy got insulted cause someone called AFI emo, needs to get a life. EMO IS NOT A DEROGATORY TERM! Emo is what AFI has become in recent years. I'm a fan of them. I fricking know what I'm talking about here. I've been keeping up with the progression of this band forever and I'm a fricking encyclopedia when it comes to punk sub-genres. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.253.34.86_ab9a.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.253.34.86">4.253.34.86</a> (<a href="../../../4/2E/2/User_talk%7E4.253.34.86.html" title="User talk:4.253.34.86">talk</a>) 18:21, 16 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>first off, emo is a way to describe some of the bands lyrics, yes. the music however, is far from emo. emo music is generally down-tempo and even when it is not it never reaches the breakneck speed of AFI's. the "emo" bands of today are not really emo. hawthorne heights and my chemical romance are not emo. they are pop rock with emo lyrics. jawbreaker and the promise ring are emo. alternative rock is a broad term, yes. but how do you define a band who in 15 years, have gone from having songs about cereal wars and key lime pie to having songs about making beauty stay if you take your life? also, chill out. we are all fans here. but dont proclaim that you know more about this band then someone else does.</dd>

<dd>Well, I'm all for blunted lyricism and obvious poetry, but I don't think Miss Murder falls into one of those categories, lyrically. After all, the rest of the song uses a lot of interpretable imagery, and it's careful not to give form to it's main players ("he", and "them") besides Miss Murder. Given that context, I think it's hard to assume that "take my life" refers to straight out suicide. HOWEVER, we probably shouldn't go on about this here.

<p>I'll explain the basic terms listed in the infobox:</p>
<ul>
<li>Punk rock: for the majority of their career, certainly. Backed up by various sources</li>
<li>Hardcore: same as above</li>
<li>Alternative rock: starting around 1999, they started gradually putting in a lot of <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_rock.html" title="Gothic rock">gothic rock</a> influence, which is one of the main alternative genres. They don't play outright goth, but they have also slowed down their tempos in recent albums and worked with producers like <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butch_Vig_0930.html" title="Butch Vig">Butch Vig</a>. Listed as alternative on Allmusic and goth in other places.</li>
<li>Emo: I think this has to do primarily with Davey Havok's vocals. Nevertheless, Emo is used to label them on Allmusic as well, but that's the only place I've seen it used for the band so far. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 03:12, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

FOR GOODNESS SAKE!!! I am an AFI fan to!!!!! I may be 14 but I love them and emo is not what I would describe AFI as. EMO is a stupid term used for emotional... in other terms people who dress in black dont smile and slit their wrists. &lt;-- stupid ha?? Whoever describes their lyrics as emo is wrong!!! Their lyrics are just meaningful!!! Its better than that other mainstream crap!!! AFI just expands on it and uses much more meaninful words. December underground may have a few songs that may seem 'emo' but emo is not a correct term!! Sing the Sorrow is more punk rock and even AFI believes that their music is not emo!!! ~crushed velvet~</p>

<p>Speaking from my perspective, saying "I love A Fire Inside" in typical conversation or something of the like makes you seem as if you are trying too hard. Really. Another common "joke" in the AFI community is to call them "Afee" or "Ahfee"; mocking the mispronunctiation that plagues us. Some laugh hysterically. I shake my head and call you an idiot. And they have ALWAYS been A fire inside. ALWAYS. Some say A Bunch of Freaking Idiots, blahblahblah. It runs the gamut. But the band has repeatedly stated that they have always been.

<p>They were always called AFI but have not always been called a fire inside. and besides, afi is ther term that you always use. or "affy" if you're my sister. and yeah, the thing about adam, jade, davey and hunter's band is evasive, cos afi hasn't always been adam, jade, davey and hunter's band, so there's a potential for smartassery/finding a loophole. --<a href="../../../g/p/m/User%7EGpmuscillo_6985.html" title="User:Gpmuscillo">Gpmuscillo</a> 22:18, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not convinced this section is correct. It states the release was '95, then re-released 96 on Nitro. However, the article doesn't mention the first album re-release on nitro (96). I think this might be a mix-up. As far as I can tell, VPOY was released for the first time on nitro in '96.<br /></p>

<p>Given that I'm going to have an excess of free time in the near future, I think I am going to take it upon myself to flesh out AFI's discography a bit more. I started working on <i>336</i> a little. Question, though: would it be appropriate of me to add them into the rotation on the individual existing album pages? For example, currently <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Art_of_Drowning_ca4a.html" title="The Art of Drowning">The Art of Drowning</a></i> links forward to <i><a href="../../../s/i/n/Sing_the_Sorrow_34c4.html" title="Sing the Sorrow">Sing the Sorrow</a></i>, and <i>Sing the Sorrow</i> back to <i>The Art of Drowning</i>, despite <i><a href="../../../3/3/6/336_Now_The_World_4138.html" title="336/Now The World">336</a></i> coming out between them. Once I get the <i>336</i> page up to snuff, shall I set those two pages to link to it, and have it link forward and back to them?--<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Dream_5d5b.html" title="User:Blue Dream">Blue Dream</a> 19:55, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, <i>336</i> isn't an album, so I wouldn't suggest doing that. Looking at e.g. <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloodflowers.html" title="Bloodflowers">Bloodflowers</a>, singles/EPs etc. are not included in the rotation. However, the box on the RHS of <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broken_%28album%29.html" title="Broken (album)">Broken (album)</a> indicates that singles, EPs etc. <i>are</i> included in the rotation for <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Inch_Nails_f615.html" title="Nine Inch Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a> (note also the page title being prefixed with (album), dispite it not being an album). I'd suggest looking around other groups and seeing what the concensus is. NIN may be an exceptional case, as every last release of theirs was given a unique sequencing ('halo') number, singles and all. I think some of AFI's earlier releases may be more difficult to include like this, so I'm inclined to think only albums should be in it. -- <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdowland_630e.html" title="User:Jdowland">Jon Dowland</a> 11:25, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you that NIN doesn't really work as an example either way, with their Halo system and all, but I think that EPs of entirely new material deserve -- i.e., <i>All Hallow's</i>, <i>A Fire Inside</i>, and <i>336</i> -- should be... well, I don't want to say treated as albums, because they're not... essentially, I think there's a difference between a single, which may or may not include any b-sides, and an EP, which is specifically new material, generally. The Cure haven't really had any EPs, per se... even though they did have a few non-album singles back in the day -- which somewhat defeats my point, doesn't it, then?

<dd>You've done a great job with the discography. It makes me feel all warm inside to look at that enormous list of releases because it really shows at a glance that AFI was around before StS. Besides, the albums are the things that really MAKE the band - their history and all that is extra stuff. I would consider the EPs as equal to the albums. There's a huge difference in length, but isn't <i>All Hallow's</i> usually acknowledged as one of their BEST albums? <i>A Fire Inside</i> was the last album made with a member of the original line-up (the end of an era), and <i>336</i> is part of the <i>Clandestine</i> and <i>Sing the Sorrow</i> mystery that's had fans over-analyzing things for three years now.

<p>The compilations section is huge. I've moved the "real" compilations into it (the eponymous release on Nitro and the vinyl boxed-set), but the others are mostly multi-artist punk comps. It would make more sense to list the actual song(s) that AFI ahve on those comps where possible, but also that should go in it's own article as it really crowds out the rest of the info on this one.

<dd>Just so you two know, the the logo that had been featured here was actually a very, very high quality rendition.

<p>I'd have just put this under the "Genre" headline already created, but I think this deserves special attention. GothicEmbrace made an edit awhile down the line, and then continued insisting that the genre section should be devided into sections (Early/Mid/Current, or something along those lines). It seems to me that this is both unprecidented and unecessary. Take, for instance, the Clash, a band that has been around the spectrum quite a bit. It's article is not devided into sections, but instead the genres are listed without noting the time-period. This seems most practicle to me, since the job of a band article, as I see it, is to provide information on the band in all years - it is the job of Album articles to assign a genre to individual eras. Certainly by way of ear-work, we can hear AFI's roots up into their latest work, both in the Hardcore Punk and Punk Rock genres, which makes AFI's case much more a candidate for non-sectioned genre. 70.16.196.104 05:46, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Emo would be the genre I would classify them as. Seeing as "Correctly or not, emo has often been used to describe such bands as AFI, Alexisonfire, Brand New, Bright Eyes, Coheed and Cambria..."</dd>

<p>as people cant decide what genre afi are why dont you put genre Debated and write a bit about all the music style that afi blend in to there music in the article. look at the him page for ideas <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIM_%28band%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIM_%28band%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIM_%28band%29</a></p>

<dd>I checked out the HIM page and it seems like a good idea. However, remember the 'no original research' stipulation - if we could perhaps find a source talking about the difficulty in classifying their genre? Or a number of sources that list their genre differently? Mnesimache 16:35, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
