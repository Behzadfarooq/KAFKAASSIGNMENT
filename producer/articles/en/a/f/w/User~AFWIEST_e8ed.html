	    <p>Dance and Theatre of India: Bharata Natyam</p>
<p>What is a Brahmin? What is Sanskrit? Why do women in India shake their ‘tail feathers’ and get all dressed up for a dance that American’s may say is bizarre and yet still intriguing? Why is the Bharata Natyam such an important form of South Indian’s classical music, dance and theatre…why should one care? Brahmin’s are ancient and present teachers of the dance and theatre form known as the Bharata Natyam and Sanskrit is apart of the primary foundation for the Vedic Sanskrit language, which pertains partially to the formation of specific Indian theatre forms (Singha, 19). Numerous women in India shake their ‘tail feathers’ for the Bharata Natyam because it contains mostly Lasya characteristics (feminine grace) within its performances and is a respected India art form for women to show their heritage with pride and charisma (Gargi, 38). Why should one care about Bharata Natyam…perhaps for not only the reason that it is traditionally one of India’s most sacred and beautiful dances; but that it is a form of South Indian classical dance that combines the use of theatrical performance along with the rhythm of music to create a justly awesome transcendent experience for a spectator of any ethnicity or culture. The more one divulges into the enigmatic, entrancing world and history of the Bharata Natyam, the more one becomes connected to what Indian dance, theatre and music are without their stigmatic skins; pure folk lore (transcendence, emotions, spirituality) and pure love along with appreciate of artistic heritage (cultural tradition, important balance of music, theatre and dance). “Bharata Natyam, which perhaps takes its name from Bharata’s Natyasastra and is over two thousand years old… (Gargi, 38) The term Bharata Natyam came to life between 200 BC and A.D. 200 and is derived from the great sage, Bharata Muni. Bharata created the Bharata Natyam as part of his extensive dramaturgy entitled Natyasastra which was, and to this day still is, considered to be the most knowledgeable text on South Indian theatre and dance performance. Muni also put together the Natyasastra in great relation to the Indian Gods and people’s beliefs that only powerful Sage’s could transcend the true implements of Natyaveda, a collection of imperative concepts regarding speech, song, mime and sentiment, into practice (Gangi 4-5). Temple dancers known as Devadasis also helped carry out the sacred tradition of the Bharata Natyam by passing it down from generation to generation (Singha, 218). There are several other contributor’s to the Bharata Natyam including; Kannada Hoysalsa queen Shantala/Shantele whom performed the Bharata Natyam long before it was put into text, also, it is said that the Indian God Krishna and the noble Rukmini were the first to bring it to the stage (Wikipedia Corrections, 1). Today, Bharata Natyam is habitually performed in Kerala, India. The Arabian Sea lies just west of Kerala and to the east of Kerala is the western mountain range of the Ghats. Kerala is extremely southwest of the Indian peninsula and Bharata Natyam is a large part of the Kerala people’s culture (Indian maps, 1). Bharata Natyam’s folk and music etymology derives from three broken down sounds within the word itself. Bha, meaning Bhava or abhinya (expression), Ra for Raga or melody and Ta for Tala or rhythm (Wikipedia Corrections, 1). It is common for the Indian classical form Raga to be played throughout the dance of the Bharata Natyam, for the melodic mode helps to unify the performer into her (or his) transcendence into the God Krishna (linear notes, 02/21/07). Known as the 5th Veda, Bharata Natyam is a reference to the idea of Hindu religion and philosophy which gave birth to the concept of Carnatic music which is also apart of Bharata Natyam and the South Indian music culture. When Raga or other forms of Carnatic music accompany Bharata Natyam, other elements of the dance our given life and spiritual meaning while telling a story of historical and emotional magnitudes (Theatres of Asia, 1986). Various musical instruments are involved with in the Raga process, but there a few explicit instruments in particular that aide in the movement of the dance and tranquil feel of Bharata Natyam. While several singers sing songs for the dance that has been set, a rather small orchestra located behind the stage or to the side plays the Veena, flute, Sitar and Violin. Other instruments can be heard, but the ones mentioned are most commonly used to create Raga through mridangam beats (Indian Maps, 1). “The pristine purity of Bharatanatyam should never be compromised. Luckily, this program was billed only as 'dance' and not as 'Bharatanatyam’ (Sundram, B M, quotes).” Copious elements comprise the dance itself, but there are three primary ones that connect to any and all of the other fundamentals of the Bharata Natyam. The Nritta refers to rhythmic motions, the Nritya relates to expression through posture, gesture and facial expressions and Natya, perhaps the most elusive, self explanatory element literally meaning drama element (Singha, 21) and (India Maps, 1). The footwork that is present is based upon Aduva’s 64 steps and the Hastramudas. There is a total of 9 Rasa’s, or emotions, that correlate with facial expressions. The six primary body movements used in the Bharata Natyam are never left out and remain the key foundations for the dance and theatrical performance. Shirobhedha is the head movement, Greevabheda is the movement of the neck, Drishtibhedha relates to the eyes, Paadabhedha means to move the feet, Gatibhedha is gait and Hasta Mudras is equivalent to the hand movements in the dance (Ohtani, 5.) While the key foundations give life and energy to the Bharata Natyam, the mystery lies within the story in the movement of the dancer’s and what the dancers perform. There are quite a few diverse segments and dances performed to express this air of spiritual connectedness through folk lore. A few specific forms of dance are; the Alarippu, this is a specific way in which the gods are invocated to join the performance, the Varnam is the center of the performance in which difficult hand and body movements tell a story that is lengthy and long concerning the idea of love and longing and the Thillana which is the epilogue of the performance concerning the music in relation to the complex footwork and dance (Balasaraswati,111). Other classical dance forms of the Bharata Natyam include; Ganapati Vandana, Jatiswaram, Shabdam, Padam and the Mangla Slokam (Balasarawati, 111-115). It is evident that within each dance achieved, a story of love or despair is told through the actor’s embodiment of Krishna and other gods. Spiritual enlightenment through both the actor and spectator is gained. However, the costumes and makeup used in Bharata Natyam are additionally significant to creating the Bharata’s aura of connectedness. An entire performance of Bharata Natyam can last anywhere from 2 and a half to 3 hours. Thus, makeup and costumes are created and integrated for this time frame and in accordance with the dances. The costumes are special fit two piece suits that are made from colorful silk and expose a little belly. Stone and gold jewelry are also worn; necklaces, long earrings, bracelets, jingling anklets, chutti (forehead jewelry), oddiyannam (waist jewelry) and chignon (long braid and jasmine strings worn in hair) (Raga, 1992) and (Theatres of Asia, 1986). Makeup wise, the eyes are lengthened with black paint and the lips are painted a full, deep red color. At times the women, or men, performing wear a heavy coat of white, cakey, powdery makeup, but not often (Indian Maps, 1). Costumes and makeup may appear flashy and unreasoned on stage, but in Bharata Natyam, every aspect, music, theatre and dance, all have specific and tender meanings. “Forget the dancer, the center of the ego. Become the dance. Then the dancer disappears and only the dance remains. Then the dancer is the dance. There is no dancer separate from dance, no dance separate from the dancer (Ranjneesh, Acharya Quotes, )." Feminine power and grace are shown through women shaking their tail feathers, the words of Sanskrit are given beautiful life through dance and Bharata Natyam is important for now and generations to come given that three elusive forms of art are combined together to give South India’s cultural heritage true life, true destiny, true meaning to India’s world, our and everyone’s world! The utilization of dance, theatre and music creates not only a spectacular performance and stage show, but helps any and all old or new viewers connect to a new realm of heritage, culture and beauty in the universe…the elements that bring people closer together through art, enjoyment and entertainment. Bharata Natyam may be only just an ancient South Indian art form, but when one looks beneath the surface of any cultural embodiment of soul, universe, folk lore and so much more, one’s self is freshly re-enlightened, after all, isn’t that what the Bharata Natyam is all about? Finding peace and tranquility, comfort even, through the combination of music, dance and theatre while enjoying a theatrical journey.</p>
