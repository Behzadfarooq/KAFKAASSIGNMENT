<dd>Hey Andrzej. Go ahead and add it to the article. I suggest to add it to the list of problems and create a new paragraph for it. It is still an issue, the abuse I mean, otherwise would there no need to talk about it, wouldn't there?&#160;:) I will do what I can with making it clean and wikified. See the other parts of the article regarding references and citations. If you make a claim about a number, tendency, event etc., you must cite the source that readers can verify its accuracy.

<dd>I would not even consider this a "B" article. It is full of opinion, conclusions, POV, colloquial language, bizarre structure, a huge opening quote from a biased source (the book quote), is a regular target for insertion of spam links (which often do not get reverted quickly), and as Grace notes above, is not very well sourced and cited. Frankly, I think it should be taken down to a stub and started over. Please see my comments above on 22 September 2006. There has been some cleanup since then, but it's still not nearly a GA. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 19:58, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><b>1. Well written?:</b> The article is, in general, poorly written. The structure is somewhat random and disorganized. The language is full of colloquial and informal writing, with a substantial amount of opinion and conclusions.</dd>
<dd><b>2. Factually accurate?:</b> Fair to reasonable, but hampered by lack of thorough sourcing and and citations.</dd>
<dd><b>3. Broad in coverage?:</b> Acceptable.</dd>
<dd><b>4. Neutral point of view?:</b> Fair to poor. Full of opinions, POV, unsourced critique and/or approval of aspects of the subject.</dd>
<dd><b>5. Article stability?</b> Not stable. Subject to a number of major edits, and a constant target for addition of spam links and references containing <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflicts of interest</a>.</dd>

<p>(Note: while I have been a Talk page participant, I have made only 7 edits to the article, of which 5 were reversion of spam, and 2 were with respect to cleanup templates.

<dd><b>4. Neutral point of view?:</b> Fair to poor. Full of opinions, POV, unsourced critique and/or approval of aspects of the subject.</dd>
<dd>There are a lot of problems in affiliate marketing that are often avoided to discuss openly. There are only rare occasions where those things are being spelled out by A-list members of the industry. You will be able to determine this if you do a bit background research. please point me to any "unsourced critique and/or approval of aspects of the subject".

<p>Thanks for the reply. First, I want to make sure to mention that I think your contributions have in general been positive, and what I mentioned about <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> is not directed toward you, but to editors who constantly insert links to programs they are affiliated with, or give their programs as so-called "examples" of various affiliate marketing features. Ideally the article would not be edited by anyone with a financial interest in affilate marketing but that might be too much to ask.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi MCB, thanks for the kind words. The financial interest thing is a problem, especially because of the high visibility of Wikipedia in the search engine results. If you have a look, you will see, that I was/am a strong supported of the nofollow attribute for all external links. This helps to reduce the spam of not so well watched articles (and areas) or Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It will not help very much with the highly visible and often accessed articles though, since the direct referrer traffic is probably enough of a goal here. Fortunately are those highly visible articles also much better watched my numerous editors and also by the RC-Patrollers of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_bdee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spam</a> and don't last very long. Some links are also not really spam and well intended, but just not appropriate. In those cases are the talk pages the place to debate about the usefulness of an external source and to weigh the pro's and con's. That you end up linking to "commercial sites" in a broader sense can not be avoided for all topics.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The nature of some topics simply require to link to those sites, because it is the nature of the beast. But if you look a bit closer, you will find out that those authority sites that are monetizing traffic give also a lot back to the community without getting paid for it. Keep in mind that time is money and good resources take time to create. The monetary reward is not always high and well below minimum wage pay, but the intention of the resources provider is not always profit and money. Commercial or not, people are behind such things and people are not exclusively interested in instant and quick riches. Living and working in a positive environment is a desire for most people too. To maintain such an environment requires maintenance work without monetary rewards. A lot of people take that for granted and do not contribute, but there will always be the ones that do care and don't stop doing it, because others are too lazy or selfish to do their part.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is how I see it. I am a strong believer in the thesis that what you do and not do will come back one day and either hurt you (the didn't do) or help you in often unexpected and surprising ways (did do). I don't keep a balance sheet where I calculate how much I did for somebody or something and how much I got out of it in the short term. If it feels right, I will do it, with or without immediate incentive. Doing something good, feels good, so I get a very powerful incentive right away. I also believe that that my positive doing will result in positive things that come back to me. Personal experience showed me, that this that comes back, often comes back with "interest". Thus it works like a bank (piggy bank&#160;:) ). You think you put X.xx into the bank to find out that it is actually more when you break it (thanks to your parents that sneak in some bonuses without your knowledge hehe).</dd>

<p>To take the GA issues in order:</p>
<p>1. <b>Quality of writing</b>. Compared to GAs and FAs, the writing seems poorly organized, and is not encylopedic in tone. The ordering of sections seems random. The tone seems to be more that of a "expert" giving personal explanations and hints, in a narrative, about various features in the field, rather than a comprehensive, neutral examination. Just compare the prose, grammar, structure, style, etc., to a number of GAs and FAs (or other encyclopedias or published books) and I'm sure you will see the difference.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see. I am a blogger so I tend to write in a narrative tone. I am trying to avoid that at Wikipedia, but fail to do it properly at times. Working on that. This is also the part where I need the most help with for the mentioned reasons.--<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 12:09, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I moved thing around a bit and added additional headlines and additional levels in the paragraph hierarchy. One step at a time&#160;:) --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 13:04, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. <b>Factual accuracy</b>. This is hard to assess, because of the extreme lack of sourcing. Most sections are totally unreferenced, and the existing references are to sources that would not be considered <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> -- that is, they are either self-interested, or lack sufficient editorial control to be accepted as reliable. Just to take the sections in order:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I actually disagree on this one. You consider MarketingSherpa "borderline source", which is funny, because it is really one of the best sources to the subject out there. The proof for that can be found in a lot of places. Starting with the number of contributing entities to the benchmark guides, ending with the number of subscribers to the MarketingSherpa Newsletters, which is used for surveys and readers choice awards. It clearly shows the relevance and acceptance by the industry as accurate and reliable source.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also cited more than once is ReveNews, which was winning the MarketingSherpa Readers Choice awards for Best Blog to affiliate marketing.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/sample.cfm?ident=28308" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/sample.cfm?ident=28308" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Take that, plus look at the contributor to ReveNews and their position and reputation in the industry and you have yourself a pretty good source. It is impossible to provide a much more general source as reference to all information provided by the article. Once you get specific, you need sources that are authorities to the subject and not mainstream media. Mainstream media does not report details about a subject and that is fine, because it is not the purpose of mainstream media to do so. The same is true for the big statistical data collectors like compScore, Nielson etc. Numbers from these sources are used and published by the more specific sources. The detailed break down and complimentary data are then gathered by the more specialized statistical information gatherer. In the case of Affiliate marketing are those more specific collectors: MarketingSherpa/MarketingExperiments.com for the U.S. and e-Consultancy for the UK. I have no problem if you challenge each individual source one by one. We can go and establish the authority of each source one at a time and even provide a ranking on a sliding scale (from "not reliable" to "very reliable"). --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 12:09, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<b>Top</b>: No refs in first few paragraphs; two legitimate refs to Internet stats; one ref to a borderline source (MarketingSherpa). It starts with a brief definition what Affiliate marketing is. Since this is an encyclopedia, is the only possible reference here another encyclopedia (which would question the authority of Wikipedia as reference). The Other Sources are e-Consultancy and MarketingSherpa. The sources are not free accessible, because there are companies that live from collecting and providing those information for money. I own the full content of each of the cited sources (and was also the one that added the references to the article. the statements were added by somebody else). The e-Consultancy sources, especially the Internet Statistics Compendium 2007 is a large collection of internet marketing related statistics, surveys, studies and benchmarks from numerous sources, which include: eMarketer.com, Nielson/NetRatings, Forrester Research, compScore, Jupiter Research, MarketingSherpa, American Technology Research; Piper Jaffray &amp; Co.; Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown; Veronis Suhler Stevenson; J.P. Morgan; Merrill Lynch; SG Cowen; Smith Barney; Myers Report; The Kelsey Group; GartnerG2; PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC); TNS Media Intelligence and Universal McCann. It also contains numbers collected by e-Consultancy. It always references in detail to the source of the data. You can consider it a reference of references for internet statistics (the $269.00 annual subscription provides access to the report and all other e-Consultancy publications. It's a bargain compared to MarketingSherpa (who offers now a Membership that provides access to over 1,900 emarkting stats and over 700 case studies)). --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 12:10, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Same as with first paragraph, what reference do you want to add? The paragraph explains and also uses specific examples as illustration. The examples are referencing to articles at Wikipedia that are explaining specifics and have references to facts where needed.

<dd>I can provide references that list some of the types, but there is no "source" for this exact list. The types of affiliate sites is not a "fix" definition, but a classification that changes frequently as new business models are being developed by creative affiliates. The classification might be done different by different entities. Affiliate Netwoks might classify different than individual Advertisers/Merchants. This includes the combination of multiple typpes listed in the article as one type. The List must be considered a "guideline" to get an idea about the type of affilates out there. You might want to help to make that clear. Is there a template or similar that can be used to indicate this? --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 12:09, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>A Brief History of Affiliate Marketing</b>: Inappropriately long quote, from a self-interested (non-neutral) source.</p>
<dl>
<dd>self-interested? I remember that there used to be a free written (not cited) version from other editors that said the same thing and that I replaced it with the current citation. What is my interest in somebody elses book? I think you got something wrong in this case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About the content of the citation. The problem is that nobody has absolute proof for the story. I can try to dig up some old press releases that mention the launches of the associate program by amazon 1996 and cdnow's buyweb program 1994, if that is what you prefer. The mentioned source "Brad Waller" and the author of the cited source in the article "Shawn Collins" are well respected veterans in the industry. If you want to question their authority, be my guest and I can dig you up tons of references to those guys, that make clear that they can be compared to Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman for the open source and linux community.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Book itself (Successful Affiliate Marketing for Merchants) is over 6!!! years old <a href="http://www.revenews.com/archives/00000061.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.revenews.com/archives/00000061.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (it was written at the end of 2000 <a href="http://www.costpernews.com/2006/12/27/open-sourcing-affiliate-marketing/#comment-618" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.costpernews.com/2006/12/27/open-sourcing-affiliate-marketing/#comment-618" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) and is to this day considered "must read" material for new Affiliate Managers. There are actually not much quality publications to that subject to that day. The new book "A practical guide to affiliate marketing" by Evgenii "Geno" Prussakov <a href="http://www.affiliatemanagerbook.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.affiliatemanagerbook.com/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> is pretty decent and the collaborative work "Affiliate Manager 1st Edition" <a href="http://www.amclassroom.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amclassroom.com/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (which I do not own personally, but I trust the reviews of several of my collegues who do own it). Geno says the same thing about the origin of Affiliate marketing, but I am sure that he took that part from Shawn's book. It's a guide and no scientific book, so he does not cite sources and writes in a narative way and his own personal experiences.</p>
<dl>
<dd>possible alternative. Simple mention that Amazon.com started their Associate Program 1996 and CDNow their BuyWeb program in 1994. Then try to find sources that mention the launch with date. This is important, because a lot of people believe that Amazon.com were the first, which is not true. Yeah, theirs is one of the very first when affiliate marketing as a word did not even exist, they have undoubtly also one of the biggest to this date.

Better wording might be: Advertisers acknowledge the advantages of the "pay per performance model" of affiliate marketing, which is less prone to fraud as Pay per click or Pay per Impression, than paying publishers only for actual and wanted results, such as a purchase or subscription. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 12:09, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"However, unlike display advertising, affiliate marketing is not easily scalable."</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know what your problem with this statement is. Are you familar with how display advertising works and how affiliate relationships are established? A little comparison. If you are the owner of a nation wide liquer store chain who sells and advertises various different types of beer, including regional and domestic big brands, display advertising would be working with distributors and affiliate marketing would be like working with each brewery individually&#160;:). --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 12:09, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"This is not considered affiliate marketing."</p>
<dl>
<dd>The claim is made that it is, but for this reason do terms such as MLM, Pyramid Schemes and Ponzi Schemes exist, to distinguish between the different types of multi-tier/level marketing/sales. The sentences before that statement say the same thing, but for the quick reader who only scans the article was this made clear in a short sentence (trust me, the thought of MLM pops into peoples mind when you start to explain to them 2-tier affiliate marketing. This is based on practical experience by numerous people, including myself. It is IMO important to highlight this fact, but suggestions to improve on how to bring that message 100% clear across are welcome. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 12:09, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Even though Quixtar compensation plan is network marketing &amp; wouldn't be considered 'affiliate marketing',..."</p>
<dl>
<dd>see comments to "This is not considered affiliate marketing.". People like to use Amway (and Tupperware) as examples to explain to normal people what affiliate marketing is. This is something more people know about. It's okay to use those as initial reference to communicate the fundamental idea, but at the same time is it important to make clear, that the similarity ends at the 2nd tier (tupperware, seller 1, seller 2 = affiliate marketing, after seller 2 (seller 3 etc.) &lt;&gt; affiliate marketing) --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 12:09, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The new media allowed merchants to get closer to their affiliates and improved communication between each other."</p>
<dl>
<dd>New media, meaning social media. It improved communication and also helped merchants and affiliates to work closer and coordinated (in conjunction) with each other (e.g. unified marketing message). That is what it means. How would you phrase that? --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 12:09, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"New developments have made it harder for unscrupulous affiliates to make money."</p>

<dd>This is out of context. It refers to the openess and faster communication channels that blogs, rss and other new media technologies provided.

<p>"Successful affiliate programs require a lot of maintenance and work. "</p>
<dl>
<dd>this is a fact and is meant to make absolute clear to the reader, that an affiliate program is not something to "set it and forget it". This might have been the case years ago, but the matured industry and increased competition made this misconception a thing of the past. Whoever tries to sell a merchant something else should be looked at once more and up close, because that person is most likely on a hidden agenda, which is good for him, but bad for the merchant that considers affiliate marketing as an additional marketing channel. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 12:09, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was bemused by the material on CPA (which, at the time I read the article, was not defined, or even linked, where it appears in the article).</p>
<p>CPA, as far as I see it, <i>is</i> modern affiliate marketing. The old-fashioned "cost per click" models are flawed in the way they create a market for clicks, when a supplier wants a market for products and solid leads. However, more appropriate terms are Cost Per Sale and Cost Per Subscription, which differentiates between these two different results for the supplier of the product or service. <a href="../../../e/l/r/User%7EElroch_ff10.html" title="User:Elroch">Elroch</a> 20:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Joekucker, please elaborate your suggestion and what you beieve is essential to affiliate marketing and missing in the article. I am one of the active editors on the article and can only speak for myself. I am involved with affiliate marketing since early 2001 as affiliate and was also once an affiliate manager for a merchant. I was sitting on both sides of the "fence" and believe of myself that I have a decent understanding of affiliate marketing (among other internet marketing subjects). Your comment is very generic without any specifics, which does not provide much to go on and respond to. I am looking forward to your comments. Thanks for your time.

<dd>Elroch, CPA was (and is) mentioned multiple times. It's even briefly explained in the article itself. The link to the (by now) more detailed article about CPA is an oversight by everybody, but especially the editors of the CPA article who did not update existing articles (older articles) that mentioned CPA. That is corrected now, at least for the Affiliate marketing article, which is also linked to from the CPA article now. I also took the liberty to extend the CPA article regarding the alternative meaning of CPA, which was used prior to "Cost Per Action" and is still in use today, "Cost per Acquisition".</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Cost Per Click used to be popular before the dot.com crash 7 years ago. It was almost fading away to nothing over the years because of fraud issues. The "new" click fraud challenges search engines face today are old and known stories for affiliate marketers, its like a deja vu with the difference that in the past individual advertisers or small affiliate networks were challenged compared to the search engine behemoths today who have much more resources available to combat click fraud.</dd>

<dd>CPS and CPA are the way to go, but if you tell that an affiliate marketer then you are preaching to the choir and you should not be surprised to get also as response "see, I told you so, x years ago". --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 08:41, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
