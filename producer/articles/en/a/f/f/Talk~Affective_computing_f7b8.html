<p>I have only recently stumbled upon the arena labelled as 'Affective Computing'. As a social scientist the term 'Affect' has a specific set of meanings denoted by a particular philosophical literature. It seems to me that what is presented in this article presupposes a conflation of 'affect' with 'emotion', which is rather contentious. What I have included below is some of my own grappling with the idea of 'affect', edited from a Masters degree dissertation [Kinsley S (2006) 'An End of Cyberspace? Metaphor, Affect &amp; Socio-technical relations' unpublished: University of Bristol] in the hope that it offers some sort of inroad into reflecting on how or why one might use affect. I would certainly encourage all those taking 'Affective Computing' forward to consider the literature I touch upon. Furthermore, given these points, should those interested in such an arena of research consider alternative titles such as: 'Emotive Computing' or 'Preceptive Computing'? -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamkinsley_4102.html" title="User:Samkinsley">Sam Kinsley</a> 6th Novembe 2006 12:05 GMT</p>
<hr />
<p>A gamut of understandings of affect can be traced across various disciplines, from social psychology and studies of cognition to continental philosophy (for a review see Thrift, 2004). The implicit danger to be recognised in any discussion of affect is a confusion or simplification to ideas of emotion, a criticism that might be levelled here. Prominent amongst theorisations of affect is the work of philosopher Gilles Deleuze who develops the ideas of Baruch de Spinoza (see: Deleuze, 1988).</p>
<p>To productively follow this line of conceptualisation, we should commence from an understanding of experience as trans-subjective, in which, according to Deleuze &amp; Guattari (1988: 180), ‘there is no longer a self’ and bodies vacillate like ‘a glowing fog [...] that has affects and experiences ovements and speeds’ (Ibid.). We can therefore understand affect as a pre-cognitive and impersonal capacity. Experience, according to (Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1994), can be understood in terms of ‘affects’, the pre-cognitive and perhaps involuntary recoil from a strong odour or the leap of the heart when faced with an attractive man or woman, and ‘percepts’, the odour itself or the appearance of the body. Affect, Thrift (2004: 60) suggests, can thus be understood ‘...as a form of thinking, often indirect and non-reflective, it is true, but thinking all the same’. Further:</p>
<p>‘...if you define bodies and thoughts as capacities for affecting and being affected, many things change. You will define an animal, or a human being not by its form, its organs, and its functions, and not as a subject either; you will define it by the affects of which it is capable’ (Deleuze, 1988: 124).</p>
<p>Do we need ‘affect’ to conceptualise our experience of the world? Indubitably, given that, to paraphrase Hamlet, there are more things in this world than can be understood, represented or conceived of consciously. Our relations are often motivated pre-cognitively and affect, therefore, provides a means of theoretically articulating such motivations.</p>

<dd>Sam, this article conflates affect and emotion in a way that the academic study of affective computing does not. Affective computing is concerned with human response in the Deleuze &amp; Guattari sense you mention above rather than with emotion as the article seems to indicate, but it is a common simplification for introductory lectures or popular articles on the subject. If you can improve this article to make the difference clear in a way that won't confuse those who are new to the concepts, that would be great! --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 13:28, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Siobhan, thank you for your quick response! I am not sure I am the best person to edit this page. The above quick discussion is a rather hackneyed version of a section of my own Masters dissertation and certainly to brief to address the broader discussion that would be necessary of Affect given the application to computing. Whilst this is a fascinating concept, and one that is close to my research interest, I am still a little confused by calling the arena of study 'affective computing'. Firstly, it seems to me that there is a wider conflation of 'affect' and 'emotion' outside of this article, for example: 'Affective Computing is computing that relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences emotions.' <a href="http://affect.media.mit.edu/" class="external text" title="http://affect.media.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow">MIT Media Lab Affective Computing Group</a>. Beyond this, a Deleuzian reading of affect might sugest that you cannot empirically access affects in and of themselves, only the resultant perceptual cognition(s), examples such as this are why I suggested a revised title. I would be very interested to hear from an 'Affective Computing' researcher on this. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamkinsley_4102.html" title="User:Samkinsley">Sam Kinsley</a> 6th November 2006 17:24 GMT</dd>

<dd>I didn't mean to imply that there is a direct equivalence between the use of affect in comp sci and affect in social science. Just that - though emotion is frequently used as though it were interchangeable with affect, affective computing looks at response in a broader sense than the definition of emotion that you are using here. It may be worth remembering that many fields have slightly different understandings of similar concepts because the desired outcomes from study and the presures within the fields are different. That doesn't mean it's not worth considering what other fields have to offfer, but to go from that to a suggestion that one field should change its name because it doesn't adhere to another field's definition of a term is a little parochial. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 18:04, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All very good points. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to suggest I was espousing a peculiar parochial one-up-manship, rather I am simply asking: Why use the term 'Affect' in this case? As I suggested in my first section above there are many disciplinary takes on 'Affect', I am confused as to how 'Affective Computing' needs 'Affect' rather than 'emotion', which would be equally as worthy a subject of study - just different. I hope that clarifies my concerns - I certainly do not want to claim a peculiar disciplinary authority or preclude any perspective from an interesting and reasonable discussion&#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamkinsley_4102.html" title="User:Samkinsley">Sam Kinsley</a> 7th November 2006 12:08 GMT</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I was being a little defensive. I disagree that affective computing is simply about emotion. While there is a lot emphasis placed on emotion as a describer of what people are trying to achieve, the reality is computers can't read emotions or hold them. They can read things like whether someone types faster, or squeezes a mouse harder, or uses more negative or more positive words. Computers can behave in one way rather than another - respond faster or slower to users, use different colors, words or graphics, or bring up different information. But beyond these types of indicators (and ways to manipulate them), affective computing also looks at things like motive (how do you understand what a user's motive is, or how do you give a computer motive). Although none of these things are simply about emotion (or perception), emotion is frequently used as a shorthand in this sort of situation.</dd>

<dd>I don't think I'm doing a good job of making a case for supporting the use of affect over emotion to you. Perhaps because I have less understanding of your own field and the language you use than I need. <a href="http://affect.unige.ch/" class="external text" title="http://affect.unige.ch/" rel="nofollow">The Swiss Center for Affective Sciences</a> describes what I consider to be affective computing's approach and places it within a broader academic constiuency. It might be useful to you in understanding how other branches of academia are conceptualizing this aspect of human behavior. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 17:11, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
