<p>I don't have the time right now, but at least the first section of this needs to be changed. For example:</p>
<p><i>"The torsion of a connection is a smooth vector field."</i></p>
<p>This is wrong. The torsion of a connection is a rank (1, 2) tensor.</p>
<p><i>"...whilst keeping the inner product of that vector constant along the curve."</i></p>
<p>The 'inner product of a vector' doesn't make sense.</p>
<p><i>"The resulting connection coefficients are called Christoffel symbols and can be calculated directly from the metric. For this reason, this type of connection is often called a metric connection."</i></p>
<p>This is a bit misleading. A metric connection is one for which the inner product of any two vectors in unchanged when those vectors are parallel transported together.</p>

<p>In fact, the whole first section needs re-writing. There is incorrect information, as above, but also no informal discussion which would help beginners to come to grips with the subject. I'm sticking a `needs help' template on here in the meantime. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShambolic_Entity_9bca.html" title="User:Shambolic Entity">Shambolic Entity</a> 04:14, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would be a good idea, because this page is filled with garbage such as the idea that an affine connection is the covariant derivative, rather than it being possible to define them in terms of each other. The covariant derivative combines two different ways a function changes from point-to-point -- the normal coordinate derivative, and how the manifold "changes under the function". The last bit is the connection. The confusion probably comes about because applying the covariant derivative to an ostensibly constant function (such as basis vectors) will leave only the last term, the connection. Differential geometry is hard enough without conflating two concepts and lying to people about it. 68.35.106.186 18:00, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, the terminology in this subject is very confused because of its historical origins. For some, the covariant derivative is only defined on vector and tensor fields, for others, it is defined on sections of any vector bundle. A Covariant derivative is sometimes called a linear connection. Other times, linear connections refer to linear Ehresmann connections, or to the affine connections of this article. An affine connection is equivalent to a covariant derivatives on the tangent bundle, but they are not really the same thing. I do not support merging this article, but rewriting it to highlight the distinction. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeometry_guy_a9f1.html" title="User:Geometry guy">Geometry guy</a> 17:20, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Once upon a time, this article had a purpose. If you look back through the history, you will find the following version of 5 July 2006.:</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&amp;oldid=62203358" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&amp;oldid=62203358" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&amp;oldid=62203358</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The outline for the article is clear: introduce affine connections via parallel transport and as Cartan connections for the affine group, and explain how this relates to the (more familiar) approach via linear connections (or covariant derivatives) on the tangent bundle. Such an article provides an excellent opportunity to explain, in true encyclopaedic spirit, why on earth a covariant derivative on the tangent bundle is called an affine connection. Unfortunately, the editor with this plan, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Silly_rabbit_1f29.html" title="Special:Contributions/Silly rabbit">Silly rabbit</a> apparently left WP without completing a first draft. Subsequently, perhaps not surprisingly, the more familiar linear description of affine connections has come to dominate the article, leading to a large overlap with other articles on linear connections and covariant derivatives. The article is in much better shape now, with properly fleshed out definitions, and even an example, but it has lost its sense of direction in my opinion.</p>
<p>I believe this can be fixed quite easily by reordering the material, and relating principal and Cartan connections on the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frame_bundle.html" title="Frame bundle">frame bundle</a> using the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solder_form.html" title="Solder form">solder form</a>. I will probably start to work this out soon. Any comments? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeometry_guy_a9f1.html" title="User:Geometry guy">Geometry guy</a> 17:47, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've done the (substantial!) ground work for this now. I think we should aim quite high with this article: it is potentially one of the more fundamental articles in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Category%7EConnection_%28mathematics%29_b0ae.html" title="Category:Connection (mathematics)">Category: Connection (mathematics)</a> — a Cartan/geometrical alternative to the more Ricci/tensorial <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covariant_derivative.html" title="Covariant derivative">covariant derivative</a> article — and I'd be very happy if we could get it to GA status. Let me know if you are watching and/or interested in this project. My next mission is to get the Cartan part into shape, and use this as a springboard to sort out (finally) the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartan_connection.html" title="Cartan connection">Cartan connection</a> article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeometry_guy_a9f1.html" title="User:Geometry guy">Geometry guy</a> 21:38, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, I've now done the hard bit now, at least in outline (there is rather too much reliance on other articles in my approach). In general, I've tried very hard to be explanatory and comprehensive enough so that other editors can make this material more accessible (although a very general reader will rarely happen upon this article, so I would not like the mathematical content to be too diluted). I still have to rewrite the section on torsion and curvature (and geodesics) in terms of the various definitions. Then I will move onto <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartan_connection.html" title="Cartan connection">Cartan connection</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeometry_guy_a9f1.html" title="User:Geometry guy">Geometry guy</a> 22:30, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I think you've done a great job with a difficult subject. This is looking pretty good now. Somehow it seems a shame though that the modern definition of an affine connection as a Cartan connection is buried so deep in the article. I suppose this is unavoidable with all the motivation and history one has to get through.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps it would be useful to summarize somewhere the various ways in which an affine connection can be defined (as a linear connection, a principal connection, or a Cartan connection) and the relationship between them. The article doesn't quite make it to the point of explaining exactly how an affine connection in the sense of Cartan is equivalent to specifying a principal connection on the frame bundle.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also it seems a little strange to me to refer to the pair (<i>P</i>, η) as an affine connection. I tend to think of η as the connection and the pair (<i>P</i>, η) as an <i>affine geometry</i> on <i>M</i>. Not really a big deal of course, it just reads a little funny (to me at least).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, nice work. This should give us a great launching point for the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartan_connection.html" title="Cartan connection">Cartan connection</a> article. -- <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFropuff_31b9.html" title="User:Fropuff">Fropuff</a> 05:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for these helpful comments. I agree that it is a shame the modern definition comes so late: originally I wanted to put the covariant derivative definition at the end, but I just couldn't figure out how to make the article work like that. I now see this article as having an educational flavour (hopefully in encyclopaedic rather than textbook spirit) to introduce readers who might already be familiar with covariant derivatives into the development of the notion and the rich world of Cartan geometry. We have another chance in the Cartan connection article to cut more quickly to the chase, and perhaps the existence of this article will help us to do that, as you suggest.</p>
<p>Your second idea resonates well with a thought that has been going through my mind from time to time: maybe we need an article like Connection (definitions) that summarizes all the definitions and the relations between them. It shouldn't be so hard to put together once everything else is sorted out (the main torment here for me is to rewrite <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connection_form.html" title="Connection form">Connection form</a> as a bridge between mathematics and gauge theory). Also, after all our hard work, I think a rewrite of the main article <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connection_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Connection (mathematics)">Connection (mathematics)</a> (or at least parts of it) is well overdue.</p>
<p>Your other suggestions are spot-on. I'll try to weave them into the article. If I don't succeed, hit that edit button! <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeometry_guy_a9f1.html" title="User:Geometry guy">Geometry guy</a> 15:00, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think we could probably incorporate the various definitions of connections and their relationships into <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connection_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Connection (mathematics)">connection (mathematics)</a> which is meant to be an overview of the subject. I agree that that article will be due for some work after the other connection pages are sorted out. -- <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFropuff_31b9.html" title="User:Fropuff">Fropuff</a> 17:54, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure about this: I suspect that such an article will be too technical and not sufficiently short to incorporate as a section in the main article, although the current last section of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connection_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Connection (mathematics)">Connection (mathematics)</a> could certainly be adapted to provide an overview. (Meanwhile, I've discovered that the whole concept of <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curvature.html" title="Curvature">curvature</a> is also in a rather parlous state right now, sigh!) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeometry_guy_a9f1.html" title="User:Geometry guy">Geometry guy</a> 19:29, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
