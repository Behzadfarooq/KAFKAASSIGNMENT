	    <p><i>From an old 1911 Encyclopedia. Needs to be edited, updated and merged with the main <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affidavit.html" title="Affidavit">Affidavit</a> article.</i></p>
<p><b>Affidavit</b> (Med. Lat. for <i>he has declared upon oath,</i> from affidare, fides, faith), a written statement sworn or affirmed to before some person who has authority to administer an oath or affirmation. Evidence is chiefly taken by means of affidavits in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> on a petition, summons or motion. Interlocutory proceedings before trial are conducted by affidavits, e.g. for discovery of documents, hence called affidavit of documents. Affidavits are sometimes necessary as certificates that certain formalities have been duly and legally performed (such as service of proceedings, &amp;c.). They are extensively used in bankruptcy practice, in the administration of the revenue and in the inferior and county courts. In testamentary causes, all documents of any kind, such as wills, codicils, drafts or instructions of same must be filed in the form of affidavits (termed affidavits of scripts.) In <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> the testimony of witnesses by affidavit is almost unknown, except in a few non-contentious cases as prima facie evidence. In the rules of the Supreme Court (R.S.C. Ord. Xxxviii.) certain formal requirements are laid down for all affidavits and affirmations in causes or matters depending in the High Court. An affidavit must consist of title, body or statement and jurat. It must be written or printed on foolscap, bookwise, in the first person; give correctly the names of the parties to the action; and the description and true place of abode of the deponent. An affidavit is confined, except on interlocutory motions, to such facts as the witness is able of his own knowledge to prove. The signature of the deponent must be written opposite to the jurat, which must contain the place, date and time of swearing, and this signed by the officer or magistrate before whom the affidavit is sworn. An affidavit sworn on a Sunday is not invalid. Quakers, Moravians and Separatists were first privileged to make a solemn declaration or affirmation, and by the Common Law Procedure Act <a href="../../../1/8/5/1852.html" title="1852">1852</a> and other statutes all persons prevented by religious belief from taking an oath were allowed to affirm; and, finally, by the Oaths Act <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>, every person who objects to be sworn is allowed to affirm in all places and for all purposes where an oath is required by law. By an act of <a href="../../../1/8/3/1835.html" title="1835">1835</a> justices are permitted to take affidavits in any matter by declaration, and a person making a false affidavit in this way is liable to punishment. The same act prohibited justices of peace from administering oaths in any matter in which they had not jurisdiction as judges, except when an oath was specially authorized by statute, as in the bankruptcy law, and excepting criminal inquiries, parliamentary proceedings and instances where oaths are required to give validity to documents abroad. Scottish justices can act in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and vice versa. The Oaths Act <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a> and the Commissioner of Oaths Act <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a> consolidated all previous enactments relating to oaths and gave the lord chancellor power to appoint commissioners for oaths to take affidavits for all purposes (see <a href="../../../o/a/t/Oath.html" title="Oath">Oath</a>.) Under the Debtors Act <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a> a plaintiff may file an affidavit for the arrest of a debtor (affidavit to hold to bail) when the debt amounts to L. 50 or upwards, where it can be shown that the debtor's absence from the kingdom would materially prejudice the prosecution of the action.</p>
<p>Affidavits may be made abroad before any <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> ambassador, envoy, minister, charge d'affaires, secretary of embassy or legation, consul or consular agent.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> affidavit has the same meaning as in England and its general uses are the same, but it is not substituted for oral evidence in court to anything like the extent to which that is done in the English courts of chancery. The statutes of each state designate the persons before whom affidavits may be made outside the state, and special commissioners are appointed for that purpose by each state. Affidavits made abroad must be made before such commissioners or persons so designated, who are usually diplomatic and consular officials, justices, notaries public or mayors. <i>Affidavit of documents</i> is not generally used in the United States; discovery is procured by motion.</p>
<p><br />
The use of the above article in relation to how affidavits are used in the courts of England and Wales would be highly misleading. I propose that it is not incorporated into the article. Although the way in which affidavits are sworn is correct, the use described is almost redundant since the implementation of the Civil Procedure Rules in 1998. There are still a limited number of applications where an affidavit must be used. These include applications for freezing injunctions and search orders and before the introduction of the CPR they were used for placing evidence before the court in final matters, especially in the chancery court, but this function has largely been replaced by the use of witness statements. A witness statement is very similar except it is not a sworn statement and does not need to be attested to by a commissioner of oaths. The witness simply signs a statement of truth at the end of the witness statement. It is the usual practice of the civil courts in England and Wales for the witness statement to stand as evidence-in-chief and only calling live witnesses for cross-examination.</p>
