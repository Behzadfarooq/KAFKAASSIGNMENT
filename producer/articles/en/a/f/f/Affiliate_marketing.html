<p>Some advertisers offer multi-tier programs that distribute commission into a hierarchical referral network of sign-ups and sub-partners. In practical terms: publisher "A" signs up to the program with an advertiser and gets rewarded for the agreed activity conducted by a referred visitor. If publisher "A" attracts other publishers ("B", "C", etc.) to sign up for the same program using her sign-up code all future activities by the joining publishers "B" and "C" will result in additional, lower commission for publisher "A".</p>
<p>Snowballing, this system rewards a chain of hierarchical publishers who may or may not know of each others' existence, yet generate income for the higher level signup. This sort of structure has been successfully implemented by a company called <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quixtar.com.html" title="Quixtar.com">Quixtar.com</a>, a division of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alticor.html" title="Alticor">Alticor</a>, the parent company of <a href="../../../a/m/w/Amway.html" title="Amway">Amway</a>. Quixtar has implemented a <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_marketing.html" title="Network marketing">network marketing</a> structure to implement its marketing program for major corporations such as <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnes_%26_Noble_cca7.html" title="Barnes &amp; Noble">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_Depot_1d41.html" title="Office Depot">Office Depot</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_Music_0848.html" title="Sony Music">Sony Music</a> and hundreds more.</p>
<p>This is not considered affiliate marketing. Two-tier programs exist in the minority of affiliate programs; most are simply one-tier. Programs beyond 2-tier are not considered affiliate programs, but rather <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multi-level_marketing.html" title="Multi-level marketing">Multi-level marketing</a> (MLM) or network marketing.</p>
<p>Even though Quixtar compensation plan is network marketing &amp; wouldn't be considered 'affiliate marketing', the big company partners are considered and call themselves affiliates. Therefore, you may argue that the Quixtar company is the affiliate marketer for its partner corporation.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate_marketing.html" title="Edit section: Compensation Models / Affiliate Commission">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Compensation Models / Affiliate Commission</span></h2>
<p>The following compensation models are relevant for affiliate marketing.<sup id="_ref-CompModel_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CompModel" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Pay-per-impression (PPI) / Cost-per-thousand (CPM)</b></p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost_Per_Impression_b756.html" title="Cost Per Impression">Cost-per-mil</a> (mil/mille/M = latin/<a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_numeral.html" title="Roman numeral">Roman numeral</a> for thousand) impressions. Publisher gets from <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertiser.html" title="Advertiser">Advertiser</a> $x.xx amount of money for every 1000 impressions (page views/displays) of the Ad. The <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad.html" title="Ad">Ad</a> can be text (<a href="../../../a/d/s/AdSense_b734.html" title="AdSense">AdSense</a>), banner image or <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rich_media.html" title="Rich media">rich media</a>.</p>
<p><b>Pay-per-click (PPC) / Cost-per-click (CPC)</b></p>
<p><a href="../../../p/a/y/Pay_per_click.html" title="Pay per click">Cost-per-click</a>. Advertiser pays publisher $x.xx amount of money, every time a visitor (potential prospect) clicks on the advertiser's Ad. It is irrelevant (for the <a href="../../../p/a/y/Pay.html" title="Pay">compensation</a>) how often an Ad is displayed. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commission_%28remuneration%29.html" title="Commission (remuneration)">commission</a> is only due when the Ad is clicked. See also <a href="../../../c/l/i/Click_fraud.html" title="Click fraud">click fraud</a>.</p>
<p><b>Pay-per-lead (PPL) / Cost-per-action/acquisition (CPA) / Cost-per-lead CPL)</b></p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost_Per_Action_35a8.html" title="Cost Per Action">Cost-per-action</a> or Cost-per-acquisition (CPA), <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost_per_lead.html" title="Cost per lead">Cost-per-Lead</a> (CPL). Advertiser pays publisher $x.xx in commission for every visitor that was referred by the publisher to the advertiser (web site) and performs a desired action, such as filling out a form, creating an account or signing up for a newsletter. This compensation model is very popular with online services from <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_service_providers.html" title="Internet service providers">internet service providers</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/b/Category%7EMobile_phone_companies_of_the_United_States_f015.html" title="Category:Mobile phone companies of the United States">cell phone providers</a>, banks (<a href="../../../l/o/a/Loans.html" title="Loans">loans</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortgages.html" title="Mortgages">mortgages</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_cards.html" title="Credit cards">credit cards</a>) and <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subscription_business_model.html" title="Subscription business model">subscription services</a>. CPA is the second most used compensation model (19%) after CPS (81%). <sup id="_ref-affstat2007_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-affstat2007" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Pay-per-sale (PPS) / Cost-per-sale (CPS)</b></p>
<p>Cost-per-sale (CPS). Advertiser pays the publisher a percentage (%) of the order amount (sale) that was created by a customer who was referred by the publisher. This model is by far the most common compensation model (81%) <sup id="_ref-affstat2007_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-affstat2007" title="">[2]</a></sup> used by online retailers that have an affiliate program. This form of compensation is also referred to as <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenue_sharing.html" title="Revenue sharing">Revenue sharing</a>.</p>
<p><b>Pay-per-call (no abbreviation exists yet)</b></p>
<p>This is a new compensation model. No official abbreviation exist yet. Advertiser pays publisher a $x.xx commission for phone calls received from potential prospects as response to a specific publisher Ad. Recently developed call-tracking technology allows to create a bridge between online and offline advertising. Pay-per-call advertising is still new and in its infancy.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The use of CPM and CPC as compensation model in affiliate marketing is today only marginal. It used to be more common in the early days of affiliate marketing, but diminished over time due to <a href="../../../c/l/i/Click_fraud.html" title="Click fraud">Click fraud</a> issues that are very similar to the click fraud issues modern <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engines.html" title="Search engines">Search engines</a> are facing today.<a href="../../../c/o/n/Contextual_advertising.html" title="Contextual advertising">Contextual advertising</a>, such as <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_AdSense_05b6.html" title="Google AdSense">Google AdSense</a> are not considered in this statistic.

<p>This is a citation from the book "Successful Affiliate Marketing for Merchants" from Shawn Collins of AffiliateTip.com and <sup id="_ref-affhist_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-affhist" title="">[3]</a></sup> which describes how affiliate marketing on the internet came into being.</p>

<p>As the story goes, affiliate marketing all started at a cocktail party. Jeff Bezos, CEO and founder of <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> (www.amazon.com), was chatting with a party guest who wanted to sell books on her web site.<br /></p>
<p>This got Bezos thinking. Why not have the woman link her site to Amazon’s and receive a commission on the books that she sold? Soon after, Amazon introduced the "Amazon Associates Program". It was a simple idea. Amazon associates would place banner or text links on their site for individual books or link directly to the Amazon’s home page.<br /></p>
<p>When visitors clicked from the associate’s site through to Amazon.com and purchased a book, the associate received a commission. With that thought, Bezos created Amazon.com’s affiliate program in July 1996.<br /></p>
<p>But Amazon wasn’t the first company to initiate an affiliate program. According to Brad Waller, VP of affiliate and business development for EPage (www.epage.com), the affiliate program for EPage started in April 1996. As documented in “The CDNow Story: Rags to Riches on the Internet,” CDNow’s affiliate program predates Amazon’s by more than a year.<br /></p>
<p>In November 1994, almost a full year before Amazon.com even launched its web site, the venerable CDNow (www.cdnow.com) began its buyweb program. With its buyweb program, CDNow was the first to introduce the concept of an affiliate or associate program with its idea of click-through purchasing through independent, online storefronts.<br /></p>
<p>It worked like this.<br /></p>
<p>CDNow had the idea that music-oriented web sites could review or list albums on their pages that their visitors might be interested in purchasing and offer a link that would take the visitor directly to CDNow to purchase them. The idea for this remote purchasing originally arose as a result of conversations with a music publisher called Geffen Records (www.geffen.com) in the fall of 1994. The management at Geffen Records wanted to sell its artists’ CDs directly from its site but didn’t want to do it itself. Geffen Records asked CDNow if it could design a program where CDNow would do the fulfillment.<br /></p>
<p>Geffen Records realized that CDNow could link directly from the artist on its Web site to Geffen’s web site, bypassing the CDNow home page and going directly to an artist’s music page. By linking Geffen Records to CDNow, the affiliate marketing format was born.</p>

<p>Affiliate marketing has grown quickly since its inception. The <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_commerce.html" title="Electronic commerce">e-commerce</a> website, viewed as a marketing toy in the early days of the web, became an integrated part of the overall business plan and in some cases grew to a bigger business than the existing offline business. According to one report, total sales generated through affiliate networks in 2006 was £2.16 billion in the UK alone. The estimates were £1.35 billion in sales in 2005. <sup id="_ref-affguide_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-affguide" title="">[4]</a></sup> MarketingSherpa's research team roughly estimates affiliates worldwide will earn $6.5 billion in bounty and commissions in 2006. This includes retail, personal finance, gaming and gambling, travel, telecom, 'Net marketing' education offers, subscription sites, and other lead generation, but it does not include contextual ad networks such as Google AdSense. <sup id="_ref-MktSherpa2006_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MktSherpa2006" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Currently the most active sectors for affiliate marketing are the adult, gambling and retail sectors<sup id="_ref-inetstats07_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-inetstats07" title="">[6]</a></sup>. The three sectors expected to experience the greatest growth are the mobile phone, finance and travel sectors<sup id="_ref-inetstats07_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-inetstats07" title="">[6]</a></sup>. Hot on the heels of these are the entertainment (particularly gaming) and internet-related services (particularly broadband) sectors. Also several of the affiliate solution providers expect to see increased interest from B2B marketers and advertisers in using affiliate marketing as part of their mix<sup id="_ref-inetstats07_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-inetstats07" title="">[6]</a></sup>. Of course, this is constantly subject to change.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate_marketing.html" title="Edit section: Affiliate Marketing Pros and Cons">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Affiliate Marketing Pros and Cons</span></h3>
<p>Merchants like affiliate <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketing.html" title="Marketing">marketing</a> because in most cases, it is a "pay for performance model", meaning the merchant does not incur a marketing expense unless results are realized, excluding the initial setup and development of the program. Some businesses owe much of their growth and success to this marketing technique, one example being Amazon.com, especially small and midsize businesses. However, unlike display advertising, affiliate marketing is not easily scalable.</p>
<p><a name="Affiliate_Program_Implementation_Options" id="Affiliate_Program_Implementation_Options"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate_marketing.html" title="Edit section: Affiliate Program Implementation Options">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Affiliate Program Implementation Options</span></h3>
<p>Some merchants run their own affiliate programs (In House) while others use third party services provided by intermediaries to track traffic or sales that are referred from affiliates. (see <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outsourced_program_management.html" title="Outsourced program management">outsourced program management</a>) Merchants can choose from two different types of affiliate management solutions standalone software or hosted services typically called affiliate networks.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate_marketing.html" title="Edit section: Affiliate Management and Program Management Outsourcing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Affiliate Management and Program Management Outsourcing</span></h3>
<p>Successful affiliate programs require a lot of maintenance and work. The number of affiliate programs just a few years back was much smaller than it is today. Having an affiliate program that is successful is not as easy anymore. The days when programs could generate considerable <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenue.html" title="Revenue">revenue</a> for the merchant even if they were poorly or not at all managed ("auto-drive") is over.</p>
<p>Those uncontrolled programs were one of the reasons why some of the not so positive examples of <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate.html" title="Affiliate">affiliates</a> were able to do what they did (<a href="../../../s/p/a/Spamming.html" title="Spamming">spamming</a><sup id="_ref-WebMRadFM_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WebMRadFM" title="">[7]</a></sup>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trademark_infringement.html" title="Trademark infringement">trademark infringement</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_advertising.html" title="False advertising">false advertising</a>, "cookie cutting", <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typosquatting.html" title="Typosquatting">typosquatting</a><sup id="_ref-RNTypoSQ_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RNTypoSQ" title="">[8]</a></sup> etc.).</p>
<p>The increase of number of internet businesses in combination with the increased number of people that trust the current technology enough to do shopping and business online caused and still causes a further maturing of affiliate marketing. The <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opportunities.html" title="Opportunities">opportunities</a> to generate considerable amount of profit in combination with a much more crowded marketplace filled with about equal quality and sized competitors made it harder for merchants to get noticed, but at the same time the rewards if you get noticed much larger.</p>
<p><a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_marketing.html" title="Internet marketing">Internet advertising</a> industry became much more professional and online media is in some areas closing the gap to offline media, where advertising is highly professional and very competitive for a lot of years already. The requirements to be successful are much higher than they were in the past. Those requirements are becoming often too much of a burden for the merchant to do it successfully in-house.

<p>In the early days of affiliate marketing, there was very little control over what affiliates were doing, which was abused by a large number of affiliates. Affiliates used <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_advertising.html" title="False advertising">false advertisements</a>, forced clicks to get tracking cookies set on users' computers, and <a href="../../../a/d/w/Adware.html" title="Adware">adware</a>, which displays ads on computers.

<p>In its early days many <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">internet</a> users held negative opinions of affiliate marketing due to the tendency of affiliates to use <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spam_%28electronic%29.html" title="Spam (electronic)">spam</a> to promote the programs in which they were enrolled.<sup id="_ref-wiredshady_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wiredshady" title="">[10]</a></sup> As affiliate marketing has matured many affiliate merchants have refined their terms and conditions to prohibit affiliates from spamming.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate_marketing.html" title="Edit section: Search Engine Spam / Spamdexing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Search Engine Spam / Spamdexing</span></h3>
<p>There used to be much debate around the <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate.html" title="Affiliate">affiliate</a> practice of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spamdexing.html" title="Spamdexing">spamdexing</a> and many affiliates have converted from sending email spam to creating large volumes of autogenerated webpages, many-a-times, using product data-feeds provided by merchants. Each devoted to different niche keywords as a way of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_optimization.html" title="Search engine optimization">SEOing</a> their sites with the search engines. This is sometimes referred to as spamming the search engine results. Spam is the biggest threat to organic search engines whose goal is to provide quality search results for keywords or phrases entered by their users. <a href="../../../p/a/g/Page_rank.html" title="Page rank">Google's algorithm</a> update dubbed "<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Daddy_Google_dfcf.html" title="Big Daddy Google">BigDaddy</a>" in February 2006 which was the final stage of Google's major update dubbed "<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Daddy_Google_dfcf.html" title="Big Daddy Google">Jagger</a>" which started mid-summer 2005 specifically targeted this kind of spam with great success and enabled Google to remove a large amount of mostly computer generated duplicate content from its index.</p>
<p>Sites made up mostly of affiliate links are usually badly regarded as they do not offer quality content. In 2005 there were active changes made by Google whereby certain websites were labeled as "thin affiliates" and were either removed from the index, or taken from the first 2 pages of the results and moved deeper within the index. In order to avoid this categorization, webmasters who are affiliate marketers must create real value within their websites that distinguishes their work from the work of spammers or banner farms with nothing but links leading to the merchant sites.</p>
<p>Affiliate links work best in the context of the information contained within the website. For instance, if a website is about "How to publish a website", within the content an affiliate link leading to a merchant's ISP site would be appropriate. If a website is about Sports, then an affiliate link leading to a sporting goods site might work well within the content of the articles and information about sports. The idea is to publish quality information within the site, and to link "in context" to related merchant's sites.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate_marketing.html" title="Edit section: Adware">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Adware</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../a/d/w/Adware.html" title="Adware">Adware</a> is still an issue today, but affiliate marketers have taken steps to fight it. AdWare is not the same as <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spyware.html" title="Spyware">SpyWare</a> although both often use the same methods and technologies. Merchants usually had no clue what adware was, what it did and how it was damaging their brand. Affiliate marketers became aware of the issue much more quickly, especially because they noticed that adware often overwrites their tracking cookie and results in a decline of commissions. Affiliates who do not use adware became enraged by adware, which they felt was stealing hard earned commission from them. Adware usually has no valuable purpose or provides any useful content to the often unaware user that has the adware running on his computer. Affiliates discussed the issues in various <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_forum.html" title="Internet forum">affiliate forums</a> and started to get organized. It became obvious that the best way to cut off adware was by discouraging merchants from advertising via adware. Merchants that did not care or even supported adware were made public by affiliates, which damaged the merchants' reputations and also hurt the merchants' general affiliate marketing efforts. Many affiliates simply "canned" the merchant or switched to a competitor's affiliate program. Eventually, <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate_Networks_8d5a.html" title="Affiliate Networks">affiliate networks</a> were also forced by merchants and affiliates to take a stand and ban adware publishers from their network.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate_marketing.html" title="Edit section: Trademark Bidding / PPC">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trademark Bidding / PPC</span></h3>
<p>Affiliates were among the earliest adopters of Pay-per-click advertising when the first PPC search engines like goto.com (which became later Overture.com, acquired by Yahoo! in 2003) emerged during the end of the nineteen-nineties. Later in 2000 Google launched their PPC service AdWords which is responsible for the wide spread use and acceptance of PPC as an advertising channel. More and more merchants engaged in PPC advertising, either directly or via a search marketing agency and realized that this space was already well occupied by their affiliates. Although this fact alone did create channel conflicts and hot debate between advertisers and affiliates, was the biggest issue the bidding on advertisers names, brands and trademarks by some affiliates. A larger number of advertisers started to adjust their affiliate program terms to prohibit their affiliates from bidding on those type of keywords. Some advertisers however did and still do embrace this behavior of their affiliates and allow them, even encourage them, to bid an any term they like, including the advertisers trademarks.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate_marketing.html" title="Edit section: Lack of Self Regulation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lack of Self Regulation</span></h3>
<p>Affiliate Marketing is driven by entrepreneurs who are working at the forefront of internet marketing. Affiliates are the first to take advantage of new emerging trends and technologies where established advertisers do not dare to be active. Affiliates take risks and "trial and error" is probably the best way to describe how affiliate marketers are operating. This is also one of the reasons why most affiliates fail and give up before they "make it" and become "super affiliates" who generate $10,000 and more in commission (not sales) per month. This "frontier" life and the attitude that can be found in such type of communities is probably the main reason, why the affiliate marketing industry is not able to this day to self-regulate itself beyond individual contracts between advertiser and affiliate. The 10+ years history since the beginning of affiliate marketing is full of failed attempts<sup id="_ref-afforg_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-afforg" title="">[11]</a></sup> to create an industry organization or association of some kind that could be the initiator of regulations, standards and guidelines for the industry. Some of the failed examples are the Affiliate Union, iAfma, USAMC, Affiliate Marketing Advertising Board and Affiliate Marketing Trade Association.</p>
<p>The only places where the different people from the industry, <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate.html" title="Affiliate">affiliates</a>/publishers, merchants/<a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertiser.html" title="Advertiser">advertisers</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate_networks.html" title="Affiliate networks">networks</a> and 3rd party vendors and service providers like <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate_managers.html" title="Affiliate managers">outsources program managers</a> come together at one location are either <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_forum.html" title="Internet forum">online forums</a> and industry trade shows. The forums are free and even small affiliates can have a big voice at places like that, which is supported by the anonymity that is provided by those platforms. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_show.html" title="Trade show">Trade shows</a> are not anonymous, but a large number, in fact the greater number (quantitative) of affiliates is not able to attend those events for financial reasons. Only performing affiliates can afford the often hefty price tags for the event passes or get it sponsored by an advertisers they promote.</p>
<p>Because of the anoymity of forums, the only place where you are to get the majority (quantitative) of people in the industry together, is it almost impossible to create any form of legally binding rule or regulation that must be followed by everybody in the industry. Forums had only very few successes in their role as representant of the majority in the affiliate marketing industry. The last example<sup id="_ref-abwcjlmi_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abwcjlmi" title="">[12]</a></sup> of such a success was the halt of the "CJ LMI" ("<a href="../../../c/o/m/Commission_Junction_ea93.html" title="Commission Junction">Commission Junction</a> Link Management Initiative") in June/July 2006, when a single network tried to impose on their publishers/affiliates the use of <a href="../../../j/a/v/Javascript.html" title="Javascript">Javascript</a> tracking code as a replacement for common <a href="../../../l/i/n/Links_%28web_browser%29.html" title="Links (web browser)">HTML Links</a>.</p>

<p>Affiliate marketers usually avoid this topic as much as possible, but when it is being discussed, then are the debates explosive and heated to say the least. <sup id="_ref-cpn84_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cpn84" title="">[13]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-cpn95_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cpn95" title="">[14]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-abw68643_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abw68643" title="">[15]</a></sup> The discussion is about CPA Networks and their impact on "classic" Affiliate Marketing. Traditional Affiliate Marketing is resources intensive and requires a lot of maintenance. Most of this includes the management, monitoring and support of affiliates. Affiliate Marketing is supposed to be about long-term and mutual benefitial partnerships between advertisers and affiliates. CPA Networks on the other hand eliminate the need for the advertiser to build and maintain relationships to affiliates, because that task is performed by the CPA Network for the advertiser. The Advertiser simply puts an offer out, which is in almost every case a CPA based offer, and the CPA Networks take care of the rest by mobilizing their affiliates to promote that offer. CPS or revenue share offers are rarely be found at CPA Networks, which is the main compensation model of classic Affiliate Marketing..</p>
