Distribution of U.S. Median Home Values</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Affordable housing</b> is a dwelling where the total <a href="../../../h/o/u/House.html" title="House">housing</a> costs are affordable to those living in that housing unit. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and Canada, a commonly accepted guideline for housing affordability is a housing cost that does not exceed 30% of a household's gross income. Housing costs considered in this guideline generally include <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">taxes</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insurance.html" title="Insurance">insurance</a> for owners, and sometimes include utility costs. When the monthly carrying costs of a home exceed 30-35% of household income, then the housing is considered unaffordable for that household. (Note that for some <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/programs/hcv/about/fact_sheet.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/programs/hcv/about/fact_sheet.cfm" rel="nofollow">US programs</a>, maximum housing cost limits are set as high as 40% gross income.)</p>
<p>Where the supply of available housing is significantly less than the demand, many low and moderate income households cannot secure housing that is affordable. In these housing markets, land values are increasing faster than incomes. These housing markets may also have a limited supply of residential land, or a number of regulations that make it difficult or costly to increase housing supply at rents affordable to consumers at income ranges below the local average.</p>
<p>Demand can be measured in terms of the costs for housing, housing type (such as apartments vs. single-detached homes, or the size and configuration of units, including number of bedrooms) and location for housing (relative to commercial/employment centers, transportation infrastructure, schools and other community resources.)</p>
<p>The most "affordable" places in the U.S. are where there is the least demand and an adequate supply. <a href="http://www.nlihc.org/oor2005/" class="external text" title="http://www.nlihc.org/oor2005/" rel="nofollow">Comprehensive data</a> for the most affordable and least affordable places in the U.S. is published each year by an affordable housing non-profit organization, the National Low Income Housing Coalition.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affordable_housing.html" title="Edit section: Household Income">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Household Income</span></h2>
<p>A primary factor in housing affordability is household income. In the U.S., households are commonly defined in terms of the amount of income they earn relative to 100% of the <a href="http://affordablehousingatl.org/glossary.html" class="external text" title="http://affordablehousingatl.org/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">Area Median Income</a> or AMI. Localized AMI figures are calculated annually based on a survey of comparably-sized households within geographic ranges known as <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metroarea.html" class="external text" title="http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metroarea.html" rel="nofollow">Metropolitan Statistical Areas</a>, as defined by the US Office of Management and Budget. For housing policy purposes, households are <a href="http://www.huduser.org/datasets/il/fmr99/sect82.html" class="external text" title="http://www.huduser.org/datasets/il/fmr99/sect82.html" rel="nofollow">categorized</a> as follows: Moderate income households earn between 80-120% of AMI. Low income households earn between 50-80% AMI. Very low income households earn no more than 50% AMI. Note that localities can adapt these income limits when administering local affordable housing programs; however, federal programs must adhere to the definitions above. Data including 2006 AMI levels for all Metropolitan Statistical Areas may be found <a href="http://www.efanniemae.com/sf/refmaterials/hudmedinc/" class="external text" title="http://www.efanniemae.com/sf/refmaterials/hudmedinc/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>A common measure of community-wide affordability is the number of homes that a household with a certain percentage of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Median_household_income.html" title="Median household income">median income</a> can afford. For example, a community might track the percentage of its housing that is affordable to households earning 60% of median income. In addition to the distress it causes families who cannot easily find a place to live, lack of affordable housing is considered by many <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_planning.html" title="Urban planning">urban planners</a> to have negative effects on a community's overall health. For example, lack of affordable housing can make low-cost labor more scarce, and increase demands on transportation systems (as workers travel longer distances between jobs and affordable housing). An increasing number of <a href="http://www.bos.frb.org/commdev/c&amp;b/2005/Spring/Housing.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bos.frb.org/commdev/c&amp;b/2005/Spring/Housing.pdf" rel="nofollow">studies</a> and articles focused on US cities (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/education/la-me-enroll11jun11,1,481921.story?coll=la-news-learning" class="external text" title="http://www.latimes.com/news/education/la-me-enroll11jun11,1,481921.story?coll=la-news-learning" rel="nofollow">Los Angeles, CA</a>, <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:J20rOJZG1_IJ:www.knowledgeplex.org/news/154740.html+affordable+housing+and+schools+enrollment&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3" class="external text" title="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:J20rOJZG1_IJ:www.knowledgeplex.org/news/154740.html+affordable+housing+and+schools+enrollment&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3" rel="nofollow">Sarasota, FL</a>) link the parallel trends of housing cost increases and declines in enrollment at local schools.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affordable_housing.html" title="Edit section: Policy tools to address affordable housing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Policy tools to address affordable housing</span></h2>
<p>Numerous policies in the U.S. and abroad have been designed to address the problem of inadequate supplies of affordable housing. Sophisticated secondary market mechanisms, inclusionary <a href="../../../z/o/n/Zoning.html" title="Zoning">zoning</a>, and <a href="http://ceres.ca.gov/planning/open_space/banking.html" class="external text" title="http://ceres.ca.gov/planning/open_space/banking.html" rel="nofollow">land banking</a> are three prominent tools, as well as tax and fiscal policies that result in reducing the cost of mortgages and the cost of borrowing. Other more recently promoted policy tools include relaxation of prohibitions against <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garage_apartment.html" title="Garage apartment">accessory dwelling units</a>, and reduction of the amount of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parking.html" title="Parking">parking</a> that must be built for a new structure.</p>
<p>Affordable housing is a controversial reality of contemporary life, for gains in affordability often result from expanding land available for housing or increasing the density of housing units in a given area. Ensuring a steady supply of affordable housing means ensuring that communities weigh real and perceived <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livability.html" title="Livability">livability</a> impacts against the sheer necessity of affordability. The process of weighing the impacts of locating affordable housing is quite contentious, and is laden with race and class implications.</p>

U.S. Federal Housing Budget 1976-2007</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The federal government in the U.S. provides subsidies to make housing more affordable. Financial assistance is provided for homeowners through the mortgage interest tax deduction and for lower income households through housing subsidy programs. In the 1970s the federal government spent somewhat equal amounts on tax expenditures for homeowners and low income housing subsidies, however by 2005 tax expenditures had risen to $120 billion per year, representing nearly 80 percent of all federal housing assistance. (See Chart.) <a href="http://www.nlihc.org/pubs/changingpriorities.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nlihc.org/pubs/changingpriorities.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform for <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">President Bush</a> proposed reducing the mortgage interest tax deduction in a <a href="http://www.taxreformpanel.gov" class="external text" title="http://www.taxreformpanel.gov" rel="nofollow">final report</a> issued on November 1, 2005.</p>
<p>Housing assistance from the federal government for lower income households can be divided into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Tenant based” subsidies given to an individual household, known as the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Section_8_%28housing%29.html" title="Section 8 (housing)">Section 8</a> program</li>
<li>“Project based” subsidies given to the owner of housing units that must be rented to lower income households at affordable rates, and</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_housing.html#United_States_and_Canada" title="Public housing">Public Housing</a>, which is usually owned and operated by the government. (Some public housing projects are managed by subcontracted private agencies.)</li>
</ul>
<p>“Project based” subsidies are also known by their section of the U.S. Housing Act, and include Section 8, Section 236, Section 221(d)(3), Section 202 for elderly households and Section 811 for people with disabilities. There are also housing subsidies through the Section 8 program that are project based. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development_6df0.html" title="United States Department of Housing and Urban Development">United States Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> (HUD) administers these programs, and has <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/mfh/progdesc/progdesc.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/mfh/progdesc/progdesc.cfm" rel="nofollow">further information</a> on the particular programs on agency <a href="http://www.hud.gov" class="external text" title="http://www.hud.gov" rel="nofollow">web site</a>. HUD programs have ceased producing large numbers of units since the 1980s. Since 1986, the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low-Income_Housing_Tax_Credit_2885.html" title="Low-Income Housing Tax Credit">Low-Income Housing Tax Credit</a> program has produced a large share of the affordable units, however the affordability level in these units is less than the former HUD programs.</p>
<p>Some states and cities in the United States operate a variety of affordable housing programs, including supportive housing programs, transitional housing programs and rent subsidies as part of public assistance programs.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affordable_housing.html" title="Edit section: UNITED KINGDOM">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">UNITED KINGDOM</span></h3>
<p>The United Kingdom has a long tradition of affordable social rented housing. This may be owned by local councils or housing associations.</p>
<p>There are also a range of affordable home ownership options including shared ownership (part rent part buy).</p>
<p>A high proportion of homes in the UK were previously council owned, but many have been sold to former tenants or transferred to <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housing_association.html" title="Housing association">Housing associations</a>.</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Housing Executive was set up to take on ownership of former council housing and prevent possible sectarian allocation of housing to people from one religion.</p>
<p>Housing associations are not for profit organisations with a history that goes back before the start of the 20th century. The number of homes they own has expanded particularly over the last 10 to 20 years as governments have enabled them to build and to receive homes transferred from councils. Many of these transferred homes have gone to newly set up housing associations, some of which are amongst the largest in the country. Despite being not-for-profit organisations, housing association rents are approximately 17% higher than council housing rents. Renting a home through a housing association can prove far costlier than paying for a similar property through a mortgage.</p>
<p>All major <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housing_association.html" title="Housing association">Housing associations</a> are registered with the Housing Corporation which regulates and them and provides grants for development. Housing associations that are registered with the Corporation are also known as Registered Social Landlords.</p>
<p>Council housing began to be a particularly significant part of housing provision in the UK after the first world war, and developed even more strongly after the second world war. In the 1950s and 1960's different political parties vied with each other to offer the greatest number of new council homes to be built. However cost restrictions lead to poorer quality homes in some cases.</p>
<p>In the 1980s the Conservative government introduced the 'Right to Buy' for council tenants along with a significant discount of up to 60% (70% on leasehold homes such as flats). This led to very large numbers of sales. In some areas significant amounts of council housing has been demolished due to poor quality, low demand or significant social problems. Governments have encouraged councils to transfer stock to housing associations. A requirement for council housing to be brought up to a set standard - called Decent Homes - combined with restrictions on the amounts that councils can borrow has led to an increase in such transfers lately. Many councils have also transferred the management of their housing to an Arms Length Management Organisation. These ALMOs have better access to funding than the councils do.</p>
<p>The Department for Communities and Local Government has responsibility for housing in England. In January 2007 it announce a planned merger between the Housing Corporation and regeneration body English Partnerships to create Communities England. This new body is likely to have access to more than £4 billion in resources.
