<p><b>Affirmative action</b> is a policy or a program of increasing the representation of certain designated groups allegedly seeking to redress discrimination or bias through active measures, as in education and employment. It is usually achieved through the use of discrimination and preferential treatment for those groups. Proponents of <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affirmative_action.html" title="Affirmative action">affirmative action</a> generally advocate it either as a means to address past or present discrimination or to enhance racial, ethnic, gender, or other diversity.<sup id="_ref-Richardson-1998_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Richardson-1998" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, opponents of affirmative action contend that affirmative action programs are discriminatory in that they promote under-qualified individuals over higher qualified individuals based on race and ethnicity.<a href="http://www.adversity.net/fed_stats/HUD/huddocs/1worth_vs._martinez.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adversity.net/fed_stats/HUD/huddocs/1worth_vs._martinez.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.adversity.net/contracting/Chicago/default.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adversity.net/contracting/Chicago/default.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, affirmative action mostly applies at transition points—times when individuals are changing their employment, housing or enrollment. Those most affected thus include working age adults who hope to improve their lot through a change in obtaining housing, employment or the pursuit of educational opportunity.</p>
<p>This arrangement has the greatest impact on young people, while maintaining the status and position of established members of society. This overall framework was established by presidential decree in March <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> by <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, but has evolved significantly; the original <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_Order_10925_5040.html" title="Executive Order 10925">Executive Order 10925</a> required treatment "without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin," but affirmative action now generally means preferential treatment for certain minorities.</p>
<p>Affirmative action has been the subject of numerous court cases, and has been contested on <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Constitution_b784.html" title="United States Constitution">constitutional</a> grounds. Writing in 1998, L. Anita Richardson commented that U.S. courts have generally accepted affirmative action as a remedy for actual present-time discrimination and rejected it outright for the goal of simply promoting racial diversity. Richardson writes, "There is much debate about dealing with the lingering, pernicious effects of past racial discrimination." She further states, "Conversely, racial diversity, while a laudable goal, will have to be achieved by means other [<i>sic</i>] affirmative action."<sup id="_ref-Richardson-1998_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Richardson-1998" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Individual U.S. states (e.g. <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington.html" title="Washington">Washington</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>) also have orders that prohibit discrimination and outline affirmative action requirements with regard to race, creed, color, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, gender, age, and disability status.</p>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>During the Nixon administration, affirmative action was adopted as a federal mandate for companies with federal contracts and for labor unions whose workers were engaged in those projects. This "revised Philadelphia plan" was spearheaded by Labor Department official Arthur Fletcher.<a href="http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:20649393&amp;ctrlInfo=Round20%3AMode20e%3ADocG%3AResult&amp;ao=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:20649393&amp;ctrlInfo=Round20%3AMode20e%3ADocG%3AResult&amp;ao=" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>

<dd>In the 1960s and 1970s, affirmative action became overwhelmingly popular on campuses across America as mass student protests spurred schools to actively recruit minority applicants. National excitement died down in the late 1970s, and quickly turned to national controversy.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The Johnson administration embraced affirmative action in 1965, by issuing U.S Executive order 11246, later amended by Executive order 11375. The order, as amended, aims "to correct the effects of past and present discrimination". It prohibits federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, skin color, religion, gender, or national origin. The order requires that contractors take affirmative action to ensure that "protected class, underutilized applicants" are employed when available, and that employees are treated without negative discriminatory regard to their protected-class status.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The order specifically requires certain organizations accepting federal funds to take affirmative action to increase employment of members of preferred racial or ethnic groups and women. Any organization with fifty or more employees and an aggregate revenue exceeding $50,000 from a single federal contract during a twelve month period must have a written affirmative action plan. This plan must include goals and timetables for achieving full utilization of women and members of racial minorities, in quotas based on an analysis of the current workforce compared to the availability in the general labor pool of women and members of racial minorities..</dd>
</dl>

<dd>The order is enforced by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs of the Employment Standards Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor and by the Office of Civil Rights of the Justice Department.</dd>

<dd>in Washington was overwhelmingly passed by the electorate. Taking effect on December 3, 1998, it applies to all local governments, including counties, cities, and towns. I-200 prohibits "preferential treatment" based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, education, and contracting. The Washington State Legislature has generally been in favor of affirmative action and appears to wish to reinstate aspects of it. However, despite several proposals, they have not yet done so.</dd>

<dd>The Washington State Supreme Court interpreted I-200 to forbid affirmative actions that promote a "less qualified" applicant over a "better qualified" one, but not programs that sought to achieve diversity without consideration of individual merit.</dd>

<p>In the beginning, racial classifications that identified race were inherently suspect and subject to strict scrutiny. These classifications would only be upheld if necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest. Later the U.S. Supreme Court decided that racial classifications that benefited underrepresented minorities were to only be upheld if necessary and promoted a compelling governmental purpose. (See Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.) There is no clear guidance about when government action is not "compelling", and such rulings are rare.</p>

<p>In the U.S., the most prominent form of affirmative action centers on access to education, particularly admission to universities and other forms of tertiary instruction. Race, ethnicity, native language, social class, geographical origin, parental attendance of the university in question (<a href="../../../l/e/g/Legacy_preferences.html" title="Legacy preferences">legacy admissions</a>), and/or gender are often taken into account when assessing the meaning of an applicant's grades and test scores (while men are under-represented in colleges in general and particularly in most liberal arts programs, males do not typically receive affirmative action<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>). Individuals can also be awarded <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarship.html" title="Scholarship">scholarships</a> and have fees paid on the basis of criteria listed above.</p>
<p>Affirmative action programs at universities benefit mostly black people and racial minorities (usually in engineering and the physical sciences). <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_Americans_3f38.html" title="Asian Americans">Asian Americans</a>, although a racial minority, do not benefit at most colleges because the rate of college education among Asian Americans is higher than the other racial groups (including Caucasians). See <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_minority.html" title="Model minority">model minority</a> for more information.</p>
<p>A 2005 study by Princeton sociologists Thomas J. Espenshade and Chang Y. Chung compared the effects of affirmative action on racial and special groups at three highly selective private research universities. The data from the study represent admissions disadvantage and advantage in terms of <a href="../../../s/a/t/SAT_684e.html" title="SAT">SAT</a> points (on the old 1600-point scale):</p>
<ul>
<li>Blacks: +230</li>
<li>Hispanics: +185</li>
<li>Asians: –50</li>
<li>Recruited athletes: +200</li>

<p>The above estimates for African-Americans, and to a lesser extent Hispanic-Americans, probably understate the disparity. Standardized tests tend to overpredict for individual, high-scoring members of populations with weaker test scores <a href="http://www.lrainc.com/swtaboo/stalkers/em_bayes.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lrainc.com/swtaboo/stalkers/em_bayes.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a><a href="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/dct.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/dct.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. (One's SAT score predicts a certain level of performance. If one performs above this level, the test underpredicted; if the reverse, it overpredicted.) Thus, according to these analyses, accounting for group differences, a Caucasian individual with a score of 1,200 would actually be <i>more</i> able on average than an African-American or Hispanic-American with a 1200. Critics say that this failure to adjust scores to improve the test's <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predictive_validity.html" title="Predictive validity">predictive validity</a> distorts the scores of minorities, and indirectly everyone, as admissions is a zero sum game. Adjusting for this tendency would likely result in more controversy, however, as it is easily misconstrued.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/c/l/UCLA_052f.html" title="UCLA">UCLA</a> professor Richard H. Sander published an article in the November 2004 issue of the <i>Stanford Law Review</i> that questioned the effectiveness of affirmative action in <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_school.html" title="Law school">law schools</a>. The article presents a study that, among other things, shows that half of all black law students rank near the bottom of their class after the first year of law school, and that black law students are more likely to drop out of law school and to fail the bar exam. The article offers a tentative estimate that the production of new black lawyers in the United States would grow by eight percent if affirmative action programs at all law schools were ended, as less qualified black students would instead attend less prestigious schools where they would be more closely matched with their classmates, and thus perform better. Sander helped to develop a socioeconomically-based affirmative action plan for the UCLA School of Law after the passage of <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Proposition_209_%281996%29_94c4.html" title="California Proposition 209 (1996)">Proposition 209 in 1996</a> which prohibited the use of racial preferences by public universities <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> schools. This change occurred after studies that showed that the graduation rate of blacks at UCLA was 41%, compared to 73% for whites. Even on the East coast, Sander's study is proven valid. Most black law students in North Carolina attend the historically black law school at North Carolina Central University. There are six other law schools in the state of North Carolina, most of them private, but the overwhelming majority of black students apply to Central. Take note that North Carolina Central University also has the distinction of perpetually having the lowest bar-passing rate in North Carolina for the past twelve years.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In order to avoid a system of racial quotas, the State of <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> passed a law guaranteeing entry to any state university of a student's choice if they finished in the top 10% of their graduating class. <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> and California have also replaced racial quotas with class rank and other programs. Class rank tends to discriminate against those at relatively competitive high schools, simply because schools are not uniform in student ability. Consequently, there have been fears that this would lower standards, disadvantaged students from schools with lesser performances would receive an unfair opportunity. Critics argue that class rank is more a measure of one's peers than of one's self. The top 10% law is highly controversial on the grounds that it overemphasizes GPA. A bill has recently passed in the Texas House (but not the Senate) strongly limiting it <a href="http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/news/legislature/11627400.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/news/legislature/11627400.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.

Nagda, Ph.D., MSW, MA, Associate Professor of Social Work and Director of the Intergroup Dialogue, Education and Action (IDEA) Training and Resource Institute at the University of Washington, and Gretchen E. Lopez, Ph.D., former Assistant Professor of Psychology and Africana and Latin American Studies at Colgate University and now Research Director of the Syracuse University Violence Prevention Project, conducted a series of studies<sup><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~pgurin/benefits.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~pgurin/benefits.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></sup> finding positive results for affirmative action. Affirmative action had significant effects in improving citizenship preparation and a student sense of commonality across ethnic boundaries. It also increases student civic engagement and racial/ethnic understanding.</p>
<p>In her expert report for the University of Michigan, Professor Patricia Gurin stated "A racially and ethnically diverse university student body has far-ranging and significant benefits for all students, non-minorities and minorities alike. Students learn better in a diverse educational environment, and they are better prepared to become active participants in our pluralistic, democratic society once they leave such a setting. In fact, patterns of racial segregation and separation historically rooted in our national life can be broken by diversity experiences in higher education.</p>
<p>... These conclusions are confirmed by one of the most broad and extensive series of empirical analyses conducted on college students in relation to diversity. I examined multi-institutional national data, the results of an extensive survey of students at the University of Michigan, and data drawn from a specific classroom program at the University of Michigan. It is clear from all three analyses that interaction with peers from diverse racial backgrounds, both in the classroom and informally, is positively associated with a host of what I call "learning outcomes." Students who experienced the most racial and ethnic diversity in classroom settings and in informal interactions with peers showed the greatest engagement in active thinking processes, growth in intellectual engagement and motivation, and growth in intellectual and academic skills.</p>
<p>...There is a consistent pattern of positive relationships between diversity in higher education and both learning and democracy outcomes. This pattern holds across racial and ethnic groups and across a broad range of outcomes. And the benefits of diversity are evident at the national level, after four years of college and five years after leaving college, and in the studies of Michigan students. This consistency is unusual in my experience as a social scientist. These analyses, which are supported by the research literature, provide strong evidence of the compelling benefits to our society of racial diversity in higher education."<sup><a href="http://www.vpcomm.umich.edu/admissions/legal/expert/summ.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vpcomm.umich.edu/admissions/legal/expert/summ.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></sup></p>

<li>They encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e. primary beneficiary of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies;</li>
<li>They tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., wealthy blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor whites);</li>
<li>They reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best — the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile — thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and</li>
<li>They engender animosity toward preferred groups as well as on the part of preferred groups themselves, whose main problem in some cases has been their own inadequacy combined with their resentment of non-preferred groups who — without preferences — consistently outperform them.</li>

<dd>"When the top-level schools recruit black students who would normally be qualified to succeed at the level next to the top, then the second tier of institutions faces the prospect of either being conspicuously lacking in minority students or (2) dipping down to the next level below to bring in enough minority students for a statistically respectable "representation."

<p>One argument against AA (affirmative action) is that it represents government sanctioned <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_discrimination.html" title="Racial discrimination">racial discrimination</a>, and is demeaning to members of minority groups - that affirmative action wrongly sends a condescending message to minorities that they are not capable enough to be considered on their own merits. If this argument is to be believed, AA promotes the idea that underrepresented minorities do not and can not emphasize education and high academic achievement as much as the racial majority or "<a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_Minority_350a.html" title="Model Minority">Model Minorities</a>." Many supporters of affirmative action charge that those who make this argument are being <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnocentric.html" title="Ethnocentric">ethnocentric</a> and are disingenuously trying to deflect or downplay the role of past and current institutional discrimination of minorities. These critics believe that these proponents are trying to shift the blame onto the victim who was discriminated against in the first place in order to justify rolling back government civil rights policies. Furthermore, many critics believe that those who make this argument are being naive, hypocritical, or vague in their quest to 'change the cultural values' of the minority community. Other supporters of affirmative action argue that it benefits society as a whole. They argue that the end goal of AA should not be one culture, but an embrace of all cultural heritages and, by doing so, we increase the quality of the society. This is widely argued in the realm of education. An example of support for this is a study done by Patricia Gurin, who is part of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychological_Association_357c.html" title="American Psychological Association">American Psychological Association</a>. Gurin found that students who are from a more diverse educational setting had better results in tests designed to measure complex thinking, were more motivated to understand other people’s points of view, were more understanding of differences in cultural environments, and were more confident in their intellectual ability.</p>

<p>Most proponents of AA believe that eradicating affirmative action would further deepen economic disparity between whites and underrepresented minorities. A common argument made for Affirmative Action is the existence of an "Old Boy's Network". Such a network, it is argued, exists where people with power in organizations are able to and readily elect, promote, and support one another as well as others who are close to them within the organization (for example, the CEO of a company ensures that his best friend's son gets a position in the mail room of his company). Such a network, to the extent that it does exist, represents not a true 'meritocracy', but an oligarchy which creates barriers to entry into it for those who are not connected to the "Old Boy's Network". Nobody from outside the "Old Boy's Network" could be promoted 'from within' a company unless the job was also posted publicly and everyone was given a 'fair chance' via a convoluted and lengthy questionnaire and interview process (for example, the federal government accepts applicants to jobs in the department of interior or department of agriculture on the basis of a numerical score based on a lengthy set of forms and questionnaires they fill out). Those who make this argument, however, also point to the fact that the government gives preferential treatment to veterans and that many organizations give preferential treatment to employees who have worked in the organization in the past. Furthermore, there is 'geographical affirmative action', in which people are more likely to be hired if their application has a local address written on it. All of these examples show ways in which employees are hired based on non-merit criteria.</p>
<p>Those who disagree with this argument point out that, with the exception of the government's preferential treatment of veterans, none of these are cases of affirmative action. Affirmative action involves legal regulation of private enterprises regarding hiring practices. There is no legal regulation for or against 'geographic affirmative action', for example. This argument further runs into the problem of resting on an implicit assumption that people are either connected to the "Old Boy's Network" or a racial minority. Where would one place the black CEO or the poor white coal miner living in West Virginia in that framework? Rather than confronting preferential treatment in a heads on kind of way, affirmative action simply creates more groups who receive preferential treatment. By legalizing and requiring preferential treatment, it promotes preferential treatment and remains mute on the vast number of people who do not fall into either of those categories (i.e., those people who are not members of the Old Boy's Network or minorities) and are discriminated against, in part, as a result of affirmative action law. In other words, opponents of affirmative action in employment and education claim that these programs encourage socioeconomic discrimination in favor of middle-class members of minority groups over better qualified but working-class members from the majority group, since such programs do not consider socioeconomic class. In essence, middle-class minorities with greater opportunities and resources at their disposal are favored over members of the working poor who happen not to be minorities (usually, poor whites). These critics believe this is contrary to claims of "social justice" made by supporters and makes AA policy in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>Their argument is a fundamental objection to the use of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_quotas.html" title="Racial quotas">racial quotas</a> and gender quotas in affirmative action, because such quotas are unable to address social injustice at the fine level of detail which is required. However, proponents of AA reply that quotas are only legal in the US when a judge issues an order for a specific institution to make restitution for past discrimination. There is intense dispute over whether the de jure illegality of quotas prevents de facto quotas in an environment where there is so much pressure to protect against the appearance of discrimination against protected groups. Much time has been spent attempting to show that these "goals" are not <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quotas.html" title="Quotas">quotas</a>.</p>

<p>Critics of affirmative action believe that it rewards or punishes individuals in the present for what their group is supposed to have done in the past. For example, Mike S. Adams argues that affirmative action can be summed up as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of whether he is guilty of racism, a person is to be punished for racism carried out by other members of his racial group. Regardless of whether he is a victim of racism, a person is entitled to benefits for racism carried out against other members of his racial group.[16]</dd>
</dl>
<p>Proponents of affirmative action respond that such discrepancies that exist are a result of historic segregation. For example, many of the state and city universities had much lower tuition fees during the time they were primarily for whites, while tuition at such institutions have grown faster than the rate of inflation now that more minorities are attending.

<p>Some <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_market.html" title="Free market">free market</a> <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian.html" title="Libertarian">libertarians</a> argue that employment discrimination is only made possible by pervasive market failures. Under a regime of highly competitive <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_market.html" title="Labor market">labor</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_%28economics_and_accounting%29.html" title="Good (economics and accounting)">goods</a> markets, companies would not be able to afford to hire on any basis other than merit. According to Libertarians, this would render affirmative action unnecessary.</p>
<p>Regardless of the willingness to pay and profitability for private persons or groups to discriminate, other libertarian-oriented persons further argue that affirmative action and non-discrimination policies violate individual rights of freedom of association and the enforcement of such statues violate individual freedom of speech. They argue that such central authority to dictate moral and social improvement is a power that will be fought over on all sides and ultimately cause more harm than good. For example, private female-only gyms have been forced to hire male workers, American colleges have discriminated against Asian students (on the grounds that they are "overrepresented"), and in Washington DC, individuals have been forbidden to advertise that they wish to share an apartment with another Democrat, homosexual, or with someone of similar faith. They conclude that application of affirmative action and anti-discrimination laws to the conduct or property of an individual or a private group is a threat to civil liberties.<a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~dbernste/book/" class="external autonumber" title="http://mason.gmu.edu/~dbernste/book/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>

<p>Certain people have a different point of view about specifically first world affirmative action which, for lack of a better word, will be referred to as "centrist" here. They claim that affirmative action makes sense, but only to the point where it helps the disadvantaged members of minorities, as opposed to the middle and upper class. They believe that affirmative action, as it is now, is not fulfilling its original purpose (to bring minorities out of poverty) as the vast majority of minorities, in the first world at least, are already middle-class. There have been cases of middle-class minorities receiving better jobs or college acceptance rates than whites of equal or lower income or social standing. According to this point of view, affirmative action should be eliminated and joined with the normal welfare system that helps both whites and blacks that are lower-class. They believe that affirmative action should only be used to bring the lower class, not a specific racial group, out of poverty. This view is particularly associated with the liberal academic and author <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Benn_Michaels_170c.html" title="Walter Benn Michaels">Walter Benn Michaels</a>. <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/09/03/colorblinded" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/09/03/colorblinded" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></p>
