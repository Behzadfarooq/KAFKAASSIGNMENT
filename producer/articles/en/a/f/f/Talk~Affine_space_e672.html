<dd>Wikipedia has a reputation for articles only mathematicians can understand. And removing this kind of stories, and also striving for more general approaches makes an article maybe better for mathematicians (which I am not sure) and, I think, worse for everybody else.

<p>I agree that the story is better as an informal description than anything else I've seen in this article. And it is misleading to say that physics sees physical space as an affine space, because the affine structure fails to indicate, for example, which lines are at right angles to each other. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 21:13, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC) ... and I would add that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Baez_224a.html" title="John Baez">John Baez</a>, the mathematical physicist, loved the story. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 21:15, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have been thinking about the physical space and you have a point: it is an affine space with a metric and conformal structure(angles). But it is still also an affine space and the only motivation thusfar that this article has ever seen.

<p>I wish the story would concentrate on subtraction of points to vectors as per the definition. Now it focuses on adding points in an affine way which I have put into formal form in the second example. I find this a bit confusing. Further I disagree with the use of a formula for one side of the story and not the other, making it more difficult to compare. Mentioning John Baez serves no purpose whatsoever and saying that the proof is a routine exercise is also garbage. cancelling the origin yields the result. Okay so John and Smith know how to "add" two points. Does that have any meaning? Well yes, it is the halfway point. And what is that? It is the point p such that a-p=p-b. Or (a-b)/2=a-p. And why did you put _every_ tex formula on a separate line? That is really ugly and difficult to read. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 14:29, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since an affine space is like a vector space which has forgot its origin, one should regard affine spaces as a more basic mathematical object than vector spaces. Hence, I would like a precise definition of an affine space without any reference to a vector space. Afterwards one can define a vector space as an affine space together with a choice of origin.</p>

<dd>The problem may be resolved, except for affine spaces over the field {0,1,2}. See the discussion below on the axiomatic definition of affine spaces.--Mark, 17 May 2006</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The case for the field {0,1,2} requires special treatment, when adopting the algebraic approach described below, as does the case of affine spaces over {0,1}.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another route that may be later discussed here is to note that an affine space may also be thought of as a projective geometry in which a specific "subspace at infinity" has been designated. The advantage of this second approach is that (1) projective geometry only requires 3-5 axioms, depending on whether you want to include Desargues' Theorem and the Theorem of Pappus, and (2) the underlying field is internally constructible and does not need to be assumed at the outset. In dimensions more than 2, Desargues' is provable, and Pappus' Theorem is only required to show that products in the underlying field commute.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The most likely route to this approach is to split the "point" concept in Projective Geometry to "point" and "direction"; and split the "line" concept to "line" and "horizon". Then each of the axioms needs to be divided into the various special cases (some becoming redundant or reducible to less generalized forms). For instance, the axiom that asserts that every line has 3 points becomes 2 axioms: (a) every line has 2 points and a direction; (b) every horizon has 3 directions on it. The axiom that asserts (c) two points uniquely determine a line now ramifies into special cases, (d) given a point and a direction, there is a unique line containing the point lying in the given direction, and (e) given two directions, there is a unique horizon which these directions lie on.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This may be brought into more conventional terms by replacing the "direction" concept by that of the "parallelism" equivalence relation; and replacing the "horizon" concept by "plane". The only drawback to this general approach is that Projective Geometry normally assumes its spaces are of 2 or more dimensions, so you lose the 1-dimensional Affine Spaces with this approach (as well as the 0-dimensional space).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All you're really doing is writing down postulates for Descriptive Geometry and then exploiting its capability of internally defining a field to construct an affine space structure on top of it. -- Mark, 19 May 2006</dd>

<p>I think there's something to be said for the approach Toreak proposes, but in this kind of forum we have to live with the fact that everyone's already familiar with the concept of vector space.

 For a precise definition of affine space, the set S should be described.-Richard Peterson
</pre>
<p>RP has good point. The minus sign usually is shorthand for a function X x X -&gt; X. In an affine space, it's used in a very nonstandard way, as it takes points from one space (the affine space) to a different space (the vector space). Saying that Theta(a,b) = a-b is simply a tautology; "a-b" has absolutely no meaning other than being equal to Theta(a,b). Presenting subtraction as if it is somehow an intrinsic property of the affine space separate from Theta is deceptive.--69.107.121.247 01:55, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is a simple intrinsic characterization of Affine Spaces over fields other than the trivial field {0,1} and the field {0,1,2}. The case of Affine Spaces over {0,1} is separately characteized as abelian group with idempotent elements. To arrive at an axiomatization for these, one needs an analogous concept of "Affine Group", which is discussed below. The case for {0,1,2} also requires special handling.</p>
<p>The operation defined by [A,r,B] = (1-r)A + rB may be completely characterized by the following properties</p>
<ul>
<li>[A,0,B] = A</li>
<li>[A,1,B] = B</li>
<li>[A,rt(1-t),[B,s,C]] = [[A,rt(1-s),B],t,[A,rs(1-t),C]].</li>
</ul>
<p>One recovers the vector space operations by designating a point, O, as the zero vector and then defining</p>

<li>rA = [O,r,A]</li>
<li>A+B = [[O,1/(1-t),A],t,[O,1/t,B]]</li>

<p>Just as an affine space may be thought of as a vector space in which the zero vector is no longer distinguished, one has an analogous concept for groups, where the identity element is no longer distinguished. Unfortunately, the name "affine group" is not possible, since that term is already being used for something else; hence the quotes.</p>
<p>An "affine" group is defined by a ternary operation a/b.c, subject to the axioms</p>
<ul>
<li>a/a.b = b</li>
<li>a/b.b = a</li>
<li>a/b.(c/d.e) = (a/b.c)/d.e</li>
</ul>
<p>It is abelian if, in addition,</p>
<ul>
<li>a/b.c = c/b.a.</li>
</ul>
<p>For abelian "affine" groups, the first two axioms are equivalent, but the third remains independent as can readily be seen by a suitable counter-example for a 2-element "affine" group.</p>
<p>The ternary corresponds to the operation a/b.c = ab^{-1}c. Here, the group operations are recovered by first selecting an element E to call the identity and then defining ab = a/E.b and a^{-1} = E/a.E. This defines the group "localized at E".</p>
<p>The group 'associated' with an "affine" group may be recovered by the equivalence relation (a,b/c.d) ~ (c/b.a,d). The corresponding equivalence class [(a,b)] defines an operation a\b which thus satisfies the identity a\(b/c.d) = (c/b.a)\d. One may then define the product by (a\b)(c\d) = a\(b/c.d) and prove that a\a is the identity and the inverse of a\b is b\a. The resulting group is isomorphic to the group localized at any element E.</p>
<p>An affine space over the field {0,1} is an "affine" group in which a/b.a = b.</p>

<p>I am bothered that the section entitled <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affine_space.html#Intrinsic_definition_of_affine_spaces" title="Affine space">Intrinsic definition of affine spaces</a> seems to be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> based on some (obviously unrefereed) posting to the sci.math.research newsgroup. However, I have no objection to a section giving an intrinsic definition or description of an affine space, and in fact, there is a published source upon which one could draw, namely</p>
<p>Bertram, Wolfgang, From linear algebra via affine algebra to projective algebra, <i>Linear Algebra Appl.</i> <b>378</b> (2004), 109-134.</p>
<p>A preprint version under a different title is also available at the <a href="http://www.uibk.ac.at/mathematik/loos/jordan/archive/gpg1/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.uibk.ac.at/mathematik/loos/jordan/archive/gpg1/index.html" rel="nofollow">Jordan Theory Preprint Archive</a>. The axioms in Bertram's paper seem more intuitive (to me, at least) than the ones in this article. However, I hesitate to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a>, because the section was added last May without anyone objecting, so maybe my concerns are misplaced. Any thoughts on this? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Kinyon_5edc.html" title="User:Michael Kinyon">Michael Kinyon</a> 23:41, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've tagged that section for cleanup because of the notation. For example, we see this:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>[A,m,B,s,C = [C,1-ms,B,(1-m)/(1-ms),A if ms is not 1.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But we should see something more like this:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>[<i>A</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>C</i>] = [<i>C</i>, 1 âˆ’ <i>ms</i>, <i>B</i>, (1 âˆ’ <i>m</i>)/(1 âˆ’ <i>ms</i>), <i>A</i>] if <i>ms</i> is not 1.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Among the differences: proper spacing, italicization of variables (but not digits and not brackets, etc.) proper minus signs instead of stubby littly hyphens, right brackets to match left brackets. This sort of stuff runs through the whole section. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 19:14, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've put most of the eqns inside &lt;math&gt; tags, which fixes some formatting problems, eqn 3' is suspect, but I don't know enough on the topic to know what it should be. The whole section could do with a lot of cleanup so tags still remain. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 15:15, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was redirected here from the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_variety.html" title="Algebraic variety">algebraic variety</a> article when I wondered what affine n-space was. Either the link from the aforementioned article was to the wrong article (what would the correct link target be?) or perhaps there should be a sentence or two about that notion? 128.135.100.161 16:09, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
