<h2><span class="mw-headline">Affiliate Marketing Resource Link Discussion</span></h2>
<p>I was there when we had the long discussions about what site to add and which not. It's a tough call, because this article is a popular SPAM target. The Dmoz link was the only compromise to have at least one further pointing resource for readers of the article. I am building currently a massive collection of (for the most part) free resources for affiliate marketing and more. Sometimes are no free resources available (or they are worthless). This makes it necessary to point to commercial services and products.</p>
<p>I am not just building a collection of links, DMOZ is doing that job just fine, but provide stuff like an aggregated news feed that merges various leading industry news sources into one convenient RSS feed. I also created and maintain a public Google calendar with industry events.</p>
<p>Have a look first and then state your opinion. I most of you don't think it's good, fine and I will remove it myself. Thanks for your feedback. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 05:26, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Due to a dispute regarding external resources for this article that ended in no consensus in march this year were all external Resources but the reference to the Affiliate Marketing Category at the Open Directory Project (ODP) at Dmoz.org removed from this article.</p>
<p><br />
This is in my opinion not sufficient. This Article is a target for Spammers, but not all Links that were added over the last months were actually Spam. They were valuable Resources that were added by a visitor who noticed the lag of such. I learned a lot about how Wikipedia works, but most normal visitors don't. I can imagine how disturbing it must be for a Visitor that reads the article, likes it and notices the missing resources and spends the time figuring out how to add one. Then coming back later and see that the change is gone and the article has the same problem as before.</p>
<p><br />
<font color="red"><b>Something should be done to correct this degradation of education and informational quality of the article.</b></font></p>
<p><b>I propose two solutions.</b></p>
<p><br />
<b>1. SEO Article Solution</b></p>
<p>Follow the example of the even more spammed and controverse article <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_Engine_Optimization_cfef.html" title="Search Engine Optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>. It took a bit, but we got all the the Editors that are watching and contributing (basically the Wikipedian that care for the content of the Article), to flesh out the problem with the external links and SPAM on the one hand and providing a quality article on the other. All agreed that having no external resources in the article for further research endangered the Articles conformity to Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREF_ecd4.html" title="WP:REF">WP:REF</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</p>
<p>The result was the agreement for 6 sites to be added to the section called "<a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_Engine_Optimization_cfef.html#Sources_of_background_information" title="Search Engine Optimization">Sources of background information</a>". One Site for each Site category (or type of site) that can not be replaced by Wikipedia and is considered to be the most Important in its category.</p>
<p>The Links are not sizzled into Stone for the ages. Anybody can come and dispute the referred resources or recommend one he believes to be a better one. The Link will be added, replacing the previous for the category If agreed upon. Additions should only happen for new emerging resources in new website categories.</p>
<p><br />
Any Link that gets just added by somebody is considered Spam and any deleted link vandalism.</p>
<p>I personally prefer this Solution.</p>
<p><br />
<b>2. Outsourced Resources that go beyond DMOZ</b></p>
<p>DMOZ is very limited and also very restrictive regarding its content. Affiliate Marketing is commercial in it's very nature, something despised by a lot of activists at DMOZ as well as Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I started Building a quite comprehensive Resource Collection on my Family Homepage regarding this topic. Resources that are not just links to other sites, but things like a Free Google Calendar with Industry Events, Aggregated RSS News Feeds and more.</p>
<p><br />
I am constantly expanding the resources without littering them with secondary or irrelevant stuff. I am eager to hear any recommendations on improving the resources and appreciate any missing resource that gets pointed out to me, especially free resources that are almost as good as their commercial counterpart. In some cases does this free resource simply not exist. I must link to the commercial resource because the overall resources collection would be degraded in quality if I would leave them out.</p>

</ul>
<p><br />
I am also a very active Wikipedian that cares about the content of this article among others and keep it on my watch-list to review the correctness of contributions, revert spam and vandalism. Feel free to check for yourself and visit <a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski">My User Page</a>/<a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski">Talk</a> and check <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cumbrowski_7d15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cumbrowski">My Contributions</a>.</p>
<p>I was <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages"><b>bold</b></a> when I just added the Link to the Article and requested to enter the discussion about the general issue.</p>
<p><br />
The <b>First Reversal</b> was done by <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeli_nk_ed07.html" title="User:Deli nk">User:Deli_nk</a>. I engaged him at <a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDeli_nk_65a9.html#Affiliate_Marketing_Article" title="User talk:Deli nk">his Talk Page</a> and explained myself. <b>He agreed</b> with me and said, that he will not remove the link anymore.</p>
<p><b>Next</b> was <a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">User:JiFish</a> who removed it with the comment "rv linkspam; clearly a commercial site and link placed by the owner of that sit". All stated in the comment was no secret and I also engaged him at his <a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html#Affiliate_Marketing_Link_Info" title="User talk:JiFish">User Page</a>. I did <b>not receive a response yet</b>. I improved my comment when I added the link back and also provided move information at this talk page (previous paragraph).</p>
<p>Shortly after did <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">User:Barrylb</a> came along and removed it for the <b>third time</b>, with the comment "better idea is to discuss first before adding a link to your own site - reverted". Now I also engaged him at his <a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarrylb_04e2.html#Aff.Marketing_Resources_Link.._Objections.3F_Support.3F" title="User talk:Barrylb">User Page</a>. I also did <b>not receive a response</b> yet from this User.</p>
<p>I realized that all this is going nowhere and I added the Templates to the Article and Talk Page. Provided the Background Information and laid out my proposals.</p>

<dd>I do feel that we could relax our attitude towards external links from this article, a little. Links to notable companies like CJ and forums such as ABestWeb should be added, IMO. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 16:57, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thannks Rhobite and I agree with you. I prefer Option 1. myself. I created already Articles here at Wikipedia for the Big Aff. Networks (which still need some work though) to get those covered, but Sites like Forums, News Sources etc. are not as easy. My list of notable sites include: ABestWeb as Forum, affiliateprograms.com as Directory, RevNews as News and Opinion and AffiliateTip as Resource and Research Sites. May be also WebMasterRadio.FM as Radio/Podcast source and Revenue Magazine as Print Magazine. Those are my candidates. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 17:18, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When it comes to Industry events is it a bit more complicated to pick one, because there is not really a single one that can be considered the "most important" where everbody who is serious about this business is going to. I like my Idea of the Public Google Calendar. I believe a link to it <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2Fcalendar%2Ffeeds%2Fu94vpokv36dug4clpgk084ccpo%40group%2Ecalendar%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2Fpublic%2Ffull" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2Fcalendar%2Ffeeds%2Fu94vpokv36dug4clpgk084ccpo%40group%2Ecalendar%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2Fpublic%2Ffull" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> would be useful.

Brad Waller here. As noted above I was invited to the discussion. I can see the conflict in referencing one's own site, and I would say that I am too new to the Wiki cluture to really say what is right here. It would be best if there was a different site that could be referenced, but if the content is still the same, why is is so bad if the site owner earns money from the site? I'm assuming that there would be no objections if the site was some random site with no affiliate links or advertising, but the content was identical. If so, then how much worse is it to reference a "commercial" version with the same valuable content? Just a question, not a position. As for events, at this point AffiliateSummit is the #1 event, with eComXpo #2, and then maybe Ad:Tech. --Bcwaller 22:11, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Brad, thanks for the feedback. I believe option 1 (the leading site per category which wikipedia can not replace) to be more appropriate. Option 2 is nice and good (looked good to me at first at least), but you can already see, that other wikipedians have doubt regarding the intentions (my intentions). I can only guess what anonymous readers of the article might think. People might think for reasons which I perfectly understand that Wikipedias position to provide information from a neutral point of view is in conflict with this. Regarding the Events. I tend to agree with you, but you know how it is with all the network events and also the "hybrid" events that have not only to do with affiliate marketing, like Pubcon or even eTrade, Did you have a look at the public Google Calendar? I think that will be the best solution to cover the Events and Tradeshows. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 09:32, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I doubt there will be any links I would be comfortable including. Due to the nature of the subject any link we include is likely to be spam-like.

<dd>Hi Barry, I understand that you do not like the general concept of Internet Marketing as a whole, but you can not deny the fact, that it exists and that it is a vital part of the Internet today. The Internet became mainstream and mainstream means commercialized. The good thing is, that not all parts are commercialized today and that the original roots are not forgotten nor dead. However, you can not separate the two and pretend that there are two different kinds of Internets. To cover the facts properly and complete, Wikipedia must reference to external sources, that are relevant to the subject and can not be integrated into Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a news site, nor a blog or a forum. It's not a magazine, a how-to resource collection, a radio station or events calendar. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. I am sure you agree with me on that part. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 09:32, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article rebuilt</span></h2>
<p>I was just gone for a few weeks to see the whole article lying in ruins when I came back. Vicious Spam attacks and other things caused over half of the article ending up undeleted. I rebuilt the article to its former self, respected all real content (and template) fixes made since the version I used for the recovery. I also removed all invalid references. The article is still not perfect and the external link issue is still open. I am going to add external links to the most relevant resources (see pervious paragraph) after the comments made regarding this. Everybody seems to be for the addition of a few and most relevant external resources, some are neutral but not against this with exception of Barrylb which seems to be alone in his opinion. This is not about one person so I argue that we should take the step forward and do what is best for the reader (IMO). I will add the Link suggestion here to the talk page first for comments, before I add them to the article itself. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 09:03, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to hear your comments, feedback and opinion on the links and their description before I add them to the article as I already announced one month ago.

<p>This is the list. I will update the article if I don't hear any objections during the next few weeks. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 00:02, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">External Links and References</span></h3>
<p>As per the last months discussions. I added the Yahoo! Dir to the External Links Section. I added the other sites to the "References" section, because I believe that it more appropriate. Those are not just "related sites" links. But source of content found in this article. Directly and indirectly. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 08:19, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Affiliate_Networks" id="Affiliate_Networks"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Affiliate Networks</span></h3>
<p>I noticed that someone added a link to the Amazon Affiliate program. Should it link externally, or to a Wikipedia page? Also, should we move the listings of Affiliate networks to the Affiliate Network page? <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnca_6ceb.html" title="User:Anca">Anca</a> 22:02, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Rule of thumb, if it has an article at Wikipedia, link to the article. Only link to the external site, if you do a citation and reference to the original source. I hope this makes sense. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 10:18, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I removed the Amazon Associate Program. It's not a Network. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 13:42, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
