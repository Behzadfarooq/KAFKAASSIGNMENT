<p>OK, it's hard to keep an even keel sometimes when you try to work with people and they don't bother to look up the basic guidelines of Wikipedia and of WikiProject Comics. Reverting and explaining takes up a lot of time that could be put to better use.</p>
<p>Among other things, the WikiProject Comics <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_exemplars_601d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/exemplars">exemplars</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_editorial_guidelines_5d01.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/editorial guidelines">editorial guidelines</a> give specific, consensus-derived structures for comics-character articles. These prominently include "Publication history" as the first thing after the lead, and ideally for the superherobox "a full-body, three-quarter picture of the character standing straight with no background, with a facing-the-camera or profile picture as the next-best," as opposed to a cover.</p>
<p>And one of my personal bugaboos, simply because it's so easy to do it <i>right</i>, is violating <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATED_d285.html" title="WP:DATED">WP:DATED</a>, which says <b>not</b> to use terms like "recently" and "now" because the general reader <i>won't know <b>when</b> something was written</i> and so who knows when "recently" and "now" even were? Say "in the mid-2000s", or "in 2006 comics", or any of a thousand similar phrases.</p>
<p>Use an encyclopedic tone, not a conversational tone. That's another Wiki guideline.</p>
<p>I could go on, but maybe I should just make this a template message! &#160;:-) &#160; —<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 03:27, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, why does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Awesome_Android_%28comics%29&amp;oldid=91022620" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Awesome_Android_%28comics%29&amp;oldid=91022620" rel="nofollow">this version</a> remove references, put in punctuation errors like hyphens in place of m-dashes, etc., and subheads with no content beneath them?

<li>What happened to meeting people half way? I put back the image of the Android as Andy and revised the text to cover the developements in his personality. I believe the title needs to still reflect that it was the Awesome Android first, and the name change came later, so as not to confuse. There's also a bit of "tell the story" that could probably be culled to one sentence (I'm tough on this as verbosity is rife on Wikipedia). It also looks a tad clunky to be referencing comics in-text when they can be listed at the end. I believe the actual reference can be reduced in size for Wiki.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for the tip about archiving. I was told it was optional.</p>

<li>The backslash separating the names is good, but you've still got a dead link in the artist's name and a chopped off paragraph. Also see my comments above.</li>

<dd>Thanks. Just to reiterate, I didn't touch the article title that reflected Awesome Android first. You unilaterally merged the two articles that way, and I left that choice as it was. As for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki_etiquette.html" title="Wiki etiquette">Wiki etiquette</a>, I never said it was mandatory. I said you'd have more credibility if you adhered to etiquette.

<dl>
<dd>I respect your opinion that listing comics in-text is clunky. Consensus disagrees, however, in that WikiComics Project exemplar and editorial guidelines state that "Publication history" is the section that immediately follows the lead. I respect your right to disagree, and if you want to change this guideline, just go the Comics Project Noticeboard and start a thread to rally consensus toward your position.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm all for streamlining text. Please just respect your fellow editors and do it in chunks rather than wholesale — that makes it easier to see specifically what's being done. And please, I beg you, check your spellling and punctuation. Please stop using hyphens where it needs an m-dash, please spelling "microcomputer" correctly, please stop removing the wikilink from <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_power.html" title="Solar power">solar power</a>, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can tell you I personally used all the References listed. Leave them. Finally, please just make edits and not wholesale reversions. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 05:12, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You know the WikiProject Comics exemplar. Why do you keep reverting <a href="../../../a/w/e/Awesome_Android_5340.html" title="Awesome Android">Awesome Android</a> to a format at odds with it? Reverting stylistically correct changes that several editors have made, in favor of changes that don't follow guidelines?</p>
<p>Together with the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactus.html" title="Galactus">Galactus</a> difficulties you're having, and the way you keep deleting posts [on your own talk page] that bring up important issues about which fellow editors should be aware, I'm really wondering why you stay and cause yourself and others of us so much <i><a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsuris.html" title="Tsuris">tsuris</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/g/i/Agita.html" title="Agita">agita</a></i>.

<p>Please: Let's discuss this before anything escalates even further. You have knowledge and passion for this pop-cultural field, and speaking just for myself, I'd like to see you continue here contributing. Talk to us. Explain the going-against-exemplar thing. Let's work this out together. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 05:02, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, all the information is still there, just in a tidier format. The Publication History isn't necessary for a character with such a brief biography, especially since the references support the text nicely. If it's a major character (eg. our friend Thor) or a team (eg. The Avengers), then a PH is definately mandatory. Many of the other low-appearance types also lack a PH. Good references as end notes seem to be where it's at.</li>

<dl>
<dd>And that's what I and other editors have helped to preserve. I don't believe you're correct in say that "Publication history" isn't necessary for a character with a brief biography. I can't find anything in WikiProject Comics to support that, and I don't see where having less information or inconsistent formatting helps the Project.</dd>

<dd>You have been asked nicely on your talk page to please stop these destructive actions, and why. I'm not going to continue to reiterate the reasons; I'd invite interested parties to read other editors' comments about your continual, and by now vandalistic, reversions, but you make that difficult because you erase all comments — meaning other editors have to tediously click through your Talk-page History. You even did so with my collegial plea on your page, which I'd also posted above on this page. If you revert this article once more, I'm afraid we'll need to take this to the next level.</dd>

<li>Not really. This happens all the time with comic characters. T-1000 was obviously a somewhat obsessed Gladiator fan, while Dcincarnate was very hot for Galactus. I'm not saying you are obsessed, but we all feel a little more passionately about some characters than others. With myself, it's Thor. I could care less that the Deadpool entry is a mess, but want to see the Thor entry be the best it can be. That's why I asked. Not personal or a misunderstanding. We're on the same page.</li>

<dd>While that may be true for you, I know many editors within the Comics WikiProject who spend a lot of time on articles whose subjects they have no interest in whatsoever. I have been working on the articles about pretty minor American actors, teen pop groups, and some FDNY opera singer because the articles needed work. Steve, I know, has been spending much more work on than he had probably planned on a Pittsburgh public school article that he probably saw me working on than he ever had planned, and he lives in the UK. I know Tenebrae also has worked on articles he had no prior interest in. There are many comics characters I really don't care about, but I would like their articles to be good because I have pride in Wikipedia, the WikiProject, and my connection to both. Implying that someone's interest in an article is because of some fanaticism is not assuming good faith, and is not a little insulting. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 20:29, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Inserting a PH on character that has not even had a series of any kind is a tad pointless, given the limited no. of appearances that said character has had, and the complete ABSENCE of a PH on many, many other characters of similar status. The FCB covers everything that was mentioned - with references - quite nicely. Why should this minor character be the exception to the rule?</p>

<dd>Well, considering that a recent issue of She-Hulk detailed his origin (information I added, which was subsequently removed), which included Awesome Andy absorbing his goodness and self-awareness from Thor, I felt it was notable. It's probably those that have a particular preference towards the character, which is why we would expect to see them have a little more detail. As long as we're listing merely facts and established canon, the fact that editors who are fans of the character are adding the most material shouldn't matter that much, should it? <a href="../../../t/o/q/User%7EToquinha_9c53.html" title="User:Toquinha">Toquinha</a> 07:06, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Thor information has been added to the FCB, which is the correct place for it. It is also referenced.</li>

<ul>
<li>The notes on PH at Exemplars applies to characters that have had actual series. Statements such as "what series they've had" and "This section should focus mainly on the comic" prove as much. The AA has never had a series, be it limited or ongoing. A PH, therefore, becomes irrelevant as the FCB and References cover all the necessary ground. Finally, there are hundreds of other comicbook characters listed on Wikipedia that DO NOT feature a PH on their entries as it is simply not applicable. The AA should be no different. On the strength of this alone, there should be no more reverts.</li>

<dd>The exemplars may need to be re-worded, then. Publication history is at least as important as fictional character history with all comics characters.

<li>To really hit home the point, does the villain the Radioactive Man, who also appeared in June of 1963 have a PH? No, because the FCB covers his scattered appearances over the years nicely. The RM has never had a title of his own.</li>

<p>Okay, the page is protected until this low level edit war over the publication history section is sorted out, following the dispute resolution process. Generate discussion and build a consensus. One point I want to address above: The guidance at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_exemplars_601d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/exemplars">Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/exemplars</a> does not specifically apply only to characters who have only had their own series.

When one is demonstrated around either position I will unprotect the page. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 16:10, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sorry, but you are being melodramatic. You also made an ultimatum, which I didn't care for and subsequently removed (something that CovenantD also does. A fact which you have now blown out of proportion). You have also brought this over from your Talk page, which is inappropriate. I'd like you to now stop and focus on the issue at hand.

<p>Steve, I have presented my reasons above. It makes little sense for one sole entry to have a PH when hundreds of other character entries do not (what about all the other characters that appeared in the same month and year?). I also interpreted the Exemplars passage as referring to those characters that have <i>at least</i> had a mini-series. In the case of the AA, everything in the PH is covered and referenced in the FCB and References. A reference to the "team" Heavy Metal (it was a very loose association) can also be made in this section, which would then remove the need for the PH, which is out of place and does not flow. In short, I believe the PH here to be superfluous for no other reason than consistency - which is one of the fundamentals of Wikipedia.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>: I'm looking at this article and debate for the first time so forgive me if I'm missing nuances in the development process of this article that is not mentioned in this discussion. I would say that there is certainly some grey area here regarding inclusion of the publication history section as <a href="../../../a/s/g/User%7EAsgardian_37db.html" title="User:Asgardian">Asgardian</a> has pointed out, as this character has been a minor and rarely used one. Even taking into account <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_exemplars_601d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/exemplars">exemplars</a> (and leaving aside that those are guidelines, not rules), there's clearly an argument that the 'spirit of the law' of those exemplar suggestions do not make a pub. history mandatory, since that guideline specifies the section is to be focused on "the comic, not the character" and in this case, there really is no one specific "comic" that is being referenced (instead being a random collection of comics with generally brief appearances).</p>
<p>Given all of that I would say to err on the side of inclusion of a publication history mostly BECAUSE this is a minor and occassional character. In other words, the recitation of the occassional appearances of Awesome Android over the past 35 years would demonstrate to the casual reader the limited significance of the character, and better conform to writing about a fiction character from an out-of-world perspective. Short articles in which the majority of the text is character biography suffer from not making clear the relative significance of the character to first time readers, so should be avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>If put to a straw poll, I would therefore suggest <b>Weak Keep</b> on the publication history, and mention to both Asgardian and Tenebrae that you both seem to have decent and justifiable arguments for your respective points of view, so please don't get in the mindset of "I'm right, he's wrong" (not that either of you seems to have been particularly uncivil or anything). This appears to be more of a judgement call than a strong mandate in either direction.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents in the hope it helps build consensus, and apologies for wordiness - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 13:13, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> on the publication history. I believe the spirit of "the comic, not the character" is to fight a problem that plagues comic-related articles on Wikipedia: They should be written as <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">histories of publications</a>, and not as biographies treating these characters as real people. My reading of this article sees the publication history as the most informative section of the article, identifying the era this character was created in, and the important appearences thereafter. As someone with a background in studying literature, I'm somewhat of a purist in regard to this issue, and believe that even "Fictional character biography" sections should be written with publication issues fully referenced and the prose written with critical distance, focusing on creators, publication years, and historical perspective, not on biography. I feel that eliminating the publication history section of this article seriously degrades its quality, eliminating pertinent information, and setting a tone that aids in <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html#Check_your_fiction" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">clarity</a> that the character is fiction. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 22:02, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">User:ChrisGriswold</a> has pointed out, real-world facts are more important than fictional facts, which are highly changeable. The very fact that this character has made few appearances makes a roadmap of them all the more important. Otherwise, for anyone interested, be it a fan or a comics historian, it'd be like trying to find a needle in a haystack. And a pub. hist. section provides perspective and context that a list could not.--<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 22:28, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>CS - when you say that the removal of a PH would seriously degrade the article, I'm guessing you are speaking in general terms as in the case of the AA it is not very well written (how is what a character did to the AA relevant to the PH? That is an <i>event</i> and a matter for the FCB).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The inclusion of a PH would be setting a problematic precendent as by that logic ALL the entries would require such a header for the sake of consistency (just like the FCB). This is something of a stretch when many characters - such as the AA - have not even had a mini-series. Also, the PH would also have to be strictly monitored to ensure that it did not clash with the FCB (as it does in the case of the AA), which is the narrative that deals with <i>events.</i> A PH for characters with series (past or present) deals with appearances and NOT events. The next question would then be what role the Reference section then plays, which has always been adequate for citing appearances. There would be unnecessary duplication of information. It isn't feasible to have a PH, FBC and Reference section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short, I believe that this is not a case of "light tinkering" and the debate needs to be moved to a wider forum as there are larger consequences for the overall entry format. <a href="../../../a/s/g/User%7EAsgardian_37db.html" title="User:Asgardian">Asgardian</a> 22:53, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that there are many areas in which this article requires a lot of work. However, I don't believe that this reason to eliminate the publication history section. Additionally, if other articles fail to achieve critical distance and "out-of-universe" perspective, then I believe that is cause to improve those articles, not to make mistakes here for the sake of consistency. I also think that it is perfectly acceptable to discuss this here, as this is the article in question. If the issue needs to be raised more broadly elsewhere, go ahead, but there is no reason to abandon the discussion about this article when there is a specific item up for debate.</dd>
<dd>I see where you are coming from, however. Your stance is that "publication history" is a term which applies only to magazine titles. I (and others) disagree, and feel that "publication history" applies to any fictional character which appears in serial publications.</dd>
<dd>Your position would make sense to me if the changes you are proposing did not result in the elimination of the information in the publication history section, and put a "biography" in its stead. The footnotes in the biography section do cite which issues the character appeared in, however this needs to be expressed inline as well. Doing so elevates the tone of the article from a fan-constructed chronology to a more professional and encyclopedic history. Suffice to say: these articles should not be "narrative[s] that [deal] with events", as you put it. These are not <i>events</i> -- they are fantasies and fiction, and should be approached as fantasies and fiction. The only <i>events</i> and the actions of the creators and publishers. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 23:21, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CS - On your last point, while the entries are obviously about fictitious characters, they exist within an established universe (which Wikipedia acknowledges) in which time passes (albeit not at a normal rate). Each character has had experiences which have served to shape them and make them more three-dimensional - something that definately holds true in the angst-driven Marvel Universe. Yes, Spiderman is fictional - as is the universe he occupies - but the deaths of his Uncle Ben and later still Gwen Stacy are significant <i>events</i> within his life, even if it a fictional one. This is a point made by writers time and time again. This is also something that the FCB achieves - it tracks the fictional events within the context of the fictional character's life. This holds true in every comic character entry on Wikipedia.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you study my version of the entry for AA, you can see that a PH isn't really necessary as all the vital information is still present in the FBC and is also sourced to the References. I don't believe there is a need for a third section that simply rehashes what the other two sections have acheived. The entries then become cluttered and then may well start to look like they are fan site entries. That is something I want to avoid. Maintaining the integrity of the FCB on many character entries is difficult enough. I truly believe that this has the potential to become a fiasco if adopted on a widespread scale. There are dozens and dozens of entries that are already far too long. Adding another section - with information that is already presented in other sections - will only exascerbate matters.</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I see absolutely no problem in having a publication history for minor characters. Just because some other articles on minor comics characters don't have publication histories is not a valid argument for its removal from this one. Rather, publication histories ought to be added to those articles. That said, in this particular case, I think that the PH section could be improved. There really isn't much in it that couldn't be combined with the "Fictional Character Biography" section. What is lacking and what would help to differentiate these sections is real world information regarding the authors who have shaped the character and changed him over the years. By providing this "out of universe" perspective (or, as Asgardian likes to say, less "tell the story" perspective), the PH section would justify its existence. --GentlemanGhost 00:23, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks GG. <i>If</i> a PH was to be included, it would in the case of the AA have to rewritten and presented in a clinical fashion, as at present it is a weaker version of the FCB. This would be the biggest hurdle - unnecessary replication of the same information.</li>

<li>Asgardian, you write "<i>If</i> a PH was to be included". Are you suggesting that there is currently no consensus to keep the publication history. I believe that such a consensus has indeed been demonstrated. In fact, I think you are the only person involved in this debate who wishes to see it removed. I'm going to remove the protection and suggest people keep an eye on the article to ensure the consensus is respected.

<li>Yes, I did say "if" as a final decision had not been made. Since the consensus has gone with a PH, so be it. I do, however, stand by the fact that the PH will need to be rewritten. Assuming I'm just going revert, however, shows a lack of good faith.</li>
