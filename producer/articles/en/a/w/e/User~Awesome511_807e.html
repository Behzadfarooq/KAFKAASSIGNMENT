	    <p>My name is g dubs and I created this page through my own time, so people who know me, don't make fun of this article because I somewhat put effort into it.</p>
<p>I am most famous for my irrelevant stories, and some are at the bottom of the page and will be updated from time to time. I am also pretty good at apeaking german, I mean I am in level 3 honors and I have the highest grade in the class.</p>
<p>I mostly get fun of by my friends in school for overachieving, but I find that necessary so I can actually go to college. Also because of my sweet video gaming skills, even though my xbox 360 is broken right now. I mean I used to really own at Halo 2, but now that I have a 360 (even though it's broken) I hardly ever play Halo 2 anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, so my freshmen school year was pretty sweet because I never had any homework. It is still the first making period of the school year and I get so much shit from my teachers that I have already had more homework this year than my freshmen year. I hope my senior year is like my brothers where I have three study halls a day. i mean, I don't even cur if people tell me that it's boring because it is better than writing fuckin essays every night for every damn class.</p>
<p>A Biography of G dubs</p>
<p>So I am going to start at 1st grade, when I had an awesome life of no homework or anything. All of my elementary school years were like that except for a couple of projects so I am going to skip the rest of my elementary school career. So in middle school things started to actually get tough because I had a retarded english teacher (anyone who went to my school should know who that is, what you don't know? That bitch who always bitched at my class because she was a bitch, seriously you don't remember? Ok, she was next to mr. cam's room. Are you serious? If you still don't know who I am talking tell me at school that you didn't know so I can kick your ass.) Anyway, that was about 6th grade. Later I had science class with a bitch ( why is it that every year I have a bitch for a teacher?) WARNING: IRRELEVANT STORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Amiable!!and!!sociable!!!!! So one time I didn't do this gay worksheet about some stupid crap and she got right up in my face and I was aboout to say, "bitch get yo ugly face outta my grill" but luckily I can control myself (Unlike someone who threw a freshmen on the ground and caused our table to split up because he is a gaybull.) And that is the end of that. So later in my 7th grade year (the same year) This retard for a teacher makes us build a catapult, and I had to use different machines or something. So this gay catapult has to launch stuff at least 3 feet, my catapult would have gone that far but my partner didn't pull it back far enough, it could have made it. WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?????????????????????????????????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT COULD HAVE MADE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But moving on, nothing happened in 8th grade, and nothing happened in 9 th grade, except for me and my friend listening to the famous famous song "drop it like it's hot" by snoop dogg (don't sue). Then 10th grade started, since I got a job over the summer this school year is even tougher balancing out the two. So I have a retarded western world teacher who gives us essays everyday and it really pisses me off. That is about it, and if you want the biography to still be good don't tell any of the teachers this.(Stick it to man)</p>
<p>Irrelevant stories</p>
<p>So one time I was playing dodgeball, and I threw the ball and it got caught, and I was all like dammit. Another time during gym class I was playing handball, and evan pegged jazz in the face and I was thinking "aw yeah evan" Then even thought the ball is soft and it only grazed her head, she threw her uniform pinny thing off and walked off the court. And I made fun of her for it because she is in 11th grade and she is in a 10th grade health and gym class. Yeah, and another time I was chillin at home and I was watching TV I wish that I could patent the phrases "amiable and sociable", "I'm a gangsta, but chall knew dat", and "I'm awesome", because anytime that someone said that they would have to pay me, and that would be awesome (I have to pay myself) so I would never have to work.<strong class="selflink">Awesome511</strong> 21:06, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
