	    <p><b>ADAM PARONS</b></p>
<p>Alas sadly enough, words cannot express how fabulous he is, for his looks are beyond that of verbal description. With his beautifully sculpted cheekbones, and irresistible eyes, these are meager pennies in what truly is his fantastic physique. Imagine the beautiful god Apollo, with his glistening muscles, and beautifully tinted skin. Everything about him is just perfect. He is the embodiment of the perfect being. Now see if you can picture something a thousand times better than that, and your not even close to how good-looking he is. Every moment he makes, is as if the sun angles itself just right, just for him, to show the gleam off his muscular body.</p>
<p>You may think its insanely buff, like those greased up animals on WWE, but sadly you are mistaken. His fabulous body, is in supreme physical condition, without all the cumbersome muscles, that prevent proper movement. Ooh no, as visible as they are, they do not impede his perfect movement. The grace, the agility, the comfort, security, and confidence, in every move that he makes. They say god created man in his own image, sure he may have spent ten seconds on you, but for him, he sculpted him from more than just his image. It was from his imagination of what the perfect being would look like. Even just a swift glance of the tiniest of his toes, would send you head over heels in awe of him. Just the reflection of the sun in his eyes, shows you an Eden you've never even dreamed of. The very thought of him, makes you melt in your chair, in a thrilling orgasmic mental climax. His lips are soft and subtle, if you kiss them, it almost like a quick taste of heaven. You feel the softness of the clouds amongst your lips, and the scourge of heavenly souls burning through out your body, in a giant flash of warmth that covers you from the back of your tingling neck to the tips of your ticklish toes. The words that pass through these lips are marked with a distinct, and breathtaking voice. The sort of kind that brings out your utmost desires, and dangles them in front of your face.</p>
<p>Brad Pitt, or any modern visual sensation, is nothing compared to his gorgeous looks, and sexual charm. So toss away your chastity belts, and divulge yourself, before this floundering fluorescence of flesh and blood. He will not take any of you, for no one is worthy enough to touch his firm, yet soft skin. If he could clone himself, only his clone would be good enough to touch him. He'd be able to touch his angelic like hair. He'd be able to caress the waves as it blows ever so gently in the wind. Remember this is his clone, and if so possible in all aspects trying to keep this as heterosexual as possible, let’s assume the scientists who cloned him, were nice enough to make his clone have an extra x chromosome instead of a y. For those simple people who do not have his fantastic brain capacity, that means, female. His clone is female. This would make him ponder would having sex with his female clone, be considered incest, or masturbation. In theory he’s having sex with himself, but isn’t he part of his own family. Anyhoo, getting back on topic on how fantastic his looks are... Just imagine the sunset on a warm tropical beach with the breezy waves crashing against the pearly sands, with footprints to show his passing through. The sensual shape of his feet, and the erotic cuteness of his perfect ears, remind you of something you can never have, and makes you lust for it even more. Every time he looks in the mirror, he reaches out to touch his reflection. But each time he tries, it hits the glass. A sense of failure fills him as he wonders what would happen if he waited a second longer. Would the glass still be there? Would he be able to touch the beauty on the other side?..............</p>
