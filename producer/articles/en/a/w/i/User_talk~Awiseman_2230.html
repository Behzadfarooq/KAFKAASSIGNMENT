<li><i>Hey, I saw you deleted my changes to the Weezer-<a href="../../../m/a/k/Make_Believe_e319.html" title="Make Believe">Make Believe</a> article. I really think it's fair to say it was released to mixed reviews by both fans (especially older ones) and critics - I have seen some very negative reviews, and some older Weezer fans I know hate it, but some positive ones too. I mean, that Metacritic site which I had mentioned averages all of the reviews as a 49 out of 100, that's very middle of the road. It got 4 stars from Rolling stone, but you can't discount bad reviews just because you like Weezer or the album. <a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">Awiseman</a></i></li>
</ul>
<p>Put those review links in the info box then. It clutters up the main text if you put them there. I agree, clearly the album has gotten mixed reviews. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetSounds_8a7e.html" title="User:PetSounds">PetSounds</a> 7 July 2005 21:08 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I'm not an expert by any means, but my understanding is that one cannot take an image from a website and upload it to Wikipedia unless (1) you are the copyright holder, (2) you have the copyright holder's permission, or (3) the image is in the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Wikipedia%7EPublic_domain_image_resources_64e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Public domain image resources">public domain</a>. — <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFingers-of-Pyrex_f88b.html" title="User:Fingers-of-Pyrex">Fingers-of-Pyrex</a> July 8, 2005 13:00 (UTC)</p>

<p>I apologize for what I do. But there is a greek-political intention by adding greek names to turkish cities. Meanwhile neither greek wikipedian allows the oppositive, I mean adding turkish names to greek cities.

<p>Hey - saw your comments (I monitor user Shup's page). Unfortunately, he has a habit of not responding/not listening to people.

<p>I wanted to point out that you have made a few mistakes in your recent edits to the Braveheart article, and I was hoping that we could square out these mistakes so they don't re-occur.</p>
<ol>
<li>. The narration at the beginning of the movie is by Angus McFayden as the Bruce. The narration at the end is that of Mel Gibson as Wallace. I even checked because it came up once before in the editing process. Perhaps you could revert our own edit, so I don't have to.</li>
<li>. The Themes section was included because it needs to be populated eventually. It was added by mistake, but I think it should stay in, so as to encourage readers to contribute. I don't see a problem with maintaining its presence, because it needs to be filled in order to get this article up to GA and FA level.</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe you could give me your thoughts on this.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 05:51, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I get your point about an empty header attracting vandalism, but I think we can simply revert it when it arrives. I'm of two minds on it, so I guess we can leave it out for now.</dd>
<dd>However, the plot point doesn't necessarily need direct citation, as it is simply relating the story. As it isn't original research to simply sya who said what, I think it should remain the way it was before your edit. Will you change it back?<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 06:51, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, first read <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> to make sure you're following that policy. Hopefully the sources you are citing are reliable enough. To quote from the "Reliable sources" of the policy page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not all widely read newspapers and magazines are equally reliable. There are some magazines and newspapers that print gossip much of which is false. While such information may be titillating, that does not mean it has a place here. Before repeating such gossip, ask yourself if the information is presented as being true, if the source is reliable, and if the information, even if true, is relevant to an encyclopaedic article on that subject. When these magazines print information they suspect is untrue, they often include <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel phrases</a>. Look out for these. If the magazine doesn't think the story is true, then why should we?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, in response to Ksp16's remark "information not from primary source", you might want to point him/her to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which says, "Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources wherever possible."

<p>I suggest that you edit your Werdnabot invocation and remove the hyphens in the file names. Also move the files from their present names (which you can reach by clicking on the blue links in the edit summaries in your revision history) to names without the hyphens. By the way, Werdnabot does not create pointers to archive files (other than the current one).

<p>Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Thank you for your contributions.</p>
<p>Currently, you are editing without a username. You can continue to do so, as you are not required to log in to Wikipedia to read and edit articles; however, logging in will result in a username being shown instead of your IP address (yours is 67.162.76.82). Logging in does not require any personal details, and there are many other benefits for logging in.</p>
<p>When you edit pages:</p>
<p>Please respect others' copyrights; do not copy and paste the contents from webpages directly. Please use a neutral point of view when editing articles; this is possibly the most important Wikipedia policy. If you are testing, please use the Sandbox to do so. Do not add unreasonable contents into any articles, such as copyrighted text, advertisement messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Adding such content or editing articles maliciously is considered vandalism. The Wikipedia Tutorial is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia. For now, if you are stuck, you can click the edit this page tab above, type {{<a href="../../../h/e/l/Template%7EHelpme_09e4.html" title="Template:Helpme">helpme</a>}} in the edit box, and then click Save Page; an experienced Wikipedian will be around shortly to answer any questions you may have.

<p>AW, the article is about Ataturks life in a factual historical context. It is about the things he had done in his life. Not about what Kurds think of him.</p>
<p>Let's take Coca-Cola for example, a completely benign subject. If someone said "Pepsi lover's critique Coke for being too acidic" (source:Pepsi lovers magazine)" would you consider that part of the history of Coke or part of the history of Pepsi lovers? It certainly is an opinion, that could only be the history of a Pepsi lover because Coke has nothing to with their taste or aspirations of how a cola should be. (sorry for the silly analogy but you get the point I hope). Furthermore, this maybe a fact (it's a fact that someone had this critique of coke), but it's not an historical event, a historical fact, nor is it NPOV.</p>
<p>Now if you apply this to Kurdish "criticizms", then you would get the same outcome. It's all a matter of taste. And there a millions critiques of Ataturks out there, some being offensive to Kurds. Shall we include those as well?</p>
<p>Not to mention, which Kurds criticized? When did they do this? How many are there? What are their credentials? So you also have a credibility problem here.</p>
<p>Moreover, your sources can't possibly speak for all Kurds. I would be surprised if you could dispute that FACT.</p>
<p>Finally, it is inflammatory and controversial. Yet, you seem to want it in there really badly for some reason which would lead <b>people to "criticize" you</b>, and come to the conclusion you are not working with the best of intentions here. Correct me if I am wrong. --<a href="../../../o/g/u/User%7EOguz1_ed78.html" title="User:Oguz1">Oguz1</a> 18:59, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

The fact that somebody thinks something is inflammatory is no reason not to keep something in. And I would argue those criticisms aren't inflammatory anyway. People disagree all the time!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And in any case, that section has historical facts. It says there were Kurdish revolts. I think you're only disagreeing with the frsit sentence, "<a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_people.html" title="Kurdish people">Kurds</a> criticize Atatürk for disregarding their cultural distinctions in pursuing a Turkish national identity."

<dd>Thanks for removing the critique. However this one: "On 8 December 1925, the Turkish Ministry of Education issued an order banning the use of ethnic terms such as Kurd, Circassian, Laz, Kurdistan and Lazistan." is not sourced. Should find a source and also explain that the Minister of Education's ban only applies to Public Schools. Something like "On 8 December 1925, the Turkish Ministry of Education issued an order banning the use of ethnic terms such as Kurd, Circassian, Laz, Kurdistan and Lazistan <b>in public school curricula</b>". That'll keep it short and save me from inserting counter-claims and explnations.

<p>AW, it's both impossible and needless to cite a source to state that "'Leon' is not a common Portuguese name". You just have to know Portuguese or Portugal to know that.

<p>I have joined WikiProject Tennessee, and have started stub articles on buildings and communities in East Tennessee. My question regards referencing sources for my articles. I am the only source for the Mabry Hood House article - I cannot find anything online about it. I hated to see an old ante-bellum home get torn down, and not have any history online - so I wrote what I recalled from driving by it on multiple occasions. Will this be deleted due to a lack of sources? An architect who lived in Tennessee should be a credible source for an article on a historic home - unless the lack of a link is going to get it deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/a/x/User%7EBaxterguy_f0dc.html" title="User:Baxterguy">Baxterguy</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/x/User_talk%7EBaxterguy_4900.html" title="User talk:Baxterguy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Baxterguy_7436.html" title="Special:Contributions/Baxterguy">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Hi Baxterguy. Thanks for joining and starting those articles. While I'm sure you know about the building, you do need a reliable outside source, like a website or even a pamphlet or interview with somebody. Maybe you can talk to someone there or with the East TN Historical Society? I found <a href="http://www.knoxcotn.org/bibliography/index.html#HISTORICAL%20SITES:" class="external text" title="http://www.knoxcotn.org/bibliography/index.html#HISTORICAL%20SITES:" rel="nofollow">this bibliography</a>, that might help, or maybe some more general book about east TN history. Here are Wikipedia's guidelines for reliable sources - <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html#Reliable_sources" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution#Reliable_sources</a>. However, if we're lucky, the article will stay up for long enough to add some sources. --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">AW</a> 22:08, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks. As an architect born in Tennessee, I am a credible source. However, I prefer not to log my college transcript under the reference section of the post. I will look for a credible reference on that ante bellum home - maybe the highway engineer's bulldozer operator took some pics for sentimental purposes before tearing it down? I'm a rookie at this, so hopefully I can get some input from others as I stumble through the Wiki learning curve. --<a href="../../../b/a/x/User%7EBaxterguy_f0dc.html" title="User:Baxterguy">Baxterguy</a> 13:23, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Baxterguy. This discussion helps explain to me why I was not previously aware of the existence of the Mabry Hood House. I would think that TDOT (in Nashville) and/or the Tennessee Historical Commission (also in Nashville) would have documentation of an historically and/or architecturally significant house that was torn down to make way for a state-funded road. I think that the original part of <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pellissippi_Parkway_7ef7.html" title="Pellissippi Parkway">Pellissippi Parkway</a> was built after the National Historic Preservation Act was in effect (that was in place when I first moved to this area, so I'm not sure when it was built, and I can't find the info on the web) and I <b>know</b> that the segment from I-40 to Alcoa Highway was subject to the NHPA (because I lived here then), so there should have been documentation requirements. (When was the house torn down?)--<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 13:55, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The house was still standing in the early 1980's. It was not occupied, but there was a trailer to the west of it for years. I assumed someone was doing a slow renovation, based on the trailer. (The house sat several lots west of Cokesbury Methodist, on the same side of the pike.) I remember being disturbed when I found out about the route for the parkway. I have found a topo map online that shows the old Mabry Hood Road, with a black dot where the plantation house would have stood. The link is: <a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=35.9077&amp;lon=-84.11824&amp;datum=nad27&amp;u=4&amp;layer=DRG&amp;size=m&amp;s=48" class="external free" title="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=35.9077&amp;lon=-84.11824&amp;datum=nad27&amp;u=4&amp;layer=DRG&amp;size=m&amp;s=48" rel="nofollow">http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=35.9077&amp;lon=-84.11824&amp;datum=nad27&amp;u=4&amp;layer=DRG&amp;size=m&amp;s=48</a> I may call the other Mabry House in Knoxville (now a museum), and see if they know anything. It was a traditional, 2-story brick southern home, except for the wood siding behind the front porch (which looked odd to me). It was not as grand as most (probably a good example of the antebellum homes on the upper Mississippi that Mark Twain made fun of in "Life on the Mississippi"). And it sat closer to grade than Baker Peters - but the elevation of Kingston Pike could have been raised since it was constructed.

<p>I wanted to point out that Brian Cox was actually in the film; you had removed his name from the cast, i think. As well, you removed the Historical inaccuracy section <i>en toto</i>. I was actually waiting for the various inaccuracies (seen on the Discussion page) to be cited. The ones on the page have been, and will converted from bullet pointed text to prose, once a fair time has passed for citation of the remaining supposed inaccuracies. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 18:27, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am, in fact, cognizant of the guidelines. A trivia section is to be avoided because "as articles grow, these lists become increasingly disorganized and difficult to read." The list for my alma mater is neither long nor difficult to read.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the guidance in the <i>Avoid trivia sections</i> guidelines is: "Whenever you see a 'trivia section,' take a look at each fact and consider how you might integrate it into the larger text, whether by inserting it into a section, adding a new section, or creating a more targeted list of closely-related items...<b>don't simply remove it, but seek to minimize it.</b></p>
<p>It concludes with: "<b>Once a trivia section is empty</b>, it should be removed, but where such a section is re-added with new content, the integration process should begin again."</p>
<p>The information included in the list is interesting, relevant, and inobtrusive. You should engage in discussion seeking consensus to remove an entire section from an article. If you can better the article, integrate information, or be constructive, by all means, continue to do so. 67.101.243.74 22:28, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One of the main rules of Wikipedia is be bold, which is what I was doing. Both myself and <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrickneil_a049.html" title="User:Patrickneil">User:Patrickneil</a> integrated most of the useful trivia, not just erase it - the section "Quadrangles" has the part about George Washington. The part about John Carroll is really not that important to the article, and it's in his article already. And the part about six shirts is meaningless and does nothing for the article. It's merely an interesting factoid which has nothing to do with anything else. --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">AW</a> 13:57, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's fine, but your first edit summary only said "rv album cover as display", which to me wasn't a good reason to remove it, which is why I reverted. As for the usage elsewhere in the article, the copyright box says it can be used "solely to illustrate the audio recording in question," and it seems like it's being used that way. --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">AW</a> 20:05, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't see any factual evidence to affiliate him to a religion. Until cited with strong sources, I think the category should be removed. If you research you will see that, he was also named to be Jewish.

<p>Hi. Thanks for your note on my talk page recommending that I place warnings on user talk pages whenever I revert vandalism. I do that from time-to-time, when the vandalism is particularly egregious, however I don't always take the time to do it as the manual process is fairly cumbersome. I have applied to use some of the tools like VP that automate the process, but so far have been declined since I'm relatively new, and don't have enough mainpage edits. I suppose they have to use some kind of criteria to decide if folks like me are working in good faith. Anyway, once I get it automated, I'll do a better job of dotting those "i's and crossing those "t's." Again, thanks for your suggestion. <a href="../../../c/m/i/User%7ECmichael_2765.html" title="User:Cmichael">Cmichael</a> 04:39, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
