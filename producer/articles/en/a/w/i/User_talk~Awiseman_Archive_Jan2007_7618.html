<p>I don't really have a lot of money to spend on cds so I can't really answer your questions on its position or on Volume One. Nor am I from DC. But I do know something about music. The fact that it and Volume I are the only things that Tower Records brings up at Search:go go means something to me. If it turns out that it isn't an important go go record then the article should be changed. ------- Go go is unerrepresented on the Wikipedia and I assume the music industry professionals who buy records for Tower know what they are doing. Tell me I'm not wrong. --<a href="../../../m/c/t/User%7EMcTrixie_e744.html" title="User:McTrixie">McTrixie</a> 20:19, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually I changed "influential" to "early", it's a good edit. But I am pretty sure this record qualifies as influential, esp. outside of DC, and when I read some documentation I will try to return to prop up the article.

<dd>Just one comment - I worked at Tower for a while, and I can't quite find a delicate way of phrasing the state of their catalogue. I'm not a huge listener of Go Go (beyond Chuck Brown), but I did work in one of the few stores with an actual "Go Go" section, featuring all of ten CDs. A lot of Go Go music would probably be catalogued as Hiphop, Reggae, or Pop/Rock, since these sections are (were) included in pretty much every Tower Records store. --Gigantic Killerdong 18:16, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He sings one song wit the monseiur riders (some french rapper group). I forget what it is called. But at the beginning he is clearly heard speaking fluent french. So we know he knows french. the wolof i doubt because it is more of a spoken language in gambia. And he is from dakar....which is metropolitan. Wolof would be more of a village sort of thing from my understanding. So lets just stick with french nowww.<br />

<p>I am not trying to be rude or anything, but i just came back to Wiki after a leave of a month because of i was getting tired ot POV pushing. Sorry if you took it that way, i was not trying to be rude. But you should also know that there is a lot of hot rhetoric flying in some articles, and unless you belong to an ethnicity concerned, it might be hard to understand why.&#160;:)) Back to the sections in question. That's exactly the problem: what are you trying to balance in the first place?? It is a bio article, not the article about the armenian genocide or some other article. There is no rule that every info has to be mentioned in every article, meaning that the addition has to be relevant to ATATURK, not something else. Did u see what I wrote on the talk page??? "He would be behind bars today for things he said back than"???? How is that relevant to Ataturk?? That is a criticisim (misplaced btw) of Turkey TODAY. Sourced doesn't cut it, I am sorry. It has to be balanced, true, but that's only if what we are discussing is relevant in the first place. You see what I mean? I have been absent for a while, so if you have been really acting in good faith, i appreciate it, but I still think that that addition in its current state is a joke coz it is not relevant. Please, don't ask me to explain why, if you are not from the Eastern Mediterranean, you wouldn't understand, sadly&#160;:))))) cheers! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:50, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many people on the talk have said that article is overly positive - there are almost no criticisms. How is it relavent to Ataturk? It's things people said he did and didn't do. That's about him. And anyway, you completely missed the point of that quote! They were saying that he said the Armenian deaths were bad, which if he said that today would be illegal in Turkey. Furthermore, saying "you wouldn't understand because you're not from there" is completely against the ideals of Wikipedia. So only people from New York can edit the New York article? Only people who are professional soccer players can edit article about soccer? That makes no sense whatsoever. --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">AW</a> 21:57, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look man, you took too seriously my poor attempt at humor I think. I was just trying to say that if u are not from the Eastern Mediterranean, the underlying reasons of the dispute might be hard to fathom. It is true for every local and ethnic disagreement in the world. Have some sense of humor dude&#160;:)) On the other hand, there is some truth to this, since I cannot go to an article about one of NY's districts and pretend to know what a seemingly small dispute is about a local sports club.. That's all what I was trying to say. Just as an advice, before saying that something doesn't make sense, try to see if you were able to understand the humor or etc behind it.&#160;:)) cheers <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 02:24, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the response. Maybe my math is wrong or I don't understand the rule, but when I look at it, there are never more than 3 reverts of the section in a 24 hour period. Maybe 6 over two days is too many, but I tried to follow that 3 in 24 rule, and after the 3rd I stopped until the next day. I guess the discussion got to me, as the other users were calling my edits a joke and ridiculous and such, but I should have remained calm and stopped after the first 3. I do appreciate you checking about A.Garnet however. Also, is there supposed to be a warning or something? I would have stopped if somebody had said "your edits are bordering on edit warring, if you do not stop you'll be blocked." This is my first block, it's new to me. --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">AW</a> 17:20, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The 3-revert rule says that if you revert more than three times in 24 hours, you should be blocked. It doesn't say that if you revert less than that, it's okay. As a matter of fact, it's very clearly NOT okay, and the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> page does explicitly address people trying to "just barely" follow the 3RR.

<p>I've always wondered why an article about a political figure of the past has no criticism in it... It is so sad, as if people who took part in wars and were politically active (id est 'liars') are portrayed as if they "lived a peacefull and sinless" life! i agree with u in the inclusion of these facts and i have reverted the article. on the other hand, i sense that the turkish users will do everything they can to remove sourced and balanced info they do not like... Maybe admins and more people with good knowledge of history and (preferably, for obvious reasons) non-Greeks, non-Armenians, non-Kurds, non...-non(?) should take a look at the article.

<dl>
<dd>What i dont understand AW, is that in believing the article needs to be more critical, why you would take it upon yourself to devote a section to the most extreme and unfounded criticism possible. Whats more, a criticism that is not even included in the main articles to which you refer to, and furthermore a criticism that rests on giving a degree of legitimacy to the Pontian Greek genocide article which itself is still in dispute. If there is to be any criticism of Ataturk, it would be his policy on Islam and the Kurds, these are the most verifiable criticisms seen throughout his biographys and countless articles on the influence of his policy on Turkey today. But yet you chose to pander to the most extreme allegations made possible against a man, that he was responsible for a genocide.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your section doesnt even have any substance to it, it is just a recount of extreme allegations made against him i.e. "Greeks say this, Armenians say this, Turks say this". On the one hand you say he is accused of being responsbile for a genocide, on the other you say there may have been no genocide, and on the other that he would placed in jail for criticising the gneocide. It makes no sense, it is to me just an effort to appease the most extreme views against Ataturk. You say you have no view on the events, but obviously you have some view if you see it fit to include such a section, even before the most commonn criticisms which refer to his policy on Kurds and Islam. I dont mean to be aggresive in my attitude AW, i am just surpised a supposed impartial user would jump in at the deep end and create a such a controversial section without consulting anyone. And whats more, rather than try to reach an understanding, you inform someone (Hectorian) who you know will be sympathetic to your edit so he can carry on reverting it. Anyway, i hope we will sort this out somehow. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 16:19, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're kidding right? It's neither extreme nor unfounded, the allegations and arguments against them appear in magazines and all over the internet. If I were a biased editor, as you suggest, I wouldn't have put in the other side of the argument, which I did - both Turkish and German sources, which say he spoke out against the Armenian genocide. It's a balanced, sourced section! And furthermore, I asked <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> to look at it too who seems to be pretty knowledgable and neutral on this sort of thing.

<dd>Firstly, you have no source implicating him in the a genocide of Pontians, no doubt since there are barely any credible sources which talk of a Pontian "genocide" at all. Second, your source for his role in the Armenian genocide comes form the Armenian National Institute, third, we will talk about those criticisms (which as a matter of fact i have added before to the article) when you agree that this section is completely unnaceptable, not because of some Turkish pride which i'm sure is what you believe, but because it is a misrepresentaion of academic opinion surrounding Ataturk. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 21:00, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just a comment cause my name was mentioned above: many users left me messanges about recent changes, so it is unfair for anyone to accuse Awiseman for also having done this. apropos, even if he had not left me a notice, i would have seen the new section and i would not have behaved elsehow. in addition, it is only natural to have a criticism section for a political figure, and thus i cannot understand what the whole mess is about (or i can, but i do not want to think that this is <i>because of some Turkish pride</i>). since we are talking about criticism in general, and since A.Garnet talked about the Pontian Genocide, which is still "disputed" (do i have to remind that the 'request for mediation', that some users finally agreed in, is still pending?), i could highlight another side of criticism, to which, no serious user would object: according to the turkish law 1151 of 1927 the Greek schools on Imbros and Tenedos were abolished, in a clear violation of the Treaty of Lausanne, that Ataturk himself signed. Ataturk was then President of Turkey then. the President of Turkey was and still is the one directly responsible for education affairs, right? so, wasn't he responsible for this violation? <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 00:33, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Andrew. I didn't really think people weren't going to have objections when you added that paragraph, and in it's current state I think there is an area for improvement. For example, perhaps you could change the heading to "Criticism" rather than "Opinions on genocide". It's just that you won't find a section with a similar title in that many other articles, but having a criticism section is a lot more common on WP, see <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elie_Wiesel_d7b0.html" title="Elie Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>. Another concern of mine is that I noticed some <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">weasel words</a> in the section. For example, "<i>some have said he was involved with the Armenian Genocide</i>". What I want to know is <b>who specifically</b> says this—remember to cite <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. If the source is not neutral, attribute it properly like "<i>the Armenian National Institute claims that...</i>". Lastly, you said, "<i>some Turks either claim the deaths were exaggerated or the result of war, or that they were committed by the Young Turks</i>". You should probably have it say, "<i>Ataturk.com states that...</i>" Overall, I hope that some compromise can be reached, and that the protection can eventually be lifted.

<dd>Thanks, I appreciate your help. I've been blocked from editing after that, which I disagree with, but I think those are great suggestions and I would appreciate it if you said the same at the Ataturk talk page.

<p>AW - I think that your understanding of Ataturk's role in the ethnic cleansing of Armenians from Anatolia is not entirely accurate. You are misinterpreting the word/concept to "consumate" the Armenians Genocide as used by ANI. This absolutly does not imply that Ataturk had a role in what we know as the Armenian Genocide period (during WWI). He was not politically involved with the CUP on any functional level during this period and he shoudl be seen as striclty a military figure who - as much as is known - had no role whatsover in these events (against Armenian civilians). When ANI presents this ida that Ataturk consumated the Genocide what they are trying to convey (IMO) and what is accurate (IMO) is that Ataturk's policy and efforts at establishing a Turkish state in Anatolia based on Turkish nationalistic and ethnic lines included as a fundemental concept the elimination (primarily through forced expulsions - but also massacres which were used to stir fear and cause Armenians and other Chrisitans to flee) etc Thus Ataturk can indeed be seen as "finishing the job" as envisioned and begun by the CUP - and if one views the entire period of the mid 19th century into the mid twentieth century as one large continum of effort on the part of (various) Turks to decimate (not just 10% but all) the Armenian presence in Anatolia then he rightly deserves his place for directing/approving the final blows to ensure that this occured. However in the stricter sense of the concept of the Armenian Genocide proper I do not think it is appropriate to include Ataturk as an actor or in any way directly connected with the ruling CUP during this time or concerning the enaction of their genocidal policies. I'm sorry for rambling on - but does this make sense? --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 18:48, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, thanks for the reasonable comments. I'm used to getting attacked over this. Anyway, that's an interesting point and one I had not heard before. Maybe I will soften the section? Maybe I could change "carried out" to "consummated" like the ANI page says? Or how would you write it? The paragraph you wrote above seems to me like a good start. I think it's important to include criticisms, and that was my goal with that section, put some of the criticisms in. --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">AW</a> 19:12, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your Welcome. I sympathyze with your interest in a more accurate (warts and all) picture of Ataturk (as opposed to the mythical version that most Turks know/believe) however I would caution against undue emphasis on the Armenian Genocide in regards to Ataturk even if it is - of course - a primary perspective of Armenians concerning Ataturk and even if - as my first comments on the Ataturk talk page suggest - that the Genocide was a fundemental event (of wide historical applicability)that impacted everything from that point foreward for Turkey/Turks and the region as a whole. However the tying of Ataturk to the Genocide proper is a no-go IMO as there is no concrete evidence or analysis that he had any direct role in such and quite the opposite - he did not see eye to eye with the main CUP perpetrators during that time and was not in any policy role (they even attmpted to supress his military role as he was seen as a potential political rival and were fearful that his military sucesses might translate into popular support and influence). Thus I see little value in any atttempt to directly connect Ataturk with the Genocide. What should be emphasised is Ataturk's role and promotion of the concept of Anatolia/Turkey for the Turks and his understanding (and promotion of the concept of) the Christian minorities as enemies of the Turks - through rival nationalist aspirations and due to their recent and past mistreatment, Ataturk understood what was at stake - that Turks needed to rally around this idea of their Turkishness above all else and needed to forcefully push their claims on Anatolia at the exclusion of all others (and concern for all others). This led him to advocate and pursue very brutal policies towards the remaining Christians of Anatolia that ultimatly led to massacres of estimated 400,000 more Armenians and the completion of cleanising of Armenians from Anatolia. It is important to note that Ataturk used the hatred of the Christian minoriites as a critical rallying point for the Turks - without which they may not have unified and risen up in such force to establish the nation of Turkey. That this unity was short lived - as can be seen by the Kurdish reistance later and that many of the forces oposing Ataturk (and his Westernizing policies) came from traditional Muslim tribal elements (such as the Kurds who were still major players politically and militarily at the time). Ataturk then took it upon himself to crush these "reactionary" elements - including former CUP memebers whom he needed for organization (overt and covert...ie assasinations, murders and other dirty deeds..) and money (that they had - largely as the result of appropriation from the Christians of the Empire. Ataturk founded the Republic on these forces but later acted against them in order to solidify his power and influence and to shape Turkey into the (Authoritarian) Western mode that he felt was necessary for its survival and prosperity. If he can be ctritiscized it is for the ruthless zeal and authoritarian way he crushed these "enemies" and how he molded the Turkish nation building myth to suit his needs - rallying around opposition to external and internal "foes" while preaching peace, Democracy and Wesern ways. Is this critiscim? Well for a Turk it is perhaps treason...ol... but for those who understand the history it is just the facts. (so read up...I suggest Taner Akcam's prvious book - <i>From Empire to Republic</i> as well as Hugh Pultons <i>Top Hat, Grey Wolf and Crecent</i> (a must) for some insites into these issues. You should also be familiar with Mango and Kinross's biographys - even though both fall far short of truly objective treatments of the man. Other sources that might be useful are <i>The Peace to End All Peace</i> and other studies of the post WWI peace process - specifically ones dealing with the breakup of the ottoman Empire and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. I've even read one book dealing with the Turkish Revolution (covering the pre/early CUP period through to after establishment of the Republic...that had some great insights - but I have forgotton the name of the book (and its been 20+ years since I read it...--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 20:11, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I see my "job" in Wikipedia - where it concerns the issue of the Armenian Genocide (primarily) - which is so contested (and vandalized) by certain Turks who buy into their slanted and distorted versions of things - to set some things straight - ie to not allow the inaccurate tangents and misrepresentations to rule the day. I am hoping that by providing proper argument and presentation of facts that I can influence the articel to at least not go too far astray. I am however a Wiki novice who is not sure just how involved I actually want to get into edit wars and the like - and I also am a bit of a perfectionaist who sees things certain (wholistic and interconnected ways) where I find it difficult to just jump in and edit in part. If I were to do an article I would practically have to start from scratch...its a defect I know - but its just how I operate. In regards to the Ataturk article - I checked it out because of your comming to the AG talk page and I immediatly sensed that you were somewhat off the mark and I wanted to make sure you/we were approaching this correctly. I did likewise see (as I expected to see) that the Turks who hold the myth of Ataturk the God hold sway on the articel and would be reluctant to budge on it. So we have a dilema. I think that it is important that we get it right and that our input is appropriate. I personally have no "grudge" per se concerning Ataturk (in fact I have long greatly admired the man) - though I am very aware/acknowledge that he was far from being a friend to Armenians in post-war Anatolia. So this history should be accuratly conveyed and included - as appropriate - but not out of some vendetta against the man...who after all was human eh? So I intend to monitor the article/talk page and will contribute as I see I can so that hopefull a slightly more accurate version of certain events might be presented. And who knows I may even offer up some actual article edits...though I see my role in educating contributors (such as yourself) as equally valuable (and what I do best).--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 21:01, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey. Maybe we could combine some of the stuff from your paragraph (possibly just the second half) to A.Garnet's "Effects of reforms" section? I've left a comment on the talk page. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 05:16, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with this approach - however the facts should be accuratly resented and sourced and presented in proper context. This is a complicated issue and some see it as black and white...they rebelled and were repressed etc - however if one studies what was going on at this time - and how Kurds/Islamists felt very thretened and betryad by Ataturk and how he and the Nationalists had planned certain cleansing and suppression (of Christians/Armenians and certain Kurds - and why - then we can come to a better understanding of motivations and events of this time. For instance this little article gives some insights into various forces/attitudes going on within the (not unified) Kurdish community during this time - worth a read - particualrly in the middle parts...<a href="http://www.ciaonet.org/conf/mei01/kih01.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ciaonet.org/conf/mei01/kih01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciaonet.org/conf/mei01/kih01.html</a> The discussion concerning Kurdish views and assistance by some to Armenians is also worth reading.</p>
<p>For instance - "The way Ankara suppressed militarily the Koçgiri movement in spring 1921 shaped the governmental behavior toward all Alevi and Kurdish autonomy claims during the 20th century: massive coercion and violence, deportation, and complete absence of political negociation. Behind closed doors, the National Assembly nevertheless discussed the atrocities commited during the campaign."</p>
<p>"in the summer 1919, Kurdish Alevi tribes were the first "interior enemies" to oppose Mustafa Kemal Pasha's reorganization of the power structures (congresses of Erzurum and Sivas), and to prepare the first Kurdish uprising against the Ankara government (revolt of Koçgiri-Dersim, 1920-1921)."</p>
<p>"As in 1915/16 the fear of extermination by the Unionist state was still very present. The new Ankara government, established in spring 1920, operated in the Eastern provincial area with precisely those forces that had already been in charge during the war."</p>
<p>"From the beginning of the 1930s onward the central state began to prepare the decisive attack upon Kurdish-Alevi Dersim, the last autonomous region in the eastern provinces. The disarmament and forced resettlement of tribes..."</p>
<p>"In the secularist understanding of the ruling positivist elite the Dersim was a "canker", a chronically "sick" member that needed to be transformed by a radical "operation" if not indeed amputated"</p>
<p>"Numerous Armenian survivors insured that Alevi-Armenian solidarity and the genocide remained in the consciousness."</p>
<p>"Seyit Riza, the most important tribal chieftain and spiritual leader of the Dersim rebellion continued to insist upon autonomy. He did this not so much for Kurdistic reasons (regular contact with the exile Kurdish-Armenian society in Syria Hoybun, founded in 1927, was not possible), but because of a desperate and partly illusory defensive position."</p>
<p>"there were no longer any literate missionary observers on hand as in Ottoman times to report to the outside world on the war now taking place against men, women and children, about the destruction of villages and deportations. The result of the Dersim campaign in 1937/38 was a large-scale devastation and the massacre of probably more than ten thousand people, many of them women and children."</p>
<p>"...the majority of the eastern Alevis distrusted Kemal's reorganization of Unionist networks and power structures."--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 15:58, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many Turks today think/assume that Ataturk was always beloved by his people - this was certainly not the case. He faced great resitance to most all of his reforms by a bunch of different groups/factions and by (many of) the Turkish people themselves - particularly - as one might expect - (non-Turkic) ethnic and religious minorities. That he was so astute in his understanding of these issues and so far sighted is quite to his credit. Perhaps history will judge if the degree of his brutality and absolutness could be justified considering the circumstances and outcome of his overall program. In any even we must give him great credit for some amazing accompliments against incredible odds and also understand that he is not alone among (those thought of as) great men in having more then a few skeletons in his closet. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 20:10, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that a "crticism" section is the proper way topresent these issues - but just to present the facts in the appropriate chronological or thematic section. However if then there is substansial disagreement of opionion (among scholers) perhaps an opposing views or different takes or what have you position can be added - but again in the appropriate section - not just out there on its own. However, if some substansial analysis can be refernced that portrays Ataturk as someone very different then that presented in the article - ie instead of strictly a savior of the Turkish nation analysis portrays him as a bloody mass murderer - and backs it up (thoroughly supports the cpontention) then perhaps it is appropriate to have an "other views" section or such. I don't think it is so clear cut that such a section is warrented and I would just perfer to see the facts of his policies against the Armenians during the Turkish War of Independence and against the Kurds - during and into the early years of the founding of the Republic (including ramifications of the policy of "Turkifying the population" presented where such commentary is accurate, appropriate and supportable.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">THOTH</a> 15:28, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey there Awiseman, The military history peer review didn't like the name "Military Brat" for the article on brats, they thought that it should be changed to something more indicative of the content. They also didn't like the idea of trying to globalize it because that would 'add more bias than it eliminates.' I placed it up for FAC, and the FAC didn't like the US centricity of the article either, thus to get this passed, I changed the name to Military brat (U.S. subculture) which is what the article describes, but I'm not sure if that is the best name. Thus, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military_brat_%28U.S._subculture%29#Page_Name" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military_brat_%28U.S._subculture%29#Page_Name" rel="nofollow">opened a discussion on the name.</a> Is that the best name or would "U.S. Military Brat" or something else be better? I would love your input.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 22:25, 2 December 2006 (UTC) <span id="63290219291"></span></p>

<p>Sure, I can make those, but I would need some reference maps, preferably a high resolution.

<p>Thanks for your message. I have modified my Talk comment to make it clear that "we" (i.e. we the editors of Wikipedia) are responsible for ensuring that the article is not embarrassing. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 16:55, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
