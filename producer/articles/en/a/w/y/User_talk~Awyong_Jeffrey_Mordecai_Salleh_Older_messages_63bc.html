<dd>What a brilliant idea! Except that you're not the first person to do it. Your edit was just basically a repetition of the entire paragraph before yours.

<dd>Fair enough. What I want is to cite precedent under International law for capital punishment in propaganda crimes. Otherwise, the article implies it is at most a hate crime, which pushes the pov that anyone who says it is more is an extremist. So to provide neutral context I referenced international jurisprudence for neutral context without reference to Streicher. P.S. I honestly don't have a pov on this - I am a scholar of communication and recognize it when people draw circles that isolate certain interests as extreme. That is what I am working against. For all I care, I could draw and publish cartoons of anyone in the world, but I wouldn't want to do so in ignorance of how some people might view them. PaxTerra 17:14, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, you removed the image in the article using the popups revert functionality. There is a clear consensus to keep the images in the article, and in any case you should not be using revert for something like this.

<p>Personally, I feel that having hidden comments on the articles would look rather distracting to users. I did not eliminate the comments completely; you can find them in the talk page. I believe, that if an editor meets up with some problems on editing, he would naturally consult the discussion page first. Furthermore, unless it is a serious problem such as errant vandalism like those on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

</dl>
<ul>
<li>For instance, there is an over-emphasis on the ideology behind the party. Compare this with the article <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party (UK)</a>, which largely focuses on significant events and people in the party.</li>
<li>Also, the article states, <i>"it has focused on helping to advance the struggle for independent political action by the working class and all the oppressed—at home and abroad."</i> — how?</li>
<li>There are no third-party links or newspaper articles mentioned in the article.</li>

<dd>Many thanks to Paul and Kimchi for your helpful hints. Kimchi's right, the base for this article was the front page of the organization's official site. I've just started to work on it, this is virtually a stub, and it will be continually improved and expanded over the next weeks. So I just ask other Wikipedians to be patient with me on this. One idea I have would be to compare and contrast Socialist Organizer's positions with the criticisms of other progressives; that means that arguments for and against S.O.'s positions would be explored. Do you all feel that this would help in dealing with the POV/advert concern? Thanks for your patience, just keep in mind, I'm new at this and still learning. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Cargohook (<a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECargohook_6239.html" title="User talk:Cargohook">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cargohook_7b39.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cargohook">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>Yes, please include alternative points of view and coverage of the party from non-party sources when possible. This will help the article to be more NPOV. However, don't remove the {{advert}} tag just yet — it places the article in a "cleanup" category, and people looking for stuff to improve will be more likely to discover the article.

In that case, you can catch up with the spoken characters easily - when you try to write anything, use your mouth to speak it up instead of attempting to type directly. Then for each word you speak (use a mic to record it and playback, maybe?) turn it into a word and type. Anyway nice to hear that you actually speak Cantonese. --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="green">D</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_Esperanza_f5cd.html" title="User:Deryck Chan/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">ryc</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="#007DFF">k C.</font></a> 04:16, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Happy Easter to all of you, and I hope that this version may fix your current problems and perhaps provide you with a few useful new tools. You can download version 1.1 at <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VandalProof_1bdb.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VandalProof">User:AmiDaniel/VandalProof</a>. Let me warn you, however, to please be extremely careful when using the new <i>Rollback All Contributions</i> feature, as, aside from the excessive server lag it would cause if everyone began using it at once, it could seriously aggitate several editors to have their contributions reverted. If you would like to experiment with it, though, I'd be more than happy to use my many sockpuppets to create some "vandalism" for you to revert. If you have any problems downloading, installing, or otherwise, please tell me about them at <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VP_Bugs_64c2.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VP/Bugs">User:AmiDaniel/VP/Bugs</a> and I will do my best to help you.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The matter of 'Wuxia' and 'Mohop'</span></h2>
<p>Sorry, I happened to be the chap who modified the wuxia to mohop/wuxia. It is the same characters in Chinese but mohop is more universally used by normal Hong Kong Chinese (I was one of them, now an expatriate in the US). Wuxia is generally used by the mainlanders, Taiwanese, and others who speak Mandarin. Prior to the handover to the People's Republic of China, HK predominately speak Cantonese. No offense to Mr .(?, sorry) Kimchi but it appears his country identifier seems to be Singapore. This being an article on HK, I believe I owe it to the HK citizens who are proud to have created the mohop/wuxia phenomenon and have annotated it as such in their honor. If the Mandarin speakers wish to call it 'wuxia', ok but we Cantonese, Hakka, Tanka Hkers and ex-HKers know it only as 'mohop' or the whatever dialectical name (but 'mohop' will suffice). By the way, I only changed the 'gongfu' to 'kung fu' whenever it was a HK production orf mention not when it was not. Lastly, I reside (still) in a free and democratic society with flaws but nevertheless still free and if wikipedia still stands for freedom and honour then please permit me to modify the mandarin wuxia to Cantonese mohop. Pre-revolutionary China may have made 'wuxia' but HK made 'mohop'. It is one of the HK's more endearing legacies before the 1997 takeover. Please restore the changes or allow me to restore the changes and you chaps can supervise or edit it. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello Kimchi. I had planned to make a run at the end of May, but I definitely won't be going "now" (at least in the next week) because I suspect that <a href="../../../a/n/w/User%7EAnwar_saadat_808d.html" title="User:Anwar saadat">Anwar saadat</a> will launch an attack, based on his comments at <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Blnguyen_21c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Blnguyen">my editor review</a>. This was due to a dispute at <a href="../../../a/j/i/Talk%7EAjith_7dae.html" title="Talk:Ajith">Talk:Ajith</a> about his repeated use of the terms "mega-star", "mega-hit", "!" in a very hagiographic manner, in which he accused <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">User:Zora</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaneshk_9519.html" title="User:Ganeshk">User:Ganeshk</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Crawshaw_7637.html" title="User:David Crawshaw">User:David Crawshaw</a>, myself of trolling and vandalising for trimming the article, and then started to behave in such a way as to irritate most of the Indian noticeboard by leaving abrasive edit summaries in <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_language.html" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> - see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotice_board_for_India-related_topics_7a67.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notice board for India-related topics">Wikipedia talk:Notice board for India-related topics</a>, and raised eyebrows at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Re:_User:_Anwar_saadat" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents#Re:_User:_Anwar_saadat</a>, and left rude comments to Indian bureaucrat <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a> at <a href="../../../a/n/w/User_talk%7EAnwar_Saadat_Archive_2_b759.html" title="User talk:Anwar Saadat/Archive 2">User talk:Anwar Saadat/Archive 2</a>. He also made his RfA debut at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Srikeit_28d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Srikeit">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Srikeit</a> to oppose on the grounds of not having featured material - I have never seen anybody oppose due to lack of featured content, which may have resulted from Srikeit asking him to keep cool on <a href="../../../a/j/i/Talk%7EAjith_7dae.html" title="Talk:Ajith">Talk:Ajith</a>, which was their only interaction. If a lot of Indian editors kept a close watch on the RfA and defended me, (as <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a> did when Anwar tried to gatecrash the Aucaman arbitration and decided to try and get Zora banned), it would make it better, but I think Anwar might be able to sway people who are not particularly familiar with me, so I would prefer to wait at least two more weeks to see how this issue pans out, rather than pass through in a somewhat undignified manner.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="../../../s/r/i/User%7ESrikeit_d1d6.html" title="User:Srikeit">User:Srikeit</a>, <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnottygobble_bf70.html" title="User:Snottygobble">User:Snottygobble</a> and <a href="../../../i/40/n/User%7EI%40n_586b.html" title="User:I@n">User:I@n</a> had started work via email on a joint nomination, as they had already individually expressed interest in nominating me.</p>

<p>I don't mean to be confrontational, but I wanted to respond to your comment about how I only have 23 edits here. I realize that that may strongly influence the perceived validity of my opinion on whether or not <a href="../../../r/m/r/User%7ERmrfstar_ff0f.html" title="User:Rmrfstar">Rmrfstar</a> should become an admin. However, I'd like to point out that I actually know that user personally and I only commented on things I actually know about him "real life" instead of what kind of a Wikipedian he is. I don't think that you can base the validity of my comment that he is trustworthy on how many edits I have on Wikipedia.

<dd>Don't worry, it's not questioning your ability to comment on Rmfstar's personality... it's just common at Wikipedia to note when a user with a small number of edits votes on RfA or AfD, as it is often a sign that they were invited to do so by someone else (or may be a <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppet</a>).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: translation request</span></h2>
<p>Hi. It's true that i am a Vietnamese and my religion is Buddhism. But I am not a researcher in Buddhism, as in I don't study Buddhism theory in details. Since the article you specified contains too many vietnamese Buddhism terms that are difficult to translate into English, I am afraid that I cannot translate it properly without the help from an expert on the topic (a monk, nun, or a Buddhism researcher, ...). For your reference, Vietnamese doesn't have the Buddhism terms of its own - most of the terms found in the article are derived from Chinese (hanzi dialect), with the pronunciation changed a bit to match the Vietnamese style. Sorry. <a href="../../../m/d/a/User%7EMdanh2002_b8df.html" title="User:Mdanh2002">Mdanh2002</a> 02:20, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi there Kimchi.sg . I might just butt and try and help on this. As you can see on my userpage I don't have much faith in my Vietnamese abilities, but I do have a Vietnamese -&gt; English Buddhism glossary-dictionary which was published by a local monk I know of to help people like me I guess. It's about the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surangama_Sutra_3aef.html" title="Surangama Sutra">Surangama Sutra</a>, I think that's why the author used KLN1 for Kinh Lang Nghiem Book 1 (my computer doesn't have diacritic buttons).

<dd>I'll try fix it since it was my doing.

<dd>I've fixed the bug, by 1. moving the image up, and 2. changing the preformatted text to &lt;blockquote&gt; which lets the browser wrap the lines. I've tested under Minefield (Firefox nightly) and Opera at 800x600 resolution.</dd>

<p>After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now <i>available for download!</i> Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Suggestions_Being_Considered" title="WP:VandalProof">here</a>. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof. Thanks to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a>, I now have an account on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://test.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">test.wikipedia.org</a></span> with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof, which I plan to make available in the near future. An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_SHM_0af5.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/SHM">simple history merge</a> tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Download" title="WP:VandalProof">download and install version 1.2</a> and take it out for a test-drive. As always, your <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_suggestions_a7f1.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/suggestions">suggestions</a> for improvement are always appreciated, and I hope that you will find this new version useful.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anatolia MUD</span></h2>
<p>Hi Kimchi,</p>
<p>I created the "Anatolia MUD" page and I believe you proposed it to be deleted. Would you tell me why you tell me the reason why it is deleted?</p>
<p>I put my comments in TALK:Anatolia MUD. It is short, so I am copy/pasting here.</p>
<p>-- I believe Anatolia MUD is important in the MUD history. You can check the MUD name listed in <a href="../../../m/u/d/MUD_trees_9a26.html" title="MUD trees">MUD trees</a> Wikipage. If you google it, you will see that it is very widely used. I am working on improving the article, but I believe deleting straight is not justified.</p>
<p>This is not a commercial project, so posting this at Wikipedia will not benefit me in any way. It is an open-source / free project to benefit the community.</p>
<p>I was trying to put some historical information about how the game came to existance, etc. --</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>Sincerely, -Serdar</p>
<dl>
<dd>To avoid being deleted, it is not sufficient for an online game just to have its name mentioned on another Wikipedia page. The page must also state in what ways the game is "notable", or special. What most Wikipedia editors consider as "special" for online content (including games such as MUDs) is listed at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. In summary, usually a game will need independent reviews in other newspapers or magazines in order not to be deleted.</dd>

<p>Firstly, repost really isn't supposed to be used for speedy deletions. The copyvio, in the past at least, has been from <a href="http://assamuniversity.tripod.com/assam1.htm" class="external free" title="http://assamuniversity.tripod.com/assam1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://assamuniversity.tripod.com/assam1.htm</a>.

<p>Sorry about the photo, I was trying to quickly correct what had been done to Felipe Calderon´s profile. Somebody had placed a political cartoon that shows him in a bad light, while the rest of the candidates had their normal photos. Due to the fact it was already almost 12 AM and had to get to bed, I quickly placed the photo up out of laziness. It won´t happen again.</p>

<p>Hi, Kimchi.

Anyway, TB has declared that he's happy and amused with the dwarves vandalising his page, so I thought I'd not roll back but merely add a sharp-toothed "Darwinbish" to scare the vandalfish. But of course re-do your action, if you prefer! P.S. Sorry the wolfstar/pussycat made a nasty mess at your RFA. But, well, that's what it does.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am quite impressed with your thoughtful and calm demeanor and obvious dedication to the project. I haven't the faintest idea why you are not yet an administrator (perhaps it isn't to your liking?), but I would be honored to nominate you if that is an avenue you wish to pursue; or, of course, to support you strongly if another nominator is waiting in the wings!&#160;;) Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:56, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

No matter what the alignment of your vote was, I will take your comments seriously and use them to improve myself.

<p><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">The University of Chicago Science Fiction Club was the center of the science fiction world in Chicago for at least thirty years. The article I posted covered the years I was active in it. Almost every name mentioned was of someone well known in science fiction fandom. Several were published authors. One was a science fiction publisher. Two were science fiction magazine editors.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">By the way, that brings up a point. I realize (and agree with) your efforts to avoid becoming a personal sounding board for anyone. In the usual case, No Original Research is an excellent policy. But what about the case where what is being reported is an eye witness account of events observed as they happened? If the account is reasonably objective, shouldn't it be allowed if the matter otherwise meets the Wikipedia standars?</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">I feel this can be particularly important with a subject like science fiction, which for many years was dismissed by many as something not worth serious attention. This has resulted in an impoverished written record for the field, or writings in places like letter columns or material published by amateurs.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by LenZettel (<a href="../../../l/e/n/User_talk%7ELenZettel_752e.html" title="User talk:LenZettel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LenZettel_d93f.html" title="Special:Contributions/LenZettel">contribs</a>) 23:17, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</small></font></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">Hi, Kimchi.sg. Speedy delete criterion A8 requires the source to be a commercial content provider - a business that makes money directly from the content that has been copied. You closed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kelly_Roberti_13d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kelly Roberti">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kelly Roberti</a> as a speedy deletion under A8, but the artist does not make money from the content that has been copied, his biography, he makes money from his artwork. It would have been closer to an A8 if an image of his artwork had been copied, but A8 only applies to text.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">His biography may be considered advertising intended to increase sales and make more money, but except in some unusual situations, people do not pay to see advertising. Money must be made directly from the content that has been copied, like a subscription encyclopedia article. Also, posting advertising to Wikipedia helps his business, rather than hurting it. Finally, there is a decent chance that he posted the material himself, giving permission for it to be used. There is a chance that he may try to unrelease it if he was unaware that the content can be edited by others, but there is still a fair chance that he will still let it be posted and he has given permission under the GFDL nonetheless by posting it.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">I don't know if you were around when A8 was crafted ("around" meaning participating or reading the discussion), but it was made to only delete material that has almost no chance of being used with permission. Encyclopedia Britannica and the New York Times, for example, are very unlikely to let us use one of their articles after it has been posted to Wikipedia and it is even less likely that someone with the authority to release the article under the GFDL would post the article to Wikipedia himself or herself. Since A8 is so narrow, it is not very useful, but it was crafted this way to make it nearly impossible for content that we might be able to get permission for to be deleted, if the rules are followed.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">The commercial content provider provision is ignored by some editors and admins, as is the under 48 hours old provision (included to prevent Wikipedia mirrors being mistaken as sources), and I won't bug you if you decide to ignore it as well. You could try to expand the criterion, instead. This has been unsuccessful in the past, but it might gain consensus now. I'll be offline for a little while, so I won't respond immediately to any replies.

I didn't necessarily expect you to delete it immediately, but thought there might be some discussion. Blastphemy claims that he was given permission to use the copyrighted material. But (1) how can he prove that? And (2) even so, just copying material from a musician's own Web page is, as you know, not acceptable according to Wiki policies. I have marked the page for deletion review again but do not know if I followed the correct procedure, since the whole thing was completely restored by the original author. Could you please look into this further? I will also leave a message on Blastphemy's talk page.

<p><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">Thank you for your prompt response. I now understand a little better the policies of Wikipedia, but not really why some articles are listed under <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">PROD</a> and others under <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">AfD</a>.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">Had I known beforehand that the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_identity.html" title="Canadian identity">Canadian identity</a> was on the block to be deleted, I would have objected, but as that is past, I would like to request its resurrection - could you please undelete it. Here are the reasons I propose to keep it (or rather, bring it back):</font></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">Length - most articles listed on <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>, in my quick random survey, are short - a sentence to two paragraphs. <b>Canadian identity</b> was considerably longer. The length also supports that it is more than some random user’s vanity page, and has been a collaborative effort, one of the main goals of Wikipedia..</font></font></li>
<li><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">Notability - Canada is indeed notable (I hope no one would dispute that). I agree that the question “What does it mean to be a Canadian?” is a slightly different topic, but I would suggest that it is a question that is fundamental to the country. From the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> on, the simple answer was “not American.” Why was Canada formed? In part, to keep from becoming American. The same reason is why <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> joined confederation, why the west (now <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba.html" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>) was the subject of a huge drive on the part of the Canadian government to be settled, and why the <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukon_Territory_2a75.html" title="Yukon Territory">Yukon Territory</a> was formed. <i>See also <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_confederation.html" title="Canadian confederation">Canadian confederation</a></i>. Canada is also special in the fact that its boundaries were not defined by war, ethic group, or common history, like most other nations (Europe, especially comes to mind).</font></font></li>
<li><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">POV - it doesn’t surprise me that the article comes across without a NPOV. By vary nature, the article implies a point of view, because it is about how Canadians see themselves. As noted above, not being American is an important part of that. <i>See “Mild anti-Americanism” in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_literature.html" title="Canadian literature">Canadian literature</a> and the article on <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molson.html" title="Molson">Molson’s</a> <a href="../../../i/_/a/I_am_Canadian_13fe.html" title="I am Canadian">I am Canadian</a> commercials.</i> I would welcome anyone to edit out the POV, but I would challenge them to do so without removing the facts. In any case, the mild POV throughout does not seem to cloud the message</font></font></li>
<li><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">Uniqueness of topic - as you noted, the material here does not readily fit elsewhere. The topic is complex enough to require its own article, as demonstrated by its length. I read the articles that you suggested the material should be in, and found no significant overlap.</font></font></li>
<li><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">Accuracy - this, above all, it what impressed me most about the article - it explained what it means to be Canadian in a clear, concise, and accurate manner. It is the sort of article I would point my American friends to. The clear explanation in and of itself is reason enough, in my mind, to keep the article.</font></font></li>
<li><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">Suggestions for expansion/improvement (things I would be willing to undertake):</font></font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#FF0000">how the adoption of the maple leaf flag <i>see <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" title="Image:Flag of Canada.svg">Image:Flag of Canada.svg</a></i> has made the maple leaf <b>the</b> Canadian symbol</font></font>

<dl>
<dd>No, it does not. The technical reason is, whenever any page is edited, the servers will keep the last edited copy in their cache for quicker loading next time the page is requested. The catch comes when a template which you transclude on your userpage is edited to include a CSD template, and then deleted - the last version edited (with the CSD tag) is cached by the servers, so they'll think your page is indirectly "tagged" for speedy deletion. The nicest way to remedy this is to invalidate the server cache by making a test edit. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 18:59, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Dear Kimchi.sg,</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my articles. I appreciate your comments, although I do not agree with the nuclear option you have chosen. My intent was to inform the public about new (and free for personal use) tool. If you think the articles do not serve this purpose, or this purpose is not aligned with Wikipedia guidelines, we should let the public administrators decide.</p>
<p>I do have a remark on your approach. It seems to me that relying on a single search engine results (google) shortly after the web site and the articles have been published is a poor rationale for discussion. I would allow both search bots and public more time to react.</p>

<p>Kimchi, I noticed you removed the Breckenheim coat of arms. According to § 5 Abs. 1 of the German Copyright law, official works like coats of arms are gemeinfrei (in the public domain).</p>

<p>Well, apparently I used the wrong tag; it's in the family estate and I thought I'd released all rights to it in the drawbar; what's the tag I should use if we're releasing it to the public domain? The photo is at least 100 years old, possibly more like 107, although I wouldn't know the actual photographer but it was a purchased portrait, with the depictee owning the rights; and me, as his grandson, is in charge of the family photographic estate. I tried to have a look at the image by moving the old Wiki image tag to the article's talk page, but it appears to have also been deleted and no longer displays; so I can't check what I'd put or change the license. Since you're the one who took it off, please advise as to what tag I SHOULD use in this situation.

<dd>Please refer to <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">Wikipedia's guidelines on autobiography articles</a>; many editors consider it bad form for one to write about themself in an article. If someone is really notable enough, it's better for others to notice the person, then write something about him. That said, I will assess your notability according to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">our guidelines for biographies</a> later today, and I'll tell you whether you deserve an article or not. Biographies (whether autobiographies or not) that don't satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">the biography notability guidelines</a> are likely to be nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 02:23, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I checked the notable guidelines and yes in a way I feel kind of strange creating an entry about myself as a number of my colleagues have. Perhaps I could ask a colleague to do this on my behalf? On the other hand I feel I can make a great contribution to Wikipedia in the computing history realm and I would think it would be valuable to tie back to my own work and references/publications in this area.</p>

<dd>You can mention your own work in related articles, but I'm still not too convinced an (auto)biographical article is a good idea. Why not have a compromise: write your planned autobiography at a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubpage_5405.html" title="Wikipedia:Subpage">subpage</a> of your user page, perhaps at User:Bdamer/article, where you can prepare the article before moving it into the article area?

Right,</p>
<p>A quick refresh on the guidelines and... The content is verifiable (Goals! website), I think there is a NPOV - the facts and not opinions.</p>
<p>Notability... 100,000 people in the UK alone play this (or a very similar) brand of five-a-side football. Additionally the atrocious record of the team makes them certainly notable (or is that notorious&#160;:) ) among this group.</p>
<p>I agree, however, that the strict sports team rules do not apply.</p>
<p>Perhaps a merge with the Goals Soccer Centre article? Possibly and entry for worst football (soccer) team ever (which would provoke interest).</p>
<p>But I respect your opinion on this and realise that - the poor record aside - it reads like a vanity article.</p>
<p>So the question becomes is the record notable.</p>
<p>Your call...</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Othman Abu-Sahnun the Italian</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I am the author of the entry on Othman Abu-Sahnun the Italian, which has been deleted. The point of the entry was not to attack the subject of the entry, but to clarify some things of his biography. Thus, I intended to begin the stub of an entry for others to pick up and complete, relying in that on their more expert knowledge. The things I wrote about are things which I personally know about but do not have verification, i.e. there is no documentation in terms of public papers of any sort available to me, although such must exist, and so was really seeking verification from others. This is relevant because Othman is the author of a web-site in which he writes on a number of subjects, and thus his biography is at least of some interest. After all for some of the subjects he writes on, a search on Google often turns up his web-site as first port of call. I am happy to re-write the entry to remove anything that might be considered inflammatory and unverified. And really only want to create a stub that might be filled in by others with better information.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Abdassamad (<a href="../../../a/b/d/User_talk%7EAbdassamad_8de2.html" title="User talk:Abdassamad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Abdassamad_7ffa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Abdassamad">contribs</a>) 02:20, 27 July 2006 (UTC+8)</small></p>

<dd>Well, the article certainly did not say that it was a species of sea urchin. It said it was "An exploding super nova suspended in liquid and time, with bright reddish-brown spines radiating out from a never blinking eye" - and the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diadema.html" title="Diadema">diadema</a> link, which goes to a page that says the word has several meanings, wasn't sufficiently helpful. Thus I couldn't find any context to explain what the article was talking about - one of our <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A1" title="WP:CSD">criteria</a> for deleting articles on sight.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have restored the page and added in the bit that it is a sea urchin, without the exaggerated description. Please note that the accompanying image will stay deleted - the first deleted version said it was used "with permission" from the photographer, making it unusable for use in Wikipedia. In light of that, the claim in the second version - that the image is licensed under GFDL - seems dubious. It <i>might</i> help if you indicate which website you got it from. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 14:28, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry about the embellishments, poetic liscence gone mad. My father discovered Diadema palmeri and I created the wiki page for his birthday and I got a little overzealous. I will enter website details with next picture. Which liscence should I use? Below is the email from the photographer Re: Diadema palmeri copyright Inbox</p>

<p>G'day Jono,</p>
<p>That's very cool that your dad discovered that urchin!!! Even better that the taxonomistw was kind enough to name it after him.</p>
<p>Feel free to use my image and you can leave it up there for as long as you like. If you could give me the photo credit and a link to my website that would be appreciated.</p>

That's not correct, so I had changed it to what actually happened. I've not edited articles here before, so I'm not sure if I'm not supposed to say anything or if I change it back again, then check later to see if it's changed. Anyway, just wanted to clarify in case I am supposed to.</p>

Hmm. Understood. There is an appeal into the lack of a proper investigation of his death, when this is decided upon, I could probably post that info; though there's about 700 pages of data, I'd not be sure if I can just put ALL that info up here or not. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>The report so far is not in the public domain, it's in front of the Austrian Government awaiting their decision in regards to Duncan's death. The investigation wasn't complete and wasn't handled properly. I will do some more digging and see what I can find in the public domain.

<dd>Not sure whether that site is a news report, but it's all we've got on his suspected cause of death, until a more authoritative source mentions otherwise.

The ITE,which is a statutory board under the Ministry of Education, Singapore, plays a vital role in the mainstream post-secondary edcuation sector in Singapore. As such, we would like the Wikipedia entry to reflect what we feel are our corporate definitions and positioning.</p>
<p>We will be updating the entry again. Hope you will allow it to remain.</p>
<p>Thanking you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

Hi again Kimchi,</p>
<p>It's not about using the Wikipedia as an advertising vehicle. It's about given the correct information and giving a description which is accurate. You article state 'sanctioned by', which is factually incorrect. 'Sanctioned by' implies that it is a private body and has the approval of the Ministry. The actual situation is that ITE is part of the Ministry of Education and is a wholly-government organisation. There is a difference between 'sanctioned by the Government" and being a body set up by the Government. Also, the National ITE Certificate (Nitec), is an internationally-recognised qualification.</p>

<p>Kimchi, excuse me for the bother, but I believe that among the personal slurs the real issue was lost, and the article still should be deleted. Therefore I would like to renominate it highlighting its inherent unfitness for WP rather than issues that don't merit deletion. How do I do that? (my problem is that after placing the subst:afd1 template on the article's page, the "this article's entry" link would lead to the archived previous nomination).

<p>Hi, you have sent me several messages indicating that my images have insufficient copyright status. The website in which I got the images off do not own the images. They were released by Holden (an Australian car maker) to promote their product. These series of images can be found on several other websites.

<p>this club is part of a league of 9 teams, each of which has a stub in wikipedia. the club had one such stub, but it was deleted after I expanded the 2 or so lines into a short paragraph. although this is an amateur league, all the clubs have web pages, corporate sponsors and fans, and take themselves seriously. this club IS notable and I would greatly appreciate it if you could restore the stub, or tat the very least not take it down when it is put back up.</p>

<p>Hi. Thanks for listing the "Body everywhere.jpg" picture - I wasn't sure what to do, as Mib was partly abusing his admin powers to undelete without cause.</p>
<p>However, as a side-note, another picture that I listed for deletion was <a href="../../../n/a/n/Image%7ENanjing_ditch.jpg_e844.html" title="Image:Nanjing ditch.jpg">Image:Nanjing ditch.jpg</a>. Now the image on wikipedia was successfully deleted, but it has a counterpart on the Commons site which is just as dubious. I have listed that for speed deletion too, but I have noticed that there is a massive backlog on Commons with such a listing. Is it possible to ask some admins to deal with the backlog, or are Commons listings normally purged/deleted at less frequent intervals.</p>
<p>Just curious if there was anything I could do to resolve the issue, rather than have it drag on for months (with tags removed by third-parties again). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 16:31, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fleur de lys window</span></h2>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>With regard to that window, it's a bit of a puzzle to me as to what constitutes free and fair use of an image of an artwork.</p>
<p>I was the photographer in this case. But this photograph is not an artwork. It's simply a straight-on good shot of the subject. The subject is a window which looks medieval. Most people who photograph it, probably several hundred times a week, would think that it was 700 years old and publish it without as such without hesitation. But I happen to KNOW that it was created about 1986.</p>
<p>I can't, in all honesty, claim the artwork because I took the photo. I'm an artist myself. On the other hand, because this window has been installed in a uniquely significant building (the first church in the Gothic style), it has become an almost-public work of art, like the Eiffel Tower, Nelson's Column and the ten new statues of 20th Century martyrs outside Westminster Abbey. The only real difference is that because these other things are outside, they are clearly Public Art. You can't stop the public from photographing the Abbey, just because you have created one of the statues that graces its facade.</p>
<p>In every church that one goes into, there are artworks both old and new. They are photographed and published all the time- particularly the stained glass. My case here is that it is Public Art and Fair Use, because it is an outstanding example of what it is, in a building of unique significance.</p>
<p>I refuse to claim it as my own work.</p>
<p>I think it must be PD Art, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmandajm_0a38.html" title="User:Amandajm">Amandajm</a> 12:47, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gaming clans not notable.</span></h2>
<p>Under the thread about Shadowclan deletion you refer to Shadowclan as a non-notable gaming clan. You then go on to point explain that if the notability of Shadowclan is not sourced then the page will be deleted. Under that two people vote for delete and give the reason that gaming clans are not notable.</p>
<p>This doesn't seem to fall under the reasoning stated for the possible deletion. Does an answer to these votes for deletion that have nothing to do with noteriety need to be answered? <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 05:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess what i'm trying to point out is that it says this under articles of deletion <b>Indeed, if you can address the points raised during the discussion by improving the article, you are encouraged to edit a nominated article</b> but their criticism of the article isn't that it can be fixed in any way, which makes their comments particularly frustrating as they don't seem to follow the guidelines you posted at the outset.<a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 05:26, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not all objections about articles in any AfD discussion are actable upon.

<p>I didn't know there was an <b>interesting enough</b> clause at Wikipedia. Is this the new reason it will be deleted now since the other reason has been overcome?<a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 07:59, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure... and I'm not sure you've overcome the objections convincingly either. Don't press me for details. Lastly, there's no need to automatically write something in response to every delete comment - it makes you look silly. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 08:01, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia is about providing the major published views to readers and that very much includes views that are critical. I invite you to post to the discussion page of <i>The Urantia Book</i> article to provide suggestions about any large revisions you think are necessary.

<p>This is an encyclopedia not a book review on Amazon. I looked on the website for the Roman Catholic church, the largest denomination of Christianity. They do not have a critical review section. Neither does Methodism, Presbyterian, Mormon, Hinduism, Tao, Congregationalism, Orthodox Christianity, or Lutheranism, etc. Why should this entry?</p>

<p>FYI for another reader's thread: As far as its classification, in the Religions list, it is probably from the in the Encyclopedia of Relgions by Gordon Melton, and Urantia and is listed as a splinter or branch of Seventh Day Adventist. But in the "American Religions Collection" at UCSB of which Melton founded, the Urantia Book Movement is listed as a separate organization that has never been affliated with the SDA and I am sure Melton will update that as well in his next edition.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Hershberger (<a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHershberger_680a.html" title="User talk:Hershberger">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hershberger_54b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hershberger">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Foundation issues</span></h2>
<p>The task of improving access to video on Wikipedia is a complex one, and one which I have not only thought about, but explored in many places on Wikipedia and Wikimedia over many months.</p>
<p>I see you commented on my understanding of foundation issues. You will notice that <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/foundation_issues" class="extiw" title="m:foundation_issues">foundation issues</a> item 4 calls for copyleft licensing of content. And yet, interestingly, not all content on Wikimedia is copyleft. This image: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Cheatsheet-en.png" class="extiw" title="m:Image:Cheatsheet-en.png">Image:Cheatsheet-en.png</a> is explicitly copyright in fact by ... Wikimedia themselves: <i>© &amp; ™ All rights reserved, Wikimedia Foundation, Inc..</i></p>
<p>So I hope you can now see that there is a gap between idealism and realism even at the heart of the Wikimedia Foundation. While some of us work to close this gap, I hope you can appreciate that this ideal has not yet been reached even amongst the most committed at Wikimedia, and can perhaps begin to appreciate that your initial hasty response on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Stephen_B_Streater" class="extiw" title="w:Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Stephen_B_Streater">my RfA</a> may not reflect that my understanding of foundation issues may be deeper than it first seems. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 17:43, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I am a doctor who works in the Baltimore area. Ever since January, I used Wikipedia to assist me in difficult decisions if I had no knowledge of a patient's condition (or if I forgot). I get accused of vandalism since I used to vandalize wikipedia a week ago. Why would I ever use Wikipedia to assist my patients again if it's just going to cause more uproar with the administrators?

<p>Hi, thanks for removing the fair use image from my user page. However, since the image was given as part of an award given to me by another user, you also inadvertently removed the text as well. I suspect that you also did that to other people who also received the award. I would like to suggest that instead of removing the entire section, you should replace the image with something like "fair use image removed" or something so that the text of the award is still preserved.

<dd>There is nothing precluding you from nominating it again with a decent reason for deletion. Any number of Wikipedia articles suffer from a "lack of interest and information".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My mistake; possibly led to improper speedy</span></h2>
<p>Hi! I came across an article posted by User:Clippark that was a copyright violation. I then found that multiple articles by him (17) were cut and paste jobs all from the same AT&amp;T website. Trying to tag them expeditiously, I did so in multiple windows. Unfortunately, I only later realized that a number of them were preexisting articles with copyvio text added and the first few I oooked at were the only ones that had been created by him. I immediately rectified the error in those that were preexisting by removing the speedy tag and reverting to a noninfringing prior version. Unfortunately, by that time you had speedied <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_Busch_III_90f5.html" title="August Busch III">August Busch III</a>. A google search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22August+Busch+III%22+site%3Aen.wikipedia.org&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22August+Busch+III%22+site%3Aen.wikipedia.org&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> finds that article, which leads me to believe that it was one of those that preexisted. My mistake and lesson learned, but that article must have preexisted so it should accordingly be restored.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 02:24, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Being first in more than one aspects should allow us to be included in Wikipedia. Plus we do have way more than 5 articles about us in newspapers. We can not become Forbes or Fortune 500 company in 18 months but we are aiming there. There is nothing wrong with our software or company type - you do not know the Corporate Blogging software industry to state that We can not be included because we are nobody. I am honestly seeking advise how we can be inclued in wikipedia,i am not arguing with the editors. I need advise what to do as I am certain my opinion is valid as well as the infromation for Blogtronix which should reside in Wikipedia</font></font></p>

<h2><font color="navy" size="2"><font><span class="mw-headline">On my own behalf</span></font></font></h2>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>Hi,</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>I just discovered a discussion about me, asking for credentials.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>There is a resume at <a href="http://maltedmedia.com/people/bathory/bathres.html" class="external free" title="http://maltedmedia.com/people/bathory/bathres.html" rel="nofollow">http://maltedmedia.com/people/bathory/bathres.html</a> that should take care of any concerns. I have had several books and hundreds of articles in print, and work in many fields. Your entry could just as easily have covered my role as a major author during the first generation of personal computers (1979-85), the post-Fluxus art movement (1973-78), Vermont's Alliance of Independent Country Stores of which I'm director (2001-present), as bibliographer of playwright Kenneth Sawyer Goodman (published by the Newberry Library, albeit with "Bathory" spelled as "Batory"), or even as an experimental elementary schoolteacher (for which I won the Regional Laboratory for Educational Improvement's New England Regional Award).</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>My music has been reviewed in the New York Times and the Village Voice (along with print, broadcast and online reviews, references all available on my music catalog page), but my concentration has been online since 1981, with my influence deliberately outside of academia.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>The Kalvos &amp; Damian radio show hosted by David Gunn and me won the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award in 2000, which you can easily verify, as you can my appearance on Travel and Discovery channels with respect to my opera (<a href="http://bathory.org/" class="external free" title="http://bathory.org/" rel="nofollow">http://bathory.org/</a>). My conducting work has appeared in the accompanying CD to the Longman Anthology of English Literature. I was just talking about my groundbreaking "We Are All Mozart" project on New York's WKCR last week.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>If you're looking for academic references, though, you won't find many. Those thousands of hits online represent my work in the very area that Wikipedia used to build its own reputation -- the edge of new information.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>I'm not making a case for a Wikipedia entry; folks can find me without it. My point is that the discussion I've been reading is very sloppy, the research poor, the logic unsubstantiated, and the commentary often ignorant.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>Thanks, Dennis Bathory-Kitsz bathory@bathory.org</font></font></p>

However, this is incorrect: The image was tagged as a <a href="../../../t/v/-/Template%7ETv-screenshot_6e4d.html" title="Template:Tv-screenshot">television screen capture</a> (by me) and noted its source as the pilot episode of the series. Further, the image clearly falls under fair use, and is specifically discussed in the article it was part of, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thematic_motifs_of_Lost_90ff.html" title="Thematic motifs of Lost">Thematic_motifs_of_Lost</a>: <i>Their dichotomy is laid out in the show's pilot episode — Locke explains backgammon to Walt by holding up one black and one white piece, saying, "Two players, two sides — one is light, one is dark."</i> I would appreciate returning the image; otherwise, I'll re-up it. --<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 17:31, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</font></font></p>

<dd><font color="navy" size="2"><font>That was an incorrect summary I provided. The reason it was deleted is that it was not being used in any articles.

<li><font color="navy" size="2"><font>Again, <i>I</i> took the screenshot. But putting myself as the "source" is an entirely silly suggestion, tantamount to claiming a need to list the editor who quotes a section of a book as the "source". The person who performs a screen capture is not a creator, nor originator -- the television broadcast itself is the source, just as a publication would be the source, not the person taking an extract of it. Your claim that it wasn't used is incorrect: Prior to your deletion of the image, it <i>was</i> used in the article I noted above -- you, yourself, removed it from that article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thematic_motifs_of_Lost&amp;diff=74156921&amp;oldid=74053996" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thematic_motifs_of_Lost&amp;diff=74156921&amp;oldid=74053996" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>.

<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>Hello,</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>I wonder if I could ask for your input a second time about this image which is proving more problematic than it should. I have tried to assist the uploader <a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">User:Leflyman</a> in stating the source and creating a fair use rationale for the image through discussion on his talk page now in an <a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_Archive6_01f7.html#Images_without_source_information" title="User talk:Leflyman/Archive6">archive</a>. After waiting for a time to see if a source and rationale was forthcoming I removed it from the article <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thematic_motifs_of_Lost_90ff.html" title="Thematic motifs of Lost">Thematic motifs of Lost</a> and tagged it as an image without source info. I see that the source was considered implied and that the image was eventually restored. After waiting a little longer to see if a fair use rationale was added I removed the image from the page and tagged it as orphaned. Leflyman has restored the image and deleted my tag. I wondered if you had any suggestions about how to proceed in convincing him of the need for a fair use rationale. He has suggested that I should write the rationale myself but I am not convinced that the image is fair use.

<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>There's a cleanup action going on to remove old protected/deleted pages since usually the people recreating them give up after a couple of months. The reason behind it is that there are now so many p/d pages that they start showing up on google and randompage. Hence, the deletion of Fransesco. It works for most of such pages but sometimes the recreators are very persistent. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 17:39, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</font></font></p>

Therefore I believe we conform to the following Wikipedia guidelines: Criteria for web content</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>Web-specific content[3] is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</font></font></p>
<pre>
<font color="navy" size="2"><font>  1. The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.
         * This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.[4]

<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>Would you like me to list for you all the pages on Wikipedia that list their contributors?

<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>Regarding the, your term, 'praise' for the database features, I can assume on that basis that you'll pull the Discogs and All Music Guide entries on that basis?</font></font></p>

<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>"The articles are full text and fully searchable (by artist, date, genre, keyword etc.) including an'advanced search' option."</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>Saying 'full text' is to distinguish this database from 'list of title' databases. The above information is important for academic users.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>You don't think this is important? Given the amount of stolen material and rights abuse online, this is not 'praise' but essential information.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>I'm happy to remove the bit about it being a subscription site, though I would have thought that would be of interest to Wikipedia's users. I'm frankly baffled as to how what I wrote could be read as 'blatant advertising'.</font></font></p>

It is particularly hard to convey an artists notability in the context of the UK Grime scene as major record labels are unwilling to sign/promote artists therefore there is not a huge amount of referencing that can be done as promotional websites/albumn sales etc are not available. However I was under the impression that the internet and particularly wikipedia was supposed to be an environment in which specialist subjects can be catalogued and made accessible not just those that appeal to the masses. If you could kindly unlock the stub MC Bearman and address my concerns then I will re-write the article to convey the notability of this artist further. Thank you.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>Nice welcome template. Btw, while your signature in that template redirects to your talk page, I'm thinking "ask me on my talk page" should be auto-linked to the talk page of the user giving the welcome. It's a shortcut, and could be invaluable to users who don't know where that talk page is.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>PS: Why the <i>Don't type the 4 tildes</i>? I see your template for generating it, now that I've previewed this, but it's contrary to the usual habit and the welcome message ("Please remember to sign your name on talk pages using four tildes (Balsa10 11:00, 18 October 2006 (UTC))"). I presume you have a special reason for doing it, though I typed it automatically and had to delete it when I remembered. And just had to do it again (laugh). I always sign after the last word; this is just my first time doing it -- or not, as it were -- as a username.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>Hello,</font></font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>I have been away for 4 months and on my return discovered that pages on the Wave Structure of Matter have been deleted. I have spent the past day reviewing relevant guidelines and have posted a very detailed reply at my talk page;</font></font></p>

<p><font color="navy" size="2"><font>PS - I am a philosopher, so I take my work at Wikipedia very seriously (encyclopedias were first created by philosophers!). I also have a fairly large website (gets around 50,000 page views a day) so i don't get much time to work at Wikipedia. However, I notice that people keep putting articles back into Wikipedia on the Wave Structure of Matter (often quite poor) and because the original articles were deleted then these further articles also keep getting deleted. My point is that I did not put the Wave Structure of Matter page up originally, but I am convinced that this knowledge is important to Wikipedia, and it will also stop this confusion of pages continually being added by the public and then deleted without reason.</font></font></p>

<p>Admin Coaching, now being coordinated by <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_1384.html" title="User:HighwayCello">HighwayCello</a>, is a program for people who want help learning some of the more subtle aspects of Wikipedia policy and culture. People are matched with experienced users who are willing to offer coaching. The program is designed for people who have figured out the basics of editing articles; they're not newcomers any more, but they might want some help in learning new roles. In this way, Esperanza would help keep hope alive for Wikipedia because we would always be grooming the next generation of admins.</p>

<p><font color="navy" size="2">Hello,</font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2">I would like to request undeletion of the article on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Context_Sensitive_Solutions_fc57.html" title="Context Sensitive Solutions">Context Sensitive Solutions</a>. Here is the reasoning behind my request, which I also posted to the discussion page for the article:</font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2">"This article was deleted for a supposed copyright violation. However, the material in question is in the public domain. The lists that appear under the sections "Qualities of a CSS Project" and "CSS Principles" are generally agreed upon by transportation planners as defining the practice of Context Sensitive Solutions. They were originally produced at a conference sponsored by the state of Maryland Department of Transportation in 1998 and have since been reproduced online in several forums, including <a href="http://environment.transportation.org/environmental_issues/context_sens_sol/" class="external text" title="http://environment.transportation.org/environmental_issues/context_sens_sol/" rel="nofollow">The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials</a>, <a href="http://www.c-b.com/information%20center/transportation/ic.asp?tID=23&amp;pID=239," class="external text" title="http://www.c-b.com/information%20center/transportation/ic.asp?tID=23&amp;pID=239," rel="nofollow">Carter and Burgess</a> (a private firm), and dozens more that can be produced with a Google search of "Qualities of Excellence in Transportation Design."</font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2">"In light of the consensus that has emerged around these principles (Federal legislation has referred to them as design criteria for the federal highway system, see <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;sid=cp109SIui1&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=sr053.109&amp;db_id=109&amp;item=&amp;sel=TOC_491395&amp;" class="external text" title="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;sid=cp109SIui1&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=sr053.109&amp;db_id=109&amp;item=&amp;sel=TOC_491395&amp;" rel="nofollow">SAFETEA-LU, Section 109.c.2.C</a>), I believe it is justified and necessary to include them in this article. I have altered the citation format to make it clearer that the lists are not my words, and I re-directed the reference to point to the <a href="http://www.sha.state.md.us/events/oce/thinkingbeyondpavement/tbtp.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.sha.state.md.us/events/oce/thinkingbeyondpavement/tbtp.pdf" rel="nofollow">original document</a> on the Maryland State Highway Administration website.</font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2">"Also, there is other material in this article besides those lists, which I believe should preclude full deletion."</font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2">Thanks for considering this request.</font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2">--<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobisfried_1fd5.html" title="User:Hobisfried">Hobisfried</a> 16:25, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2">Thanks for your courteous reply. I appreciate your rigorous standards and welcome your suggestions. I realize that I have not met the burden of proof, and I would like your help understanding what conditions must be met to either prove that I have permission to use this material or prove that it is in the public domain. Since the source document is a <a href="http://www.sha.state.md.us/events/oce/thinkingBeyondPavement/tbtp.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.sha.state.md.us/events/oce/thinkingBeyondPavement/tbtp.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF</a> on the Maryland State Highway Administration website, would confirmation from a representative of that public agency be sufficient? I've already reviewed many pages pertaining to copyright protocol on Wikipedia, but I hope you'll be able to give an authoritative answer that will allow me to pursue a course of action free from doubt.</font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2">I understand that the most reasonable thing to do would be to find another way to convey the same ideas. However, the reason I'm resisting re-wording the disputed text is because my colleagues in the transportation planning field firmly believe this particular phrasing is intrinsic to the meaning of the term. Perhaps that stance is contrary to the very nature of Wikiedia, but I am trying to explore all available options to preserve the disputed wording before going another route.</font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2">I'm also curious as to why the entire article was deleted when the disputed text was only a portion of the whole. Is it possible to restore the remainder of the article?</font></p>

<p><font color="navy" size="2">it is insulting that an article for a notable do it yourself band {I.E a none signed band that has been on three tours thus far including a european one,} such as the pijin can not be added to wikipedia. Yet I see many inifinitely more pointless articles littering the server that don't deserve to be here. The moderation of this site is bigoted and hypocritical in nature. I propose you allow this article to be recreated and I shall spend a little more time adding images and information so you can see that this act are actually notable and unlike your pre conconceptions not a piece of petty trivia.. Toxic Pijin have been around for three years they have a wide cult fanbase in both europe and England. They have produced four albums in this time period I am very insulted by the fact I create a user name, log in, start to create and article and it is deleted twice and before I can add my coding to it you decide to protect it so I cannot recreate it again and add my further editing. Also I find it very hypocritical to send me a message claiming I am not contributing when in all fairness I have tried to contribute but you have deleted it twice!</font></p>

<p><font color="navy" size="2">re: toxic pijin I notice that I can claim the completed article as notable under point 3 . Criteria for musicians and ensembles - Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country,[1] reported in notable and verifiable sources. "There are, at present, no precise definitions of a "small", "medium" or "large" country in this context. However, a very limited definition of "small" will generally be used, excluding only a few of the world's smallest countries."</font></p>
<p><font color="navy" size="2">I therefore propose I produce links to reviews of their european tour last year and a scan of their media coverage. I have several reviews of their recent england "Oberon gisepe wemblequest" tour. I would also like to add that no other band in the world throws bread, brocoli, dog food at their audience and no other band has the balls to throw tabasco sauce in their eyes and express their pain through feedback and anger.. I am also sure no other band has songs about the number 27, tea breaks, ikea and preaching teachers who tell you to "get in the cupboard with jesus and think about what you've done". I admit I have a hard task ahead to convice you but they are worthy of inclusion due to the fact by their very nature the toxic pijin go out of their way to offend everyone.

It is fair that the reader shouldn't have to take the author's word for it when the words "renowned" and "notable" are used. As such, these assertions have now been backed up by references to the 24 state championships claimed by the club and the 11 SMCC players who have represented their countries at the highest level. In terms of achievement and contribution to the sport of cricket, these criteria are more reliable than the number of Google entries.</font></p>

My intention was definitely not to spam anyone, but W.marsh's initial concern was that those who had voted Keep in the first round didn't know about the second, and the agreement we had apparently reached involved notifying them (thus my comment to Awyong and the two others). When the nomination went up a third time on procedural grounds, I thought it was only fair to re-notify the Delete votes as well.

<h2><font color="navy" size="2"><span class="mw-headline">Album covers tagged by sockpuppet vandal</span></font></h2>
<p><font color="navy" size="2">Please be more careful when deleting images tagged with {{<a href="../../../n/o/_/Template%7ENo_source_a38c.html" title="Template:No source">no source</a>}}. A number of album cover images were tagged "no source" by a sockpuppet vandal (User:Aujin66), but for the most part the source of an album cover is obviously the album from which it came. See the discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Fair_use#Sockpuppet_Vandal_.2F_Deletion_of_Fair_Use_images" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Fair_use#Sockpuppet_Vandal_.2F_Deletion_of_Fair_Use_images" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you could restore these images it would be much appreciated. The following is a list of just some of the images... the majority of images deleted on 19 November were probably similar, and between 200 and 250 were tagged by the sockpuppet on 11 November.</font></p>

<p><font color="navy" size="2">RE: I do perceve it at vandalism. I do not, in good faith perceve it as vandalism in the first instance. I do perceve it as vandalism if they ignore repeated explainations on THEIR talk page (not the article's) that the content is not appropriate and simply make the same edit 6 times in a row (and several times before that). It's not a content dispute because there is no dispute - the person has made no communications, and if they did there would be no argument. An opinion "this song is similar to that song" has no basis on wikipedia - particularly without any citation. Nor is the fact that the same writer (who has written dozens and dozens of hit songs) happened to write these two, even arguably worth mentioning. The vandalism isn't the comment in itself. It's ignoring any discussion and repeatedly forcing it upon the articles. If I went into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> and kept writing "This is a really really great show, and the same guys created Futurama." in the lead, and ignored any request to stop adding that, I'd expect to get banned. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 16:30, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</font></p>

<p><font color="navy" size="2">Good evening.

<p><font color="navy" size="2">Do you think the site <a href="http://www.marbridgeconsulting.com/newsletter/archive/xunlei_bitcomet_cooperate_on_legal_video_downloads.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.marbridgeconsulting.com/newsletter/archive/xunlei_bitcomet_cooperate_on_legal_video_downloads.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.marbridgeconsulting.com/newsletter/archive/xunlei_bitcomet_cooperate_on_legal_video_downloads.htm</a> is a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Reliable_source.html" title="Reliable source">reliable source</a> that can prove <a href="../../../x/u/n/Xunlei.html" title="Xunlei">Xunlei</a> is notable enough?<br />
<br />
If not, read these tow articles here(<a href="http://blog.wenxuecity.com/blogview.php?date=200611&amp;postID=28091" class="external text" title="http://blog.wenxuecity.com/blogview.php?date=200611&amp;postID=28091" rel="nofollow">article one</a> , <a href="http://blog.wenxuecity.com/myblog.php?blogID=11131" class="external text" title="http://blog.wenxuecity.com/myblog.php?blogID=11131" rel="nofollow">article tow</a>) as well. Both of the articles come from blog. However, I am not sure whether articles from blog can be considered as <a href="../../../r/e/l/Reliable_source.html" title="Reliable source">reliable sources</a>.<br />
<br />
Besides the sources above, there are still somethings I intend to tell you. First , in my opinion, <a href="../../../x/u/n/Xunlei.html" title="Xunlei">Xunlei</a> is notable enough because one can easily find a lot of things, which are independent of Xunlei's company themselves, concering to <a href="../../../x/u/n/Xunlei.html" title="Xunlei">Xunlei</a> by using Google to search "Xunlei" as a key word. If you still do not believe, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=xunlei&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=xunlei&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">TRY HERE</a>!<br />
Second, it may be positive if you delete the article of <a href="../../../x/u/n/Xunlei.html" title="Xunlei">Xunlei</a>, because <a href="../../../x/u/n/Xunlei.html" title="Xunlei">Xunlei</a> is , indeed, nothing more than a malicious software that will cost a lot of problems(<a href="../../../x/u/n/Xunlei.html" title="Xunlei">Xunlei</a> decieve its users by lying them that there is no problem). On of these problems is as the number of Xunlei's user(they are mainly Chinese) keeps on increasing, the downlaod speed of non-Xunlei users will become more and more sluggish. So, to remove the article about <a href="../../../x/u/n/Xunlei.html" title="Xunlei">Xunlei</a> from wikipedia will certainly reduce Xunelie's probablity of becoming famous all over the world. Now I will not remove the "{{notability}}" in page of <a href="../../../x/u/n/Xunlei.html" title="Xunlei">Xunlei</a>, without your agreement. And I will try my best to find the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Reliable_source.html" title="Reliable source">reliable sources</a> for you.</font></p>

<p><font color="navy" size="2">Hi. You need to let me know why you want it deleted. I looked at it and I do see a link to alt.sex stories, etc., but most of the rest seems to be cell phone and news-related. Maybe I'm missing something, but I was under the impression that userspace is separate from Wikispace and that a user can, by and large, have whatever he wants on a page.

And I suppose I see how you'd want to get rid of it. However, I don't see anything negative or disruptive about his page. Therefore, at this time, I'm unwilling to get it deleted. Maybe you know of something specific this user has done... If I could give you some advice tho -- if this is deleted, it'll probably be recreated.
