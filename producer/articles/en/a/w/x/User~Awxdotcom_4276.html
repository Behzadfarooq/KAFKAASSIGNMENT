   <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wyclif_b026.html" title="John Wyclif">John Wyclif</a> (1328-1384), a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theologian.html" title="Theologian">theologian</a> at the University of <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> in England and founder of the <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lollard.html" title="Lollard">Lollard</a> reformist movement, had ideas that attacked the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>. He believed that there was absolutely no basis for the papal claim of temporal rule in scripture and suggested that this power be stripped away from the Church. <a href="../../../w/y/c/Wyclif.html" title="Wyclif">Wyclif</a> even went so far as to say that the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">pope</a> was the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antichrist.html" title="Antichrist">Antichrist</a>. He condemned the practices of <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrimage.html" title="Pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/n/Veneration_of_saints.html" title="Veneration of saints">veneration of saints</a> developed by the Medieval Church. <a href="../../../w/y/c/Wyclif.html" title="Wyclif">Wyclif</a> also believed that the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> was the most important if not only Christian guide to turn to and advocated its vernacularization.

<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hus_6869.html" title="John Hus">John Hus</a> (1374-1415), chancellor of the University of <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a> and leader of the Czech reformist movement, known as Hussism, was influenced by the <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lollard.html" title="Lollard">Lollard</a> teachings. He believed in the elimination of “worldliness” and corruption in the Church and also attacked the “excessive” power of the papacy. Feeling threatened by growing heresy the Council of Constance called <a href="../../../h/u/s/Hus.html" title="Hus">Hus</a> before them. Hus agreed to go under the alleged protection of Emperor Sigimund and hoped to have his opinions heard. Instead he was arrested, tried, and executed for heresy in 1415. His death sparked a revolution in Bohemia (the region containing Prague) called the Hussite wars. A truce was reached in 1436 ending the conflict.</p>

<p>3. In Fourteenth Century Europe the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Schism_68a7.html" title="Great Schism">Great Schism</a> was in full swing. In 1377 the Avignonese <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Gregory_XI_1ff9.html" title="Pope Gregory XI">Pope Gregory XI</a>, seeing the declining Avignonese papal prestige, returned to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> and promptly passed away in the Spring of 1378. The <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> world now faced a problem. If the predominantly French <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_Cardinals_49b1.html" title="College of Cardinals">College of Cardinals</a> would elect a French Cardinal to the papacy, they would surely return him to <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avignon.html" title="Avignon">Avignon</a>. To prevent this, during the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conclave.html" title="Conclave">conclave</a>, the people of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> threatened to kill any cardinal who left without electing a Roman or Italian pope. The Cardinals heeded the Roman threat and elected the Italian archduke of Bari, alias <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_VI_8bf2.html" title="Urban VI">Urban VI</a>, as pope (1378-1389). But the French Cardinals’ urbanity did not last long. Five months later the French Cardinals nullified <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_VI_8bf2.html" title="Urban VI">Urban VI</a>’s election, elected <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_VII_a0b6.html" title="Clement VII">Clement VII</a> pope, and returned to Avignon. As a result of this there were two popes, one in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> and One in <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avignon.html" title="Avignon">Avignon</a>, known as the “<a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Schism_68a7.html" title="Great Schism">Great Schism</a>.”</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Schism_68a7.html" title="Great Schism">Great Schism</a> abused the Christian world in several ways. First, different regions of the Christian world pledged allegiance to different papacies. The French, Scots, Spanish, and Southern Italians pledged allegiance to the Avignonese popes, while England, Germany, Scandinavia, and most of Italy followed the Roman popes. Another problem was that the two papal administrative systems meant half the revenue for the church than before, which, in turn, led two a doubling in taxes.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Schism_68a7.html" title="Great Schism">Great Schism</a> led to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conciliarism.html" title="Conciliarism">Conciliarism</a>. The founder of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conciliarism.html" title="Conciliarism">Conciliarism</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marsiglio_of_Padua_bff3.html" title="Marsiglio of Padua">Marsiglio of Padua</a> (1270?-1342), author of Defender of Peace and rector of the University of Paris, devised a systematic solution to the Church’s problems. He said that the church was a facet of society and must deal with its spiritual functions. He also argued that the Church is a communal endeavor deriving authority from all of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christendom.html" title="Christendom">Christendom</a>. The clergy had no special authority; rather it was their responsibility to administer the affairs of the church. The final authority should not be a single individual as it was with the pope’s authority. Instead there should be a council representing all members of the Church. Marsiglio was quoted saying, “no partial group or individual person of whatever status [the pope], has the authority to make such definitions.”</p>
<p>There was one problem. According to Church <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">doctrine</a>, only the pope could create such a council. Theologists argued and said that a council may be formed also by a group of <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerics.html" title="Clerics">clerics</a> or a secular source, especially the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Emperor_674b.html" title="Holy Roman Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>.</p>
<p>A group of cardinals formed the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Pisa_5c79.html" title="Council of Pisa">Council of Pisa</a> (1409). They formally deposed both popes and elected <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Alexander_V_0ad3.html" title="Pope Alexander V">Pope Alexander V</a> to the papacy. Unfortunately, the other two popes refused to step down from their papal offices, and Christianity was now faces with a greater disaster: three different popes serving at the same time.</p>
<p>Another council, the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Constance_367f.html" title="Council of Constance">Council of Constance</a> (1414-1418), was started to correct the mistakes of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Pisa_5c79.html" title="Council of Pisa">Council of Pisa</a>. This time it was the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Emperor_674b.html" title="Holy Roman Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> Sigismund, who convened it, and in 1417, the council disposed of all three popes and elected <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Martin_V_f725.html" title="Pope Martin V">Pope Martin V</a>, ending the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Schism_68a7.html" title="Great Schism">Great Schism</a> and that smudge in the history of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christendom.html" title="Christendom">Christendom</a>.</p>

<p>5. People took an active role in their salvation two main ways. The first way is through prayer and good deeds. People of the 14th Century often wrote clauses into their wills donating money to hospitals or other charitable sources. A major concern for Christians of the age was that of <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purgatory.html" title="Purgatory">Purgatory</a>, the place where the soul is purged, or purified, of its worldly sins before it can ascend to heaven. To solve this problem and hasten the soul’s ascension, people often started family chapels, in which priests said prayers and conducted masses for a loved one’s soul. Lastly, pilgrimages were used to aid in salvation. In pilgrimages, pilgrims could find their salvation without the involvement of clergy. The emphasis and popularity of pilgrimages during the time reflected a distrust of the organized Ecclesiastical hierarchy.</p>
<p>The second mode of salvation was through <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysticism.html" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a>. <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysticism.html" title="Mysticism">Mysticism</a> is defined as “the immediate experience of oneness with God”, and was best characterized in the teachings of <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meister_Eckhart_d5fe.html" title="Meister Eckhart">Meister Eckhart</a> (1260-1327). He said the union with God, or “birth of Christ”, that so characterizes mysticism, was attainable by those who pursued it wholeheartedly. Eckhart’s student, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Tauler_eb92.html" title="Johannes Tauler">Johannes Tauler</a> (1300-1361) added on to his master’s teachings that the soul needs to prepare for the union with God by expresing love of and devotion to God in everyday activities. Tauler and Eckheart’s teachings deepened the religious lives of clergy and laymen alike. Another important mystic, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerard_Groote_e0a2.html" title="Gerard Groote">Gerard Groote</a> (1340-1384), told people that to achieve unity one must emulate Jesus in that all his endeavors should be towards the greater good and to help those in need. He also emphasized simple piety and scripture based morals. The followers of his teachings formed the Brothers and Sisters of the Common life, a group that emphasized lay piety, emphasized the emulation of Christ through the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> and distributed Bibles to the lay (after the invention of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Printing_press.html" title="Printing press">printing press</a>). (The Grootian school of mysticism is also known as Modern Devotion.)</p>

<p>6. The German princes were a threat to the Church and surrounding states in the Empire. The issuing of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Bull_42a9.html" title="Golden Bull">Golden Bull</a> in 1356 by <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Charles_IV_d2e2.html" title="Emperor Charles IV">Emperor Charles IV</a> placed the election of the Holy Roman Empire into the hands of a new committee of four German princes and three archbishops. This new system of appointment for the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Emperor_674b.html" title="Holy Roman Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> was a threat to the Pope, because now he no longer had a say in who would become “the ruler of the world and the Christian people”. This system also allowed three different Emperors to claim the throne, sending Germany into a state of chaos with princes fighting for control.</p>
<p>The German princes also posed a threat to the Holy Roman Emperor. German states, such as Bavaria, Hesse, Brandenburg, and the Palatinate, built up strong independent armies and started governing in the ways of the independent monarchies of France, England and Spain in their fiscal and Roman judicial policies.</p>
