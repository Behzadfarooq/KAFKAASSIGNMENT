<p>To all who may read this, I am very proud to announce that this page is now "open for business". I have linked every medal that has an associated article. Please feel free to add new articles for those awards which are not yet described. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">User:Husnock</a> 23 June 2004</p>
<dl>
<dd>Great stuff! I suggest adding free (red) links for the other medals, so they'll "light up" when somebody creates an article starting from some other context. Just today I added a couple links to newly-created articles from old articles that should have had the free links and didn't. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 04:00, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yeah, thats a pretty good idea. I used to be agaist that, since I saw the red articles as "broken links". But, they do light up in every connected article once an article is written. I will probably not do that for every single decoration on the page. Just the ones that I know I will be working on the near future. Dont let that stop other people, though. Link away, I say -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">User:Husnock</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>As you can see, I went ahead and did as you suggested. Very good idea. I will now start the LONG process of writing articles on all the decorations. Hopefully others will contribute.</dd>

<p>To the loyal followers of this page, I tried to get it as a featured article, but that got shot down pretty quickly. How vain am I, but I find it a little amazing that anyone could say <i>negative</i> things about this article! Oh well. &#160;:-) -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">User:Husnock</a> 7 Jul 2004</p>

<dd>(As the one who objected to the article) - the rules for Featured articles (FA) more-or-less prohibit list-articles (or list-like articles) from becoming featured. Typically, what one does is "spin-off" the lists, and write an article solely about the topic at hand. For example, <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege.html" title="Siege">Siege</a> spun off <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sieges.html" title="List of sieges">List of sieges</a>, Margerent Thather spun off <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinets_under_Margaret_Thatcher_9e39.html" title="Cabinets under Margaret Thatcher">Cabinets under Margaret Thatcher</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Earth_f1cb.html" title="Middle Earth">Middle Earth</a> spun off a *lot* of lists, etc etc) I think that would be a good idea in this case. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 05:33, Jul 8, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I was just being vain. You are absolutely right, it IS a list article. One of the associated medals articles might be worthy, but this one is not. I took it off the candidate list as fast as I had put it on. Best- <a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">User:Husnock</a> 8 Jul 2004</p>

<dd>Excellent! I think tableization will be necessary in each section though, to get ribbons and names to line up properly. You'll also want to shrink the ribbon images a bit then, so the names don't get spread too far apart. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 04:59, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just finished a major picture upload, article rewrite, and revamp of the Second World War foreign medals section. I took out some of the rarer medals which weren't bestwoed that often. Among them the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_White_Lion_6441.html" title="Order of the White Lion">Order of the White Lion</a> of <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> and the senior medals of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_Islands_44d4.html" title="Philippine Islands">Philippine Islands</a>. If anyone notices a common World War II medal, which was awarded to U.S. troops and was omitted, please let me know. Enjoy the update! -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 20 Oct 2004</p>

<p>I dont know if there are any administrators out there watching this page, but this may be oif interest. I discovered this entire article, indeed half of Wilkipedia, has been copied over to the following webpage.</p>
<p><a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/" class="external free" title="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/" rel="nofollow">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/</a></p>
<p>The articles are carbon copies of the ones poste don this site, complete with links. It also is NOT a free website, in that I could see no way for the general public to edit or add things much like on Wilk. I guess that may be allowed, since this is all public info once its written. I just hope people over there are not claiming credit to articles which are written by the good people on this website.</p>

<p>I am pleased to announce that every decoration in this article now has a corresponding ribbon picture. Some of the articles have yet to be written, but the ribbon picturte download is compelte.

<dd>Hey Husnock, nice job on the section. However, I notice some of the ribbons need to be cleaned up. I am going to redraw the ribbons and post them as soon as I can. I will also post them up using the <a href="../../../p/n/g/PNG_5550.html" title="PNG">PNG</a> format. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 17:25, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have just performed a <b>MAJOR</b> revamping, expansion, and article creation project to branch out this article into the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilian_decorations_of_the_United_States_66b9.html" title="Civilian decorations of the United States">civilian decorations of the United States</a>. Eventually, this will hoepfully include every significant award of the federal government, most state awards, and the higher level local decorations to include police decorations.

<li>I personally do not think so, since there are many sites that list civilian awards. If an entire article cannot be used or produced, a few short lines will be good enough on the main medals/ribbons section. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 03:26, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I recently upgraded my web browser to Netscape 8 and discovered that the ribbons on the page now appear as straight columns and dont line up with the actual name of the award.

<dd>We might as well go full speed ahead and put pictures of the full sized medals. Most of the linked articles have them. If the sizing is consistent and it doesnt look too non-conform.

<p>Well, with the new medals pictures (which look really cool, by the way), I at last began the grand project to turn this into a disambig page.

<p>About 15 minutes ago, all pictures on Wikipedia started to strech to fit the thumbnail boxes, distorting over half the images on the website. IS this a thing with my browser?

<p>For those who follow this page, we seem to be experiancing a problem with some new users going into award articles and "updating them" which, in actuality, entails cutting and pasting (word for word) text about the medals from other websites to include the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_of_Heraldry_49ff.html" title="Institute of Heraldry">Institute of Heraldry</a> and the Center for Army History. We've already had problems with <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Asia_Service_Medal_9e44.html" title="Southwest Asia Service Medal">Southwest Asia Service Medal</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/w/Kuwait_Liberation_Medal_9b98.html" title="Kuwait Liberation Medal">Kuwait Liberation Medal</a> being effectively blanked and replaced with copyrighted info from other websites. Also, on <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple_Heart_4dee.html" title="Purple Heart">Purple Heart</a> a user pasted in a large segment of material word from word from another site.</p>
<p>I feel articles about medals may duplicate ther websites, in so far as the criteria, but never should a medals article simply be a mirror image of another site. We are not creating a backup Institute of Heraldry, but rather writing original articlesd to cinlude medals and awards info from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>I have already copyvio noticed two articles and encourage everyone to be aware of this kind of "shotgunning" where established articles are blanked and replaced with info from other sites -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 00:01, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
