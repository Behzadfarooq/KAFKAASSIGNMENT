<p><i>Where it is sold, evangelizers pay a lower price for the magazine, which is then resold to the public, <b>with the evangelizers keeping the profit</b>.</i> As far as I know this is not true, can someone offer any evidence of this? Gideon</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is based upon my first-hand experience. All WT publications were handled in this manner in Guatemala, being available to the pioneers at about two-thirds their "retail" price.

<dd>I am a Jehovah's Witness myself, and all publication is free to everyone. We who do the door to door work (or anyone who doesn't for whatever reason (health etc)) don't pay for them, and neither do those who accept them.

<dd>The literature is sold wherever it wouldn't be taxed. It was sold in the United States until the early 90's. You can verify this by calling the Mexico or Guatemala (or any of many countries) branches of the Jehovah's Witnesses, where they will tell you this.

<dd>A friend of mine rang the london Bethel (headquaters for Britain's printing and cordination etc) and they said that they are free to everyone everywhere. Although the Watchtower and Awake! USED to be sold, they no no longer are anyway. You ask me for proof that they are not sold, I ask for proof that they are, the fact that we say they are not sold should be proof enough. Please do not add false information.Zikar 17:22 23rd June 2004
<dl>
<dd>I would have put more credibility in your updating of my information if you seemed like a genuine Jehovah's Witness. However, your rude and hostile attitude, in addition being against Wikipedia policy and guidelines, is not like that I would expect from a genuine Jehovah's Witness. You weren't friendly at all, just hostile, rude, and accusatory. My information wasn't "false", it was just a little outdated. Please work on your attitude if you wish to be any part of Wikipedia, or any environment where you have to work with people. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamrolken_4544.html" title="User:Samrolken">Samrolken</a> 19:59, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, no need to get personal. I deleted that information, stating I was a witness at which point you changed it back before telling me flat out I was wrong... and told me to "Please stop editing stuff unless you come up with *proof* you're right." Aside from my word I have no proof, and neither do you, I just pointed this out. I would mention a few ways to improve your attitude too.. however I do feel that this is not the place to do it.

<dd>It's interesting that no one noted the prices for the magazines. It's been a while, but as I recall when we used to sell them here in the US they were $0.25 per copy, yes that's right, 25 cents each. So obviously nobody was getting rich off this! --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDannyMuse_9f6f.html" title="User:DannyMuse">DannyMuse</a> 17:14, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The prices have certainly changed over the years, as in 1919 $0.25 would have been quite costly for a magazine... It would be a difficult proposition to try and track the price changes over the years (and in the various countries of publication). Perhaps it would be better to mention that the price of the magazine usually closely reflected the printing and distribution costs. I recall reading that in several places, but will have to verify its factuality. -- <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberpenguin_c2a8.html" title="User:Uberpenguin">uberpenguin</a> 03:20, 2005 Jan 26 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since Awake! uses scriptures in many of its articles, I would say that calling it "general interest" doesn't really convey the right impression. I'm not sure exactly what I would suggest instead, but general interest doesn't sound like a magazine that promotes Bible morals and teachings in many of the articles.

<p>Well, the way I look at it, it is general interest, just looked at from a biblical standpoint... although often it has many section not related to religion in itself (moves on to religious bits later) For example, this Awake I have at hand deals with Movies, it gives a brief history of theatres in the US, describes the ins and outs of movie making, how marketing works, explains the rating systems etc only then moving onto the "What entertainment is suitable" line of discussion... next is a cool little story about some peeps adopting an injured sparrow and a scripture or two at the end, the next article focuses on butterflies of the Tropics... next is an article on Cibwa salt... then one on to 'Should Icons be used in Worship'... then an article on the flying squirrel... a few more articles, one being about food comes to the small article page thing called Watching the World that's more random bits of news than anything... over all I think it's very general interest. --Zikar 15:53, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see your point, though I'm not saying it doesn't cover general interest topics. My point is that it seems quite clear that the magazine has a religious agenda. On page 4 of the magazine under <i>Why Awake! is Published</i>, is says: <i>"Most important, this magazine builds confidence in the Creator's promise of a peaceful and secure new world that is about to replace the present wicked, lawless system of things."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even the WT site presents the Watchtower and Awake! together stating: <i>"Bible-based magazines with the largest distribution in the world. The Watchtower and Awake! both build confidence in the Creator's promise of a peaceful and secure new world. Each is published semimonthly; attractively illustrated."</i> <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/publications/publications_available.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.watchtower.org/publications/publications_available.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Due to this, I think the intro shouldn't say it is a "general interest" magazine, but simply a magazine published by JW. See examples (<a href="../../../e/n/s/Ensign_%28magazine%29.html" title="Ensign (magazine)">Ensign (magazine)</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Friend_cd8b.html" title="The Friend">The Friend</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Plain_Truth_7a94.html" title="The Plain Truth">The Plain Truth</a>). --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> 07:03, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can the magazine still be considered general-interest, given that in 2006 it's going to start being a glorified Watchtower-lite? Has the first 2006 issue even come out yet? Just writing about things that aren't the Bible doesn't make a magazine general-interest; the Watchtower has such articles too sometimes.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommstein_671e.html" title="User:Tommstein">Tommstein</a> 07:02, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first two are out and it's still general-interest. Current regular features are as follows:</p>
<p>"The Bible's Viewpoint", in odd-numbered months; "Young People Ask", in even-numbered months.</p>
<p>"Watching the World", in each issue, is normally followed by "From Our Readers".</p>
<p>"How Would You Answer?" appears on page 31, with the answers elsewhere in each issue.</p>
