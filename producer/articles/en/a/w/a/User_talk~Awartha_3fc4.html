<p>Hello--</p>
<p>I added the explanation to the claim that he's first in the world because the statement seems a little POV, and as far as I can tell, the world standings page doesn't have any explanation as to what the scores are based on. Do you think the article would be better without the statement? I feel it still needs to be clarified in some way, because I feel someone unfamiliar to figure skating would assume that Buttle was ranked first based on some single championship event (<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Figure_Skating_Championships_64b6.html" title="World Figure Skating Championships">Worlds</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Continents_Figure_Skating_Championships_4b9e.html" title="Four Continents Figure Skating Championships">4CC</a> come to mind), when other people have won those titles.</p>

<p>Hello, honestly I do not understand what else I shall write as a source for this article. I actually wrote a very long text as a source when I first touched this article. Please see the history and search for my name. The sources are, to say it again: A book with the title "Jahrbuch 1989 - DEV" (Yearbook 1989 - DEV (German Skating Association)) and the result lists of each competition at German figure skating championships as a paper copy. I bought these lists from the DEU, which is the German figure skating association. I freely admit English is not my mother-tongue, but you deleted the text where I explained it, but did not understand what it meant. Why don't you ask me? I am not a monster.

<p>Good day! I certainly don't want to start a revert war on an article that I don't care about (rather than very periferally). But I would like to note that its current abridged form may be rather misleading. If we simply say that <i>Ming Xu</i> "is a Chinese name where Ming is the family name and Xu is the given name" (which, of course, what "Ming Xu" would mean for the overwhelming majority of persons who are referred to in that way), then I think we should not immediately proceed without explanation to "<a href="../../../x/u/_/Xu_Ming_3830.html" title="Xu Ming">Xu Ming</a>" (for whom of course <i>Xu</i> is the family name) or General <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mingsioi.html" title="Mingsioi">Mingsioi</a> (whose family name we don't know, as the Manchus did not use family name together with the given name. <i>Ming</i> is simply the first syllable of his two-syllable Manchu personal name. I actully was wrong even spelling it with a space, but that would be a likely misspelling for somebody not aware of the convention). Otherwise we'll imply that these persons' family name is <i>Ming</i>, which it is not. If you want the disambig article short - but without factual incorrectness, something like this could do:</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ming Xu</b> is usually a Chinese name where <i>Ming</i> is the family name and <i>Xu</i> is the given name.</p>
<p><b>Ming Xu</b> may also refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../x/u/_/Xu_Ming_3830.html" title="Xu Ming">Xu Ming</a>, figure skater</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/i/n/Mingsioi.html" title="Mingsioi">Mingsioi</a> or Mingxu, a <a href="../../../q/i/n/Qing_Dynasty_4907.html" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing</a> Governor General of the <a href="../../../i/l/i/Ili_Kazakh_Autonomous_Prefecture_30a0.html" title="Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture">Ili Region</a>.</li>

<p>P.S. Incidentally, it seem that some other articles in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Category%7EChinese_figure_skaters_3680.html" title="Category:Chinese figure skaters">Category:Chinese figure skaters</a> may need to be renamed: right now some are named using the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_name.html" title="Chinese name">Chinese convention</a> - (e.g. <a href="../../../x/u/_/Xu_Ming_3830.html" title="Xu Ming">Xu Ming</a>, family name first), while others using the "Western" form (e.g. <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiaodong_Ma_732b.html" title="Xiaodong Ma">Xiaodong Ma</a> where <a href="../../../m/a/_/Ma.html" title="Ma">Ma</a> is the family name). It seems appropriate to rename them all into Last name, First name format, unless there is a good reason to keep somebody's name in a "Western" form. So you may end up creating a few more of those redirect pages - and then somebody else may want to make them into disambig pages... <a href="../../../v/m/e/User%7EVmenkov_4129.html" title="User:Vmenkov">Vmenkov</a></p>

<dd>I got rid of it to conform to standards used in other skating articles. DetailsLink looked messy and was easily overlooked. I didn't even notice that the page it linked to existed until I following "what links here" from <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Johansson_5c3e.html" title="Richard Johansson">Richard Johansson</a> and found myself in a page I'd never been before.

<dd>Ok, but two things: First, please use edit summaries so people can figure out what you are doing. A glance at your contributions list tells me that you rarely use them. Second, that article is more in line with other <b>Olympic</b> articles, and is intended to follow the standard formats used there. A recent discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Sports_Olympics_634a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Sports Olympics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Sports Olympics</a> had some consensus that merely wikilinking the event name to the event article was <i>less</i> distinctive than adding an identifiable word to show the link. It is still under discussion, so your input would be more helfpul to contribute your opinions than to make unexplained edits.

<p>Hello, actually I would disagree that that establishes notability. A subject (of any type) becomes notable by being featured in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">multiple nontrivial secondary sources</a>, although we have some good <i>secondary</i> guidelines such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> which offer some indications when that's more likely. Also, it would seem to me that the "highest level" for figure skating would <i>be</i> the Olympics, rendering the point moot in this case regardless. It seems he might meet the criteria, but I could find no secondary sources, so I'd like to leave the tag in place for now as all that's featured as a source is a statistics sheet. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 09:43, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, there are 319 google hits for him, so I wouldn't call him completely obscure. The highest level for figure skating are the ISU Championships, which are four championships held by the International Skating Union. They are the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Figure_Skating_Championships_64b6.html" title="World Figure Skating Championships">World Figure Skating Championships</a>, the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Junior_Figure_Skating_Championships_b256.html" title="World Junior Figure Skating Championships">World Junior Figure Skating Championships</a>, the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Figure_Skating_Championships_424b.html" title="European Figure Skating Championships">European Figure Skating Championships</a>, and the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Continents_Figure_Skating_Championships_4b9e.html" title="Four Continents Figure Skating Championships">Four Continents Figure Skating Championships</a>. To compete at those events, skaters have to be elite and at the highest level in their country. The World Figure Skating Championships are like the Olympics, except they happen every year. World Juniors is the same, except that it's targeted at skaters between the ages of 13 and 19 (but note the ages of competitiors at World Seniors. There's a major overlap, so what happens is that skaters at World Juniors are often skaters who just missed the Worlds team but are still skating at World Championship level). Senior level is Olympic level. Junior level is one below that, but junior level at ISU Championships is based on <i>age</i>, not <i>skill level</i>. Olympic champion <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Hughes_025b.html" title="Sarah Hughes">Sarah Hughes</a>, for example, could still have gone to World Juniors after winning the gold! <a href="../../../a/w/a/User%7EAwartha_adf6.html" title="User:Awartha">Awartha</a> 09:50, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do see quite a few Google hits for him, unfortunately most of those are not in English. (Or Spanish, I could help on that one too.) What you might want to do (if you can't translate the sources yourself of course!) is contact WP:TRANSLATE for some help translating source material into English. Really though, it's probably not that big a deal right now-the notability tag mentions deletion, but it doesn't call for it, it'll just categorize the article like all the maintenance tags do! <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 09:56, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's cool. Sorry if I come off grumpy. I've watched too many pages I've created get speedy deleted and prodded into extinction, while non notable skaters survive AfD.

<dd>Well, to me, sourcing matters more than hierarchy. Still, the article you created does have a notability assertion-A7 is only meant for articles in which there's absolutely no reason stated to believe the subject might be notable, vanity bios and the like, although unfortunately it does get misused sometimes. What you might want to do, though, is set up a userspace "sandbox" that you can use as an incubator for articles in progress until you've got a couple sources on them, that makes them quite a bit less likely to get nominated for deletion. I've got one going like that <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_sandbox_1_0ce9.html" title="User:Seraphimblade/sandbox/1">here</a>, I can certainly help you set it up if you should need. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 10:28, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's weird. I'm using the default skin, and your screencap is what I used to see, but now my page just stops after <i>See our policies and guidelines for more information on editing.</i> .

<dd>Nah, it sounds like we're both using the same (Monobook) skin, so I don't think it's that. Actually, I've just noticed I'm not seeing the list of templates when using Internet Explorer 6 (don't have 7 to test), but I do when using Firefox. In IE, I only see the same you've pasted above. Maybe it's a feature only possible in Firefox; maybe it's a bug. I'll try and research some more and let you know if I find any more info! —<a href="../../../x/h/a/User%7EXhantar_c10d.html" title="User:Xhantar">Xhantar</a><small><sup><a href="../../../x/h/a/User_talk%7EXhantar_46cf.html" title="User talk:Xhantar">Talk</a></sup></small> 23:18, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, wait a sec. I have Firefox setup to automatically log me into Wikipedia, but just about never use IE so I was editing the page anonymously when I tested, and didn't notice. Also, I have "Show preview on first edit" turned on under "my preferences" :: "Editing" tab, but the auto preview never happened in IE because I wasn't logged on. I could see the list of templates once I manually clicked on Preview, though, so it looks like you <i>have</i> to preview the page first, before it shows up. This I found out from the following comment in MediaWiki's <a href="http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/includes/EditPage.php?view=markup" class="external text" title="http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/includes/EditPage.php?view=markup" rel="nofollow">EditPage.php</a>:</dd>
