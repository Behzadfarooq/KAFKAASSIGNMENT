Tolkien</a>, the <b>Awakening of the Elves</b> is an event which marks the beginning of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Age_dfda.html" title="First Age">First Age</a> of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth.html" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>.</p>

<p>According to a legend of the <a href="../../../e/l/f/Elf_%28Middle-earth%29_b841.html" title="Elf (Middle-earth)">Elves</a>, the first Elves were awakened by <a href="../../../e/r/u/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar_b0d0.html" title="Eru Ilúvatar">Eru Ilúvatar</a> near the bay of <a href="../../../c/u/i/Cuivi%C3%A9nen.html" title="Cuiviénen">Cuiviénen</a>. The first Elf to awake was called <b>Imin</b> ("First"). Next to him lay <b>Iminyë</b>, who would become his wife. Near where Imin woke, awoke <b>Tata</b> ("Second") and <b>Tatië</b>, and <b>Enel</b> ("Third") and <b>Enelyë</b>.</p>
<p>Imin, Tata, and Enel and their wives joined up, and walked through the forests. They first came across six pairs of Elves, and Imin, as eldest, claimed them as his people, and woke them. After a short time Imin and his people, together with Tata and Enel, continued their journey. Next, they came across nine pairs of Elves, and Tata as second eldest, claimed them as his people. After a short time the now thirty-six Elves continued their journey. Then they found twelve pairs of Elves, and Enel, as third eldest, claimed them as his people.</p>
<p>For many days the now sixty Elves dwelt by the rivers, and they began to invent poetry and music.</p>
<p>Finally they set out again, but Imin thought to himself that since each time they had found more Elves, and his folk was least in size, he would now choose last.</p>
<p>They came across eighteen pairs of Elves, who were watching the stars, and Tata and Enel waited for Imin to claim them for his people, but Imin told them he would wait, so Tata added them to his folk. They were tall and had dark hair, and they were the fathers of most of the <a href="../../../n/o/l/Noldor.html" title="Noldor">Noldor</a> of later times.</p>
<p>The ninety-six Elves now spoke with each other and invented many new words, but then they continued their journey. Next they found twenty-four pairs of Elves, who were singing without language, and again Imin was offered the choice, but refused. Therefore Enel chose them as his people, and from them came most of the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindar.html" title="Lindar">Lindar</a> or singers of later times.</p>
<p>And the hundred and forty-four Elves now dwelt long together, until all had learned the same language, and they were glad. But then Imin said it was time to seek more companions for him, but most of the others were content and did not join him. So Imin and Iminyë and their twelve companions set out alone, and they searched long near Cuiviénen, but never found any more companions.</p>
<p>And because all Elves had been found in groups of twelve, twelve became the number they counted with ever after, and 144 was for long their highest number, and in none of their later tongues was there therefore any common name for a greater number.</p>
<p>After the tale of the Awakening of the Elves the <i>Companions of Imin</i> or the Eldest Company (the later <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanyar.html" title="Vanyar">Vanyar</a>) numbered fourteen, and they remained the smallest company. The <i>Companions of Tata</i> (half of whom became the Noldor) numbered fifty-six, and they remained the second-largest company. The <i>Companions of Enel</i> (the later Lindar or <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleri.html" title="Teleri">Teleri</a>) were the largest company, numbering seventy-four.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/e/l/Melkor.html" title="Melkor">Melkor</a> was the first to learn of the Awakening. He soon began sending evil spirits among the Elves, who planted seeds of doubt against the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vala_%28Middle-earth%29_3b8a.html" title="Vala (Middle-earth)">Valar</a>. It is also rumoured that some of the Elves were being captured by a Rider if they strayed too far, and the Elves later believed these were brought to <a href="../../../u/t/u/Utumno.html" title="Utumno">Utumno</a> and twisted into <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orc_%28Middle-earth%29_802b.html" title="Orc (Middle-earth)">Orcs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../o/r/o/Orom%C3%AB.html" title="Oromë">Oromë</a> one day came across the Elves, and realized who they were. At first the Elves were suspicious of him, fearing he was the Rider who captured the Elves, and because of the lies of Melkor. Nevertheless, three lords of the Elves agreed to come with Oromë to <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valinor.html" title="Valinor">Valinor</a>. These were <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingw%C3%AB.html" title="Ingwë">Ingwë</a> of the <i>Minyar</i> (later <i>Vanyar</i>), <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finw%C3%AB.html" title="Finwë">Finwë</a> of the <i>Tatyar</i> (later <i>Noldor</i>), and <a href="../../../e/l/w/Elw%C3%AB.html" title="Elwë">Elwë</a> of the <i>Lindar</i>. In due time, Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë returned to Cuiviénen, and told the Elves of the glory of Valinor, and there befell the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sundering_of_the_Elves_9185.html" title="Sundering of the Elves">Sundering of the Elves</a>. All the Minyar and half of the Tatyar were persuaded, along with most of the Lindar, and followed Oromë into the west on the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Journey_7c26.html" title="Great Journey">Great Journey</a>. These have been known ever since by the name <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldar.html" title="Eldar">Eldar</a>, or "Star-folk", which Oromë gave to them in their own language. The remainder of the Tatyar and Lindar remained suspicious, or simply refused to depart from their own lands, and spread gradually throughout the wide lands of Middle-earth. They were after known by the name <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avari.html" title="Avari">Avari</a>, meaning 'the Unwilling', because they refused the summons, in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quenya.html" title="Quenya">Quenya</a>, the language of the Eldar that eventually reached Valinor.</p>
<hr />
<p>The tale of Imin, Tata and Enel, known as <i><b>Cuivienyarna</b></i>, was a very late writing by Tolkien, written as part of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_War_of_the_Jewels_9729.html" title="The War of the Jewels">Quendi and Eldar</a></i>. They replaced Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë as the eldest Elves, who now merely became the first ambassadors and the Kings of the Elves in exile.</p>
