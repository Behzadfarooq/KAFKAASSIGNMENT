<p>The show pitted teams from two different schools against each other during the course of a week. Points gained by each contestant during the week would be totalled up to decide the winning school at the end of each week.</p>
<p><a name="Round_one" id="Round_one"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2A/m/A_mazing_9987.html" title="Edit section: Round one">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Round one</span></h3>
<p>In the first round of the game, a 90 second countdown timer begins and the contestants have to guess the answer to a question. The host begins by saying clues to the word or phrase one after another. Then he starts saying first letter is this, second letter is that and so on until the last letter. If the contestants still doesn't get it, Sherry spells the word or phrase out then says the answer. If a correct response is given, they would then have to spell out the answer by stomping out the letters on a large <a href="../../../q/w/e/QWERTY_keyboard_6a34.html" title="QWERTY keyboard">QWERTY keyboard</a> mounted in the floor. If the answer had two words, contestants don't need to hit the spacebar or enter key. After this, the countdown timer stops and contestants are awarded points depending on the time taken to correctly type the answer. The second school's contestants then do the same thing with the same number of letters as the first answer to make the rounds even and fair.</p>
<p><a name="Round_two" id="Round_two"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2A/m/A_mazing_9987.html" title="Edit section: Round two">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Round two</span></h3>
<p>After that, the first two contestants then enter the maze and attempt to collect the letters of the answer which are hidden in such places as a garbage can, or behind a mock cactus. The amount of time time they have to find these letters depends on how much time it took to guess and type the answer in the first round. Ten points is given for every letter they retrieve inside the maze before their time runs out.</p>
<p><a name="Round_three" id="Round_three"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2A/m/A_mazing_9987.html" title="Edit section: Round three">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Round three</span></h3>
<p>In the third round the contestants competed in a <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video game</a> face off. During the course of the show, several different gaming platforms were used. Originally, contestants played the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NES_8d93.html" title="NES">NES</a>, then <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Nintendo_60e0.html" title="Super Nintendo">Super Nintendo</a> and later <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_64.html" title="Nintendo 64">Nintendo 64</a>.</p>
<p>Games played include <i><a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetris.html" title="Tetris">Tetris</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubsy.html" title="Bubsy">Bubsy</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_Kong_Country_f6a8.html" title="Donkey Kong Country">Donkey Kong Country</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_Kong_Country_2_002a.html" title="Donkey Kong Country 2">Donkey Kong Country 2</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_Kong_Country_3_3bfc.html" title="Donkey Kong Country 3">Donkey Kong Country 3</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../w/a/v/Wave_Race_64_37db.html" title="Wave Race 64">Wave Race 64</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_Kart_5fe5.html" title="Super Mario Kart">Super Mario Kart</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Kart_64_0fbf.html" title="Mario Kart 64">Mario Kart 64</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Rush_6e89.html" title="San Francisco Rush">San Francisco Rush</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/r/c/MRC_a40b.html" title="MRC">MRC</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruis%27n_USA_c6b3.html" title="Cruis'n USA">Cruis'n USA</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/i/d/Diddy_Kong_Racing_ab64.html" title="Diddy Kong Racing">Diddy Kong Racing</a></i> and the fly-swatting <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minigame.html" title="Minigame">minigame</a> from <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Paint_6f94.html" title="Mario Paint">Mario Paint</a></i>.</p>
<p>The team with the most points/fastest time win 50 points for their team, while runners-up in this challenge win 25 points for their team. Should there be a tie (e.g. score the same number of coins in Super Mario Kart or hit the same number of flies in the fly-swatting minigame from Mario Paint), both teams score 25 points each. Originally 100 points were awarded to the winners and 50 points to the runners-up.</p>
<p><a name="Bonus_Round" id="Bonus_Round"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2A/m/A_mazing_9987.html" title="Edit section: Bonus Round">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bonus Round</span></h3>
<p>After the third round, the team with the highest score would then go back to the maze for 90 seconds (later changed to 120 seconds) to collect keys. One player will choose which side of the maze they want to explore. Only when that player exits that maze can the other player enter the other half of the maze. There were seven keys including a bonus one in the maze and each key was worth 100 points. If either of the contestants found the bonus key, then both of the contestants will each get an original <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Boy_a165.html" title="Game Boy">Game Boy</a>, which later became a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Boy_Pocket_e8c2.html" title="Game Boy Pocket">Game Boy Pocket</a>.</p>
<p>If there was a tie after the third round, a sudden death question was read out to both teams in the style of the first round, and whoever answered the question correctly would technically win the game for the day and go into the maze to find keys.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2A/m/A_mazing_9987.html" title="Edit section: Outcome">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Outcome</span></h2>
<p>By the end of the week, the school with the highest number of points would win a grand prize, often educational computer software. Other prizes include tickets to the Wet n Wild theme park in Australia.</p>
<p><a name="Trivia" id="Trivia"></a></p>

<ul>
<li>The only parts of the maze that remained for every series were (left to right, start to finish): the mirrored doors, the pirates cove, the desert, the bamboo walk, the yellow slide, the padded stairs and the penguins.</li>
<li>In the first series, players entering the left hand side of the maze would run past the ball pit, into the mirrored doors, through the toy shop, through the pipe into the pirates' cove, into the desert, up the ladder, across the bamboo walk, and down the yellow slide into the ball pit.</li>
<li>In the first series, players entering the right hand side of the maze would run up the steps, past the pots, through the curved red pipe, down the stairs, into the snowstorm, up the padded stairs, past the penguins, down the ice slide and into the foam pit.</li>
<li>In the second series, players entering the left hand side of the maze would go through an aquarium, into the mirrored doors, through the toy shop, through the pipe into the pirates' cove, into the desert, up the ladder, across the jungle walk, and down the yellow slide into the ball pit.</li>
<li>In the second series, players entering the right hand side of the maze would run up the steps, past the pots, through the curved red pipe, into a toilet house, down by the fireman's pole, get through the car, up the padded stairs, past the penguins, down the ice slide, into the pit and pass the three wheelie bins.</li>
<li>In the third series, players entering the left hand side of the maze would pass through the swiss cheese, into the mirrored doors, through the laboratory, through the revolving pipe, into the pirates' cove, into the desert, up the ladder, across the bamboo walk, pass through three Donkey Kongs, down the slide and into the ball pit.</li>
<li>In the third series, players entering the right hand side of the maze would pass through the pet shop, up the padded stairs, go through the castle themed platform with the zig-zag run, down the fireman's pole, through the dungeon, get through the car, pass the luggage and the four toilets before exiting the maze.</li>
<li>The lowest score ever scored in the first round was 5 points. After the green team finally answered "Todd Woodbridge" by having the host telling all the clues, saying the letters of the name and telling the answer himself, they struggled with spelling. This then meant they only had 5 seconds to find upto 14 letters in the maze. Unfortunately, they only got one letter, but had no value since they picked up a "S" and "Todd Woodbridge" doesn't have a "S" in it. They scored 5 points in the round.</li>
<li>There was only one occasion during the entire run of the show when host James Sherry was shown to venture onto the maze during the game portion of the show. During series two, one player from the winning team grabbed one key and got the key entangled in the fish net at the start of the left-hand side of the maze. After 30 seconds of trying to untangle it, James told them that the key was theirs. After the run, James ventured into the maze to count the keys they collected from the fish net.</li>
<li>Towards the end of the show's run, parts of the set from another show on the Seven Network, <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Masters_0bfc.html" title="Time Masters">Time Masters</a></i>, appeared on the set of A*mazing as part of the maze. The Ziz-Zag Run from the BrainStrain game appeared on the castle, and the Revolving Pipe replaced the green pipe at the entrance to the pirates' cove.</li>
<li>In one episode, the yellow school won the computer challenge, resulting in the yellow team winning the episode by one point. This resulted in one of the yellow team's contestants punching the air in triumph. However, the contestant punched host James Sherry in the head in the process.</li>
