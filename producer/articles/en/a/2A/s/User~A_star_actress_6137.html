<p>Hi! I'm A*star actress and I've been a member of the Wikipedia community for a while now. So far, I've loved it. If anyone wants to talk on my talk page, feel welcome. You may also make comments about my user page on my talk page.</p>
<p><a name="Astrology" id="Astrology"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2A/s/User%7EA_star_actress_6137.html" title="Edit section: Astrology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Astrology</span></h2>
<p>There are twelve astrological signs in the year. People born under each sign will, more likely than not, have the characteristics of their sign. Each of these unique astrological signs and the people born under them are described below.</p>
<p><a name="Aquarius" id="Aquarius"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2A/s/User%7EA_star_actress_6137.html" title="Edit section: Aquarius">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aquarius</span></h3>
<p>January 20 - February 18</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>You can recognize the ones born under the sign of the Water Bearer because they're the ones starting their own trends instead of following everyone else. Independent and unique, they don't believe in cliques, but invite everyone to sit at their lunch table. Once they get to know you, you can count on them to be a loyal friend. Water Bearers are known for their beauty, but would rather be judged for their deeds and abilities than for their looks. Their quest for knowledge makes Water Bearers excellent scientists and their love of people makes teaching a perfect Aquarius profession.</i></p>

<p>February 19 - March 20</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>You know the friend who always seems to know something's wrong before you mention it - the one who's a great listener? You can bet that they're born under the sign of the Fish. Is it that aura of mystery around them or just their easygoing nature that draws everyone to Pisces? While they love being with the whole gang, Pisces individuals are also known to slip into their own dream world. Medicine is a perfect career for compassionate Pisces. Couple their kindness with their strong spirituality and Pisces make powerful religious leaders as well.</i></p>

<p>March 21 - April 19</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Those born under the sign of the Ram are natural leaders. Whether student council president or basketball team captain, they take their duties seriously. Confident and enthusiastic, Aries individuals are driven to succeed and take everyone with them. They're just as likely to be helping a teammate with that jump shot as to be working on their own. Rams love to participate in sports, and Aries girls are seen as "one of the guys" - until they turn on that charm. Their intellect and curiosity make Aries good explorers and doctors. Whatever the profession, you'll find Aries taking the lead.</i></p>

<p>April 20 - May 20</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Social yet hard working, blessed with both fashion sense and common sense, you might find those born under the sign of the Bull planning the next school dance or writing the advice column for the school newspaper. If a Taurus individual is planning the dance, eat before you go, because the Taurus is known for being thrifty. And expect the advice Taurus doles out to be honest but compassionate, because Bulls are also known for their integrity and kindheartedness. A wide variety of careers are good for Taurus, including medicine, architecture, banking, and fashion design.</i></p>

<p>May 21 - June 21</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Have you ever heard the nursery rhyme that goes "...when she was good, she was very, very good, and when she was bad, she was horrid?" That was probably written about a Gemini. Blame it on the fact that they were born under the sign of the Twins, but it's like they're two people rolled into one. Intelligent and witty, Geminis are never satisfied doing one thing at a time, but need to be juggling lots of things. Fun and funny Geminis make good friends and are never boring. Good career choices for logical, rational Geminis include law and journalism.</i></p>

<p>June 22 - July 22</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The caretakers, the organizers - you know - the "moms" of the world, are often the ones born under the sign of the Crab. Always looking out for others, the Cancer person is likely the one organizing the winter mitten or Thanksgiving food drives. And because of their excellent organizational skills and enormous group of friends, these drives are huge successes. The phone is always ringing at sympathetic Cancer's house with friends calling with problems, and caring Cancer never lets them down. Their interest in people make journalism and politics good career choices.</i></p>

<p>July 23 - August 22</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Just as the lion is "king of the jungle," those born under the sign of the Lion strive to be the center of attention. Dynamic, dramatic, and creative, you will never be mislead by a Leo. What you see is what you get with this most honest of all zodiac signs. Still, you might get tired of Leo always being in the spotlight. Count on Leo to be "king of the jungle" in their career as well. If they're in politics, they'll be governor or president. If a Leo is an entertainer, they're sure to be a star.</i></p>

<p>August 23 - September 23</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The saying "still waters run deep" might have been written about those born under the sign of the Virgin. They're so quiet, Virgos might go unnoticed in the crowd, but they're paying attention and analyzing every move. They're so shy, Virgos might have some trouble making friends, but once they do they're devoted for life. Virgos have strong ideas of right and wrong and live their life by this code. You won't find a Virgo cheating on a test or taking something that isn't theirs. Intelligent and analytical, Virgo's strong eye for details make them excellent bookkeepers, accountants, and editors.</i></p>

<p>September 23 - October 23</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Born under the sign of the Scales, sociable Libra is the one throwing yet another wonderful party. Outgoing and full of charm, even if Libra isn't hosting the party, they're probably still the one making sure no one's fighting and everyone's happy. Libra can't stand conflict and will often give in to avoid a fight. You'll find them running back and forth between friends helping to smooth out their problems as well. This sensitivity to others makes counseling a good Libra profession. Their artistic abilities also make them well suited to be writers, artists, or interior decorators.</i></p>

<p>October 24 - November 21</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>That intense, mysterious person, whom you can't quite figure out...you know the one whom everyone's curious about? Well, they might very well be born under the sign of the Scorpion. Scorpion individuals don't run in a crowd but will have one or two close friends they're dedicated to. Private Scorpio won't even share their secrets with them. Yet there's something about Scorpio that makes others share their deepest secrets. Scorpio people tend to possess great wisdom and strong reasoning skills, so good career matches include psychologist, detective, and even spy.</i></p>

<p>November 22 - December 21</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Don't look for those born under the sign of the Archer couch potatoing in front of the TV. Instead of watching the big game, they've organized their own. These outgoing, witty, and profound lovers of travel can be counted on for FUN!! Raising money for a cause? It's Sagittarius who'll come up with the idea, organize the event, and see it through. They have great organizational skills and are always ready to fight for the underdog. With so many gifts, Sagittarius can be almost anything, but some top career choices include teacher, coach, or anything else that involves travel.</i></p>

<p>December 22 - January 19</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>While the rest of the class is worrying about getting the big paper done, those born under the sign of the Goat have already finished it. Self-disciplined and hard working, Capricorn will have crossed the paper off their to-do list and moved on to the next assignment. Capricorn individuals are competitive and ambitious, but they're not trying to best you. They're trying to outdo themselves, setting even higher goals to reach. Capricorn might seem cold, but once you get to know them, they'll be your friends for life. Math and money professions appeal to logical Capricorn, and they also make excellent teachers.</i></p>

<p>There are a lot of facts on this page, and I can't be 100% positive that all of them are 100% accurate. I wish I could be, but I'm sure that there's at least one fact that isn't 100% accurate.</p>

<p>1. Ostriches are often not taken seriously. They can run faster than horses, and the males can roar like lions.</p>
<p>2. Seals used for their fur get extremely sick when taken aboard ships.</p>
<p>3. Sloths take two weeks to digest their food.</p>
<p>4. Guinea pigs and rabbits can't sweat.</p>
<p>5. The pet food company Ralston Purina recently introduced, from its subsidiary Purina Philippines, power chicken feed designed to help roosters build muscles for cockfighting, which is popular in many areas of the world.</p>
<p>6. According to the Wall Street Journal, the cockfighting market is huge: The Philippines has five million roosters used for exactly that.</p>

<p>223. The African lungfish can live out of water for up to four years.</p>
<p>224. Cats can run slightly more than 30 miles per hour.</p>
<p>225. Male birds actually do most of the singing, primarily to stake out their territory and to invite females of their species over to mate. Females tend to select as mates those male birds who sing the most. It is believed they do this not because they like the quality of the singing, but because they have learned the males who sing the most have the most food in their territory. Since the male doesn't have to spend much time hunting for food, it has more time to sing.</p>
<p>226. At birth a panda is smaller than a mouse and weighs about four ounces.</p>
<p>227. The flying gurnard, a fish, swims in water, walks on land, and flies through the air.</p>

<p>232. A camel can lose up to 30 percent of its body weight in perspiration and continue to cross the desert. A human would die of heat shock after sweating away only 12 percent of body weight.</p>
<p>233. There are about 500 different kinds of cone snails around the world. All have a sharp, modified tooth that stabs prey with venom like a harpoon. Most cone snails hunt worms and other snails, but some eat fish. These are the ones most dangerous to people. The nerve toxin that stops a fish is powerful enough to also kill a human.</p>
<p>234. The leech has 32 brains, 32 more than most humans.</p>
<p>235. The blow of a whale has a strong, foul odor. It apparently smells like a combination of spoiled fish and old oil. Because whales have such terrible breath, sailors believed at one time that a whiff of it could cause brain disorders.</p>

<p>285. A cow's sweat glands are in the nose.</p>
<p>286. City squirrels will eat just about anything, and often, it's the junk food that people offer them that they prefer, like Cracker Jack peanuts. Many naturalists have concluded that a peanut diet is harmful to squirrels: it seems to result in a weakening of eyesight and a thinning of the animal's pelt.</p>
<p>287. A skunk will not bite and throw its scent at the same time.</p>
<p>288. The Mola Mola, or Ocean Sunfish, lays up to 5,000,000 eggs at one time.</p>
<p>289. Mother prairie dogs will nurse their young only while underground in the safety of the burrow. If an infant tries to suckle above ground, the mother will slap it.</p>
<p>290. The more that is learned about the ecological benefits of bats, the more home gardeners are going out of their way to entice these amazing winged mammals into their neighborhoods. Bats are voracious insect eaters, devouring as many as 600 bugs per hour for 4 to 6 hours a night. They can eat from one-half to three-quarters their weight per evening. Bats are also important plant pollinators, particularly in the southwestern U.S.</p>
<p>291. The chameleon has a tongue that is 1.5 times the length of its body.</p>
<p>292. Mother-of pearl is not always white. It can be pink, blue, purple, gray, or even green. Nor is it produced only by the pearl oyster. The abalone and the pearl mussel both have shells that are lined with fine-quality mother-of-pearl.</p>
<p>293. Orcas (killer whales) kill sharks by torpedoing up into the shark's stomach from underneath, causing the shark to explode.</p>
<p>294. Boredom can lead to madness in parrots. When caged by themselves and neglected for long periods of time, these intelligent, sociable birds can easily become mentally ill. Many inflict wounds upon themselves, develop strange tics, and rip out their own feathers. The birds need constant interaction, affection, and mental stimulation; some bird authorities have determined that some parrot breeds have the mental abilities of a 5-year-old human child. Should a neglected parrot go mad, there is little that can be done to restore it to normalcy. In England, there are "mental institutions" for such unfortunate creatures.</p>
<p>295. The smallest of American owls, the elf owl, often nests in the Gila woodpecker’s cactus hole after the woodpecker leaves. The owl measures barely 6 inches tall. It specializes in catching scorpions, seizing each by the tail and nipping off its stinger. It then swallows the scorpion’s body, pincers and all.</p>
<p>296. As much as 40-percent of the entire world's varieties of freshwater fish are to be found in the Amazon River basin. There are about 8,600 species of birds in the entire world, and more than half of them are also represented in this area.</p>

<p>299. Cats can run slightly more than 30 miles per hour.</p>
<p>300. Male birds actually do most of the singing, primarily to stake out their territory and to invite females of their species over to mate. Females tend to select as mates those male birds who sing the most. It is believed they do this not because they like the quality of the singing, but because they have learned the males who sing the most have the most food in their territory. Since the male doesn't have to spend much time hunting for food, it has more time to sing.</p>
<p>301. At birth a panda is smaller than a mouse and weighs about four ounces.</p>
<p>302. The flying gurnard, a fish, swims in water, walks on land, and flies through the air.</p>
<p>303. Contrary to popular belief, elephants are not afraid of mice, and they do not have any better memory than any other animal.</p>

<p>309. Gorillas do not know how to swim.</p>
<p>310. A 4-inch-long abalone can grip a rock with a force of 400 pounds. Two grown men are incapable of prying it up.</p>
<p>311. A bird "chews" with its stomach. Since most birds do not have teeth, a bird routinely swallows small pebbles and gravel. These grits become vigorously agitated in the bird's stomach and serve to grind food as it passes through the digestive system.</p>
<p>312. A bird sees everything at once in total focus. Whereas the human eye is globular and must adjust to varying distances, the bird's eye is flat and can take in everything at once in a single glance.</p>
<p>313. There are about 40 different muscles in a bird’s wing.</p>
<p>314. A bison can jump 6 feet.</p>
<p>315. There are about 5,000 species of coral known. Only about half of them build reefs.</p>

<p>11. Fleas can jump more than 200 times their body length.</p>
<p>12. Crickets don't chirp by rubbing their legs together, they make the noise by rubbing their wings together.</p>
<p>13. The social life in ants and termites has been accompanied by an extraordinary royal perk: a 100-fold increase among queen ants in average maximum lifespan, with some queens surviving for almost 30 years. This longevity can be attributed in part to the sheltered and pampered life of the royal egg layer.</p>
<p>14. Between 20,000 and 60,000 bees live in a single hive. The queen bee lays nearly 1,500 eggs a day and lives for up to 2 years. The drone, whose only job is to mate with the queen bee, has a lifespan of around 24 days—he has no sting. Worker bees - all sterile females - usually work themselves to death within 40 days, collecting pollen and nectar. Worker bees will fly p to 9 miles to find pollen and nectar, flying at speeds as fast as 15 mph.</p>
<p>15. There are 4,300 known species of ladybugs in the world.</p>
<p>16. You're more likely to get stung by a bee on a windy day that in any other weather.</p>
<p>17. The tarantula spends most of its life within its burrow, which is an 18-inch vertical hole with an inch-wide opening. When male tarantulas are between the ages of 5 to 7 years, they leave the burrow in search of a female, usually in the early fall. This migration actually signals the end of their life cycle. The males mate with as many females as they can, and then they die around mid-November.</p>
<p>18. Until very recently, no centipede was found that did not have an ODD number of leg pairs. Usually the number varies from 15 to 191 pairs, all odd. No one knows why. However, Chris Kettle, a doctoral student in ecology, recently found a centipede with 48 pairs of legs, an even number. The remarkable discovery was presented to the International Congress of Myriapodology in Poland and featured in the science journal Trends in Genetics. Mr. Kettle suspects a genetic mutation is responsible for the even number of leg pairs.</p>
<p>19. 62 degrees Fahrenheit is the minimum temperature required for a grasshopper to be able to hop.</p>
<p>20. Mosquitoes prefer children to adults, and blondes to brunettes.</p>
<p>21. Spiders have transparent blood.</p>
<p>22. There are more insects in one square mile of rural land than there are humans on the entire earth.</p>
<p>23. A spiders web is made of two types of silk, one sticky and the other not. The spider begins the web with the non sticky silk and forms the "spokes". After the frame is constructed and secure, the spider goes back with the sticky silk and completes the web design we are so familiar with, connecting spoke to spoke. They will also add rows connecting the spokes to allow them access for web maintenance. Spend time watching a spider and you will see that they painstakingly avoid the sticky silk and walk on the spokes. Should the spider be startled and walk in the sticky silk it will affix to the spider the same as it would you or any thing else. Spiders recycle their webbing, so a spider that gets stuck in its own web may eat its way out.</p>
<p>24. Some crickets burrow megaphone-like tunnels that help transport the sound of their chirps as far as 2,000 feet away.</p>
<p>25. A bee could travel 4 million miles (6.5 million km) at 7 mph (11km/h) on the energy it would obtain from 1 gallon (3.785 liters) of nectar.</p>

<p>27. A fly can react to something it sees and change direction in 30 milliseconds.</p>
<p>28. A housefly can transport germs as far as 15 miles away from the original source of contamination.</p>
<p>29. A mature, well-established termite colony with as many as 60,000 members will eat only about one-fifth of an ounce of wood a day.</p>
<p>30. The silkworm's silk comes out of its mouth as a thread of gooey liquid, so that nice silk blouse you spent a fortune on is really just worm spit.</p>
<p>31. Some spiders have as many as eight eyes.</p>
<p>32. The monarch butterfly's sense of taste is about 12,000 times more sensitive than a human's.</p>
<p>33. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the best time to spray household insects is 4:00 p.m. Insects are most vulnerable at this time.</p>
<p>34. After mating, the female black widow spider turns on her partner and devours him. The female may dispatch as many as twenty-five suitors a day in this manner.</p>
<p>35. An ant can survive for up to two weeks underwater.</p>
<p>36. Ants stretch when they wake up. They also appear to yawn in a very human manner before taking up the tasks of the day.</p>
<p>37. On an average day, a queen bee lays about 1,500 eggs.</p>
<p>38. Bees have been known to cure rheumatism.</p>
<p>39. A mosquito has 47 teeth.</p>
<p>40. Tarantulas do not use muscles to move their legs. They control the amount of blood pumped into them to extend and retract their legs.</p>
<p>41. Any Female bee in a beehive could have been the queen if she had been fed the necessary royal jelly. All female bees in a given hive are sisters.</p>
<p>42. The longest species of centipede is the giant scolopender (Scolopendra gigantea), found in the rain forests of Central and South America. It has 23 segments (46 legs) and specimens have been measured up to 10.5 inches long and 1" in diameter.</p>
<p>43. Female mosquitoes will obtain blood from humans and animals, but only to nourish their eggs. Their food actually consists of nectar and other plant juices.</p>
<p>44. Ladybugs bleed to protect themselves. When alarmed, they release drops of a reddish or yellowish bitter tasting liquid from their mouths and from the pores at their joints. This repels prospective attackers.</p>
<p>45. Certain kinds of insects can live as long as a year after having their head severed. What's more, the insects can still react to stimuli, such as light and temperature.</p>
<p>46. March 14 is "Save a spider day."</p>
<p>47. The beautiful but deadly Australian sea wasp (Chironex fleckeri) is the most venomous jellyfish in the world. Its cardiotoxic venom has caused the deaths of 66 people off the coast of Queensland since 1880, with victims dying within 1-3 minutes if medical aid is not available.</p>
<p>48. The leaf bug of ceylon (phyllum sicci folium) has legs and antennae the color and shape of leaves, has indentations on its body like the vein marks on a leaf, and hangs from branches, swaying in the breeze exactly like a leaf.</p>
<p>49. The black widow spider can devour as many as twenty 'mates' in a single day.</p>
<p>50. Tarantulas are poisonous, but the concentration of the venom in those found in North America is low enough that they're usually not a threat to human life. In fact, some people keep them as pets.</p>

<p>105. A tenth of the 7 million tons of rice grown in the U.S. each year goes into the making of beer.</p>
<p>106. According to the National Safety Council, coffee is not successful at sobering up a drunk person, and in many cases it may actually increase the adverse effects of alcohol.</p>

<p>119. Over 15 billion prizes have been given away in Cracker Jacks boxes.</p>
<p>120. The Chinese developed the custom of using chop sticks because they didn't need anything resembling a knife and fork at the table. They cut up food into bite-sized pieces in the kitchen before serving it. This stemmed from their belief that bringing meat to the table in any form resembling an animal was uncivilized and that it was inhospitable, anyway, to ask a guest to cut food while eating.</p>
<p>121. The first frozen foods were launched back in the mid-1920s. (Of course, the microwave to cook them in took a while longer!) Clarence Birdseye came up with the idea from his work with the US government surveys of fish and wildlife in Labrador in 1912 and 1915. While working on the surveys, he noted that the natives preserved their fish in ice. He claimed: "I saw natives catching fish in fifty below zero weather, which froze stiff as soon as they were taken out of the water. Months later, when they were thawed out, some of those fish were still alive." Birds Eye's first products were individually boxed packages of peas, cherries, berries, spinach, fish, and meats. Birds Eye products, of course, are still sold.</p>

<p>129. Sometimes vanilla ice cream looks as if it has bits of chocolate in it, as if only that could make the flavor acceptable. What are those dark specks, anyway? If you thought they might be parts of vanilla beans, you're right. But they're only the flavorless residue of the bean. Companies put them in just for show, to prove that they used real beans and not artificial flavor.</p>
<p>130. What is the difference between a yam and a sweet potato? According to the Mayo Clinic dietician, a true yam is a large, starchy root that can get up to 100 pounds. It is native to Africa and Asia and is seldom available in the USA. The sweet potato is a native American plant. It was a staple for early settlers and was actually brought to Europe by Columbus. There are two varieties of sweet potatoes: One is moist and orange-fleshed, the other is drier and yellow. The orange-fleshed potato is commonly - and incorrectly - called a yam. This common practice has resulted in confusion when it comes to labels. Some stores incorrectly label the darker of the two sweet potatoes as being a yam, and they list the nutrient content for yams. True yams have no vitamin A. So consumers mistakenly think that the product has no vitamin A, even though it actually does. Consumers are most likely eating sweet potatoes - and sweet potatoes are rich in vitamin A, vitamin C and fiber.</p>
<p>131. Juan Metzger, a former Dannon Co. executive, is credited with putting fruit in yogurt.

<p>132. Ice Cream Sundaes were created when it became illegal to sell ice cream with flavored soda on a Sunday in the Evanston, Illinois during the late 19th century. Some traders got round it by serving it with syrup instead, calling it an 'Ice Cream Sunday' and eventually replacing the final 'y' with an 'e' to avoid upsetting religious leaders.</p>

More than 5,000 years ago, the Chinese discovered how to make silk from silkworm cocoons. For about 3,000 years, the Chinese kept this discovery a secret. Because poor people could not afford real silk, they tried to make other cloth look silky. Women would beat on cotton with sticks to soften the fibers. Then they rubbed it against a big stone to make it shiny. The shiny cotton was called "chintz." Because chintz was a cheaper copy of silk, calling something "chintzy" means it is cheap and not of good quality. 4. The pharaohs of ancient Egypt wore garments made with thin threads of beaten gold.

Griffith wanted actress Seena Owen to have lashes that brushed her cheeks, to make her eyes shine larger than life. A wigmaker wove human hair through fine gauze, which was then gummed to Owen's eyelids. "Intolerance" was critically acclaimed but flopped financially, leaving Griffith with huge debts that he might have been able to settle easily - had he only thought to patent the eyelashes. 26. On November 29, 1941, the program for the annual Army-Navy football game carried a picture of the Battleship Arizona, captioned: "It is significant that despite the claims of air enthusiasts no battleship has yet been sunk by bombs."

Leonardo da Vinci could write with one hand and draw with the other at the same time. 28. During the California Gold Rush of 1849 miners sent their laundry to Honolulu for washing and pressing. Due to the extremely high costs in California during these boom years it was deemed more feasible to send the shirts to Hawaii for servicing. 29.

Spiral staircases in medieval castles are running clockwise. This is because all knights used to be right-handed. When the intruding army would climb the stairs they would not be able to use their right hand which was holding the sword because of the difficulties of climbing the stairs. Left-handed knights would have had no troubles, except left-handed people could never become knights because it was assumed that they were descendants of the devil. 48. Charles de Gaulle's final words were, "It hurts." 49. Alexander the Great was an epileptic. 50. Shakespeare spelled his OWN name several different ways. 51.

The name of the ship in his novel - The Titan. 60. George Washington, who was nearly toothless himself, was meticulous with the teeth of the six white horses that pulled his presidential coach. He had their teeth picked and cleaned daily to improve their appearance. 61. Once upon a time, in the little state of Rhode Island, they were electing a state legislature. There was a thrifty Federalist farmer who started for the polls late in the afternoon and, on the way, heard the squealing of a pig. He looked around to see the pig with its head caught in the mesh of an old wire fence. Hogs often will kill and eat a trapped pig. So the farmer stopped to rescue the porker and was too late at the polls. Now, wait a minute. The Federalist farmer was too late to vote, and, the election was decided by a one-vote margin in favor of the Democrats. If the farmer had been at the voting place in time, the Democrat would not have been elected. One vote. At the following session of the legislature (these were the days when the legislatures elected our Senators) a Democrat was sent to the Senate from Rhode Island by a one-vote margin in the legislature. Try to keep up with this. The legislator was elected by one vote and his one vote elected a Senator. And in the United States Senate the vote that we should go to war with England was carried by the one Democrat margin. So the Revolutionary War was fought because, a Rhode Island pig got caught in a fence. One vote. A vote was taken on which would be the national language - English or German. English by one vote. Dr. George Benson of Harding College traced this sequence: One morning in 1844 a grain miller in De Kalb County, Indiana, was walking toward his mill. It was election day, but he had work to do and did not intend to vote. Before he reached the mill, however, he was stopped by friends who persuaded him to go to the polls. As it happened the candidate for whom he voted won a seat in the state legislature, by a margin of one vote. When the Indiana Legislature convened, the man elected from De Kalb cast the deciding vote that sent Edward Allen Hannegan to the United States Senate. Then, in the United States Senate the question of statehood for the great state of Texas came up, the result was a tie vote. But Senator Hannegan, presiding as President pro tempore, cast the deciding vote from the chair. So the Lone Star state of Texas was admitted to the Union because a miller in De Kalb County, Indiana, went ten minutes out of his way to cast his one vote, just one vote. Thomas Jefferson was elected President by one vote in the Electoral College. So was John Quincy Adams. And so was Rutherford B. Hayes, elected President, by one vote. One vote gave statehood to California, Idaho, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. All those people in all those states are Americans because of somebody's one vote. Kentucky came into the Union as a slave state, by the casting of one majority vote in the Constitutional Convention. Had it not been for the one vote, Kentucky would have entered the Union a free state. If it had, Missouri, largely settled by Kentuckians, would have done likewise. In that event there probably never would have been a war between the states. And closer to home the Draft Act of World War II, passed in the House of Representatives, by just one vote. One vote. In St. Johns, Michigan, the race for City Council (two seats, four candidates) was a one-vote wonder. The top three candidates were separated by one vote each. Election results showed Bates with 27%, Hanover with 27% and Huard with 27%. Mark Bates had one more vote than Heather Hanover, who had one more vote than Roland Huard. 62.

Barbero fired a guided missile carrying 3,000 letters at the Naval Auxiliary Air Station in Mayport, Florida. "Before man reaches the moon," the official was quoted as saying, "mail will be delivered within hours from New York to California, to Britain, to India or Australia by guided missiles." History proved differently, but this experiment with missile mail exemplifies the pioneering spirit of the Post Office Department when it came to developing faster, better ways of moving the mail.... however, they don't mention if the 3,000 letters were ever delivered. 95. Chrysler built B-29's that bombed Japan, Mitsubishi built Zeros that tried to shoot them down. Both companies now build cars in a joint plant called Diamond Star. 96.

History's first recorded toothpaste was an Egyptian mixture of ground pumice and strong wine. But the early Romans brushed their teeth with human urine, and also used it as a mouthwash. Actually, urine was an active component in toothpaste and mouthwashes until well into the 18th century - the ammonia it contains gave them strong cleansing power. 103. The 16th century astronomer Tycho Brahe lost his nose in a duel with one of his students over a mathematical computation. He wore a silver replacement nose for the rest of his life. 104.

DaVinci is best remembered as the painter of the Mona Lisa (1504?)and The Last Supper (1495). But he's almost equally famous for his astonishing multiplicity of talents: he dabbled in architecture, sculpture, engineering, geology, hydraulics and the military arts, all with success, and in his spare time doodled parachutes and flying machines that resembled inventions of the 19th and 20th centuries. 111. DaVinci made detailed drawings of human anatomy, which are still highly regarded today. 112. DaVinci wrote notebook entries in mirror (backwards) script, a trick that kept many of his observations from being widely known until decades after his death. It is believed that he was hiding his scientific ideas from the powerful Roman Catholic Church, whose teachings sometimes disagreed with what Leonardo observed. 113. When Gaius Caesar was a boy, Roman soldiers affectionately nicknamed him "little boots" for the boy-sized military footwear he sported. 114. Although most people think that Napoleon was short, he was actually five feet six inches tall (1.676 meters), an average height for a Frenchman in those days. 115. The German Kaiser Wilhelm II had a withered arm and often hid the fact by posing with his hand resting on a sword, or by holding gloves. 116. Napoleon took 14,000 French decrees and simplified them into a unified set of 7 laws. This was the first time in modern history that a nation's laws applied equally to all citizens. Napoleon's 7 laws are so impressive that by 1960 more than 70 governments had patterned their own laws after them or used them verbatim. 117. More than 5,600 men died while building the Panama Canal. Today, it takes more than 8,000 workers to run and maintain the canal. It takes a ship an average of 33 hours to travel the length of the canal. 118.

"John has a long mustache" was the coded-signal used by the French Resistance in WWII to mobilize their forces once the Allies had landed on the Normandy beaches. 135. The State of Nevada first legalized gambling in 1931. At that same time, the Hoover Dam was being built and the federal government did not want its workers (who earned 50 cents an hour) to be involved with such diversions, so they built the town of Boulder City to house the dam workers. To this day, Boulder City is the only city in Nevada where gambling is illegal. Hoover Dam is 726 feet tall and 660 feet thick at its base. Enough rock was excavated in its construction to build the Great Wall of China. Contrary to old wives' tales, no workers were buried in the dam's cement. 136.

King Charles VII, who was assassinated in 1167, was the first Swedish king with the name of Charles. Charles I, II, III, IV, V, never existed. No one knows why. To add to the mystery, almost 300 years went by before there was a Charles VIII (1448-57). 148. Lafayette was a major general in the United States at the age of 19. Lafayette's whole name takes up an entire line on a page: Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. 149. Many hundreds of years ago when the well-known style of Irish dancing began in the country side of Ireland, most houses of the poor - and that means most houses - only had a dirt floor which was not a lot of use for dancing on if you were holding a ceildh (pronounced kay-lee and meaning party - more or less). So in order to make the dancing easier the owners of the house which was holding the party would take the doors off their hinges and lay them on the floor. There was just enough room on each door for two people to dance, providing they did not fling their arms about - hence the original name for Irish dancing - Door Dancing. 150. In a tradition dating to the beginning of the Westminster system of government, the bench in the middle of a Westminster parliament is two and a half sword lengths long.

Until 1796, there was a state in the United States called Franklin. Today it is known as Tennessee. 159. While Theodore Roosevelt was campaigning in Milwaukee in 1912, a would-be assassin fired a bullet into the right side of his chest. Much of the force of the slug was absorbed by the President's eyeglasses case and by the 50 page speech he was carrying double-folded in his breast pocket. Nevertheless, the bullet lodged itself just short of his lung, and, dripping in blood, Roosevelt pulled himself up to the podium. He asked the crowd to please "...be very quiet and excuse me from making a long speech. I'll do the best I can, but there's a bullet in my body... I have a message to deliver, and I will deliver it as long as there is life in my body." He spoke for 90 minutes, but was unable to refer to his text due to the gaping hole which the bullet had torn through it. 160.

She recovered and returned to her nursing duties. (Oct. 28, 1919) 163. What would eventually become one of the world's most prestigious museums, the Louvre Museum opened in Paris in 1793. Until the French Revolution, the King's art collection had been strictly for the private pleasure of the Court, but revolutionary leaders decided to open the collection to the public. Among some of its most famous art pieces, the Louvre houses, the Joconde (Mona Lisa), Venus de Milo, the Winged Victory of Samothrace, and the Liberty Leading the People. 164. Ishi had made it very clear before he died that he did not want to be autopsied. However, his wishes were ignored and his body was autopsied and the brain removed and sent to the Smithsonian, where scientists were collecting brains for a study of brain size and race. After 83 years, the Smithsonian is finally returning the brain of Ishi to his closest relatives so they can bury his remains. 165. Ishi's remains will be given to representative of the Redding Rancheria and the Pit River Tribe, two Native American groups from Northern California. Ishi was actually a Yahi-Yana Indian. Smithsonian officials decided that the two tribes were the closest living relatives and truly represented the Yana descendants. 166.

Most people know that the reign of Czar Nicholas II of Russia ended in tragedy, but few know that's how it started as well. At his coronation, presents were given to all the people who attended. As the gifts were being handed out, a rumor started that there weren't enough to go around and a stampede started. Hundreds of women and children were killed. 176. The first known item made from aluminum was a rattle—made for Napoleon III in the 1850s. Napoleon also provided his most honored guests with knives and forks made of pure aluminum. At the time the newly discovered metal was so rare, it was considered more valuable than gold. 177. General Henry Heth (1825-1888) leading a confederate division in the Battle of Gettysburg, was hit in the head by a Union bullet, but his life was saved because he was wearing a hat two sizes too large, with newspaper folded inside the sweatband. The paper deflected the bullet, and the general, unconscious for 30 hours, recovered and lived another 25 years. 178. During the American revolution, more inhabitants of the American colonies fought for the British than for the Continental Army. 179. During the Crimean War, the British Army lost ten times more troops to dysentery than to battle wounds. 180. During the Renaissance blond hair became so much de rigueur in Venice that a brunette was not to be seen except among the working classes. Venetian women spent hours dyeing and burnishing their hair until they achieved the harsh metallic glitter that was considered a necessity. 181. During the Renaissance, fashionable aristocratic Italian women shaved their hair several inches back from their natural hairlines. 182. During the Spanish American War in 1898 there were 45 stars on the American flag. 183. During World War II the original copies of the U. S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence was taken from the Library of Congress and kept at Fort Knox, Kentucky. 184. During World War II, the U.S. Navy had a world champion chess player, Reuben Fine, calculate - on the basis of positional probability - where enemy submarines might surface. 185. On June 13th 1944, a single Tiger tank headed by Captain Michael Wittman stopped the advance of the entire British 7th armored division (the famous 'desert rats') in the town of Villers Bocage, Normandy. This has been the deadliest single action in the entire war and stopped the British offensive, planned by Montgomery, to break through German lines. Wittman died later in August fighting against 12 Canadian Sherman tanks. 186. Five members of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer's family were killed at the Battle of little Big Horn. They were Tom and Boston, two half-brothers, Harry Armstrong Reed, a nephew and a brother-in-law, James Calhoun. 187. In 1865 opium was grown in the state of Virginia and a product was distilled from it that yielded 4 percent morphine. In 1867 it was grown in Tennessee: six years later it was cultivated in Kentucky. During these years opium, marijuana and cocaine could be purchased legally over the counter from any druggist. 188. The Roman emperor Commodos collected all the dwarfs, cripples, and freaks he could find in the city of Rome and had them brought to the Coliseum, where they were ordered to fight each other to the death with meat cleavers. 189. High-wire acts have been enjoyed since the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Antique medals have been excavated from Greek islands depicting men ascending inclined cords and walking across ropes stretched between cliffs. The Greeks called these high-wire performers neurobates or oribates. In the Roman city of Herculaneum there is a fresco representing an aerialist high on a rope, dancing and playing a flute. Sometimes Roman tightrope walkers stretched cables between the tops of two neighboring hills and performed comic dances and pantomimes while crossing. 190. John Wilkes Booth's brother once saved the life of Abraham Lincoln's son. 191. There was a "pony express" in Persia many centuries before Christ. Riders on this ancient circuit, wearing special colored headbands, delivered the mails across the vast stretch of Asia Minor, sometimes riding for hundreds of miles without a break. 192. It was only after 440 A.D. that December 25 was celebrated as the birth date of Jesus Christ. 193. The first aerial photograph was taken from a balloon during the U.S. civil war. 194. Olive oil was used for washing the body in the ancient Mediterranean world. 195. In 1801, 20 percent of the people in the U.S. were slaves. 196. Slaves under the last emperors of China wore pigtails so they could be picked out quickly. 197. Dinner guests during the medieval times in England were expected to bring their own knives to the table. 198. It is estimated that a few years after Columbus discovered the New World, the Spaniards killed off 1.5 million Indians. 199. The Fish Bowl was invented by Countess Dubarry, Mistress of King Louis XV (Born 1710 Died 1774) 200. Leonardo DaVinci painted the Mona Lisa on a piece of pinewood, 77 x 53 cm (30 x 20 7/8 in) in the year 1506. 201. Today the painting hangs in the Musee du Louvre, Paris, France. 202. DaVinci's name for the painting was La Gioconda. Named for the wife of Francesco del Giocondo; 1503-06 203. Who posed for the painting? Dr. Lillian Schwartz of Bell Labs suggests that Leonardo painted himself, and was able to support her theory by analyzing the facial features of Leonardo's face and that of the famous painting, She digitized both the self-portrait of the artist and the Mona Lisa. She flipped the self-portrait and merged the two images together using a computer. She noticed the features of the face aligned perfectly. 204. When Elizabeth I of Russia died in 1762, 15,000 dresses were found in her closets. She used to change what she was wearing two and even three times an evening. 205. Napoleon, the famous French general, was not born in France. He was born on the Mediterranean island of Corsica of Italian parents. 206. When he resigned in 1923 because of illegal behavior in the Teapot Dome Affair, Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall was offered an appointment to the Supreme Court by President Harding. In 1931, Fall was tried and found guilty of conspiracy to defraud. 207. Jahangir, a 17th-century Indian Mughal ruler, had 5,000 women in his harem and 1,000 young boys. He also owned 12,000 elephants. 208. China was the first country to introduce paper money (in 812), but it wasn't until 1661 that a bank (Banco-Sedlar of Sweden) issued banknotes. 209. If the arm of King Henry I of England had been 42 inches long, the unit of measure of a "foot" today would be fourteen inches. But his arm happened to be 36 inches long and he decreed that the "standard" foot should be one-third that length: 12 inches. 210. Napoleon's nemesis, the Duke of Wellington, was an accomplished yo-yo player. At that time, the yo-yo was known as a "bandalore." 211. When Thomas Jefferson became U.S. President in 1801, 20 percent of all people in the young nation were slaves. 212. Early Egyptians wore sandals made from woven papyrus leaves. 213. The Marquis de Lafayette, America's Revolutionary War ally, named his only son George Washington Lafayette. 214. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, the fathers of communism, wrote 500 articles for the "New York Tribune" from 1851 to 1862. 215. While Theodore Roosevelt was campaigning in Milwaukee in 1912, a would-be assassin fired a bullet into the right side of his chest. Much of the force of the slug was absorbed by the President's eyeglasses case and by the 50 page speech he was carrying double-folded in his breast pocket. Nevertheless, the bullet lodged itself just short of his lung, and, dripping in blood, Roosevelt pulled himself up to the podium. He asked the crowd to please "...be very quiet and excuse me from making a long speech. I'll do the best I can, but there's a bullet in my body... I have a message to deliver, and I will deliver it as long as there is life in my body." He spoke for 90 minutes, but was unable to refer to his text due to the gaping hole which the bullet had torn through it. 216. Karl Marx was targeted for assassination when he met with two Prussian officers in his house in Cologne in 1848. Marx had friends among the German labor unions, and he was considered a threat to the autocrats. Dressed in his bathrobe, he forced the officers out at the point of a revolver, which, it turned out, was not loaded. 217. Ishi was believed to be the last of the Yahi, a tribe of Native Americans living in California that were wiped out by disease and massacres. In the early part of the twentieth century (1911), he became a sensation when he wandered out of the woods near Oroville. Ishi was taken to the University of California at San Francisco where he lived and worked (as a janitor) in the anthropology museum, helping researchers to document the Yahi language, until his death from tuberculosis in 1916. His name, Ishi, was given to him by the anthropologists. Linguists believe it was his tribe's word for "man."</p>

<p>1. So many visitors were taking his cigars, so Thomas Edison devised a plan to discourage the practice. He had several boxes of cigars custom-made with cabbage leaves. But when the offensive smelling stogies were delivered to his office, his secretary sent them on to his home where his wife went ahead and packed the items in his luggage, and the offensive items accompanied Mr. Edison on his business trip. This just goes to show you that even a genius can't outsmart his wife. 2. Henry Waterman, of New York, invented the elevator in 1850. He intended it to transport barrels of flour. 3. John Greenwood, also of New York invented the dental drill in 1790. 4. The corkscrew was invented by M.L. Bryn, also of New York, in 1860. 5. Electrical hearing aids were invented in 1901 by Miller R. Hutchinson, who was (you guessed it) from New York. 6. Dr. Jonas Salk developed the vaccine for polio in 1952, in New York (aaah!). 7. Four wheel roller skates were invented by James L. Plimpton in 1863. Can you guess where? 8. The first words that Thomas A. Edison spoke into the phonograph were, "Mary had a little lamb." 9. In the early 1800s, a French silk weaver called Joseph-Marie Jacquard invented a way of automatically controlling the warp and weft threads on a silk loom by recording patterns of holes in a string of cards. 10. In 1843, a mathematician, Ada Byron, published the first computer programs. She based them on Jacquard's punch-card idea. Her programs were for the first general-purpose mechanical digital computer, that was just invented by Charles Babbage. 11. As an advertising gimmick, Carl Meyer, nephew of lunch meat mogul Oscar Meyer, invented the company's "Wienermobile". On July 18, 1936, the first Oscar Mayer "Wienermobile" rolled out of General Body Company's factory in Chicago. The Wienermobile still tours the U.S. today. 12. Gutenburg invented the printing press in the 1450's, and the first book to ever be printed was the Bible. It was, however, in Latin rather than English. 13. Jeanne Pierre Francois Blanchard built the first parachute and tested it using a dog. He put the dog in a basket equipped with his invention and then dropped it from a hot air balloon. It was a giant step forward for aviation history, but a giant step backwards in establishing the dog as man's best friend. 14. The toothbrush was invented in 1498. 15. The waffle iron was invented August 24, 1869. 16. The alarm clock was not invented by the Marquis de Sade, as some suspect, but rather by a man named Levi Hutchins of Concord, New Hampshire, in 1787. Perversity, though, characterized his invention from the beginning. The alarm on his clock could ring only at 4 am. Rumor has it that Hutchins was murdered by his wife at 4:05 am on a very dark and deeply cold New England morning. 17. Craven Walker invented the lava lamp, and its contents are colored wax and water. 18. In 1916, Jones Wister of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania invented a rifle for shooting around corners. It had a curved barrel and periscopic sights. 19. The same man who led the attack on the Alamo, Mexican Military General, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, is also credited with the invention of chewing gum. 20. The parachute was invented by Leonardo da Vinci in 1515. 21. The guillotine was originally called a louisette. Named for Antoine Louis, the French surgeon who invented it. It became known as the guillotine for Joseph Ignace Guillotin, the French physician who advocated it as a more merciful means of execution than the noose or ax. 22. Leonardo Da Vinci invented the scissors. 23. Lazy Susans are named after Thomas Edison's daughter. He invented it to impress a gathering of industrialists and inventors. 24. Cyano-acrylate glues (super glue) were invented by accident. The researcher was trying to make optical materials, and would test their properties by putting them between two prisms and shining light through them. When he tried the cyano-acrylate, he couldn't get the prisms apart. 25. A device invented as a primitive steam engine by the Greek engineer Hero, about the time of the birth of Christ, is used today as a rotating lawn sprinkler. 26. A machine has been invented that can read printed English books aloud to the blind, and it can do so at speed half again as fast as normal speech. 27. Games Slayter, a Purdue graduate, invented fiberglass. 28. Teflon was discovered in 1938. 29. Alfred Nobel used a cellulose adhesive (nitrocellulose) as the chemical binder for nitroglycerin, which he used in his invention of dynamite. 30. At the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, Richard Blechyden, and Englishman, had a tea concession. On a very hot day, none of the fairgoers were interested in hot tea. Blechyden served the tea cold—and invented iced tea. 31. At the turn of the century, most light bulbs were hand-blown, and the cost of one was equivalent to half a day's pay for the average U.S. worker. 32. Camel's-hair brushes are not made of camel's hair. They were invented by a man named Mr. Camel. 33. Carbonated beverages became popular in 1832 after John Mathews invented an apparatus for charging water with carbon dioxide gas. 34. Western Electric invented the loudspeaker which was initially called "loud-speaking telephone." 35. Phone service was established at the White House one year after its invention. President Rutherford B. Hayes was the first to have phone service (1877-81). 36. Fifteen years after its invention in 1876, there were five million phones in America. Fifteen years after its invention, more than 33 million wireless phones were in the U.S. 37. According to U.S. law, a patent may not be granted on a useless invention, on a method of doing business, on mere printed matter, or on a device or machine that will not operate. Even if an invention is novel or new, a patent may not be obtained if the invention would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the same area at the time of the invention. 38. While Eleanor Abbott of San Diego, California was recuperating from polio in the 1940s, she occupied herself with devising games and activities for youngsters who had polio. One of her inventions was called "Candy Land." Her young friends liked the game so much, she submitted it to Milton Bradley Company where it was immediately accepted. Since then, CANDY LAND has been recognized internationally as a "child's first game." 39. The modern zipper, the Talon Slide Fastener, was invented in 1913 but didn't catch on until after World War I. The first dresses incorporating the zipper appeared in the 1930's. 40. Bavarian immigrant Charles August Fey invented the first three-reel automatic payout slot machine, the Liberty Bell, in San Francisco in 1899. 41. In 1966, Elliot Handler, one of the co-founders of Mattel, Inc. and part of the Barbie doll empire, was the inventor of Hot Wheels®. Handler experimented with axles and rotating wheels being attached to tiny model cars. The innovative gravity-powered car he developed had special low-friction styrene wheels. Hot Wheels® have been clocked at speeds of up to 300 miles per hour. 42. Dr. John Gorrie of Appalachicola, Florida, invented mechanical refrigeration in 1851. He patented his device on May 6, 1851. There is a statue which honors this "Father of Modern Day Air Conditioning" in the Statuary Hall of the Capitol building in Washington, DC. 43. Electrical hearing aids were invented in 1901 by Miller R. Hutchinson. 44. Eli Whitney made no money from the cotton gin because he did not have a valid patent on it. 45. The British import Spirograph was introduced in the United States in 1967 by Kenner and has racked up millions of dollars in sales. It was invented by a British electronics engineer, Denys Fisher, who was inspired to create the toy while doing research on a new design for bomb detonators for NATO. 46. The Chinese invented eyeglasses. Marco Polo reported seeing many pairs worn by the Chinese as early as 1275, 500 years before lens grinding became an art in the West. 47. The classic toy wagon was designed by Antonio Pasin, who founded his company in 1918. Pasin wanted to give his wagons a modern flair, and chose the word "radio" for what was then a new form of communication, and "flyer" for the wonder of flight — hence, "Radio Flyer." 48. The coffee filter was invented by Melissa Bentz, in Germany in 1908. She pierced holes in a tin container, put a circular piece of absorbent paper in the bottom of it and put her creation over a coffee pot. 49. Ferdinand Porsche, who later went on to build sports cars bearing his own name, designed the original 1936 Volkswagen. 50. In 1889, the first coin-operated telephone, patented by Hartford, Connecticut inventor William Gray, was installed in the Hartford Bank. Soon, "pay phones" were installed in stores, hotels, saloons, and restaurants, and their use soared. Local calls using a coin-operated phone in the U.S. cost only 5 cents everywhere until 1951. 51. The first commercial vacuum cleaner was so large it was mounted on a wagon. People threw parties in their homes so guests could watch the new device do its job. 52. The first VCR, made in 1956, was the size of a piano. 53. Inventor Hugh Moore's paper cup factory was located next door to the Dixie Doll Company in the same downtown loft building. The word Dixie printed on the company's door reminded Moore of the story he had heard as a boy about "dixies," the ten dollar bank notes printed with the French word dix in big letters across the face of the bill by a New Orleans bank renowned for its strong currency in the early 1800s. The "dixies," Moore decided, had the qualities he wanted people to associate with his paper cups, and with permission from his neighbor, he used the name for his cups - "Dixie Cups". 54. It has been determined that less than one patented invention in a hundred makes any money for the inventor. 55. It was Swiss chemist Jacques Edwin Brandenberger who invented cellophane, back in 1908. 56. James J. Ritty, owner of a tavern in Dayton, Ohio, invented the cash register in 1879 to stop his patrons from pilfering house profits. 57. James Ramsey invented a steam-driven motorboat in 1784. He ran it on the Potomac River, and the event was witnessed by George Washington. 58. The monkey wrench is named after its inventor, a London blacksmith named Charles Moncke. 59. The paper clip was patented by Norwegian inventor Johan Vaaler in 1899. Because Norway had no patent law at the time, he had to travel to Germany where he received his patent in 1900. His U.S. Patent was granted in 1901. 60. The pop top can was invented in Kettering, Ohio by Ermal Fraze. 61. The power lawn mower was invented by Ransom E. Olds (of Oldsmobile fame) in 1915. 62. The rickshaw was invented by the Reverend Jonathan Scobie, an American Baptist minister living in Yokohama, Japan, built the first model in 1869 in order to transport his invalid wife. Today it remains a common mode of transportation in the Orient. 63. The shoestring was invented in England in 1790, Prior to this time all shoes were fastened with buckles. 64. The single blade window cleaning squeegee was invented in 1936 by Ettore Sceccone and is still the most common form of commercial window cleaning today. 65. The Super Ball® was born in 1965, and it became America's most popular plaything that year. By Christmas time, only six months after it was introduced by Wham-O, 7 million balls had been sold at 98 cents apiece. Norman Stingley, a California chemist, invented the bouncing gray ball. In his spare time, he had compressed a synthetic rubber material under 3,500 pounds of pressure per square inch, and eventually created the remarkable ball. It had a resiliency of 92 percent, about three times that of a tennis ball, and could bounce for long periods. It was reported that presidential aide McGeorge Bundy had five dozen Super Balls® shipped to the White House for the amusement of staffers. 66. Roulette was invented by the great French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal. It was a by product of his experiments with perpetual motion. 67. The 'spot' on 7UP comes from its inventor who had red eyes. He was albino. 68. Edison improved the incandescent lamp in 1879, but he didn't actually invent it. Sir Humphrey Davy is reputed to be the true inventor of the electric light. He passed electricity through a platinum wire and caused an arc lamp to glow as early as 1802. However, Davy did not pursue the discovery. By the time Edison entered the scene, arc lamps had been burning for several decades, but were limited by short life spans. Edison developed a long-lasting filament light in 1877, and in 1879 produced the first long-lasting light bulb. 69. The man who invented shorthand, John Gregg, was deaf. 70. The state of Maine was once known as the "Earmuff Capital of The World". Earmuffs were invented there by Chester Greenwood in 1873. 71. Because he felt such an important tool should be public property, English chemist John Walker never patented his invention — matches. 72. California police in the 1920s thought they had gotten the drop on a moonshiner. They raided what they thought was a still and found, instead, inventor Philo T. Farnsworth, working on something that was later to become television. 73. The hypodermic needle was invented in 1853. It was initially used for giving injections of morphine as a painkiller. Physicians mistakenly believed that morphine would not be addictive if it by-passed the digestive tract. 74. Thomas Edison’s first major invention was the quadruplex telegraph. Unlike other telegraphs at the time, it could send four messages at the same time over one wire. 75. Inventor Gail Borden, Jr. invented condensed milk in the 1850's. 76. After his death in 1937, Guglielmo Marconi, inventor of the wireless telegraph was honored by broadcasters worldwide as they let the airwaves fall silent for two minutes in his memory. 77. Bryan J. Patrie, a Stanford graduate student invented the Watercolor Intelligent Nightlight, which informs bleary-eyed midnight bathroom-goers whether the toilet seat is up or down... without turning on a blinding light. Patrie introduced the device in the early 1990's. He explained, "When you get within five feet of the dark commode, it will sense your motion. It looks to see if the room is dark. Then it looks upward by sending out an infrared beam. If it gets a reflection, it knows the seat is up. If it is, the red light comes on." 78. Pez was invented in 1927 by Eduard Haas, an Austrian anti-smoking fanatic, who marketed peppermint-flavored PEZ as a cigarette substitute. The candy gets its name from the German word for peppermint, Pfefferminze. Haas brought the candy to the U.S. in 1952. It bombed, so he reintroduced it as a children's toy, complete with cartoon heads and fruity flavors. One of the most secretive companies in the U.S., PEZ won't even disclose who currently owns the company. 79. In the year 1886, Herman Hollerith had the idea of using punched cards to keep and transport information, a technology used up to the late 1970's. This device was constructed to allow the 1890 census to be tabulated. In 1896 the Tabulating Machine Company was founded by Hollerith. Twenty-eight years later, in 1924, after several take-overs the company became known as International Business Machines (IBM). 80. The Nobel Prize resulted from a late change in the will of Alfred Nobel, who did not want to be remembered after his death as a propagator of violence - he invented dynamite. 81. The shoe string was invented in England in 1790. Until then shoes were fastened with buckles. 82. Germany holds the title for most independent inventors to apply for patents. 83. Noxema, the skin cream invented in 1914 by Baltimore pharmacist George Bunting, was originally sold as "Dr. Bunting's Sunburn Remedy." Mr. Bunting changed the name to Noxema after a customer enthusiastically told him the cream had "knocked out his eczema." Thus, the cream that "knocks eczema" became "Noxema". 84. George Eastman, inventor of the Kodak camera, hated having his picture taken. 85. Root Beer was invented in Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1898 by Edward Adolf Barq, Sr. 86. Because Napoleon believed that armies marched on their stomachs, he offered a prize in 1795 for a practical way of preserving food. The prize was won by a French inventor, Nicholas Appert. What he devised was canning. It was the beginning of the canned food industry of today. 87. Bavarian immigrant Charles August Fey invented the first three-reel automatic payout slot machine, the Liberty Bell, in San Francisco in 1899. 88. Venetian blinds were invented in Japan. 89. Benjamin Franklin was also the first person to try to electrocute a turkey. This experiment didn't work. The bird lived and it was America's Renaissance man who ended up absorbing the jolt. "I meant to kill a turkey," said the shocked inventor, "and instead, I nearly killed a goose." 90. The horse race starting gate is a Canadian invention, designed in the early 1900s by Philip McGinnis, a racetrack reporter from Huntingdon, Quebec. The device proved popular because it prevented arguments caused when horses started prematurely. 91. The Direct Action Committee, a group pushing for nuclear disarmament, invented the peace symbol in 1958. The forked symbol is actually a composite of the semaphore signals "N" and "D," to stand for nuclear disarmament. 92. Diet Coke was only invented in 1982. 93. Fifty years ago the B. F. Goodrich Company, the American corporation known for its automobile tires, thought it was really on to something. Its engineers came up with the prototype of an atomic golf ball. The ball, with a radioactive core, would be easy to locate with a Geiger counter if hit into the rough. But the company abandoned the invention as unworkable. 94. The wristwatch was invented in 1904 by Louis Cartier. 95. American sculptor, Alexander Calder, rigged the front door of his Paris apartment so that he could open it from his bathtub. 96. The first prototype of the sound-proof phone booth was built in 1877. Mr. Watson, Alexander Graham Bell's trusty assistant, used a bunch of bed blankets around a box. He created the booth to prevent his landlady from listening in on his conversations. 97. Some callers didn't like using the early phone booths because the doors would get stuck, forcing users to fight their way out. 98. The commercial wireless phone was first introduced in Chicago in 1982 by Ameritech. 99. The first mobile car phones were located in the car's trunk, taking up nearly half of the space. 100. When Alexander Graham Bell died on August 4, 1922, millions of phones went dead. In Bell's honor, all phones served by the Bell System in the USA and Canada went silent for one minute. 101. One of the first telephone answering machines was developed in Switzerland during the 1950's. It took three days to install. 102. Two days before Alexander Graham Bell married Mabel Hubbard in 1877, he gave her 99 percent of his company shares as a wedding gift. He kept a mere ten for himself. 103. Naugahyde, plastic "leather" was created in Naugatuck, Connecticut. 104. As of 1940, total of ninety patents had been taken out on shaving mugs. 105. It took three years of constant printing to complete Johann Gutenberg's famous Bible, which appeared in 1455 in two volumes, and had 1,284 pages. He reportedly printed 200 Bibles, of which 47 still exist. 106. Madame Alexander dolls were the creation of Beatrice Alexander Behrman, the daughter of Russian immigrants. Mrs. Behrman, whose father operated New York's first doll "hospital," started making dolls in 1923, and her creations soon became famous for their molded heads and limbs, lifelike eyes, rooted hair and elaborate costumes. Mrs. Behrman sold the company to several New York investors in 1988, two years before she died at age 95. But America's first and only remaining doll manufacturer has not compromised her high standard of quality and unique craftsmanship. Today, most of the company's manufacturing is still done in Harlem, New York, and more than 500,000 dolls a year are sold. 107. Dr. Samuel Langley was able to get many model airplanes to fly, but on December 8, 1903, Langley's "human carrying flying machine", the aerodrome plunged into the Potomac River near Washington D.C., in front of photographers who were assembled to witness the event. Reporters around the country made fun of the idea that people could fly and nine days later, Wilbur and Orville Wright proved them wrong. 108. The first product Motorola started to develop was a record player for automobiles. At that time the most known player on the market was the Victrola, so they called themselves Motorola. 109. When using the first pay telephone, a caller did not deposit his coins in the machine. He gave them to an attendant who stood next to the telephone. Coin telephones did not appear to 1899. 110. Spacewar is generally considered to be the first video game. Programmed in 1962 by MIT student Steve Russell, Spacewar was a simple game with ASCII graphics where two players would blast lasers at each other. At the time, the game only ran on massive, million-dollar mainframes the size of a small house. Spacewar was circulated to other computer labs across the country, but only nerdy college students with access to mainframes could play it. 1962 was also the year in which University of Utah student Nolan Bushnell received his first exposure to video games, playing Spacewar in the University's computer lab. Bushnell spent the next seven years trying to reproduce Spacewar on a smaller, less expensive computer. When it was finally completed in 1971, Bushnell's Spacewar variation (dubbed "Computer Space"), bombed. For one thing, people found it too complicated. Bushnell gave up on it, quit his job at Ampex and founded Atari in 1972. Bushnell originally wanted to name the company Syzygy, but the name was already taken by a roofing company. That same year, Magnavox quietly released the Odyssey, the first home video game system. It had a game similar to Pong, and Magnavox later sued Atari for "copying" it (they won). Bushnell and Atari engineer Al Alcorn placed a prototype of their game in Andy Capp's Tavern, a Sunnyvale, California bar. Alcorn began work a home version of Pong. His project was code named "Darlene" after a female coworker that worked with Alcorn at the time. In the fall of 1974, Alcorn began developing the "Darlene" system. Several months later Atari released Home Pong. 111. While known as a painter, sculptor, architect, and engineer, Leonardo da Vinci was the first to record that the number of rings in the cross section of a tree trunk reveal its age. He also discovered that the width between the rings indicates the annual moisture. 112. Self-made millionaire Cyrus Field championed the idea of a telegraph from England to Newfoundland. Britain quickly agreed to subsidize. Congress went along by a one-vote margin. That was in 1856. Laying cable was tough. It kept breaking. The first line - two years later - died almost immediately. But 10 years later, there were two working lines. Communications changed forever. 113. The first lightweight luggage designed for air travel was conceived by aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. 114. Donald F. Duncan, the man who made the yo-yo an American tradition, is also credited with popularizing the parking meter and introducing Good Humor "ice cream on a stick. 115. Eastman Kodak's Brownie camera cost $1.00 when it was introduced in 1900. 116. Sylvan N. Goldman of Humpty Dumpty Stores and Standard Food Markets developed the shopping cart so that people could buy more in a single visit to the grocery store. He unveiled his creation in Oklahoma City on June 4, 1937. 117. Frederick Winthrop Thayer of Massachusetts and the captain of the Harvard University Baseball Club received a patent for his baseball catcher's mask on February 12, 1878. 118. The first coin operated machine ever designed was a holy-water dispenser that required a five-drachma piece to operate. It was the brainchild of the Greek scientist Hero in the first century AD. 119. Ornithologists often use Scotch tape to cover cracks in the soft shells of fertilized pigeon eggs, allowing the eggs to hatch. Scotch tape has also been used as an anti-corrosive shield on the Goodyear Blimp. 120. Q-TIPS Cotton Swabs were originally called "Baby Gays." In 1922, Leo Gerstenrang, an immigrant from Warsaw, Poland, who had served in the U.S. Army during World War I and worked with the fledgling Red Cross Organization, founded the Leo Gerstenrang Infant Novelty Co. with his wife, selling accessories used for baby care. After the birth of the couple's daughter, Gerstenrang noticed that his wife would wrap a wad of cotton around a toothpick for use during their baby's bath and decided to manufacture a ready-to-use cotton swab. Gerstenrang developed a machine that would wrap cotton uniformly around each blunt end of a small stick of carefully selected and cured non-splintering birch wood, package the swabs in a sliding tray type box, sterilize the box, and seal it with an outer wrapping of glassine (later changed to cellophane). The phrase "untouched by human hands" became widely known in the production of cotton swabs. 121. The world's first underground railway, between Paddington (Bishop's Road) and Farringdon Street - with trains hauled by steam engines - was opened by the Metropolitan Railway on January 10th 1863. The initial section was six km (nearly four miles) in length, and provided both a new commuter rail service and an onward rail link for passengers arriving at Paddington, Euston and King's Cross main line stations to the City of London. 122. The City and South London Railway opened the world's first deep-level electric railway on December 18th, 1890, from King William Street in the City of London under the River Thames to Stockwell. 123. Today, the London Underground Limited (LUL) is a major business with 2.5 million passenger journeys a day, nearly 500 trains, serving over 260 stations, around 16,000 staff and vast engineering assets. 124. Average scheduled train speed (including station stops) 20.5 mph (33 kmh). 125. Maximum tunnel depth below mean sea level is 70ft (21.3m) 126. Maximum tunnel depth below ground level is 221ft (67.4m) 127. According to company lore, Ole Evinrude, a Norwegian immigrant, got the idea for an outboard motor while on a picnic with his sweetheart Bessie. They were on a small island in Lake Michigan, when Bessie decided she wanted some ice cream. Ole obligingly rowed to shore to get some, but by the time he made it back the ice cream had melted. So Ole built a motor that could be attached to his rowboat, and founded the Evinrude company in 1909. 128. The first underground and underwater rail system in the world, the New York City Subway, began operating in 1904. Almost 8,000 men participated in building the 21-mile (33.6 km) route. The project's chief engineer was William Barclay Parsons. 129. The safety pin was patented in 1849 by Walter Hunt. He sold the patent rights for $400. 130. An Englishman invented Scotland's national dress - the kilt. It was developed from the philamore - a massive piece of tartan worn with a belt and draped over the shoulder - by English industrialist Thomas Rawlinson who ran a foundry at Lochaber, Scotland in the early 1700s and thought a detachable garment would make life more comfortable for his workers. 131. It is recorded that the Babylonians were making soap around 2800 B.C. and that it was known to the Phoenicians around 600 B.C. These early references to soap and soap making were for the use of soap in the cleaning of textile fibers such as wool and cotton in preparation for weaving into cloth. 132. Disc Jockey Alan Freed popularized the term "Rock and Roll." 133. The patent number of the telephone is 174465. 134. George Washington Carver invented peanut butter. 135.

Thomas Edison had a collection of over 5,000 birds. 139. Ben Franklin Facts: - Benjamin Franklin had poor vision and needed glasses to read. He got tired of constantly taking them off and putting them back on, so he decided to figure out a way to make his glasses let him see both near and far. He had two pairs of spectacles cut in half and put half of each lens in a single frame. Today, we call them bifocals. 140. He was the youngest son of a youngest son of a youngest son of a youngest son. 141. He was the first American philosopher and the first American ambassador. 142. He invented the harmonica, the rocking chair, the street lamp, the lightning conductor, and the Franklin stove - to name a few. 143. He originated the first circulating library. 144. He is the originator of Daylight Saving Time. 145. He originated the first street-cleaning department. 146. He was the first reformer of English spelling. 147. He is the father of modern dentistry. 148. He organized the first fire department. 149. He was the founder of the Democratic party. 150. He established the modern post-office system. 151. He was a pioneer of the modern voting system for Congress. 152. Dutch engineers have developed a computerized machine that allows a cow to milk itself. Each cow in the herd has a computer chip in its collar. If the computer senses that the cow has not been milked in a given period of time, the milk-laden animal is allowed to enter the stall. The robot sensors locate the teats, apply the vacuum devices, and the cow is milked. The machine costs a mere $250,000 and is said to boost milk production by 15%. 153. On November 23, 1835, Henry Burden of Troy, New York, developed the first machine for manufacturing horseshoes. Burden later oversaw the production of most of the horseshoes used by the Union cavalry during the Civil War. 154. On the first neon sign, the word neon was spelled out in red by Dr. Perley G. Nutting, 15 years before neon signs became widely used commercially. 155. Out of the 11 original patents made by Nikola Tessla, for the generation of hydroelectric energy, 9 are still in use, (unchanged) today. 156. The windmill originated in Iran in AD 644. It was used to grind grain. 157. Russian submarine designers are building military submarines out of concrete. Because concrete becomes stronger under high pressure, (C-subs) could settle down to the bottom in very deep water and wait for enemy ships to pass overhead. Concrete would not show up on sonar displays (it looks just like sand or rocks), so the passing ships would not see the sub lurking below. 158. Two French toolmakers were the first engineers to put the engine in the front of the car. This gave the car better balance, made it easier to steer, and made it much easier to get all your luggage in. 159. The first umbrella factory in the U.S. was founded in 1928 in Baltimore, Maryland. 160. In the early 1950's, Denver architect Temple H. Buell, often called the Father of the Mall, conceived of and built one of the first shopping malls in the U.S.: the Cherry Creek Mall. 161. During one four-year period, Thomas Edison obtained 300 patents, or one every five days. 162. The Wright Brothers spent time observing the flight of the buzzard to help them solve the mystery of flight. They realized that the bird retained balance in the air by twisting the tips of it's wings. By creating a wing warping method based upon this observation, the brothers were able to obtain a remarkable degree of maneuverability. 163. The game that would become Scrabble was created by an unemployed architect, Alfred Mosher Butts in the early 1930s. He called it Lexiko, then Criss Cross Words and then sold the rights to James Brunot. In 1948 it was renamed Scrabble and was manufactured in a converted school house in Connecticut. Bruno sold the game to Selchow and Righter, who were bought out by Coleco in 1987, and in 1989 Milton Bradley bought it. More than 100 million Scrabble games have been sold worldwide. 164. Rubber bands were first made by Perry and Co. of London in 1845. 165. In 1832 the Scottish surgeon Neil Arnott devised water beds as a way of improving patients' comfort. 166. In 1769 the British designer Edward Beran enclosed wooden slats in a frame to adjust the amount of light let into a room. These became known as venetian blinds from their early use over Italianate windows. 167. George Seldon received a patent in 1895 - for the automobile. Four years later, George sold the rights for $200,000. 168. You could milk about six cows per hour by hand, but with modern machinery, you can milk up to 100 cows per hour. 169. Lillian Moller Gilbreth (1878-1972), the mother of 12 children, had good reason to improve the efficiency and convenience of household items. A pioneer in ergonomics, Gilbreth patented many devices, including an electric food mixer, and the trash can with step-on lid-opener that can be found in most households today. 170. Direct-dial, coast-to-coast telephone service began as Mayor M. Leslie Denning of Englewood, New Jersey, called his counterpart in Alameda, California. 171. Kleenex tissues were originally used as filters in gas masks. 172. The toilet was invented by an Englishman named Thomas Crapper.</p>

<p>1. Medical researchers contend that no disease ever identified has been completely eradicated. 2. The attachment of the human skin to muscles is what causes dimples. 3. No one seems to know why people blush. 4. In 1972, a group of scientists reported that you could cure the common cold by freezing the big toe. 5. The number one cause of blindness in the United States is diabetes. 6. The adult human heart weighs about ten ounces. 7. People who laugh a lot are much healthier than those who don't. Dr. Lee Berk at the Loma Linda School of Public Health in California found that laughing lowers levels of stress hormones, and strengthens the immune system. Six-year-olds have it best - they laugh an average of 300 times a day. Adults only laugh 15 to 100 times a day. 8. People who have a tough time handling the stress of money woes are twice as likely to develop severe gum disease, a new study finds. 9. Between 25% to 33% of the population sneeze when they are exposed to light. 10. Of the 206 bones in the average human adult's body, 106 are in the hands and feet. (54 in the hands and 52 in the feet) 11. In 1815 French chemist Michael Eugene Chevreul realized the first link between diabetes and sugar metabolism when he discovered that the urine of a diabetic was identical to grape sugar. 12. Approximately 16 Canadians have their appendices removed, when not required, every day. 13. Sumerians (from 5000 BC) thought that the liver made blood and the heart was the center of thought. 14. Men have more blood than women. Men have 1.5 gallons for men versus 0.875 gallons for women. 15. The first Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages were three inches wide and eighteen inches long. You made your own bandage by cutting off as much as you needed. 16. The human brain stops growing at the age of 18. 17. In 1977, a 13 year old child found a tooth growing out of his left foot. 18. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 18 million courses of antibiotics are prescribed for the common cold in the United States per year. Research shows that colds are caused by viruses. 50 million unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for viral respiratory infections. 19. It takes an interaction of 72 different muscles to produce human speech. 20. The first known heart medicine was discovered in an English garden. In 1799, physician John Ferriar noted the effect of dried leaves of the common plant, digitalis purpurea, on heart action. Still used in heart medications, digitalis slows the pulse and increases the force of heart contractions and the amount of blood pumped per heartbeat. 21. Blood is red only in the arteries after it has left the heart and is full of oxygen. Blood is a purplish, blue color in the veins as it returns to the heart, thanks to having picked up carbon dioxide and other wastes from the body's cells. In fact, your blood is red throughout only half your body. When cut, of course, the blood always appears red because it is instantly exposed to oxygen outside the body. 22. Contrary to popular belief, hemophiliacs do NOT bleed to death from minor cuts. This rare disease, which affects only males (it is carried by females, but they don't exhibit symptoms), involves an impairment in blood clotting—not an absolute inability to clot. Hemophiliacs today may take clotting serums and often lead fairly normal lives. 23. During his or her lifetime, the average human will grow 590 miles of hair. 24. The average Human bladder can hold 13 ounces of liquid. 25. You lose enough dead skin cells in your lifetime to fill eight five-pound flour bags. 26. Your thumb is the same length as your nose. 27. The storage capacity of human brain exceeds 4 Terrabytes. 28. The Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland was a symbolic character for the hat makers in towns of the late 1800's. The large felt hats of the day had supports made out of lead. The lead caused an organic form of psychosis (brain damage) to develop in the hat makers causing them to be declared crazy. 29. Although your system cannot digest gum like other foods, it won't be stuck inside of you forever. It comes out with other waste your body can't use. 30. The substance that human blood resembles most closely in terms of chemical composition is sea water. 31. The right lung takes in more air than the left lung. 32. A woman's heart beats faster than a man's. 33. The brain requires 25 percent of all oxygen used by the body. 34. There are 10 trillion living cells in the human body. 35. Females have 500 more genes than males, and because of this are protected from things like color blindness and hemophilia. 36. Homo sapiens shouldn't feel too high and mighty, even though they currently dominate the Earth. After all, they are covered with flesh that medical scientists have determined bears an important resemblance to Silly Putty. The specific gravity of your skin and the gooey stuff is close enough that doctors have actually used Silly Putty to align and test CAT scan machines. 37. The short-term memory capacity for most people is between five and nine items or digits. This is one reason that phone numbers were kept to seven digits for so long. 38. Studies shown by the Psychology Department of DePaul University show that the principal reason to lie is to avoid punishment. 39. People who have never been married are seven and a half times more likely than married people to be admitted to a psychiatric facility. 40. Cephalacaudal recapitulation is the reason our extremities develop faster than the rest of us. 41. "Soldiers disease" is a term for morphine addiction. The Civil War produced over 400,000 morphine addicts. 42. Dogs and humans are the only animals with prostates. 43. A study by researcher Frank Hu and the Harvard School of Public Health found that women who snore are at an increased risk of high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. 44. Dr. Maurice R. Hilleman is considered to be the godfather of the modern vaccine era. Having created nearly three dozen vaccines - more than any other scientist, Hilleman is also credited with saving more lives than any other scientist. Probably best known for his preventive vaccine for mumps, Hilleman has also developed vaccines for measles, rubella, chicken pox, bacterial meningitis, flu and hepatitis B. 45. If you combined all the muscles in an average human in to one muscle, the force it would be capable of producing is about 2,000 tonnes. 46. Fluoridated toothpaste came about as the result of a discovery made in Naples, Italy in 1802, when local dentists noticed yellowish-brown spots on their patient's teeth - but no cavities. Subsequent examination revealed that high levels of fluoride in the water caused the spots and prevented tooth decay, and that less fluoride protected teeth without causing the spots. It took a while for the discovery to be implemented; the first U.S. fluoridated water tests didn't take place until 1915, and Crest, the firth toothpaste with fluoride in it didn't hit stores until 1956. 47. According to the Journal of American Medical Association, as of 1998, more than 100,000 Americans die annually from adverse reactions to prescription drugs. 48. You can see a candle flame from 50 Kilometers on a clear, dark night. You can hear the tick of a watch from 6 meters in very quiet conditions. You can taste one gram of salt in 500 liters of water (.0001M). You can detect one drop of perfume diffused throughout a three-room apartment. You can detect the wing of a bee falling on your cheek from a height of one centimeter. 49. Gold salts are sometimes injected into the muscles to relieve arthritis. 50. Undertakers report that human bodies do not deteriorate as quickly as they used to. The reason, they believe, is that the modern diet contains so many preservatives that these chemicals tend to prevent the body from decomposition too rapidly after death. 51. Captain Cook lost 41 of his 98 crew to scurvy (a lack of vitamin C) on his first voyage to the South Pacific in 1768. By 1795 the importance of eating citrus was realized, and lemon juice was issued on all British Navy ships. 52. During a kiss as many as 278 bacteria colonies are exchanged. 53. A passionate kiss uses up 6.4 calories per minute. 54. Drinking water after eating reduces the acid in your mouth by 61 percent. 55. Human thigh bones are stronger than concrete. 56. Hailed as a wonder drug in the late nineteenth century, cocaine was outlawed in the United States in 1914. 57. The lens of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life. 58. The little lump of flesh just forward of your ear canal, right next to your temple, is called a tragus. 59. The first drug that was offered as a water-soluble tablet, was aspirin in 1900. 60. There have been cases of people dying from paper cuts. The paper cut gets infected, and without proper treatment you can die from the infection. 61. Over 25% of Zaire is infected with a form of the Ebola virus that does not kill. 62. There are more than one form of the Ebola virus. Different strains are named after the area they were discovered in. 63. It only takes 7 lbs of pressure to rip off your ears. 64. Brain surgery is done with the patient still awake. The brain has no nerves therefore it has no sensation. The person is put to sleep to open the skull but after that the person wakes up to see the operation be completed. 65. A new born baby breathes five times faster than an adult man. 66. Smoking makes it almost impossible for a male to have a natural erection and it shrinks the penis. It also reduces the mobility of sperm. 67. A follicle that is more oval in shape will produce curlier hair, which, when viewed under a microscope, is more "flat" in appearance than a straight hair, which is "round". 68. Although it's only 2% of our body weight, the brain uses 20% of all oxygen we breathe, 20% of the calories we take in, and 15% of the body's blood supply. 69. Did you know that you can actually die from a broken heart? Studies have shown that people who had experienced great loss or sadness can develop cracks in their heart which could lead to death. 70. Every person has a unique tongue print. 71. Queen Victoria eased the discomfort of her menstrual cramps by having her doctor supply her with marijuana. 72. In 1990, a 64-year old Hartsville, Tennessee, woman entered a hospital for surgery for what doctors diagnosed as a tumor on her buttocks. What surgeons found, however, was a four-inch pork chop bone, which they removed. They estimated that it had been in place for five to ten years. The woman could not remember sitting on it, or eating it for that matter. 73. In Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, in the late 50's thru early 70's, there was a dentist named Dunat Yelle. 74. Americans spend an estimated $500 million each year on allergy treatments. 75. Sarin, the nerve gas believed to have been used in a Tokyo subway attack, can be made by anyone with an undergraduate degree in chemistry using easily obtainable chemicals and a formula readily available on the Internet. The agent, a type of organophosphate pesticide, causes paralysis by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine at nerve junctions. (If you do this, don't blame me when you get put on death row.) 76. Blonde beards grow faster than darker beards. 77. By age sixty, most people have lost half of their taste buds. 78. One group, the Hunza in Northwest Kashmir, reportedly have not experienced cancer. The group is also said to have unusual longevity. 79.

During a lifetime, one person generates more than 1,000 pounds of red blood cells. 82. An itch is a stimulus affecting the nerve endings between the dermis and epidermis; scientists liken it to a form of pain. But that's neither here nor there. It's usually caused by histamine released in the epidermis. Scratching stops it, either by interfering with the nerve impulses or by temporarily damaging the nerves themselves. 83. Scientists have identified more than 300 viruses capable of bringing fatal diseases to insects. The organisms are believed to be entirely different than those that cause disease in humans, and are thus harmless to man. 84. Devoid of its cells and proteins, human blood has the same general makeup as sea water. 85. From the age of thirty, humans gradually begin to shrink in size. 86. Despite accounting for just one-fiftieth of body weight, the brain burns as much as one-fifth of our daily caloric intake. 87. Your jaw muscle is the most powerful muscle in your body. 88.

Between the ages of 30 and 70, you nose may lengthen and widen by as much as half an inch. 101. The sense of touch: electrical impulses travel from the skin toward the spinal cord at a rate of up to 425 feet per second. 102. You blink every 2-10 seconds. As you focus on each word in this sentence, your eyes swing back and forth 100 times a second, and every second; the retina performs 10 billion computer-like calculations. 103. Each red blood cell lives an average of 4 months and travels between the lungs and other tissues 75,000 times before returning to the bone marrow to die. 104. The average square inch of skin holds 650 sweat glands, 20 blood vessels, 60,000 melanocytes, and during the summer months, six or seven mosquito bites. 105. The lens of the human eye continues to go throughout a person's life. 106. If you squeezed out all of the bacteria from your intestines, you could almost fill up a coffee mug. 107. Several well documented instances have been reported of extremely obese people flushing aircraft toilets whilst still sitting on them. The vacuum action of these toilets sucked the rectum inside out. 108. When honey is swallowed, it enters the blood stream within a period of 20 minutes. 109.

Electrical stimulation in certain areas of the brain can revive long lost memories. 116. Ever wonder how a mortician keeps a dead person's mouth shut? Undertakers pass a suture through he nasal septum and tie it to the lower lip. Or the use an injector needle gun to place wires into the lower and upper jaws; these are then twisted together to close the mouth. 117. The average person can go as many as eleven days without water. That's assuming a mean temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. 118. Human lungs are 100 times easier to blow up than a standard toy balloon. But they tend to make lousy party favors. 119. Heroin is the brand name of morphine once marketed by Bayer. 120.

Her family moved 19 times before she was 15. 3. When the Yardbirds broke up in 1968, Jimmy Page was left to honor the band's commitments, performing as The New Yardbirds. The group eventually evolved into Led Zeppelin. 4. At age 47, the Rolling Stones' bassist, Bill Wyman, began a relationship with 13-year old Mandy Smith, with her mother's blessing. Six years later, they were married, but the marriage only lasted a year. Not long after, Bill's 30-year-old son Stephen married Mandy's mother, age 46. That made Stephen a stepfather to his former stepmother. If Bill and Mandy had remained married, Stephen would have been his father's father-in-law and his own grandpa. 5. The brass family of instruments include the trumpet, trombone, tuba, cornet, flügelhorn, French horn, saxhorn, and sousaphone. While they are usually made of brass today, in the past they were made of wood, horn, and glass. 6. Most toilets flush in E flat. 7. The rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd took their name from a high school teacher named Leonard Skinner who had suspended several students for having long hair. 8. According to Beatles producer George Martin, Neal Hefti's catchy composition of the 1960's "Batman" Emmy-winning theme song inspired George Harrison to write the hit song "Taxman." 9. At the tender age of 7, the multi-award-winning composer and pianist Marvin Hamlisch ("The Way We Were," "The Sting") was one of the youngest students ever admitted to the renowned Juilliard School of Music in New York City. 10. In the band KISS, Gene Simmons was "The Demon", Paul Stanley was "Star Child", Ace Frehley was "Space Man", and Peter Criss was "The Cat. 11.

The famous Russian composer Aleksandr Borodin was also a respected chemistry professor in St. Petersburg. 13. In 1992, Sarah Ophelia Colley Cannon, better known to country music fans as singer/comedienne Minnie Pearl, was awarded a National Medal of Arts by President George Bush. In 1994, Minnie became the first woman to be inducted into the Comedy Hall of Fame. She was too frail and sick to attend the ceremony, and so good friend and comedian George Lindsey ("Goober") accepted the award for her. She died in 1996 at age 83. 14. Bill Haley and the Comets, one of rock and roll's pioneer groups actually began their career's as Bill Haley's Saddle Pals - a country music act. 15.

In 1939 Irving Berlin composed a Christmas song but thought so little of it that he never showed it to anybody. He just tossed it into a trunk and didn't see fit to retrieve it until he needed it for a Bing Crosby-Fred Astaire movie, HOLIDAY INN 10 years later. Bing Crosby was a staunch Catholic and at first refused to sing the song because he felt it tended to commercialize Christmas. He finally agreed, took eighteen minutes to make the recording, and then the "throw-away" song become an all-time hit. Crosby's version has sold over 40 million copies. All together, this song has appeared in 750 versions, selling 6 million copies of sheet music and 90,000,000 recordings ,just in the United States and Canada. You might not recognize the song from the movie HOLIDAY INN...or from the composer's name of Irving Berlin. But you're bound to know it because it's on everyone's list of Christmas favorites: WHITE CHRISTMAS. 17.

When the producers approached the Beatles about this film, the group, which hated the TV cartoon show of them, agreed to it only as a easy way of completing their movie contract. As such, they contributed only a few old songs and four quickly produced numbers, Only a Northern Song, Hey Bulldog, All Together Now, and It's All Too Much. However, when they saw the finished film, they were so impressed by it that they decided to appear in a short live action epilogue to the film. 38.

"Memory," has become a contemporary classic. It's been recorded more than 600 times, including as international hit recordings for such artists as Barbra Streisand, Barry Manilow and Judy Collins, among many others. It's most recent incarnations underline its diverse and universal appeal: as a #1 dance smash by European chanteuse Natalie Grant, and as a duet for Placido Domingo and Natalie Cole during a live telecast of the tenor's world tour. 42. Elvis Presley's hit recording of "Love Me Tender" entered Billboard's pop charts in October 1956. It stayed on the charts for 19 weeks, and was in the Number 1 spot for five of those weeks.

Beethoven's Fifth, was the first symphony to include trombones. 46. EMI stands for ' Electrical and Musical Instruments'. 47. The only musical instrument you play without touching it is called the theremin. The technology is simple: when activated, the theremin generates a sonic field around a small antenna that sticks out vertically from the top. When you put your hand closer to the antenna, the sound field is broken and the unit emits a high-pitched, electronic wail-that's the music. Different varieties of pitch are achieved by placing your hand closer to the antenna and moving it away. When your hand approaches the antenna, a low pitch will be created. As your hand gets nearer the antenna, the pitch becomes higher. (It's easily recognized for its spooky "ooo-eee-ooo" sound. You know it if you've heard the Beach Boys song "Good Vibrations.") 48. Brian Epstein, a record store owner in London, was asked by a customer for a copy of the record, "My Bonnie", by a group known as The Silver Beatles.

Vaudevillian Jack Norworth wrote "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" in 1908 after seeing a sign on a bus advertising BASEBALL TODAY - POLO GROUNDS. Norworth and his friend Albert von Tilzer (who write the music) had never been to a baseball game before his song became a hit sing-along. 58. The Japanese national anthem is expressed in only four lines. The Greek anthem runs 158 verses. 59. John Philip Sousa enlisted in the Marines at age 13. He worked as an apprentice in the band. 60. At age 14, George Harrison joined his friend Paul McCartney's band, the Quarry Men, led by John Lennon. 61. Dances with twisting motions accompanied jazz as far back as Jelly Roll Morton. The Paul Williams Saxtet - a sax-intensive jazz combo - recorded a two-sided 78 called "The Twister." Chubby Checker wasn't even the first man to record the song "The Twist." Hank Ballard was, in 1959. 62. At age 15, Jerry Garcia swapped his birthday accordion for an electric guitar. 63. At age 4, Mozart composed a concerto for the clavier. 64.

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2A/s/User%7EA_star_actress_6137.html" title="Edit section: Myths">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Myths</span></h4>
<p>1. One legend claims stealing someone's shadow (by measuring it against a wall and driving a nail through its head) can turn the victim into a vampire.</p>
<p>2. Avoid people who talk to themselves. According to Ukrainian legend, that could indicate a dual soul and the second one doesn't die! Also watch out for the seventh son of a seventh son, a person born with a red caul (amniotic membrane covering the head), or a child born with teeth. A vampire can result if a cat or dog walks over a fresh grave, a bat flies over the corpse, or the person has died suddenly as a result of suicide or murder. Unfinished business can also cause a body to rise, as can inadequate burial rites, including a grave that is too shallow.</p>
<p>3. Most vampires are described in folklore as flushed and ruddy, with swollen bodies and bloated faces. Often, they can be identified because they're sitting up in the grave.</p>
<p>4. According to folklore, there are a number of ways to protect yourself from vampires, including the ever-popular wearing of garlic or a religious symbol. You can slow a vampire down by giving him something to do, like pick up poppy seeds or unravel a net. (They're quite compulsive.) Cross water and he can't follow. If you can find the body, give it a bottle of whiskey or food so it doesn't have to travel. If that doesn't work, either shoot the corpse (may require a silver bullet) or drive a stake through the heart. And remember, the vampire won't enter your dwelling unless invited.</p>
<p>5. Trivia is the Roman goddess of sorcery, hounds and the crossroads.</p>
<p>6. In Dante's "Inferno" the Ninth Circle of Hell is reserved for those who betray family or country. The denizens of this deepest circle, who are frozen in ice, include Judas (betrayer of Christ) and Cassius and Brutus (betrayers of Julius Caesar).</p>
<p>7. Abe Silverstein, who headed NASA's Space Flight Development Program, proposed the name Apollo for the space exploration programs in the 1960's. He chose that legendary Greek name because the virile Apollo was a god who rode through the skies in a magnificent golden chariot. The precedent of naming manned spacecraft for mythological gods had been set earlier with Project Mercury, also named by Silverstein.</p>
<p>8. Some people consider the $1 bill unlucky because there are so many 13's on it: 13 stars, 13 stripes, 13 steps, 13 arrows and even an olive branch with 13 leaves on it. Of course the $1 bill is unlucky - if it was lucky it would be a $100 bill.</p>
<p>9. The name of the legendary Lady Godiva's horse - Aethenoth</p>
<p>10. An artificial spider and web are often included in the decorations on Ukrainian Christmas trees. A spider web found on Christmas morning is believed to bring good luck.</p>
<p>11. When visiting Finland, Santa leaves his sleigh behind and rides on a goat named Ukko. Finnish folklore has it that Ukko is made of straw, but is strong enough to carry Santa Claus anyway.</p>
<p>12. According to legend, if a hare crosses a person's path as he starts out on a journey, the trip will be unlucky and it's best to return home and start again. If a pregnant woman sees a hare, her child may be born with a hare-lip. If a hare runs down the main street of a town, it foretells a fire. Cornish legend says that girls who die of grief after being rejected by a lover turn into white hares and haunt their former beaus.</p>
<p>13. Ancient Greeks wove marjoram into funeral wreaths and put them on the graves of loved ones. The wreaths served as prayers for the happiness of the deceased in a future life.</p>
<p>14. Breaking of a glass is traditional in some wedding ceremonies. This custom symbolizes different things. To some its the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem, and for some its the represents the fragility of a relationship.</p>
<p>15. In Greek culture, brides carry a lump of sugar in their wedding glove. It's supposed to bring sweetness to their married life.</p>
<p>16. Placing a wreath on a grave is part of an ancient belief it was necessary to provide comforts for the dead and give them gifts in order for their spirits to not haunt the mourners. The circular arrangement represents a magic circle which is supposed to keep the spirit within its bounds.</p>
<p>17. The Sphinx at Giza in Egypt is 240 feet long and carved out of limestone. Built by Pharaoh Khafre to guard the way to his pyramid, it has a lion's body and the ruler's head.</p>
<p>18. The Vikings believed that the Northern lights which are seen from time to time in the north sky were caused by the flashing armor and spears of Odin's handmaidens as they rode out to collect warriors slain in battle.</p>
<p>19. One gift-giving taboo in China is the giving of straw sandals, which are associated with funerals, and therefore considered bad luck.</p>
<p>20. Crossing one's fingers is a way of secretly making the sign of the Cross. It was started by early Christians to ask for divine assistance without attracting the attention of pagans.</p>
<p>21. One sign of rain that farmers once searched for was for their pigs to pick up sticks and walk around with them in their mouths.</p>
<p>22. During the Civil War, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant believed that onions would prevent dysentery and other physical ailments. He reportedly sent the following message via wire to the War Department: "I will not move my army without onions." Within a day, the U.S. government sent three trainloads of onions to the front.</p>
<p>23. Contrary to popular belief, there are almost no Buddhists in India, nor have there been for about a thousand years.</p>
<p>24. On the stone temples of Madura in southern India, there are more than 30 million carved images of gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>25. One superstition says that if a girl leaves her house early on Valentine's Day and the first person she meets is a man, then she will be married within three months.</p>
<p>26. Less romantic was the old historical opinion that Valentine's Day is a good day to prepare eels for the purposes of magic. Eating an eel's heart was once believed to enable a person to see into the future.</p>
<p>27. The reason one wears a wedding ring on the third finger is that (tradition says) there is supposed to be a vein which goes directly from that finger to the heart—i.e., the seat of love. Also, not everyone wears that wedding ring on the third finger of the LEFT hand. In some traditions, such as the Jewish one, it is worn on the right hand. Also, I'm given to understand that nuns ("brides of Christ") wear a wedding ring, again on the right hand.</p>
<p>28. To prevent evil spirits from entering the bodies of their male children, parents dressed them in blue. Blue was chosen because it's the color of the sky and was therefore associated with heavenly spirits.</p>
<p>29. Girls weren't dressed in blue, apparently because people didn't think that evil spirits would bother with them. Eventually, however, girls did get their own color: pink. Pink was chosen because of an old English legend which said that girls were born inside of pink roses.</p>
<p>30. The famous Citgo sign near Fenway Park in Boston is maintained not by Citgo, but by Boston's historical society.</p>
<p>31. In the 1700's you could purchase insurance against going to hell, in London England.</p>
<p>32. The Aztec Indians of Mexico believed turquoise would protect them from physical harm, and so warriors used these green and blue stones to decorate their battle shields.</p>
<p>33. Black cats are considered lucky in England.</p>
<p>34. Long ago, the people of Nicaragua believed that if they threw beautiful young women into a volcano it would stop erupting.</p>
<p>35. In medieval times, thunderstorms were believed by some to be the work of demons. So when it stormed, bell ringers would go up into the bell towers to ring the consecrated bells in an effort to stop the storm. This practice didn't always work out well for the bell ringer.</p>
<p>36. No one knows where the expression "to grin like a Cheshire cat" originated, but it wasn't with Carroll. The Cheshire cat is a well-known character in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but the expression, meaning a sneering smile that shows the gums, existed long before he wrote the book. There is no such breed of cat.</p>
<p>37. Superstition says that the left side is the wrong side of the bed.</p>
<p>38. Aphrodite was the Greek goddess of love.</p>
<p>39. The ace of spades in a playing card deck symbolizes death.</p>
<p>40. The dove is considered the symbol of peace.</p>
<p>41. Ra was the sun god of ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>42. The mythical figure Father Time carries an hourglass and a scythe.</p>
<p>43. It's a myth that owls don't hunt in the daytime because they can't see in daylight. It's just that rats and mice, the main items on owl menus, are most active after dark.</p>
<p>44. Many sailors believe a cat on board a ship means a lucky trip.</p>
<p>45. The mythical Scottish town of Brigadoon appears for one day every 100 years.</p>
<p>46. January is named for the Roman god Janus.</p>
<p>47. Influenza got its name from that fact that people believed the disease was because of the evil "influence" of stars.</p>
<p>48. During the middle ages, it was widely believed that men had one less rib than woman. This is because of the story in the Bible that Eve had been created out of Adam's rib.</p>
<p>49. The seven deadly sins (sins serious enough to kill one's soul) are currently anger, envy, pride, sloth, lust, gluttony, and covetousness. They haven't always been so, however. Originally, there were eight deadly sins (as proposed by Avagrius of Pontus). The eight (in order of increasing severity) were gluttony, lust, avarice, sadness, anger, apathy, vainglory, and pride. Gregory the Great later decided that vainglory and pride were too much alike to be counted separately and combined them. He added envy. Later still, the Roman Catholic Church decided sadness wasn't a sin, and added sloth. Somewhere along the way, apathy was dropped as well.</p>
<p>50. Hindu men once believed it to be unluckily to marry a third time. They could avoid misfortune by marrying a tree first. The tree (his third wife) was then burnt, freeing him to marry again.</p>
<p>51. When christening a ship, instead of using champagne, the Vikings would sacrifice a human being.</p>
<p>52. The Vikings also thought the spirits of the murdered person would guide and guard the craft.</p>

<p>1. The leaves of the Victorian water lily are sometimes over six feet in diameter. 2. Orchids are grown from seed so small that it would take thirty thousand to weigh as much as one grain of wheat. 3. At last count there were about 226,000 trees in New York's Central Park. 4. The Curly Redwood Lodge is one of northern California’s most unique lodges. It was built from one curly redwood tree that produced 57,000 board feet of lumber. The tree - cut down in 1952 - was 18 feet 2 inches at the trunk. Curly redwood is unique because of the curly grain of the wood, unlike typical straight grained redwood. 5. The Mexican Jumping Bean is not a bean. It is actually a thin-shelled section of a seed capsule containing the larva of a small gray moth called the jumping bean moth (Laspeyresia saltitans). 6. The average ear of corn has eight-hundred kernels arranged in sixteen rows. 7. Trees do not have life expectancies like humans. Some in California are believed to be four-thousand years old or more. How can trees live so long? The simple answer is that they're not as complex as people. So, as long as conditions are right, trees continue to live and grow, until something interrupts it. 8. In ancient religions, the Norsemen considered the mistletoe a baleful plant that caused the death of Baldur, the shining god of youth. 9. Carrageenan is a common ingredient in ice cream and toothpaste. Carrageenan is seaweed. A purple, edible seaweed, also known as Irish moss, that's found along the coasts of Northern Europe and North America. It's used as a suspending agent in foods, pharmaceuticals and liquids, as a clarifying agent for beverages, and in controlling crystal growth in frozen confections. 10. A single coffee tree yields only one pound of roasted, ground coffee annually. 11. Bamboo can grow up to three feet in a 24 hour period. 12. Kudzu is not indigenous to the South, but in that climate it can grow up to six inches a day. 13. The shape of plant collenchyma cells and the shape of the bubbles in beer foam are the same - they are orthotetrachidecahedrons. 14. American colonists discovered that superior candles could be made from the fruit of a squat bush growing in the sand dunes along the New England seashore. The small, grayish bayberry was picked, crushed, and boiled. It had to be skimmed several times before the pale, nearly transparent, green fat was sufficiently refined. Bayberry candles were highly prized, because so much labor and so many berries were needed to make just one candle. 15. Oak trees do not have acorns until they are fifty years old or older. 16. A person standing under an oak tree is 16 more times liable to be hit by lightning than if he had taken refuge beneath a beech tree. The oak tree has vertical roots which provide a more direct route to ground water. 17. The partridge berry is a botanical Siamese twin. Each berry develops from 2 flowers. 18. The giant sequoia, which produces millions of seeds, can take 175 to 200 years to flower. No other organism takes this long to mature sexually. 19. There are an estimated 285,000 species of flowering plants on Earth compared to 148,000 for all other plants. Flowering plants are very important because they provide food for herbivores - plant-eating animals - and for humans. 20. Leaves of the Sumatra breadfruit tree are notched when they first form, yet have no indentations when the leaves mature. 21. The Sitka spruce is Britain's most commonly planted tree. 22. The squirting cucumber (Ecballium elaterium), when brushed by a passerby, ejects its seeds and a stream of poisonous juice that stings the skin. 23. The Saguaro Cactus, found in the Southwestern United States doesn't grow branches until it is 75 years old. 24. Lightning keeps plants alive. The intense heat of lightning forces nitrogen in the air to mix with oxygen, forming nitrogen oxides that are soluble in water and fall to the ground in rain. Plants need nitrates to survive, so without lightning, plants could not live. 25. Pine, spruce, or other evergreen wood should never be used for barbecuing. These woods, when burning or smoking, can add harmful tar and resins to the food. Only hardwoods should be used for smoking and grilling, such as oak, pecan, hickory, maple, cherry, alder, apple, or mesquite, depending on the type of meat being cooked. 26. Heroin is derived from the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum, which means the poppy that brings sleep. 27. An ear of corn averages 800 kernels in 16 rows. A pound of corn consists of approximately 1,300 kernels. 100 bushels of corn produces approximately 7,280,000 kernels. Corn is produced on every continent of the world with the exception of Antarctica. 28. The tree dictated on the Lebanese flag is a Cedar. 29. Of the 15,000-odd known species of orchids in the world, 3,000 of them can be found in Brazil. 30. The telegraph plant of Asia has leaves that flutter constantly, even when there is no breeze. 31. The giant puffball, lycoperdon giganteum, produces 7,000,000,000,000 spores, each of which could grow into a puffball a foot in diameter and collectively cover an area of 280,000 square mile, greater than the size of Texas. Fortunately, only one of the spores actually becomes a puffball, and all the others die. 32. The slippers plant (bulbo stylis) of Haiti looks like a pair of fuzzy slippers. 33. The primary purpose of growing rice in flooded paddies is to drown the weeds surrounding the young seedlings. Rice can, in fact, be grown in drained areas. 34. The fragrance of flowers is due to the essences of oil which they produce. 35. While known as a painter, sculptor, architect, and engineer, Leonard da Vinci was the first to record that the number of rings in the cross section of a tree trunk revealed its age. He also discovered that the width between the rings indicated the annual moisture. 36. The bark of a redwood tree is fireproof. Fires that occur in a redwood forest take place inside the trees. 37. A plant in central Australia, the candlesticks of the sun, grows a candle-shaped flower once every 7 years. 38. The woman's tongue of Zanzibar is a plant with pods full of seeds which rattle continuously. 39. The Siberian larch accounts for more than 20% of all the worlds trees.</p>

<p>1. In the Durango desert, in Mexico, there's a creepy spot called the "Zone of Silence." You can't pick up clear TV or radio signals. And locals say fireballs sometimes appear in the sky. 2. Ethernet is a registered trademark of Xerox, Unix is a registered trademark of AT&amp;T. 3.

The final resting-place for Dr. Eugene Shoemaker - the Moon. The famed U.S. Geological Survey astronomer, trained the Apollo astronauts about craters, but never made it into space. Mr. Shoemaker had wanted to be an astronaut but was rejected because of a medical problem. His ashes were placed on board the Lunar Prospector spacecraft before it was launched on January 6, 1998. NASA crashed the probe into a crater on the moon in an attempt to learn if there is water on the moon. 6. Outside the USA, Ireland is the largest software producing country in the world. 7. The first fossilized specimen of Australopithecus afarenisis was named Lucy after the paleontologists' favorite song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," by the Beatles. 8.

If you went out into space, you would explode before you suffocated because there's no air pressure. 14. The radioactive substance, Americanium - 241 is used in many smoke detectors. 15. The original IBM-PCs, that had hard drives, referred to the hard drives as Winchester drives. This is due to the fact that the original Winchester drive had a model number of 3030. This is, of course, a Winchester firearm. 16. Sound travels 15 times faster through steel than through the air. 17. On average, half of all false teeth have some form of radioactivity. 18. Only one satellite has been ever been destroyed by a meteor: the European Space Agency's Olympus in 1993. 19. Starch is used as a binder in the production of paper. It is the use of a starch coating that controls ink penetration when printing. Cheaper papers do not use as much starch, and this is why your elbows get black when you are leaning over your morning paper. 20. Sterling silver is not pure silver. Because pure silver is too soft to be used in most tableware it is mixed with copper in the proportion of 92.5 percent silver to 7.5 percent copper. 21. A ball of glass will bounce higher than a ball of rubber. A ball of solid steel will bounce higher than one made entirely of glass. 22. A chip of silicon a quarter-inch square has the capacity of the original 1949 ENIAC computer, which occupied a city block. 23. An ordinary TNT bomb involves atomic reaction, and could be called an atomic bomb. What we call an A-bomb involves nuclear reactions and should be called a nuclear bomb. 24. At a glance, the Celsius scale makes more sense than the Fahrenheit scale for temperature measuring. But its creator, Anders Celsius, was an oddball scientist. When he first developed his scale, he made freezing 100 degrees and boiling 0 degrees, or upside down. No one dared point this out to him, so fellow scientists waited until Celsius died to change the scale. 25. At a jet plane's speed of 1,000 km (620mi) per hour, the length of the plane becomes one atom shorter than its original length. 26. The first full moon to occur on the winter solstice, Dec. 22, commonly called the first day of winter, happened in 1999. Since a full moon on the winter solstice occurred in conjunction with a lunar perigee (point in the moon's orbit that is closest to Earth), the moon appeared about 14% larger than it does at apogee (the point in it's elliptical orbit that is farthest from the Earth). Since the Earth is also several million miles closer to the sun at that time of the year than in the summer, sunlight striking the moon was about 7% stronger making it brighter. Also, this was the closest perigee of the Moon of the year since the moon's orbit is constantly deforming. In places where the weather was clear and there was a snow cover, even car headlights were superfluous. 27. According to security equipment specialists, security systems that utilize motion detectors won't function properly if walls and floors are too hot. When an infrared beam is used in a motion detector, it will pick up a person's body temperature of 98.6 degrees compared to the cooler walls and floor. If the room is too hot, the motion detector won't register a change in the radiated heat of that person's body when it enters the room and breaks the infrared beam. Your home's safety might be compromised if you turn your air conditioning off or set the thermostat too high while on summer vacation. 28. Western Electric successfully brought sound to motion pictures and introduced systems of mobile communications which culminated in the cellular telephone. 29. On December 23, 1947, Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., held a secret demonstration of the transistor which marked the foundation of modern electronics. 30. The wick of a trick candle has small amounts of magnesium in them. When you light the candle, you are also lighting the magnesium. When someone tries to blow out the flame, the magnesium inside the wick continues to burn and, in just a split second (or two or three), relights the wick. 31. Time slows down near a black hole; inside it stops completely. 32. Tiny dust particles surround a comet. They are swept into a long tail by the solar wind, which consists of subatomic particles speeding from the sum at speed of hundred of miles per second. 33. To an observer standing on Pluto, the sun would appear no brighter than Venus appears in our evening sky. 34. Traveling at the speed of 186,000 miles per second, light take 6 hours to travel from Pluto to the earth. 35. A brown dwarf is a very small, dark object, with a mass less than 1/10 that of the Sun. They are 'failed stars', globules of gas that have shrunk under gravity, but failed to ignite and shine as stars. 36. A bucket filled with earth would weigh about 5 time more than the same bucket filled with the substance of the sun. However, the force of gravity is so much greater on the sun that the man weighing 150 pounds on our planet would weigh 2 tons on the sun. 37. A car traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour would take over 48 million years to reach the nearest star (other than our sun), Proxima Centauri. This is about 685,000 average human lifetimes. 38. A cosmic year is the amount of time it takes the sun to revolve around the center of the Milky Way, about 225 million years. 39. A day on the planet Mercury is twice as long as its year. Mercury rotates very slowly but revolves around the sun in slightly less than 88 days. 40. A dog was killed by a meteor at Nakhla, Egypt, in 1911. The unlucky canine is the only creature known to have been killed by a meteor. 41. You know the three physical dimensions, and the fourth dimension, time. For years, people have speculated about other dimensions. Experts in theoretical physics now say the major theories about the universe make sense together - and all the math seems to work - if there are 10 dimensions. 42. A scientist at Michigan State University has calculated that the production of a single hen egg requires about 120 gallons of water, a loaf of bread requires 300 gallons, and a pound of beef, 3,500. 43. Portland cement is used for underwater work. It hardens because of a chemical reaction it has with the water, not because the water mixed with it evaporates. The amount of water that reacts with the cement is crucial for this process, and the physical structure of this cement enables it to control exactly how much water gets into the reaction. So it doesn't matter at all how much water surrounds the cement as long as it has enough to set. 44. Dating back to the 1600's, thermometers were filled with Brandy instead of mercury. 45. The first "technology" corporation to move into California's Silicon Valley was Hewlett-Packard, in 1938. Stanford University engineers Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard started their company in a Palo Alto garage, with $1,538. Their first product was an audio oscillator bought by Walt Disney Studios for use in making Fantasia. 46. The first U.S. census to be tallied by computer was in 1950. UNIVAC did the tallying. 47. Rain contains vitamin B12. 48. ENIAC, the first electronic computer, appeared 50 years ago. The original ENIAC was about 80 feet long, weighed 30 tons, had 17,000 tubes. By comparison, a desktop computer today can store a million times more information than an ENIAC, and 50,000 times faster. 49. From bridges to rebar, rust is everywhere. According to a recent study, the annual cost of metallic corrosion in the U.S. is approximately $300 billion. The report, by Battelle, Columbus, Ohio, and the Specialty Steel Industry of North America, Washington, D.C., estimated that about one-third of that cost could be avoided through broader application of corrosion-resistant material and "best anti-corrosive practice" from design through maintenance. 50. From the smallest microprocessor to the biggest mainframe, the average American depends on over 264 computers per day. 51. The first man-made item to exceed the speed of sound is the bull whip our leather whip. When the whip is snapped, the knotted end makes a "crack" or popping noise. It is actually causing a mini sonic boom as it exceeds the speed of sound. 52. The hardness of ice is similar to that of concrete. 53. A full moon always rises at sunset. 54. A bowl of lime Jell-O, when hooked up to an EEG machine, exhibited movement which is virtually identical to the brain waves of a healthy adult man or woman. 55. If the world were tilted one degree more either way, the planet would not be habitable because the area around the equator would be too hot and the poles would be too cold. 56. The opposite of a "vacuum" is a "plenum." 57. In 1980, Namco released PAC-MAN, the most popular video game (or arcade game) of all time. The original name was going to be PUCK MAN, but executives saw the potential for vandals to scratch out part of the P in the games marquee and labeling. 58. Clothes that are dried outside DO smell better because of a process called photolysis. What happens is this: sunlight breaks down compounds in the laundry that cause odor, such as perspiration and body oils. 59. Clouds fly higher during the day than the night. 60. Dirty snow melts faster than clean. 61. Back in the mid to late 80's, an IBM compatible computer wasn't considered a hundred percent compatible unless it could run Microsoft's Flight Simulator, probably because of the fact that it is one of the hardest programs to get running. 62. Some early TV screens did emit excessive X-rays, as did computer monitors, but that was fixed long ago. Doctors suggest that at worst, sitting too close might cause some temporary eye fatigue—the same for reading with insufficient light—but no permanent damage, no matter what your mother claimed. 63. A "fulgerite" is fossilized lightning. It forms when a powerful lightning bolt melts the soil into a glass-like state. 64. If you stand in the bottom of a well, you would be able to see the stars even in the daytime. 65. STASI, the East German secret police organization, devised a devilishly clever way to prevent someone from giving them the slip during the Cold War: they managed to synthesize the scent of a female dog in heat, which they applied to the shoes of the person under surveillance. Then they simply had a male dog follow the scent. 66. Experiments conducted in Germany and at the University of Southampton in England show that even mild and incidental noises cause the pupils of the eyes to dilate. It is believed that this is why surgeons, watchmakers, and others who perform delicate manual operations are so bothered by noise. The sounds cause their pupils to change focus and blur their vision. 67. A downburst is a downward blowing wind that sometimes comes blasting out of a thunderstorm. The damage looks like tornado damage, since the wind can be as strong as an F2 tornado, but debris is blown straight away from a point on the ground. It's not lofted into the air and transported downwind. 68. On December 2, 1942, a nuclear chain reaction was achieved for the first time under the stands of the University of Chicago’s football stadium. The first reactor measured 30 feet wide, 32 feet long, and 21.5 feet high. It weighed 1,400 tons and contained 52 tons of uranium in the form of uranium metal and uranium oxide. Although the same process led to the massive energy release of the atomic bomb, the first artificially sustained nuclear reaction produced just enough energy to light a small flashlight. 69. A raisin dropped in a glass of fresh champagne will bounce up and down continually from the bottom of the glass to the top. This is because the carbonation in the drink gets pockets of air stuck in the wrinkles of the raisin, which is light enough to be raised by this air. When it reaches the surface of the champagne, the bubbles pop, and the raisin sinks back to the bottom, starting the cycle over. 70. Bacteria, the tiniest free-living cells, are so small that a single drop of liquid contains as many as 50 million of them. 71. The proper name of earth's satellite is Luna. The grammar books say that "moon" (and likewise "earth" and "sun") should be lower case, with the exception of when "earth" is in a list with other planets. The earth is Terra; the sun is Sol. This is where we get the words "extraTERREstrial" and "SOLar". 72. At any given time, there are 1,800 thunderstorms in progress over the earth's atmosphere. 73. Compact discs read from the inside to the outside edge, the reverse of how a record works. 74. Because of the rotation of the earth, an object can be thrown farther if it is thrown west. 75. The fastest moon in our solar system circles Jupiter once every seven hours - traveling at 70,400 miles per hour. 76. George Ellery Hale was the 20th century's most important builder of telescopes. In 1897, Hale built a 40 inch wide telescope, the largest ever built at that time. His second telescope, with a sixty inch lens, was set up in 1917 and took 14 years to build. During the 14 years Hale became convinced that he suffered from "Americanitis" a disorder in which the ambitions of Americans drive them insane. During the building of his 100 inch lens Hale spent time in a sanatorium and would only discuss his plans for the telescope with a "sympathetic green elf". 77. Hale's 100 inch lens built in the early 1900s was the largest solid piece of glass made until then. The lens was made by a French specialist who poured the equivalent of ten thousand melted champagne bottles into a mold packed with heat maintaining manure so that the glass would cool slowly and not crack. 78. The shockwave from a nitroglycerine explosion travels at 17,000 miles per hour. 79. The planet Saturn has a density lower than water. If there was a bathtub large enough to hold it, Saturn would float. 80. Earth's atmosphere is, proportionally, thinner than the skin of an apple. 81. The first portable calculator placed on sale by Texas Instruments weighed only 2-1/2 pounds and cost a mere $150. (1971) 82. Carolyn Shoemaker has discovered 32 comets and approximately 800 asteroids. 83. Because of the salt content of the Dead Sea, it is difficult to dive below its surface. 84. The planet Venus has the longest day. 85. The first atomic bomb exploded at Trinity Site, New Mexico. 86. All organic compounds contain carbon. 87. Three astronauts manned each Apollo flight. 88. Out of all the senses, smell is most closely linked to memory. 89. There are 7 stars in the Big Dipper. 90. Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. 91. The speed of sound must be exceeded to produce a sonic boom. 92. The nearest galaxy to our own is Andromeda. 93. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is predicted to topple over between 2010 and 2020. 94. Mercury is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature. 95. Blood is 6 times thicker than water. 96. Dissolved salt makes up 3.5 percent of the oceans. 97. Three stars make up Orion's belt. 98. Glaciers store about 75% of the world's freshwater. In Washington State alone, glaciers provide 470 billion gallons of water each summer. 99. To an observer standing on Pluto, the sun would appear no brighter than Venus appears in our evening sky. 100. Traveling at the speed of 186,000 miles per second, light take 6 hours to travel from Pluto to the earth. 101. A car traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour would take over 48 million years to reach the nearest star (other than our sun), Proxima Centauri. This is about 685,000 average human lifetimes. 102. Scientists recently announced the discovery of a new planet orbiting a star that's practically next door - relatively speaking. There's also the possibility that the system might contain a second planet. The star, Epsilon Eridani, is only 10.5 light years away — which is just down the block in astronomical terms — making it the nearest star known to have such a planet. The new planet appears similar to Jupiter, but half again as big. The discovery was made by a team of researchers led by scientists at the McDonald Observatory at the University of Texas at Austin. 103. A cosmic year is the length of time it takes the sun to complete one revolution around the center of the Milky Way galaxy. That's approximately 225 million earth years. 104. The sun is estimated to be between 20 and 21 cosmic years old. 105. It takes a plastic container 50000 years to start decomposing. 106. Lab tests can detect traces of alcohol in urine six to 12 hours after a person has stopped drinking. 107. Sound at the right vibration can bore holes through a solid object. 108. The color black is produced by the complete absorption of light rays. 109. There are 3 golf balls sitting on the moon. 110. The Sun has a diameter of 864,000 miles. 111. Air is denser in cold weather. A wind of the same speed can exert 25 percent more force during the winter as compared to the summer. 112. An iceberg contains more heat than a match. 113. Every cubic mile of seawater holds over 150 million tons of minerals. 114. A temperature of 70 million degrees Celsius was generated at Princeton University in 1978. This was during a fusionism experiment and is the highest man-made temperature ever. 115. Bacteria can reproduce sexually. 116. The pressure at the center of the Earth is 27,000 tons per square inch. 117. There are five tillion trillion atoms in one pound of iron. 118. German chemist Hennig Brand discovered phosphorus while he was examining urine. 119. The densest substance on Earth is the metal "osmium." 120. The clock at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., will gain or lose only one second in 300 years because it uses cesium atoms. 121. Vineger was the strongest acid known in the ancient times. 122. A shrimp has more than a hundred pair of chromosomes in each cell nucleus. 123. About 500 meteorites hit the Earth each year. The largest known meteorite was found at Grootfontein in Namibia, southwest Africa, in 1920. It is 9 feet (2.75m) long and 8 feet (2.43m) wide. 124. According to experts, large caves tend to "breathe"; they inhale and exhale great quantities of air when the barometric pressure on the surface changes, and air rushes in or out seeking equilibrium. 125. Because of a large orbital eccentricity, Pluto was closer to the sun than Neptune between January 1979 and March 1999. 126. The whirling cloud, a flat cloud hovering over the peak of an extinct volcano, Mount Jirinaj in Indonesia, affected by hot air rising from the crater, spins swiftly around and around. 127. The Earth gets heavier each day by tons, as meteoric dust settles on it. 128. The earth rotates on its axis more slowly in March than in September. 129. The first man-made insecticide was DDT. 130. We are in the middle of an ice age. Ice ages include both cold and warm periods; at the moment we are experiencing a relatively warm span of time known as an "interglacial period." Geologists believe that the warmest part of this period occurred from 1890 through 1945 and that since 1945 things have slowly begun freezing up again. 131. In Gulliver's Travels Jonathan Swift described the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, giving their exact size and speeds of rotation. He did this more than 100 years before either moon was discovered.</p>

In July 1934 Babe Ruth paid a fan $20 dollars for the return of the baseball he hit for his 700th career home run. 10. In 1969 a brief battle broke out between Honduras and El Salvador. Although tensions had been rough between the two countries, the reason for the war was El Salvador's victory over Honduras in the World Cup Soccer playoffs. Gunfire was exchanged for about 30 minutes before reason could prevail. 11. Horse racing is one of the most dangerous sports. Between 2 and 3 jockeys are killed each year. That's about how many baseball players have died in baseball's entire professional history. 12. Bulgaria was the only soccer team in the 1994 World Cup in which all 11 players' last names ended with the letters "OV." 13.

Since 1896, the beginning of the modern Olympics, only Greece and Australia have participated in every Games. 17. Australian Rules football was originally designed to give cricketers something to play during the off season. 18. Baseball cards have been around since 1886. Modern cards, with high-resolution color photographs on the front and player statistics on the back, date from 1953. The photos are taken in the spring, with and without team caps, just in case the player is traded to another team. 19. Because of fears that the Japanese, who had attacked Pearl Harbor less than a month earlier, might attach California, the Rose Bowl game of 1942 between Oregon State and Duke University was moved east to Duke's hometown in Durham, North Carolina. It didn't, however, help the home team. Oregon won, 20-16. 20. Racehorses have been known to wear out new shoes in one race. 21. The home team must provide the referee with 36 footballs for each National Football League game. 22. Olympic Badminton rules say that the birdie has to have exactly fourteen feathers. 23. Many Japanese golfers carry "hole-in-one" insurance, because it is traditional in Japan to share one's good luck by sending gifts to all your friends when you get an "ace." The price for what the Japanese term an "albatross" can often reach $10,000. 24. Will Clark, professional baseball player, is a direct descendant of William Clark of Lewis and Clark. 25. The 1990 New York Yankee pitching staff set an all-time record with the fewest complete games, three. 26. Rick and Paul Reuschel of the 1975 Chicago Cubs combine to pitch a shutout, the first time brothers do this. 27.

Opposing players each throw a single dart at the bull's eye. The person who is closest starts the game. 37. Eddie Gaedel was the 3'7' midget who played in only one game against the St. Louis Browns and the Detroit Tigers. In the second inning of a double-header, St. Louis manager, Zach Taylor, sent 3'7', 65-pound Eddie Gaedel up to bat. Gaedel stood in a crouch up at the plate, giving pitcher Bob Cain a strike zone of about one and a half inches. Gaedel was walked on four straight pitches. 38.

The National Hockey League has a rule that permits their players from taking aspirin. Strangely, there is no rule that says they can't drink or use illegal drugs. 40. Frank Mahovlich played for 3 different teams during his NHL career: Toronto, Detroit, and Montreal. For all three, he wore the number 27. 41. In the NHL in the 1960’s, the league decided that home teams would wear white, while visiting teams would wear their dark jerseys. The reasoning behind this was that it would be more difficult to keep white uniforms clean while on the road. 42. Rudyard Kipling, living in Vermont in the 1890's invented the game of snow golf. He would paint his golf balls red so that they could be located in the snow. 43. Honey is used as a center for golf balls and in antifreeze mixtures. 44. Before 1850, golf balls were made of leather and were stuffed with feathers. 45. Golfing great Ben Hogan's famous reply when asked how to improve one's game was: "Hit the ball closer to the hole." 46. Americans spend more than $630 million a year on golf balls. 47. The youngest American female to score an ace was Shirley Kunde in August 1943 at age 13. 48. The oldest player to score his age is C. Arthur Thompson (1869-1975) of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, who scored 103 on the Uplands course of 6,215 yd, age 103 in 1973. 49. The Tom Thumb golf course was the first miniature golf course in the United States. It was built it 1929 in Chattanooga, Tennessee by John Garnet Carter. 50. The Chinese Nationalist Golf Association claims the game is of Chinese origin (ch'ui wan - the ball hitting game) in the third or 2nd century BC. There were official ordinances prohibiting a ball game with clubs in Belgium and Holland from 1360. 51. Two golf clubs claim to be the first established in the United States: the Foxberg Golf Club, Clarion County, PA (1887) and St. Andrews Golf Club of Yonkers, NY (1888). 52. The youngest golfer recorded to have shot a hole-in-one is Coby Orr (5 years) of Littleton, CO on the 103 yd fifth at the Riverside Golf Course, San Antonio, TX in 1975. 53. The United States Golf Association (USGA) was founded in 1894 as the governing body of golf in the United States. 54. Golf-great Billy Casper turned golf pro during the Korean War while serving in the Navy. Casper was assigned to operate and build golf driving ranges for the Navy in the San Diego area. 55. Before 1859, baseball umpires were seated in padded chairs behind home plate. 56. In 1910, A baseball with a cork center was used in a World Series game for the first time. The Philadelphia Athletics (managed by Connie Mack) and the Chicago Cubs (managed by P.K. Wrigley) played for the championship. 57. Roger Bannister was the first man to break the four-minute mile, however he did not break the four-minute mile in an actual race. On May 6, 1954, he ran 3:59.4 while being carefully paced by other runners. Bannister's quarter-mile splits were 57.5 seconds, 60.7, 62.3, and 58.9. Twenty-three days after Bannister had run the most famous mile of all time, his fellow Briton, Diane Leather, became the first woman to break five minutes with a 4:59.6 seconds, in Birmingham, England, on May 29, 1954. In the forty-plus years since the two British runners broke these significant marks, women's times have improved by a far higher percentage than men's. 58. Mark McGwire's record-setting 70 home runs in the 1998 season traveled a total of 29,598 feet. 59. A regulation soccer games is 90 minutes. 60. Ten events make up the decathlon. 61.

Boxing is considered the easiest sport for gamblers to fix. 71. In 1870, British boxing champ Jim Mace and American boxer Joe Coburn fought for three hours and 48 minutes without landing one punch. 72. Professional sumo wrestlers, called rikishi, must be quick on their feet and supple, but weight is vital to success as they hurl themselves at their opponents, aiming to floor them or push them outside the 15-foot fighting circle. 73. To bulk up, rikishi eat huge portions of protein-rich stews called chankonabe, packed with fish or meat and vegetables, plus vast quantities of less healthful foods, including fast food. They often force themselves to eat when they are full, and they have a nap after lunch, thus acquiring flab on top of their strong muscles, which helps to keep their center of gravity low. 74. The average rikishi tips the scales at about 280 pounds, but in 1988 the heaviest sumo westler ever recorded weighed in at a thundering 560 pounds. 75. The 1900 Olympics were held in Paris, France. 76. The Miami Dolphins were the last NFL team to go through a season unbeaten. 77.

Table tennis was originally played with balls made from champagne corks and paddles made from cigar-box lids. It was created in the 1880s by James Gibb, a British engineer who wanted an invigorating game he could play indoors when it was raining. Named "Gossima," the game was first marketed with celluloid balls, which replaced Gibb's corks. After the equipment manufacturer renamed the game "Ping-Pong" in 1901, it became a hot seller. 82. Scientists have estimated a fly ball will travel about seven feet further for every 1,000 feet of altitude. With an approximate elevation of 1,100 feet, Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Arizona is the second highest facility in the major baseball leagues; only Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is higher.</p>

Shakespeare is given credit by scholars for introducing as many as 10,000 words and phrases into written language, including "skim milk," "alligator," and "hobnob."

Some scholars give him credit for thousands, but others say he actually coined only a few hundred. 142. "Acre" literally means the amount of land plowable in one day. 143. Would you believe that "on the nose" comes from radio? When broadcasting began, directors had to communicate with people on the air without making noise, so they developed hand signals.

If things were "just right," the director signaled with a finger to the side of his or her nose. 144.

When navigating a riverboat over the Mississippi River, a riverboat captain needs someone to call out the depth in tricky areas to ensure that the boat can make it through. If he hears "mark twain," he knows that the water is barely deep enough for the boat to pass. 146. Samuel Clemens, the creator of the adventuresome Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, took "Mark Twain" as his pen name. This was not because he WAS a riverboat captain, but because he once wanted very badly to be one. 147. The English word pajamas has it's origin in Persian. It is a combination of the Persian words pa (leg) and jamah (garment). 148. The word "puppy" comes from the French poupee, meaning "doll." 149. Spain literally means 'the land of rabbits.' 150.

Halloween dates from 837 when Pope Gregory IV instituted All Saints or All Hallows Day on Nov. 1 to take the place of an earlier festival known as the Peace of the Martyrs. The day was set aside to honor all saints, known and unknown. Halloween then is a shortened form of All Hallows Eve - the evening before All Hallows Day. Certainly, you have a choice of celebrating it on Oct. 30, Saturday, if you wish. Many of the area parties will be held then rather than on Sunday.

Charles Perrault, a Frenchman, published a collection of these rhymes in 1697 and an illustration accompanying the text showed an old woman telling stories, with the words "Mother Goose" appearing behind her. The book was eventually published in England and the United States and more rhymes were added with each new publication. It wasn't until the 1800's that a relative of Mrs. Goose claimed the stories originated with Elizabeth.</p>

<p>29. The reason wheels seem to spin backwards on a camera is because when you film something, you are really taking a series of still images and then replaying them so fast that the eye is fooled into thinking it is a continuous stream of images. The eye can see about 12-14 frames per second. Because of a physical law called the Nyquist Sampling Theorem you need to display frames twice as fast as the eye can see to fool it into seeing it as a continuous movie (Nyquist showed mathematically why that is true). So, imagine you have a wheel that is spinning exactly once every second. If you took a picture at the same rate, it would look like it is standing still. That's because it rotates exactly once every time you take a picture. Now take a picture just a little bit faster than 1 per second. Now every time you take a picture, the wheel has not quite made it all the way around; maybe it will have gone 350 degrees around, so it's 10 degrees behind the first frame. The next frame it will have gone another 350 degrees, making it now 20 degrees behind the first frame, and so on. When you play the film back, it will look like the wheel is moving backwards, even though you know it was going forwards. The opposite effect happens when you take pictures a bit slower than the rotation rate. It gets more complicated when the wheel does not rotate at a constant rate, like when a car accelerates. The next time you watch TV or go to the movies, watch the wheels as a car speeds up. You might see the wheel appear to go backwards, them stop, then go forwards, all while the car is moving forwards.</p>

<p>This song is, like, the most annoying song in the universe. People enjoy the effect it usually has on other people.</p>

<p>This is the most famous of the annoying bus songs, but <i>The Song That Never Ends</i> is, by far, the most annoying. There are many different versions of this song, and you choose the one depending on how obnoxious you want to be. The first one I will type is the least obnoxious, and the last one is the most obnoxious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall. 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall. 97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall..............................</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>99 bottles of pop on the wall, 99 bottles of pop. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of pop on the wall. 98 bottles of pop on the wall, 98 bottles of pop. Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of pop on the wall. 97 bottles of pop on the wall, 97 bottles of pop. Take one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of pop on the wall..............................</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And *obnoxious drumroll* the most obnoxious <i>99 Bottles</i>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>99 bottles of Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper With Lemon on the wall, 99 bottles of Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper With Lemon. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper With Lemon on the wall. 98 bottles of Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper With Lemon on the wall, 98 bottles of Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper With Lemon.

<p>See those periods at the end? You keep singing it, oblivious to all the people telling you to stop, until you get to zero, then you start singing <i>The Song That Never Ends</i>. *laughs evilly*</p>
