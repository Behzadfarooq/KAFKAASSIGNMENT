<p>Heeloo. This article could use sections on prediction (to go with the table), protection, how to survive, and what non-buried witnesses should do immediately. Maybe also a list of the world's greatest avalanche disasters? or is there a better place for that? <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupinelawyer_3a03.html" title="User:Lupinelawyer">Lupinelawyer</a> 18:12, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think more attention should be given to the table of avalanche sizes, the one that starts off with "sluffs" as being the smallest and least dangerous avalanches. Sluffs are actually another term used to describe point-release avalanches and has nothing to do with its size or destructive capacity. These sluffs are usually a very good indicator of top-layer snowpack instability. You should avoid slopes with aspects that are sluffing. The other kind of avalanche is a slab-release avalanche, which usually occur when there are deeper instabilities in the snowpack, such as buried layers of hoar, facets, and round snowflakes. Generally, slab avalanches are much bigger than point-release ones, but that doesn't mean sluffs pose virtually no risk to humans. There have been some big point-releases that dwarf smaller slab avalanches. In fact, the misconception that point-releases are not harmful might lead some backcountry travelers to believe that it's safe to travel on aspects where these are ocurring, when in reality point-releases are one of the red-flags travelers should look out for. Aspects that are sluffing are on the verge of sliding big-time and should be avoided!</p>
<p>Usually the "size" of avalanches in the US is measured by their destructive potential rather than the volume of snow moved. Since you could have a really wide slab release that only falls a half-meter that might knock someone to the ground that would have the same volume as a much more destructive avalanche that's only half a meter wide and falls much further and takes out a bunch of trees, understanding the destructive potential is much more important than volume of snow moved. I forget what the rating system is but it's in the "Avalanche Handbook" that's already cited and starts with little ones that bareley move any snow to the biggest which can derail a train. I don't have the book anymore or I'd post the information up myself.</p>

<p>Consider changing this section to something like Avalanche Management, because the sub-sections fall under a broader category of managing a group in avalanche terrain.</p>
<p>The subsection called Traversing should be renamed Terrain management and broadened. Traversing is both too vague and too specific. The Terrain management section should briefly mention not under cutting slopes (removing physical support), not skiing over convex rolls, and staying away from weaknesses like exposed rock. Also mention avoiding terrian traps (gulleys that can be filled in, cliffs over which one can be swept, or heavy timber into which one can be carried). Basically this sub-section explains reducing the risk for the individual skier on a slope.</p>
<p>The subsection on Risk should be renamed Group Managment and would explain reducing the overall reduction of risk for a whole group by using strategies such as exposing only one memberat time to a hazard, having well defined safe spots, and planning escape routes.</p>
<p>The Group size section is close to correct. It should strongly emphasize that a carefull balance needs to be struck between having enough people to carry out a rescue (sometimes 2 is enough) and having far too many people to safely manage the risks.</p>
<p>The Leadership sub-section is way off base and needs to be completely re-written. Leadership in avalanche terrain requires well defined decision making protocals, which are being taught in a growing number of courses provided by national avalanche resource centers in Europe and North America, and an honest attempt at assessing ones blind spots, (what information am I ignoring?) There is a growing body of research into the pyschological failures and group dynamics that lead to avalanche involvement, could some of that be referenced? -- Aaron</p>

<dd>You can make these changes yourself, if you want to. It was good to post your concerns to the talk page, though. You might want to get an account before making major changes, as it will help communication with other editors and will make it less likely that your edits will be confused as vandalism (for example, editors might get suspicious when you delete a section that needs to be rewritten). You don't have to give any personal information to get an account, not even an email address (you can give an email address if you want to receive mail from other editors, though). Whether you get an account or not, be sure to give descriptive edit summaries about the changes you make. Giving references would also be a good idea. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 17:43, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, since August 2, 2006 this article underwent, what appears to me, erroneous editing.</p>
<p>I made a contribution to the pictures on this page and when I was looking back at the article and noticed that a significant portion of it was removed. I'm not certain removing that much information was intentional. So I took the liberty to EDIT the article on August 1 by Kjkolb and saved the changes to be current.</p>

<p>I have made the addition of a picture of avalanche blasting in Tignes and was wondering if more depth could be added to the section on prevention which covers the use of explosives to trigger deliberate and hopefully controlled avalanches - as it is method that almost any skier is subject to who has visited the mountains when there’s a lot of snow around.</p>

<p>The following statement is inaccurate: "An avalanche is an example of a gravity current consisting of granular material." Gravity currents consist of very low aspect ratios involving differing densities, typically when more saline water displaces less saline water, or differing air densities. It does not apply to snow on a mountain! Removed. <a href="../../../m/u/g/User%7EMugaliens_0078.html" title="User:Mugaliens">- Mugs</a> 23:43, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>72.93.88.4 00:34, 30 January 2007 (UTC)i read a book where a 14 year old lived for a week before almost dying. is that possible? jamie</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it is not possible. When children turn 14, they die immediately. In case any young children are reading this, that was a joke. I assume that you mean can a person live for a week after being buried by an avalanche. The chances of survival drop quickly in the first hour and after a couple of hours, the survival rate is very low. However, if the person has enough air and has clothes that are sufficiently warm to avoid hypothermia, I suppose it might be possible. If the person is able to climb out after being buried, it would be difficult for him or her to survive for a week without food, water, supplies or training, but he or she would be far more likely to survive than someone who is buried. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good to hear that this kid really appreciates Wikipedia. It's a nice spring board for other sources, and in and of itself is pretty nice as well.</p>
<p>I also wanted to say, to the lame imbecile who posted emoticons in the Avalanches article, that you are completely insane. I mean, yes, I am totally bonkers, but you... smiley faces on a Wiki page? I mean, can you not think of anything more creative? And anyway, you're just wasting our time.

<p>Nearly a year ago I made some recommendations. I'm finally getting around to them. I've referenced Pascal Hageli when discussing avalanche rates for terrian and aspect, although I can't remember the exact article, I'm going off my notes from the November 2004 Avalanche Workshop at the University of Calgary.
