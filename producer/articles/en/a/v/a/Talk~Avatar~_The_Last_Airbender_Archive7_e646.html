<li>I am back! I cannot believe it actually won the nomination (even though it was pretty likely). Anyway, as for the min page, I agree with Aang's portrait as the picture. However, references should not be included. In addition, the text should not just be a copy of the first paragraph or two. We should tweak it a bit to make it sound better for the main page. A minor edit I want to mention is that the first time the show is mentioned, it has to be a link, not just bolded, but that is minor. I cannot believe that a month ago I was nominating this article for Featured Article status and now we are talking about putting it on the main page! <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParent5446_3d08.html" title="User:Parent5446">Parent5446</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParent5446_956c.html" title="User talk:Parent5446">Murder me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parent5446_72ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parent5446">my actions</a>)</sup> 21:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First for the 4.4 million thing: yeah, it should say best rated, that's detailed in the source cited. As for the date: I don't mind either way, really. The only possible problem I see with waiting is, its hard to say if we'll have a solid date (as opposed to timeframe) for the premiere far enough ahead of time to get the date. They normally do it farther than it is now, I think. Feb 21 would be good, but I've got no strong opinions either way.

<dd>Well, we'll at least get a date two weeks ahead from TvGuide and Nick. Oh, but if we put it up for the premier, would it be the day before to raise hype or the day after when most people look?

<p>Hmm, I seriously missed a lot of stuff while at work. Anyway, I never really liked that image of Aang, is there any way we could blow up the opening title somehow, or atleast get a new picture for Aang before the time comes (considering we might be getting a new one for Katara and Toph as well). Also as per the date, I say it doesn't matter. The Fed 21st is a neat idea. I would NOT include this to go up on the day of the new episode, the reason being is that, well, you all remember the crap that happened with the Finale aired.

<li>Pooldude says Nick may hold off on avatar season 3 until the fall so it doesn't interrupt their summer programing. If this is the case we can probably have Zuko up by then. So once we get confirmation, the 21st looks to be the date. -<a href="../../../d/y/l/User%7EDylan0513_8f4d.html" title="User:Dylan0513">Dylan0513</a> 21:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Looks to me like your comments keep getting deleted because we have no idea what you're talking about. You keep quoting unspecified interviews and opinions from random people on YouTube and such to back up your claim for the start of Season 3, but we can't trust those sources. Give us a link to a reliable source. Also, the true point of this discussion is to decide what date to request the article be featured on the Main Page. Opinion, as well as the lack of a firm date for the release of Season 3, points to February 21, the second anneversary of the series premiere. For what it's worth, I understand that you mean well and are trying to help, but we just can't give any weight to unverified claims. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerald_Alberich_21e3.html" title="User:Herald Alberich">Herald Alberich</a> 22:32, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ok, seriously guys. Let's get this show on the road. Questions to answer:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) <b>Is February 21st our date?</b> I think it is our best option. Back by poll results at donbufeng and an uncertain season 3 premier date.
<dl>
<dd>Um... You might want to look again, the vote is currently 40-37 in favor of season three instead of February 21 <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Placebo_Effect_8620.html" title="User:The Placebo Effect">The Placebo Effect</a> 01:27, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, I don't know what happened. It doesn't really matter anymore, if season 3 is in the fall, we can get Zuko featured by then. -<a href="../../../d/y/l/User%7EDylan0513_8f4d.html" title="User:Dylan0513">Dylan0513</a> 01:42, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2) <b>What is our picture for the wikipedia main page: Aang, the logo, the one I just got of Aang with his back to the screen, or something else.</b> I think our best choice is the one of Aang with is back to the screen for now. But I think we can do better.
<dl>
<dd>Out of those three images, I'd go with the logo. The shot of Aang's back just...doesn't look good. At all. New people will look at that and go "What the heck?" The logo may not be as flashy, but it pertains better to the article. I keep thinking the ideal image would be a stylish, dramatic shot of Aang, but from the front. And not the one where he's got his goofy grin, either. For now, the logo looks like the best option to me. <a href="../../../y/_/b/User%7EY_BCZ_9daf.html" title="User:Y BCZ">Y BCZ</a> 06:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Good point about identification. No one would know what the new pic was. I guess the logo is our best choice for now, but again, I don't think any of them are that great. -<a href="../../../d/y/l/User%7EDylan0513_8f4d.html" title="User:Dylan0513">Dylan0513</a> 13:18, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But what would we put in it? Everything we know about the movie is already in the main article. "On January 8, 2007, Paramount Pictures' MTV Films and Nick Movies announced that it has signed on M. Night Shyamalan to write, direct and produce a trilogy of live action films based on the series" is the entirety of meaningful text we could include, with maybe a mention about the naming controversy. And that's another mess; with both Paramount and Fox having movies named Avatar, we don't even know what to call the movie page yet. Certainly it will get an article eventually, but I think we need more info first. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerald_Alberich_21e3.html" title="User:Herald Alberich">Herald Alberich</a> 19:37, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I would say you can only add a relationship if there is an explicit reliable source for it. For example, if there's a TV Guide or Nickelodeon magazine article on Avatar that mentions the various romances, then adding the content would be quite acceptable. Or something fairly overt, like Nick setting up a "Zukolovesmomo.com" website. You may also wish to look at <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shipping_%28fandom%29.html" title="Shipping (fandom)">shipping</a> or <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slash_fiction.html" title="Slash fiction">Slash fiction</a> for examples. In general though, considering how this subject seems to interest you, perhaps you might wish to try an Avatar fansite instead? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually they have various times. First of all, they even named that new chibi short the "schooltime shipping", and in a Nick mag article they talked all about the "ships" and how they're called Kataang, Zutara, etc... (it was the article that also featured the fanart You Know You're An Avatar When.. I think that was the all-avatar issue) If you need a reference for the fans' oppions, go here, hahaha <a href="http://airbender.net/fun/ship.php" class="external free" title="http://airbender.net/fun/ship.php" rel="nofollow">http://airbender.net/fun/ship.php</a> 75.68.77.207 15:14, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, most of the fanbase believes in Zuko and Katara because many people know that fire and water balance each other out, it's a yinyang deal. In fact, if you ask someone what balances water, they would say fire. Oh yeah remember what that fat guy said about the visions in the swamp The visions in the swamp were of "People they loved, People they lost." and Aang saw Toph. I smell a new romance between those two. Also, I wrote to Mike and Bryan about what they wrote in that episode to remind them. Another thing water and air don't mix.</p>

<li>Wikipedia is not a fan site, we don't put things in to make fans happy.</li>
<li>We CERTAINLY don't put in Zutara crap because the show has never once even put out that idea.</li>
<li>Everything you wrote is speculation and therefore it does not belong in Wikipedia at all.</li>
<li>You wrote to Mike and Bryan? Really? Because we've been trying to get their e-mails for months now. I'd like to know how you got their e-mails when our digging for almost a year hasn't delivered anything.</li>

<p>It might be possible to write a shipping article that could be added as an addition to the Avatar article, especially since the creators discuss the topic during one of the comic cons and in an animated short. However, the facts of the matter is that the Shipping article would have to be more secure than Fort Knox since there are any number of insane fans that would change the neutrality of the article to favour their favourite relationships. It would take respected editors and writers for the linked Avatar sites to even make it possible, but limits given by the masters of Wiki. Just my opinion. <a href="../../../h/v/u/User%7EHVulpes_f743.html" title="User:HVulpes">HVulpes</a> 15:25, 21 February 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../h/v/u/User%7EHVulpes_f743.html" title="User:HVulpes">HVulpes</a></p>

<dd>I would not object to content regarding the online comic, as it is something produced by Nick, and presumably official content for the show.

<dl>
<dd>While it's official content, it should be noted that it's probably not canonical. Just as the game and collectable cards contain information deemed separate from the events of the show. However, there should be some mention of it in the media information or somesuch. <a href="../../../y/_/b/User%7EY_BCZ_9daf.html" title="User:Y BCZ">Y BCZ</a> 16:55, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now, I won't say that the Avatar Escape(AE) video comics are canon, but I will say that there is a difference between its canonicity and that of the card game or video game. Essentially, the AE video comics are produced directly by Nick and are presented directly by Nick. They would be as canonical as the information on the main site, which is a conflicting issue already.</dd>
<dd>Notice how I mention only the video comics. That's because they provide backstory to the other Avatars and don't effect the continuity of the show. The game part of AE, even the Yue part, are dubious in their alignment with the show, however, as it directly involves Aang. But the Avatar backstories in the video comics seem to me like they are worthwhile pieces of information that wouldn't have just been tossed there without consultation with the creators.</dd>
<dd>It should go without saying, however, that if information from the video comics is to be presented in a character article page, direct reference to AE needs to be made so as to make it obvious that its canonicity might be in question. As we have done with every piece of info that has come from the official site.<a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_of_Ice_3d30.html" title="User:Sage of Ice">Sage of Ice</a> 04:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here is the main problem, we don't know how these comics affect canon if they do at all. Some of the information contadicts the Avatar Magazine put out recently, mostly the spelling of Hei-Bai. Let's wait a bit, see if the information correlates with the show (like a mention or something that is the same verbatim, like if Aang wakes up in season 3 and says "Kyoshi formed the Dai Li").

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I would vote February 21st for sure! It's seems more appropriate for Avatar than the Season 3 primere. Not only would it probably be too late by the time we'd find out but the 21st is more significant to Avatar history so we should stick with it. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralIroh_f809.html" title="User:GeneralIroh">GeneralIroh</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../g/e/n/User_talk%7EGeneralIroh_ea6e.html" title="User talk:GeneralIroh">Leave a message after the beep</a> if <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GeneralIroh_39a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralIroh">you gotta problem.</a>)</sup> 01:46, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>2) <b>What is our picture for the wikipedia main page: Aang, the logo, the one I just got of Aang with his back to the screen, or something else.</b> I think our best choice is the one of Aang with is back to the screen for now. But I think we can do better.
<dl>
<dd>Out of those three images, I'd go with the logo. The shot of Aang's back just...doesn't look good. At all. New people will look at that and go "What the heck?" The logo may not be as flashy, but it pertains better to the article. I keep thinking the ideal image would be a stylish, dramatic shot of Aang, but from the front. And not the one where he's got his goofy grin, either. For now, the logo looks like the best option to me. <a href="../../../y/_/b/User%7EY_BCZ_9daf.html" title="User:Y BCZ">Y BCZ</a> 06:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Good point about identification. No one would know what the new pic was. I guess the logo is our best choice for now, but again, I don't think any of them are that great. -<a href="../../../d/y/l/User%7EDylan0513_8f4d.html" title="User:Dylan0513">Dylan0513</a> 13:18, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Definitely, the logo. We're not going to find a better image of Aang in time and his current one makes the article look too 'childish.' The back head shot looks ugly and personally I think the logo would be best suited for the article itself, as it a headliner for Avatar. And the fact that it is slightly catchy and flashy...or at least more than the other two. The logo is by far the way to go. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralIroh_f809.html" title="User:GeneralIroh">GeneralIroh</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../g/e/n/User_talk%7EGeneralIroh_ea6e.html" title="User talk:GeneralIroh">Leave a message after the beep</a> if <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GeneralIroh_39a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralIroh">you gotta problem.</a>)</sup> 01:46, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>3) <b>Any more improvements on the summary?</b> I think it is too detailed mentioning "originally slated to begin airing in November of 2004" and "six-inch (15.34 cm) scale." They should be taken out.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, the only real 'detail' would be about the six-inch (15.34) information and additions <i>could</i> include a link to the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Lego_Avatar%7E_The_Last_Airbender_e53b.html" title="Lego Avatar: The Last Airbender">lego sets</a> and you add something like 'and his pets <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appa.html" title="Appa">Appa</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/List_of_Avatar%7E_The_Last_Airbender_major_secondary_characters_1d90.html#Momo" title="List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters">Momo</a>' near the info about Aang and the gang.

<dd>(edit conflict) I was about to say the same thing. Come to think of it, Zuko's more important than his father, too; perhaps we could replace "an industrialized empire run by the murderous Fire Lord Ozai" with something like "while evading capture at the hands of the Fire Nation's <a href="../../../z/u/k/Zuko.html" title="Zuko">Prince Zuko</a>." The problem there, of course, is that a phrase like that only covers the first season. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerald_Alberich_21e3.html" title="User:Herald Alberich">Herald Alberich</a> 00:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Avatar Escape Video Comics</span></h2>
<p>I wanted to have a separate discussion going for this, as I know that there will be a lot of conflict and debate, so it's best to start on a clean slate.</p>
<p>We can't ignore the Avatar Escape video comics any more. I know that plenty of you wish to entirely dismiss it since it is associated with a Nick game, but those of you are going to need to open your minds a bit.</p>
<p>Currently available from the "Download Podcast" option after entering the code and skipping the "Watch Comic Book" option, the video comics for Avatars Roku, Kyoshi, and Kuruk are all up for viewing. If you haven't seen them yet, I suggest you go take a look.</p>
<p>Essentially, while you may feel that the information in Roku's video comic is overlookable and not worth mentioning, the comics for Kyoshi and Kuruk can't be shrugged off the same way.</p>
<ul>
<li>spoilers ahead*</li>
</ul>
<p>Kyoshi's is especially notable for the wealth of extra information it provided. It clarified the odd time discrepancy between Roku and Kyoshi being born ca. 100 and ca. 300 years before Aang, respectively. It gave historical insight on Earth Kingdom government and, most surprisingly, it explained the origins of the Dai Li. All the while giving the character of Kyoshi more depth.</p>
<p>Kuruk's gives us information on him, Avatar Kuruk, someone we knew absolutely nothing about. It gives us a glimpse of how the female Airbenders dressed and shaved (their heads). It gives more cultural insight into the Water Tribes. It tells us which Avatar tried to kill Koh, and it gives more insight into the character of Koh himself and his possible role as a Spirit.</p>
<ul>
<li>end of spoilers*</li>
</ul>
<p>All this stuff can't just be non-canon, especially considering how it came straight from Nick, just like the info on the official site does. We seem to have no issue taking stuff from the Nick site as canon, so these Avatar backstories should be no different. There is just too much useful information in these comics for them to be shrugged off by the skeptical crowd.</p>
<p>Given how much they expand on the show, there is no way that these video comics were created without the consent and verification of the creators. As such, I think we should start including this information onto their respective pages. Of course, they need to be directly referenced to Avatar Escape, just like anything else that isn't divulged by the series directly but through other methods (like DVD extras and con panels). <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_of_Ice_3d30.html" title="User:Sage of Ice">Sage of Ice</a> 08:04, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I actually don’t see a problem with it. I’ve always kinda seen the show for various reasons as kinda a cartoon version of Lost and with this, eh its considerably obvious that the creators are making it up as they go along. Nonetheless, the information is intriguing and correlates well with what’s already been given, much like the Lost Scrolls. Though atypical, this was a pretty interesting method of expanding their universe and I’m glad they made sure that almost everything fit, something that most nicktoon shows wouldn’t hinge on.</dd>

<p>The problem arose when all these people were so quick to add stuff prior to discussion or a reasonable amount of information. Does a person who we’ve only seen for about four seconds and know absolutely nothing about other than his/her name honestly constitute as notable? Why not just wait a little while longer for some actual discussion regarding the topic and more stuff to be handed our way. And here it is. All in all, now that we actually have something to go on, I fail to see why it shouldn’t be utilized. ~71.163.70.100 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">American animated television show</span></h2>
<p>This sentence always annoyed me. Avatar is made in Korea, influenced by Asia, and shown around the world but written by Americans. How do we justify this as an American animated show when it isn't animated in America? <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> 16:07, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Easily, the show's production team is in America, the creative origins are in America, and the details of animation are just a production issue that hasn't mattered for any of the dozens of shows that are animated in overseas studios. Certainly the show is made in Korea, and that should be mentioned, and so should the influences, but it's the creative team that defines it. It's no different for Avatar than it is for <a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Animated_Series_3563.html" title="Batman: The Animated Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a> or any of the dozens of Cartoon Network shows that are animated elsewhere. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:01, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll be a bit more technical.</p>
<p>Copyright. It's entirely owned by an American corporation: Nickelodeon. Where the ownership resides, is where we justify it's place of origin. You can have a burger made in Brazil from a McDonald's in Brazil with ingredients taken only from Brazil, and you may even eat that burger in Brazil, but the McDonald's is still American. It may be made in Brazil, but it's not Brazilian, since that isn't where the ownership resides. Same thing for Nike and sweatshops.</p>
<p>Your problem might be the wording itself when we say "American animated". Don't confuse that with "American-animated", which means it was animated in America. It's an "American-owned animated television show", we just drop the "owned" as per convention. Hope this helped. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_of_Ice_3d30.html" title="User:Sage of Ice">Sage of Ice</a> 18:09, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Presumed dead is way to much of a stretch for Suki, we haven't even seen the circumstances of her capture. Jet, at least, was horribly brutalized by a slab of rock, and he's still not definitely deceased (Although I, personally, believe he is). All we know about Suki is that Ty Lee said she'd been defeated in battle. <a href="../../../j/b/k/User%7EJBK405_a584.html" title="User:JBK405">JBK405</a> 00:11, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bending Metal</span></h2>
<p>King Bumi was "unable" to bend metals - being stuffed into a metal box, he could only bend the earth outside because his head was exposed.</p>
<p>There are repeated mentions in Fire Nation dialogue about how their machines, especially the heavier ones, are "safe" from Earthbenders because the Earthbenders cannot "bend" metal.</p>
<p>The two Earthbenders who capture Toph certainly think that Earthbenders are incapable of Bending metal, because they cannot and they put her in a metal box.</p>
<p>The fact that Toph demonstrated this ability - figuring out how under great duress - and the fact that she is the ONLY bender, onscreen or in mention, to show this ability - is enough for it to be mentioned in her profile.

<dd>As someone just coming across this page, I'd like to agree with those who would like to keep it off. Even disregarding the very pertinent issue of spoilers that should be avoided, I don't see as how this is sufficiently relevant to her character.

The specificity regarding her ability to "see" is understandably necessary, but I don't see her metalbending as being any more pertinent than the fact that only Azula has used blue fire or that only she and Uncle Iroh can bend lightning.--<a href="../../../d/y/c/User%7EDycedarg_1cf0.html" title="User:Dycedarg"><span style="border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000"><b>Dycedarg</b></span></a> <a href="../../../d/y/c/User_talk%7EDycedarg_ffee.html" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b><span style="color:#000000">ж</span></b></a> 05:57, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fandom</span></h2>
<p>Seeing how its gotten to be, I'm surprised at how little its mentioned of. Its even been referred to in article <a href="http://www.musogato.com/avatar/magazine/avatarmag1_scan40.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.musogato.com/avatar/magazine/avatarmag1_scan40.jpg" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> I'm not saying we should start posting up links to fanart or fanfics (don't care for them), but some things should be made mentioned of.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping
<ul>
<li>Considering its relationship with both the series and fandom definately needs made mention of. Not "Zomg! Katara and Aang should like totally get together. Kataanger 4ever!" Something like:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"One aspect of the series is the '<a href="../../../s/h/i/Shipping_%28fandom%29.html" title="Shipping (fandom)">shipping</a>' which has come to be one of the franchise's main foundations. This is best expressed by the last Comic Con panel, which included a hilarious slide segment dedicated to identifying each and every one, and then some. The most infamous ship is that of the 'Zutara' ship. As the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> name implies, the ship involves the characters Zuko and Katara, and was first catalyzed by Zuko tying Katara to a try and attempting to bribe her with the necklace of her deceased mother in 'The Waterbending Scroll'. One way or another, it has grown to be one of the most recognizable ship, and also helping it was the fact that the two voice actors shared a parallel relationship on another show, '<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Dragon_Jake_Long_61cd.html" title="American Dragon Jake Long">American Dragon Jake Long</a>'. Regardless of it origins, due to being known to regularly visits their fansites and forums, the creators are quite aware of the ship or at least seem to enjoy playing with it, as it has been mentioned in almost every interview/convention. Also evident is the fact that the very first commercial clip for the season two finale centered around informing viewers that the two were to be 'spending some unexpectesd time together'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now as a person who doesn't ship for any show, as it has a knack for getting in the way of the plot and true characterizations and this show's no different (Sokka's role in Lake Lagoi for example), I'm surprised their isn't even some little line like "For one reason or another, numerous fans have enjoyed pairing blank with blank ever since their interaction in the waterbending scroll in complete disregard of the natural intial unliklihood. Some are thoroughly convinced that the two will 'end up together' " <i>somewhere</i> in their trivia section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once again fanart and all that other crap shouldn't be put here but there are some who should be made mentioned of. Kimberly Miranda aka "Isaia", ...aka Aviaq's satirical take on the Avatar fandom has earned her mention in articles and recognition in the eyes of the staff.<a href="http://nickmag-comics.livejournal.com/tag/contest" class="external autonumber" title="http://nickmag-comics.livejournal.com/tag/contest" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> (she was right on the money with that one) To go even further, recently the deviantart user "<a href="http://rufftoon.deviantart.com/" class="external text" title="http://rufftoon.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">rufftoon</a>" known best for lighthearted Avatar based <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/46848139/" class="external text" title="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/46848139/" rel="nofollow">strips</a>, has been enducted as a storyboader for the series. Seriously <a href="http://www.drawingboard.org/blogs/Nofret/2424/Big+News%21%21.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.drawingboard.org/blogs/Nofret/2424/Big+News%21%21.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally in terms of media. Avatar fanvids and online episodes have come to be quite common on youtube, even earning some "most viewed" honors, but are constantly deleted because of copyright issues. Though common for most youtube vids, problems arose with the Google Youtube deal and have reached a headway. In that tens of thousands of vids were once again removed, and due to Avatar's relations to Viacom, it was affected. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/02/news/companies/viacom_youtube.reut/?postversion=2007020216" class="external autonumber" title="http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/02/news/companies/viacom_youtube.reut/?postversion=2007020216" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> The staff once even expressed their sympathy and support for the production of the videos.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"We did remove the illegal episode broadcasts but the mashups are great. Everybody at Avatar loves them. I have also noticed that some of them have been removed. However it is not by us. Most likely it is the record companies pulling the content because of the music that is used. Google is cracking down on a lot of this now that they have bought youtube. We still encourage mashups and videos to the fullest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally all this crap doesn't have to go on the main page, could just have a link to its page, like with the media information. Come to think of it, fits well under the “franchise” category. Doesn't even have to all be crammed in one place like this, it just calls for some mentioning here and there, ya'know. Heart of series. More or less. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.250.190.116_1251.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.250.190.116">66.250.190.116</a> (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.250.190.116.html" title="User talk:66.250.190.116">talk</a>) 21:08, 23 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I’ve been following this discussion for a little bit and I have something to say. I personally think fan art should have <b>NO</b> place on this article. I’ve noticed there is a correlation between Fan art and some of the crap anonymous users have been posting to various Avatar related articles. (FOR EXAPMLE) The independent comic strip “Avatarded” lists/illustrates a series of silly obsessions belonging to avatar fans and numbers each of them 49 – 54. Number 52 reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>You’ve somehow managed to CROSSOVER Avatar with everything imaginable. ... YES EVERYTHING. Even if there are but a few similarities ...</i>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the pictures below this is of a melding of Avatar and <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruto.html" title="Naruto">Naruto</a> characters and the sign over top of it says “Avaruto”. <a href="../../../a/a/n/Aang.html" title="Aang">Aang</a> is portrayed as <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruto_Uzumaki_c432.html" title="Naruto Uzumaki">Naruto</a>; <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakka.html" title="Sakka">Sakka</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikamaru_Nara_893b.html" title="Shikamaru Nara">Shikamaru</a>; <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Zuko_4667.html" title="Prince Zuko">Prince Zuko</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/s/Sasuke_Uchiha_81b4.html" title="Sasuke Uchiha">Sasuke</a>; etc. (See the <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/39867827/" class="external text" title="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/39867827/" rel="nofollow">visuals for it here</a> [click to enlarge].) Now having read that, please read the following that an anonymous user posted to the Aang article two days ago. I’m sure you will notice some striking similarities!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>The Avatar Series has done some Homages of the show, Naruto. For Example, in the episode "The Guru", Xii Mu teaches Aang about "Chakra", which is what energy is called when doing Ninjutsu in Naruto. And Sakka has homaged Shikamaru Nara in the episode "Warriors of Kioshi" Sakka reveals that he finds man more superior to woman, Same with Shikamaru, when he believes it's a waist to fight girls. Plus, Sakka has a Similar alligned Ponytail to Shikamaru. Prince Zuko can easily be compared to Gaara. Both Their Fathers are/were after them, They became enemies with the main character and allign with them at some points in time.</i>" (From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aang&amp;diff=111104825&amp;oldid=110671444" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aang&amp;diff=111104825&amp;oldid=110671444" rel="nofollow">this edit here</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess this person honestly believes that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chakra.html" title="Chakra">Chakras</a> are something newly created by the creater of Naruto. I’m afraid if this isn’t checked, the page is going to be bombarded with crazy CROSSOVER stuff like this!

<p>Here's a hint to all you people who keep thinking shipping should be added: *ahem* YOU'RE A TOOL! The producers know the shipping is there because it's in every show with characters that have emotions. The writers aren't ever going to just confirm a ship because it has the most backers. Not only that but shipping would ruin a story, taking away the tension of romance and removing a good chunk of story element. We also will NOT put shipping because as unbiased as you make it, it WILL be a biased statement. Even in the example you put you had a bias and it's clearly evident.</p>
<p>Fanart is fanart and doesn't belong. Why do you think all the webcomic pages are being deleted? Also, let's just make sure to put up a clear citation to all the damn youtube videos made by people with too much time on their hands. Splice a little video, add a pop punk or Linkin Park song, and BAM, you just got yourself on Wikipedia!!! HE11z Ye@h!</p>
<p>In conclusion, no, none of those three things listed will ever merit as something important enough to be on Wikipedia. And stop stealing from AvatarSpirit, it makes this WikiProject look bad as we have hard enough time trying to prevent the plagarism. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 06:29, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>While certainly not everything you mention qualifies right now as something that belongs on Wikipedia, you overexaggerate when you claim that none of those things will ever merit as something to be on Wikipedia. If enough reliable sources can be produced about the subject, then it can easily belong on Wikipedia. See for example the page on <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shipping_%28fandom%29.html" title="Shipping (fandom)">shipping</a>, or other pages in the <a href="../../../f/a/n/Category%7EFandom_4827.html" title="Category:Fandom">Category:Fandom</a>. If such material were produced about Avatar characters, the coverage of the subject would be appropriate. So, I suggest being slightly more careful about your statements in the future, and simply saying that there's not enough reliable sources at this time. Perhaps there never will be. It is, however, important to remember that it is possible that it could happen. The subject itself is not forbidden from Wikipedia. So, I suggest instead of telling the people that want to add shipping that they are a tool and otherwise being offensive, you remind them that they need sources beyond simple fan speculation. An article in a published magazine or newspaper, for example, an interview with the creators, even commentary on the DVDs. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:18, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The element of the first bender? All of them... right? That's what an Avatar does. Here's the problem, we know when waterbending and earthbending were created. We know how airbending came about too. We know that these three bending abilities did not exist at the beginning of human evolution in this world. So at some point in time, the spirit world must have created the Avatar Spirit and randomly entered the body of a person. Hell they didn't even need to be a future bender. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 21:41, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, since the Avatar cycle in the nations is Water, Earth, Fire, and Air, respectively and since the legend's order for learning the bending arts is the same, I suppose one could somewhat assume that the first Avatar came from the Water Tribe. But I agree with the above, it's not very possible for us to guess this sort of thing...</dd>

<dd>The show is based on chinease mythology right? Well, all one has to do is read up on it and find out during what season the earth was created (according to the chinease). The season that you get can then be translated to an element. You end up with a pretty good idea of what type of bender the first avatar was. But remember, this is just a guess; the writers may make the first avatar a totally different element, a non-bender, or they may not mention it at all.

<dd>They (IMDB) even says that information is obviously made up, i.e. "keeping this just for the laughs, I'll change it as soon as anyone can give me real info". Of course that one is not real. Selecting one particular factoid or trivial minutia and picking at it does not necessarily discredit the other information, and is a classic "strawman" frame-the-argument technique. None the less, I agree completely with you and Sgt. Hydra below in that it is safe to say that all info on new episodes should be considered speculation until they're printed in TV Guide or being actually advertised on Nickelodeon.

<p>Pretty much that. Basically yes his information is always right (the sole guy who claims to happen to have a so-called "inside source" and actually lives up to it) but in terms of sourcing, protocol and all that good stuff calls that we have to do a bit better that "Yeah, my man Jake hooked me up," ya'know?

I asked about september, and all it said back was that they are working as fast as they can, and will try to get it present to these months, but, further more they cant reveal anything else. I also did a little research and i know for a fact its not premiering in september, neither march. Pooldude is reliable, in most cases, and knows much behind nick, and yes i did talk to him With Instant message. September is only the latest date, incase the scehdual gets meesed up. And Its most likely premiering Pretty soon, becuase If not, they will loose to Mnay fans, Suspense limit will increase then dramaticly decrease, and more popular shows could be premiering by then. Not to mention Zack Eison tyler, is Only 12 or 13 right now as it is. It isnt to long beofre he goes through puberty, and looses his voice. The only thing i have to agree with Dylan and The others is that, we shouldnt list those episodes up on wikipedia just yet, until its more clear when they are premiering. -<a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvatarDude360_d5aa.html" title="User:AvatarDude360">User:AvatarDude360</a>

Gaining more fans is a possibility also, but also loosing, remeber, Suspense can raise the fans, but the new nick shows can decrease the rate. -<a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvatarDude360_d5aa.html" title="User:AvatarDude360">User:AvatarDude360</a>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hate Mail</span></h2>
<p>I know Mike and Bryan are probably getting hate mail because of what happened for their Season 2 finale. They're being called Liar and words I can't type because you'll delete it. Let's just say the fan group is extremely upset about this. Some are even boycotting the show to make them fall. Nikita Khruschev-"We will bury you!" Remember that saying because that's probably what's going to happen to Avatar: The Last Airbender</p>
<dl>
<dd>You people are dumb. It's THEIR show and if you're really that unhappy because of Zuko's actions you need to 1) get a life and get over it, and 2) find medical help because you are clearly retarded. Avatar will not lose anybody because of the season 2 finale and the people it does lose weren't people that really loved the show. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 19:50, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While not my choice of words, I agree with H2P. The writers showed Zuko to have uncerainity about his actions ("I betrayed Uncle..."), so this left the rest of the fanbase curious as to his motives and future. Besides, several other fanbases of different TV shows, movies, and even books have issues with major plot twists like that. In a similar case, in the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> franchise (spoiler), the death of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albus_Dumbledore_087b.html" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> at the hands of "reformed" <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Eater_263c.html" title="Death Eater">Death Eater</a> <a href="../../../s/e/v/Severus_Snape_75dc.html" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, leading to the possible closing of <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogwarts.html" title="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a>, may have upset some fans, but the majority of the fanbase awaits the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_7748.html" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">seventh book</a> being released this summer. So, just because some of the fanbase isn't happy with certain plot points, the majority of the fanbase supports it. <a href="../../../k/o/c/User%7EKochdude388_efc8.html" title="User:Kochdude388">Kochdude388</a> 21:14, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Here, here. H2P is dead-on. They need to get a life...really. If they get so wrapped up in something to the point where they begin opposing their own thoughts on the writers, just because they WANT things their way, then 1.) They're <b>WAY</b> out of line; and 2.) Lack ANY...and mean "ANY", creativity what so ever. I mean what fun would it be just to have a character stay the same? Not biased, but I like te finale. It definitely sets itself up for much deeper character development and plot. I love cartoons, anime, any form of drawn art, and I've learn to appreciate and respect the authors views. But when I hear such complete disrespect and lack of appreciation, it burns me. So all this about "I don't like what you made *such-and-such* do, so I'll destroy you!" I say is immature crap and these people just need to GROW...UP! Then again...the people doing it, may well be kids.

<p>Personally i think what happened in the season finale was brilliant, i felt it wouldve been dry and repetetive like other cartoons had Zuko reformed completely. When i read about the hate mail i was very surprised, it looks like some kind of lame attempt to get the writters to change their mind and rewrite the story or something, but from what ive seen so far, the series seems to have been carefully written and the writters must have it all mapped out. Big fans of the show should respect the creators decision, because up until now they havent been dissapointed. I agree and think its stupid to critisize them. Apparently these hait-mailers care so much about the show and the characters that they got angry, I think these people or kids will watch the show anyway, they just may not admit to it.</p>
