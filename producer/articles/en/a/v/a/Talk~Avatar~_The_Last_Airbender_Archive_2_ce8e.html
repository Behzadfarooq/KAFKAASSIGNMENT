<p><i>First half of discussion archived <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender/Archive_1#Quick_Question" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender/Archive_1#Quick_Question" rel="nofollow">here.</a></i></p>
<p>ok, 1. Fyre, you arent one of the 3, so dont worry. 2. Proto, that was not the one I was bringing up. I believe, well, I know, it was on a different page. Just a respons that I got. And it has been delt with. But, since yo brought it up, quick question for you: Why did you have to open up a whole new page, saying that I had no show-info? When I even told the episodes that I got my info from. 3. As to why, well, come to my original topic first. It was only to a topic that was replied to, in a rude way. But as I said, it has been taken care of, by the person I had the problem with. ~Sayasha</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Why did you have to open up a whole new page, saying that I had no show-info?" I haven't the faintest clue what you're talking about. Where is this new page? –<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrototime_62d7.html" title="User:Prototime">Prototime</a> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPrototime_2eb0.html" title="User talk:Prototime">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Prototime_0748.html" title="Special:Contributions/Prototime">contribs</a>) 20:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Scary that you dont know.... well, heres the link: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender#Zuko.27s_Age ~Sayasha</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually Sayasha, that was put up around the exact same time as the argument put up at Zuko's talk page. That's why you should sign your posts with the four tildes ~~~~ so we can see dates. And it's easy to forget what page you are referencing. The Wikiproject workers go through about 40 some pages a day, it's hard to remember where things are usually. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> 21:13, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As H2P pointed out, that discussion dates back all the way back to the original conflict, as evidenced by the dates in our signatures. Nothing new has been started by anyone else concerning the issue since its conclusion months ago, short of the newly-recreated revert war that's now going on at the Prince Zuko page. –<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrototime_62d7.html" title="User:Prototime">Prototime</a> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPrototime_2eb0.html" title="User talk:Prototime">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Prototime_0748.html" title="Special:Contributions/Prototime">contribs</a>) 21:19, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(Looks up) Ya, I think i said soemthing about the part that this wasnt posted about the Zuko's Age thing originally... And it was never ment to inply it. Proto, you are the one who truely brought that to this page. And H2P, I know about all the date stuff, and I read the dates to. I just dont do he 4 ~'s, because I dont want to. But I do see the dates. ~Sayasha</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(Dubling, problably yes, but oh well) posted this, shortly after what I posted on your page, H2P. Mainly regarding the same area, as listed in your talk page. It was about nothing more then that. Never ment to be Zuko's age. ~Sayasha</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, well, despite you not originally wanting to bring this issue up, I still would like to know why there's a revert war going on again at Zuko's page. That second discussion on the WikiProject page was not meant to be hidden from you or used as something to insult you behind your back, and I don't see how your recent discovery of it should spark you to recreate this war. –<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrototime_62d7.html" title="User:Prototime">Prototime</a> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPrototime_2eb0.html" title="User talk:Prototime">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Prototime_0748.html" title="Special:Contributions/Prototime">contribs</a>) 21:35, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, on that, as it sits now, I just want to know why no one considered talking to me on a 1-1 bassis, or even why I was being talked about on the page, like I was some kind of person who loves to mess with things. ~Sayasha
<dl>
<dd>That second discussion wasn't started with malevolent intent (or at the very least not on my part, and I suspect it's the same with the other editors), nor was it meant to personally attack you, but it was designed to be a brainstorming area for refutations to your argument. The discussion was meant to serve as a communication medium for several like-minded editors who disagreed with your logic to come up with the best argument against your case--and you could have always interjected there as well, or started your own discussion with editors who were like-minded to you on another page for your own purposes. I most certainly wouldn't have been offended if you did that; after all, we all have the same goal, and that's to make Wikipedia the best it can be (which obviously requires communication), and I always assume good faith. For my part, though, I apologize if anything I said there offended you. –<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrototime_62d7.html" title="User:Prototime">Prototime</a> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPrototime_2eb0.html" title="User talk:Prototime">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Prototime_0748.html" title="Special:Contributions/Prototime">contribs</a>) 21:44, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Ok, I get what your saying. Thank you, and I apologize (Even though I cant spell it) for any content that gets anoying. And as for whats going on on the Zuko page, I have no clue. i havent been on in a while, so I cant tell the least. SOrry. ~Sayasha

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Elements and Seasons</span></h2>
<p>Is there any correlation with the seasons and the elements? I'm wondering this because during Winter, the Book of Water focuses on Aang learning Waterbending. The same goes with Spring and Earthbending and I assume with Summer and Firebending. I'm just wondering this because it seems that there is.--<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsaneZeroG_3356.html" title="User:InsaneZeroG">InsaneZeroG</a> 22:39, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Avatar Cycle mirrors the seasons.

<p>"There is only one Avatar, who reincarnates himself through the centuries. Each time the Avatar dies it is reborn into the next nation. This successive cycle mirrors the order of the seasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Water Tribes - winter</li>
<li>Earth Kingdom - spring</li>
<li>Fire Nation - summer</li>
<li>Air Nomads - autumn</li>
</ul>
<p>The cycle provides a natural balance between the elements. This way, no single nation can grow stronger than another."</p>
<p>If the relationship between the elements and the seasons is any deeper than this, however, we do not presently know. –<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrototime_62d7.html" title="User:Prototime">Prototime</a> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPrototime_2eb0.html" title="User talk:Prototime">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Prototime_0748.html" title="Special:Contributions/Prototime">contribs</a>) 00:55, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why insist on these hacked (or at least unpublished) episodes?!</span></h2>
<p>I have noticed lately that there have been episode edits to include UNANNOUNCED episodes from the IMDb and other unreliable, unpublished sources, it's leading me to think that this page should be semi-protected again. I have edited some things back to the published (or at least known) episodes. As a reader, if i had not read the talk pages beforehand, I would easily assume these episodes were "real". <a href="../../../w/h/y/User%7EWhydoit_b1d5.html" title="User:Whydoit">Whydoit</a> 19:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Airbender in opening title.</span></h2>
<p>OK, its time we do this the right way, instead of revert warring. The fact in question is the claim that the Airbender shown in the opening title sequence is <a href="../../../a/a/n/Aang.html" title="Aang">Aang</a>. Some maintain that it is, others maintain that is not, and still others maintain that it is indeterminate.</p>
<p>My opinion: it might be Aang. However, "might be" does not belong on Wikipedia. I would ask, then, that the editors who believe, with certainty, that the figure is Aang explain here why they do. Remember, Wikipedia only works when we have discussion.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> 03:36, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since I added the "do not change this" note, I've been using this picture as a reference to the facial hair argument. <a href="http://www.firebender.com/intro/images/15.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.firebender.com/intro/images/15.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

When comparing this one <a href="http://www.firebender.com/intro/images/17.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.firebender.com/intro/images/17.jpg" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> with the pictures of Aangs head as seen on the page, Aang's head is a lot rounder where as the one portrayed here is must more oval and sharp. I'm gonna take Fyre's stance on this one. I don't believe it's Aang, and I'll defend it completely, but it could be Aang and I could be wrong. But I have a myspace forum that I can direct you too that has debated it and the fact that it is debated means that we don't know and therefore can't put up the conclusion that it is Aang. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 05:22, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Those pictures pretty much convince me that the Airbender has facial hair. But if not Aang (when older, perhaps), and not Monk Gyatso (who I don't think was ever shown in the young monk robes that Aang &amp; this Airbender wear), is it possible that he could be just a generic monk who wasn't introduced in the episodes? As such he would still represent the Air Nomads and the Air element in the title sequence. Of course, his identity could be revealed in a future episode, which shouldn't be forgotten as an option. --<a href="../../../t/r/y/User%7ETryforceful_b16a.html" title="User:Tryforceful">Tryforceful</a> 07:36, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with the generic monk idea, those pictures show a mustache that is pretty easy to see, and to me (for some odd reason)the monk in the opening sequence seems to be older than Aang, for now I think that it's best to not identify him as of yet (if at all). --<a href="../../../w/h/y/User%7EWhydoit_b1d5.html" title="User:Whydoit">Whydoit</a> 01:46, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So far I understand that Benders, that is the people who bend, are capitalized. For example: "Zuko is a Firebender."</p>
<p>The act/art of bending by itself is <i>not</i> capitalized. For example, "Aang, an Airbender, uses airbending to protect his friends from other hostile Benders."</p>
<p>I think this first convention was adopted based on how Nickelodeon initially did it on their official website for Avatar.

<p>The fact that there are only 3 styles of bending for Aang to learn doesn't limit the shows run. For all we know, they might start a brand new avatar season featuring a new avatar after Aang has defeated the fire lord (if he does...)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">moving some of the front matter down a paragraph</span></h2>
<p>It seems to me that the front paragraph is filled with a lot of information about where Avatar airs that might be best set after a description of the show itself.</p>
<p>Example: "Avatar: The Last Airbender (known as Avatar: The Legend of Aang in the UK, Brazil, India and New Zealand) is an American animated television series airing on Nickelodeon. Set in a fantastic, Asian-influenced world of martial arts and elemental magic, Avatar: The Last Airbender follows the adventures of Aang, the successor to a long line of Avatars, and his friends Katara, Sokka and later Toph, and their two animal companions Appa and Momo in their quest to save the world from the merciless Fire Nation, while avoiding capture from pursuers including Prince Zuko and other hunters from the Fire Nation.</p>
<p>"Originally slated to start November 2004, it debuted on TV February 21, 2005 and has also become available on iTunes. Produced at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank, California, and animated in South Korea (where many animated television series are animated), it was co-created and executive produced by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. In the United States, new episodes air Friday nights at 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the Nickelodeon cable network. New seasons of Avatar begin in the spring and episodes are rerun in the summer; new episodes return in the autumn and the season ends in early winter."</p>
