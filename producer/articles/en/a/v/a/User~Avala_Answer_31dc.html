	    <p>Here I will write about almost completely false accusations by Snowspinner.</p>
<p>I will follow <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_Avala_Evidence_0f84.html" title="User:Snowspinner/Avala Evidence">User:Snowspinner/Avala Evidence</a> and try to provide answer to everything written in there.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">User:Snowspinner</a> has been very agressive many times. In some arguing with him, I tried to reach compromise but they were rejected by Snowspinner. He was pointing to consensus. His consensus can be found at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Avala_69ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Avala">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Avala</a> where he had votes of the sides that were completely unneutral like <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomanm_5283.html" title="User:Romanm">User:Romanm</a> and the vote by <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">User:GeneralPatton</a> who calls other users "cunts" but it will be explained later. I also once mentioned Snowspinner in requests for arbitration, and somehow I have felt his angriness since than.</p>
<p>I will put what Snowspinner said in <i>italic</i> and the answer in bold.</p>
<p><i>One such edit war can be found regarding <a href="../../../n/a/m/Template%7ENAM_07a4.html" title="Template:NAM">Template:NAM</a>. When it was suggested that the box was overly large, and it was suggested that NAM might not be a good subject for an ASB, the following posts ensued: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:NAM&amp;diff=3591508&amp;oldid=3590283" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:NAM&amp;diff=3591508&amp;oldid=3590283" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:NAM&amp;diff=3696634&amp;oldid=3659102" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:NAM&amp;diff=3696634&amp;oldid=3659102" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:NAM&amp;diff=3909283&amp;oldid=3701566" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:NAM&amp;diff=3909283&amp;oldid=3701566" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. When the box was subsequently listed on VfD, Avala’s responses were of similar tone – the archived VfD discussion can be found at MediaWiki talk:NAM.</i></p>
<p><b>I actually don`t see the problem in here, this box passed VfD and I don`t know why is Snowspinner still arguing about it. Consensus he was pointing to many times was actually proven in here. Regarding those links it is mostly discussion and don`t need any comments.</b></p>
<p><i>When faced with this criticism of the box, Avala also responded by deleting the comparable NATO box from a bunch of articles and replacing it with a box that simply said the country was a part of NATO. This can be seen at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=United_Kingdom&amp;diff=3631552&amp;oldid=3630281" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=United_Kingdom&amp;diff=3631552&amp;oldid=3630281" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Romania&amp;diff=3631510&amp;oldid=3630269" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Romania&amp;diff=3631510&amp;oldid=3630269" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Portugal&amp;diff=3630490&amp;oldid=3630262" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Portugal&amp;diff=3630490&amp;oldid=3630262" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Luxembourg&amp;diff=3630253&amp;oldid=3630237" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Luxembourg&amp;diff=3630253&amp;oldid=3630237" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Norway&amp;diff=3632057&amp;oldid=3630250" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Norway&amp;diff=3632057&amp;oldid=3630250" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Spain&amp;diff=3630286&amp;oldid=3630278" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Spain&amp;diff=3630286&amp;oldid=3630278" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.</i></p>
<p><b>I was trying to point that Nam box was not only organization box with many country links. I also changed it to have only NATO emblem and text-Member of Nato, because it was visually much better. I also made Template:NAMm in the same way which was not mentioned by Snowspinner. These links are placed just for no reason because they are showing how I edited those articles-swaped <a href="../../../n/a/t/Template%7ENATO_d41c.html" title="Template:NATO">Template:NATO</a> with Template:NATOm. Anyways I think i proved my point because <a href="../../../n/a/m/Template%7ENAM_07a4.html" title="Template:NAM">Template:NAM</a> was not deleted</b></p>
<p>This was followed with a discussion regarding Template:Serbia and Montenegro, the following edits were made: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=3645726&amp;oldid=3645682" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=3645726&amp;oldid=3645682" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> (Note here what might be taken as a personal attack) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=3645860&amp;oldid=3645769" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=3645860&amp;oldid=3645769" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=3660101&amp;oldid=3659544" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=3660101&amp;oldid=3659544" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=3660124&amp;oldid=3660101" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=3660124&amp;oldid=3660101" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=3661470&amp;oldid=3661407" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=3661470&amp;oldid=3661407" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=3661525" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=3661525" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. These edits, made in response to the concern that the box didn’t have enough information to be worth making an ASB about, demonstrate hostility, refusal to negotiate or seek consensus, and general unhelpfulness in favor of being excessively provocative.</p>
<p><b>Again Snowspinner still seems to be angry that those boxes weren`t deleted. I am very shocked we are still talking about this box, on whuch everyone agreed , box is still here and no need to discuss something like that. This was written by Snowspinner , I guess, just to make those evidence list longer.</b></p>
<p><b>He somehow accepted that <a href="../../../s/f/r/Template%7ESFRY_648d.html" title="Template:SFRY">Template:SFRY</a> should be placed in history articles of these countries not on main article. But still never said he agree but only stopped replying.</b></p>
<p><i>Another edit war occured on <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a>, where Avala sought to remove the honorific "Her Majesty." Avala violated the three revert rule on this article as shown here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;diff=4526655&amp;oldid=4524954" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;diff=4526655&amp;oldid=4524954" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;diff=4528954&amp;oldid=4527445" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;diff=4528954&amp;oldid=4527445" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;diff=4529794&amp;oldid=4529538" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;diff=4529794&amp;oldid=4529538" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;diff=4530495&amp;oldid=4530101" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;diff=4530495&amp;oldid=4530101" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;diff=4534156&amp;oldid=4532924" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;diff=4534156&amp;oldid=4532924" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. In discussing this edit, Avala adopted a hostile and beligerant tone, frequently responding with large amounts of capital letters and exclamation points, giving his posts an exceedingly aggressive tone, and generally refusing to accept widespread opposition as a reason to stop reverting.

<b>My point was that we shouldn`t include Her Majesty in the article because Britannica, Encarta and any tiehr encyclopedia does not. I have some links at <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvala_EII_8614.html" title="User:Avala/EII">User:Avala/EII</a>. Anyways I was called an "idiot" together with Hemanshu for deleting HM from first sentence. I agreed to use HM elswhere in the article but once again my compromise proposal was rejected. Only thing I was trying to gain is NPOV but it is hard to get with many stuborn users who like to press revert.

<p><b>Many times I said I PROPOSE A PEACEFUL SOLUTION in the article and on IRC but I guess it was wrong because Snowspinner is using it against me. His idea is I guess to propose hostile solutions.

<p>Avala’s most problematic conduct in an edit war, however, comes from <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan_Kucan_d4dc.html" title="Milan Kucan">Milan Kucan</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janez_Drnovsek_a611.html" title="Janez Drnovsek">Janez Drnovsek</a>. (Note that this matter was previously turned down for arbitration). Avala sought to add a note that both Kucan and Drnovsek were being accused of war crimes. More or less everyone who was not Avala objected to this on the grounds that it did not appear to be a serious charge, mentioned only marginally in one paper.

<p><b>I provided evidence, many evidence which you rejected in worst style. No compromise again. Finally I decided not to write anything in those articles anymore becuase there is no point , ver loud Slovenian users were against my edits and I decided to leave even though article is not complete.</b></p>
<p><i>Some of this tendency towards edit warring may be explained by the attitude expressed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4873104&amp;oldid=4873051" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4873104&amp;oldid=4873051" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>, in which Avala suggests that an edit war can be justified if the user “knew much more than other users” – an attitude which goes against the Wikipedian drive towards consensus.</i></p>
<p><b>Well, I think everyone will agree with me that two users can't fight about for an example <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart.html" title="Heart">Heart</a> where one user is cardiologist and the other one is pool cleaner.</b></p>
<p><i>Avala also regularly demonstrates a lack of understanding of Wikipedia conventions, policy, making spurious listings or votes on ViP, RFA, and FAC. When called on these listings, he responds with the hostility described above.Examples of this include his opposition to <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">User:Snowspinner</a>’s nomination on RFA, which was on the grounds that <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">User:GeneralPatton</a> had supported the nomination. This can be found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4850996&amp;oldid=4850953" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4850996&amp;oldid=4850953" rel="nofollow">[58]</a> with further explanation and comments at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4873009&amp;oldid=4872960" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4873009&amp;oldid=4872960" rel="nofollow">[59]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4852495&amp;oldid=4852132" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4852495&amp;oldid=4852132" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>. Obviously, the vote itself is not actionable - one can vote however they want. My concern is the larger issue of not seeming to work within the context of Wikipedia conventions and engaging with the community - particularly when combined with his nomination of <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">User:Nikola Smolenski</a>, which demonstrated a lack of understanding of what people look for in an administrator. When users pointed to edit wars Nikola had engaged in, he maintained that this should be ignored in the face of Nikola’s edits and promotion of Wikipedia. Although, certainly, these things should be weighed, the seeming disregard for concerns as towards Nikola’s judgment seems further symptomatic the described lack of awareness of normal Wikipedia conventions and procedures. Evidence of this can be found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4872340&amp;oldid=4872281" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4872340&amp;oldid=4872281" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4873104&amp;oldid=4873051" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4873104&amp;oldid=4873051" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> (Which was linked to above). Again, nominating a user and supporting him is not itself actionable - what concerns me is that not wanting to be on the same list as another user is considered a good reason to oppose a user, but concern about edit wars and misconduct are not. And, more broadly, what conerns me is that these things, combined, seem to indicate willful disengagement with Wikipedia as a community, and to constitute deliberate provocativeness so as to disrupt Wikipedia's function.</i></p>
<p><b>I think is is my right to nominate whoever I want. Plus I see that you are very angry because of my vote even though you say you are not. Your tone sounds like you are very angry, and I think that you should just take a rest. Mentioning evidence in style like this is some detective work on spying the country makes you look funny, and I am not personal attacking you. I am just saying it with best intention</b></p>
<p><b>Later in this text I will copy/paste some parts of Snowspinner's nomination to show how this evidence list made some people vote against him</b></p>
<p><i>On FAC, he has made a number of unsuitable nominations, and been obstinate about objections. Furthermore, he has shown a disregard for the request that each nominator only submit one article. Some of his many nominations can be found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=4442471&amp;oldid=4442060" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=4442471&amp;oldid=4442060" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=4455780&amp;oldid=4455760" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=4455780&amp;oldid=4455760" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=4496283&amp;oldid=4495950" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=4496283&amp;oldid=4495950" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=4438032&amp;oldid=4437726" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=4438032&amp;oldid=4437726" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>.</i></p>
<p>The latter two are particularly telling. <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_humor.html" title="Russian humor">Russian humor</a> at the time of its nomination was little more than a list of Russian jokes, as you can see (It hasn’t changed), and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro_42bb.html" title="Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro">Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro</a> was a mess – poor grammar and formatting, and over half the article consisted of source text.

<p>When people raised the natural objections, a typical flurry of snippisness and refusal to change anything ensued.

The last is particularly noteworthy, with its insinuation and near-personal attack of Snowspinner, saying “We all know why you are doing this, Snowsppiner [sic]. It is sad but I shall not comment it in here.”</p>
<p>Another display of unhelpfulness on FAC can be found when someone objected to the placement of an ASB on <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikola_Tesla_c53c.html" title="Nikola Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a> and complained that the see also section was gratuitously long, his response was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=4531539&amp;oldid=4531348" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=4531539&amp;oldid=4531348" rel="nofollow">[77]</a>, indicating an unwillingness too His activities at FAC extends into <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_removal_candidates_42f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article removal candidates">Wikipedia:Featured article removal candidates</a>, where he listed <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Paul_Bremer_84f2.html" title="L.

The article, of course, was not a stub – here is how it stood when Avala listed it – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=L._Paul_Bremer&amp;oldid=4451535" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=L._Paul_Bremer&amp;oldid=4451535" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>.</p>
<p><b>I just don`t get your point in here. First link you provided after saying&#160;:"he has made a number of unsuitable nominations" I see the nomination of the article that became Featured? Do you check or just post these links? Still I have a right to nominate an article I think deserves to be nominated. Sometimes I made mistakes, I agree. When you said these are some of mmy many nominations you were wrong because I can`t think of any other nomination I made. Then you say "when someone objected to the placement of an ASB". I thought it was you? Anyways many many people agreeed that Nikola Tesla article should become featured but you dissagreed about the box, and links. I hoped that you will help in making it better, but instead you raised your nose because on IRC noone agreed with you. Like I said million times I never called L. Paul Bremer article a stub. I said it is more a stub then featured. You probably didn`t undersand me well but what I meant to say is that this article is longer than a stub but certainly not of featured quality. You even posted links in here which prove everything what I said. I guess your play is that people will get bored after 70 links, and that they will beleive you. I just hope that such a thing will not happen.</b></p>
<p><i>On VIP, Avala listed <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomanm_5283.html" title="User:Romanm">User:Romanm</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">User:GeneralPatton</a> who were clearly not committing vandalism, but who were merely disagreeing with him on the matters of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan_Kucan_d4dc.html" title="Milan Kucan">Milan Kucan</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janez_Drnovsek_a611.html" title="Janez Drnovsek">Janez Drnovsek</a> (Note that the exchange between GeneralPatton and Avala that resulted in the personal attacks happened after this point). I’m still working on finding the actual edits – it appears that ViP was affected by Wik’s vandalbot attacks, and that the edit history is lost somewhere. I’m not entirely certain where. As soon as I find those, I’ll post them.</i></p>
<p><b>I am waiting for you to post them. To help you he called me cunt-pickice and i will shit on your kings picture-serem ti na sliku kralja</b></p>
<p><br />
<i>Smaller instances include the questionable practice of voting for one’s self on RFA, as shown at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4884841&amp;oldid=4884839" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4884841&amp;oldid=4884839" rel="nofollow">[81]</a>. Although its unclear whether this is an actual violation of the rules, it is, again, certainly a disregard for convention. There is also the voting in a long-ended poll at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Naming_policy_poll&amp;diff=4889698&amp;oldid=4889658" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Naming_policy_poll&amp;diff=4889698&amp;oldid=4889658" rel="nofollow">[82]</a>.</i></p>
<p><b>Actually you couldn`t find anything so you pointed to "There is also the voting in a long-ended poll". You should know that I settled this up with Raul on IRC because you were there. He said that some admin unprotected the poll and that he will do it again. And the reason I voted was that this poll was mentioned as alive on IRC so that is why I voted. I just placed a vote not checking the note at top of the page. Are you the only one who sees the problem in here?</b></p>
<p><i>Avala also engages in personal attacks with some frequency. When called on these personal attacks, whether in IRC or Wikipedia, he frequently refers to an incident in which <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">User:GeneralPatton</a> called him a ‘cunt” in a foreign language, seeming to believe that because he was a victim of a personal attack at one point, he somehow has eternal amnesty from the personal attacks policy. One instance of this fixation on this instance can be found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4884770&amp;oldid=4884639" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=4884770&amp;oldid=4884639" rel="nofollow">[83]</a>, which is arguably a personal attack as well.</i></p>

<dd>In the name of openess, I think, though I'm not sure, that what zocky is objecting to is that I removed a pair of nominations under the policy that obviously unsupported nominations may be removed. I did so because they were becoming exceedingly vicious and hateful, and, in the case of one of them, because it appeared to be posted by a sockpuppet and seemed designed to foster exactly the kind of flame war that it did foster. Were I an administrator, I would have done exactly this, and probably warned some people for personal attacks as well. I say this by way of saying that, yes, I am willing to be decisive in my actions. If something is causing a problem, I will attempt to fix it. I will note in my defense, however, that I did not remove the nominations once they were reinstated. I will be decisive - I will not be stubborn and insistent.

That's either a serious misunderstanding of Wikipedia (which I choose to believe) or a sneaky perpetuation of personal antipathy.

<dd>Honestly, I don't think the amount of time matters as much as you do... there's just no way that Avala's nomination is going to pass, and I think that was clear when I removed it. A nomination with 12 votes in opposition, which was what I think it had at the time, needs 40 supporters to pass. Only one RfA has ever passed 39 votes. It was not concievable that it was going to pass, no matter how many people had time to vote on it. Clearly there was disagreement with this. I stand by my decision, but I'm not rushing to take it down again, as I said. As for the other... I personally attribute a lot of Avala's seeming hostility to difficulty expressing himself in English. I find that a more sympathetic opinion than that he's a hothead. I think we're reacting to the same set of behaviors here, at least, though attributing different causes to it. Looking at my wording, though, i can see how it could be misinterpreted - I'll clarify. But both of those are neither here nor there, and I don't want this to turn into a lengthy debate on the matter. Feel free to bring it up with me on my talk page or on IRC if you want (And please do - I'm happy to explain myself). I just wanted to note that my approach towards this page regarding Avala's nomination and its removal would in fact be consistent with my approach towards conflict as an administrator, so that, should anyone else find it extremely objectionable, they would be aware and would vote accordingly.&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 23:54, Jul 28, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I think I'm entitled to the last word on my vote. Removing anything of consequence in less than 24 hours keeps even regular editors, who take time to follow the running of Wikipedia, out of the loop and denies the user's right to reply to objections.</dd>
<dd>The other thing is, Avala's English is nowhere neer as bad as you claim. I read all his comments on this page carefully. He has problems with articles and tenses, but so do most Slavic speakers.

<li><s>Well, after some consideration, I am compelled to oppose here. I do not often vote in such things, but I am not at all certain I agree with many of this user's views on WP administration, particularly regarding resolution of disputes without recourse to enforced procedure and regulations. Specific examples include Avala's RfAr evidence (which, while not containing any specific objections which would on their own disqualify a user from adminship, exemplifies my general feelings), and an opinion that mediation is not helpful; however, I also have a broad non-specific objection to hir general attitude and opinions in such matters. While adminship should be something bestowed upon anyone willing to enforce the community's decisions, rather than an ability to enforce one's own views, there is at present a certain status associated with adminship and it does result in one's own opinions, however inadvertantly, carrying more weight than a normal user's. I therefore cannot personally support adminship for those whose desired procedures differ so much from my own. <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELady_Lysine_Ikinsile_e8ab.html" title="User:Lady Lysine Ikinsile">—<i>Lady Lysiŋe Ikiŋsile</i></a> | <a href="../../../l/a/d/User_talk%7ELady_Lysine_Ikinsile_ece5.html" title="User talk:Lady Lysine Ikinsile">Talk</a> 00:27, 2004 Jul 29 (UTC)</s> Having considered this further, I am changing my vote to neutral; not because my opinion has changed, but because I do not feel comfortable opposing a nomination on the grounds that I personally disagree with the direction the community is taking.

<p><b>Snowspinner sees to jump at everyone voting against him by making me look bad.</b></p>
<p><b>At the end I would like to say that I admit making mistakes, but many of them were made while I was young editor in here. Still Snowspinner IMO was never able to solve problems, had to appologise to some users before becuase of personal attacks. I am really sorry that someone is obsessed with me but he also gets hard time finding anything against me. Still Snowspinner was saying bad things about me on IRC and sometimes unaware of my presence. Once he said "I love to poke Avala".</b></p>
<p><b>I hope that Snowspinner will realise his mistakes and withdraw this request as soon as possible.</b></p>
<p>Yours sincerily --[[User:Avala|<a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvala_c557.html" title="User:Avala">Avala</a>|<a href="../../../a/v/a/User_talk%7EAvala_8e78.html" title="User talk:Avala"><font color="#882222">★</font></a>]] 13:20, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
