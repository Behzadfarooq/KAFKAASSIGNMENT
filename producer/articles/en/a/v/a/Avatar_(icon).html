<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatar_%28icon%29.html" title="Edit section: Origin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origin</span></h2>
<p>The "<a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatar.html" title="Avatar">avatar</a>" derives from the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word Avatāra, meaning "incarnation" and usually implying a deliberate descent into mortal realms for special purposes. The term is used primarily in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hindu</a> texts. For example, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishna.html" title="Krishna">Krishna</a> is the eighth avatar (incarnation) of <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu.html" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> the Preserver, whom many Hindus worship as God. The <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatar.html" title="Avatar">Dasavatara</a> are ten particular "great" incarnations of <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu.html" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatar_%28icon%29.html" title="Edit section: Computer games">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Computer games</span></h3>
<p>As used for a computer representation of a user, the term dates at least as far back as <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, when it was used as the name for the player character in the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima.html" title="Ultima">Ultima</a> series of computer games. The Ultima games started out in 1981, but it was in <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima_IV_0a78.html" title="Ultima IV">Ultima IV</a> (1985), that the term "avatar" was introduced. To become the "avatar" was the goal of Ultima IV. The later games assumed that you were the avatar and "avatar" was the player's visual on-screen in-game persona. The on-screen representation could be customized in appearance. Later, the term "avatar" was used by the designers of the role-playing game <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadowrun.html" title="Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a> (1989), as well as in the online role-playing game <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habitat_%28video_game%29.html" title="Habitat (video game)">Habitat</a> (1987).</p>

<p>The use of <i>Avatar</i> to mean online virtual bodies was popularised by <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Stephenson_f694.html" title="Neal Stephenson">Neal Stephenson</a> in his <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberpunk.html" title="Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> novel <i><a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow_Crash_5835.html" title="Snow Crash">Snow Crash</a></i> (1992). <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> In <i>Snow Crash,</i> the term <i>Avatar</i> was used to describe the virtual simulation of the human form in the <i><a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaverse.html" title="Metaverse">Metaverse</a></i>, a virtual-reality version of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_status.html" title="Social status">Social status</a> within the Metaverse was often based on the quality of a user's avatar, as a highly detailed avatar showed that the user was a skilled <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker.html" title="Hacker">hacker</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programmer.html" title="Programmer">programmer</a> while the less talented would buy off-the-shelf models in the same manner a beginner would today. Stephenson wrote in the "Acknowledgments" to <i>Snow Crash</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The idea of a 'virtual reality' such as the Metaverse is by now widespread in the computer-graphics community and is being used in a number of different ways. The particular vision of the Metaverse as expressed in this novel originated from idle discussion between me and Jaime (Captain Bandwidth)Taffe...The words 'avatar' (in the sense used here) and 'Metaverse' are my inventions, which I came up with when I decided that existing words (such as 'virtual reality') were simply too awkward to use...after the first publication of 'Snow Crash' I learned that the term 'avatar' has actually been in use for a number of years as part of a virtual reality system called 'Habitat'...in addition to avatars, Habitat includes many of the basic features of the Metaverse as described in this book,</i><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Despite the widespread use of avatars, it is unknown which <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_forum.html" title="Internet forum">Internet forums</a> were the first to use them; the earliest forums did not include avatars as a default feature, and they were included in unofficial "hacks" before eventually being made standard. Avatars on Internet forums serve the purpose of representing users and their actions, personalizing their contributions to the forum, and may represent different parts of their <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persona.html" title="Persona">persona</a>, beliefs, interests or social status in the forum.</p>
<p>The traditional avatar system used on most Internet forums is a small (96x96 to 100x100 <a href="../../../p/i/x/Pixel.html" title="Pixel">pixels</a>, for example) square-shaped area close to the user's forum post, where the avatar is placed. Some forums allow the user to <a href="../../../u/p/l/Upload.html" title="Upload">upload</a> an avatar image that may have been designed by the user or acquired from elsewhere. Other forums allow the user to select an avatar from a preset list or use an auto-discovery algorithm to extract one from the user's homepage.</p>

<p><a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_Instant_Messenger_c0e8.html" title="AOL Instant Messenger">AOL Instant Messenger</a> (AIM) was the first popular <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant_messaging.html" title="Instant messaging">instant-messaging</a> program to use avatars, picking up on the idea from PC games. However, users of AIM commonly refer to avatars as <i>buddy icons</i>. Today, many popular instant-messaging clients use avatars, including <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trillian_%28instant_messaging_client%29.html" title="Trillian (instant messaging client)">Trillian</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaim.html" title="Gaim">Gaim</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Live_Messenger_4fc0.html" title="Windows Live Messenger">Windows Live Messenger</a> and <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo%21_Messenger_6f40.html" title="Yahoo! Messenger">Yahoo! Messenger</a>.</p>
<p>Instant messaging avatars are usually very small. AIM icons are 48x48 pixels, although many icons can be found online that typically measure anywhere from 50x50 pixels to 100x100 pixels in size. A wide variety of these imaged avatars can be found on web sites and popular eGroups such as <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo%21_Groups_30db.html" title="Yahoo! Groups">Yahoo! Groups</a>.</p>
<p>The latest use of avatars in instant messaging is dominated by dynamic avatars. The user choose an avatar that represent him while chatting and the use of a text to speech technology, enable the avatar to talk the texts being used at the chat window. Another form of use for these kind of avatars is for video chats/calls. Skype has featured on her latest release (3.0) the option to use talking avatars while making video calls, two companies are doing that on Skype - <a href="https://extras.skype.com/72/view" class="external text" title="https://extras.skype.com/72/view" rel="nofollow">Gizmoz</a>and <a href="https://extras.skype.com/322/view" class="external text" title="https://extras.skype.com/322/view" rel="nofollow">CrazyTalk</a> and they offer a new way of self expression over IM experience.</p>

<p>Although blog comment pages can sometimes act like Internet forums, there is no single way to provide avatar support on blogs. One solution is the "gravatar", an avatar called from a centralized server at <a href="http://site.gravatar.com/" class="external text" title="http://site.gravatar.com/" rel="nofollow">site.gravatar.com/</a> and linked to one's e-mail address. Gravatars are centrally moderated, which allows them to be filtered for family friendliness.</p>
<p>Another attempt at a solution is the "pavatar", a tag included in the HTML of a website which links to an image file. There is also the concept of a "favatar", or using the <a href="../../../f/a/v/Favicon.html" title="Favicon">favicon</a> file on a server controlled by the represented user as an avatar. Favatars and pavatars are unmoderated.</p>

<p>Avatars in <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_games.html" title="Video games">video games</a> are essentially the player's physical representation in the game world. In most games, the player's representation is fixed, however increasingly games offer a basic character model, or template, and then allow customization of the physical features as the player sees fit. For example, <a href="../../../s/a/n/List_of_characters_in_Grand_Theft_Auto%7E_San_Andreas_739d.html#Carl_.22CJ.22_Johnson" title="List of characters in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas">Carl Johnson</a>, the avatar from <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/Grand_Theft_Auto%7E_San_Andreas_e6da.html" title="Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></i>, can be dressed in a wide range of clothing, can be given <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tattoo.html" title="Tattoo">tattoos</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haircut.html" title="Haircut">haircuts</a>, and can even <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodybuilding.html" title="Bodybuilding">body build</a> or become <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obesity.html" title="Obesity">obese</a> depending upon player actions.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Aside from an avatar's physical appearance, its dialogue, particularly in <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cut_scene.html" title="Cut scene">cut scenes</a>, may also reveal something of its character. A good example is the crude, <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_movie.html" title="Action movie">action hero</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotype.html" title="Stereotype">stereotype</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Nukem_%28character%29_1ea3.html" title="Duke Nukem (character)">Duke Nukem</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> Other avatars, such as <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Freeman_b9f0.html" title="Gordon Freeman">Gordon Freeman</a> (from <i><a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_ea8b.html" title="Half-Life">Half-Life</a></i>), reveal very little of themselves.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatar_%28icon%29.html" title="Edit section: Avatars in non-gaming universes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Avatars in non-gaming universes</span></h2>
<p>Avatars in non-gaming universes are used as two-<a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimension.html" title="Dimension">dimensional</a> or three-dimensional human or <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantastic.html" title="Fantastic">fantastic</a> <a href="../../../r/e/p/Representations.html" title="Representations">representations</a> of a person's self. Such representations can explore the virtual universe with which they are in using their avatar, add to it, or conduct conversations with other users, and can be customized by the user. Usually, the purpose and appeal of such non-gaming universes is to provide a large enhancement to common online conversation capabilities, and to allow the user to peacefully develop a portion of a non-gaming universe without being forced to strive towards a pre-defined goal.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The criteria avatars in non-gaming universes have to fulfill, in order to become useful, can depend to a great extent on, for example, the age of potential users. Research suggests that younger users of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_community.html" title="Virtual community">virtual communities</a> put great emphasis on fun and entertainment aspects of avatars, as well as on their practical functionalities (e.g. whispering). Younger users are furthermore interested in the simple ease of use of avatars, and their ability to retain the user’s <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymity.html" title="Anonymity">anonymity</a>. Meanwhile, older users pay great importance to an avatar’s ability to reflect their own appearance, <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_identity.html" title="Online identity">identity</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personality.html" title="Personality">personality</a>. Additionally, the majority of older users want to be able to make use of an avatar’s expressive functionalities (e.g. showing emotions), while being prepared to learn new methods of navigation, in order to handle the use of more complex avatars. Social scientists at Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> are examining the implications, possibilities, and transformationed social interactions <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformed_social_interaction.html" title="Transformed social interaction">transformed social interaction</a> that occur when people interact via avatars.</p>
<p>Avatar-based non-gaming universes are usually populated by those age groups, whose requirements concerning avatars are fulfilled. The majority of users of <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habbo_Hotel_1ebf.html" title="Habbo Hotel">Habbo Hotel</a>, for example, are of the age of 10 to 15. and <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaiaonline.html" title="Gaiaonline">gaiaonline</a>, 13 to 18. The reason for this might well be found in the properties and functionalities provided by the avatars of this virtual community. In contrast, <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_%28internet_service%29.html" title="There (internet service)">There</a> has a target audience ranging from the age of 22 to 49. The avatars incorporated into this immersive environment allow for a wide range of social interactions, including the expression of emotions. Another example is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Palace_%28computer_program%29_b190.html" title="The Palace (computer program)">The Palace</a>, where the majority of users seem to belong to an older age group. Here, users have the option to use their own images as avatars. This functionality turns the avatar into a direct reflection of their real-life appearance, a feature most desired by members of older age groups. Again, the population of the non-gaming universe seems to be largely determined by the properties and functionalities of its avatars. This is less true of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a>, where avatars range from lifelike humans to more fanciful robots, animals, and mythical creatures, with avatars created by players. The main <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a> grid is open only to adults, and participation is driven by social, artistic and commercial motivations.</p>
<p>Lisa Nakamura and other researchers have suggested that customizable avatars in non-gaming worlds tend to be biased towards lighter skin colors and against minorities, especially male minorities.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
