<h2><span class="mw-headline">Character section</span></h2>
<p>Since the FAC still has comments on the character section that have not been addressed, and there was some support in the prior discussion for improving this section, I'd like people to state their proposals here. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:17, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>This is what I think.
<ol>
<li>Get some sources. Right now it's unsourced. That needs to be fixed regardless of what you think of the rest.</li>
<li>Shorten it. Two paragraphs for each major character is a bit much. Three in some cases is a bit excessive.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would consider these changes to be the most important, but if you have other ideas, please share them. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:17, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Both sound logical, although I'd do 2 before 1, just so nobody wastes time digging up sources for stuff that's going to be removed anyway.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for sourcing, there IS precedent for TV show articles using the show in general as a source. Things like character traits and what-not are hard to cite to a single episode.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>)</sup> 00:22, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, I don't disagree that much of the material can be sourced directly to the show(and often enough they are in the main articles on the characters). In terms of shortening though, the longest are Iroh's and Toph's. I'd suggest removing the last paragraph for both of them. More so for Toph since it's unsourced at the moment. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Well, there are still some entries lacking sources, and I'd check awkward sentences like "He is as pained by his nephew's past as Zuko is, and hates that his nephew must suffer as he does." for rewriting. A simpler sentence like "He is troubled by his nephew's anguish from being exiled" would be much better. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey people, i want to know why they've removed the gif picture i uploaded. its really nice!! Please tell me why. I'll upload it again. remove it after letting me know why u r removing it. I'm also a wikipedian Contributor!! and i deserve the same right you hold as wikipedians. i uploaded the gif. file for its own decorative and informative purpose, and i dont see any reason why it should be replaced. it sure looks better than the present one ofcux.. and its a edited clip from the original movie and not by any chance a copy righted work. thnx for ur precious time.. i think i deserve an answer for this.. soon.. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlacious_bfa6.html" title="User:Glacious">Glacious</a> 09:27, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know why it was removed. Someone above said it was slow for them. And we're going for FA status here, so please add a fair use rationale to the gif asap. -<a href="../../../d/y/l/User%7EDylan0513_8f4d.html" title="User:Dylan0513">Dylan0513</a> 12:02, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, first off, it is absolutely based on a copyrighted work, even though you converted it to a .gif, you used the image files of the show for the purpose. As such, it is a derivative work, so I do not know if that falls under fair use rationale, however, there were apparently some technical issues viewing the animated files, thus it may not be an important question anyway. If people are having trouble viewing it, for whatever reason, it probably doesn't need to be used until that is dealt with. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:32, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Additionally, as I noted above, the graphic slowed me down, both on IE and Firefox (tested on multiple computers, Glacious). The ultimate answer, however, is "Does it add to the encyclopediac nature of the article?" I believe the answer here is "No." The plain logo itself is sufficient. --<b><a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESnicker_0fd1.html" title="User:Snicker"><span style="color:blue">Snicker</span></a><sup>|<a href="../../../s/n/i/User_talk%7ESnicker_541d.html" title="User talk:Snicker"><span class="plainlinks" style="color:red">Â¥</span></a></sup>Â°<sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snicker_f73e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snicker"><span class="plainlinks" style="color:orange">â‚¬</span></a>|</sup></b> 16:16, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">but it gives a better image to the article</span></h2>
<p>HI, well yeah u seem to have a point there, but i believe it gives the article much more naturality and plus all that it increases the image of this article. however i am sorry if this caused any difficulties to some users, but i use both I.E and Fire Fox PLUS Opera for my work purpose and i havent had any problems yet. it might seem a little slow when it loads but once it is loaded in a matter of sec, it looks perfect. by the way hav a look at <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a>. its also GIF but they dont complain over it like you guys do. and i dun even kno who loaded it. thnx anyways and i am waiting for a much reasonable explanation... <a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlacious_bfa6.html" title="User:Glacious">Glacious</a> 11:42, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I couldn't see it either, which is weird because I know I used to be able to.

<dd>There are copyright issues, as well. An animated gif is not one screenshot, but many of them acting as frames.

<dd>Spiderman is also red-x for me too. The Avatar gif loads slowly for me on Opera, Firefox, IE, and Netscape. The image doesn't really add anything new in my opinion too.

<dd>I'm not sure if it can, the colon in the title may allow Fox to stop the name as it owns the rights to Avatar with a colon making it seem like a sequel to Fox's movie, in which case Paramount would be able to get free ticket sales from Fox's viewers who don't know any better. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 21:21, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>well i think we can make an exception for this forum talk part cus its upbasis matter and it does have to do with Avatar potential. Besides, season 3 may have not began becuase the actor who played the UNCLE had died not to long ago. They probably need to find a replacement or just disclude him from the show. And yes that would be a real shame.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the third season Aang will go to the Fire Nation, that where Aang will see what has happened to them. A hundred years of war is not good for any nation, so it is assumable that the Fire Nation is destroying itself. With all of the Fire Nations Resources going to the war the economy is getting bad much like Germany after WWI. we have only seen the royal palace which doesn't show what real life in the Fire Nation is like.-Iroh18</p>

<dd>If Sokka becomes a Waterbender I will quit watching this show, because that has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Not only would it ruin Sokka's character and place on the team, it goes against everything previously stated about bending ability.

<li>well upbasis does have only that one episodes clarified. Dude, the episode may be about sokka thinking that he may be waterbending but finds out it was just his imagination and overeation. Although, it would be funny to see sokka waterbend. I can imagine him failing by the 100th time. Check the special page rep. Sok'as master is the name of one episode, the 3rd episode. It does have to do with sokka and waterbending. Remember the boomerang he has and its history. That to has something to do with waterbending. Plus there was a carving on it i think he discovers its true meaning. Even if he does learn it or not, Just enjoy the show. I'm am pleased they named one of the episodes already. But didnt the actor who played uncle die? Are they gonna find a replacement or just put him out of the show or just give him no lines and main parts? well, i still hope we can find more about sokka in the third episode.</li>

He was one of my favorite characters. Not to mention how funny he was. I hope they dont cancel it for that reason. He plays some pretty important parts in the series.

<li>chill out, i just posted at the wrong point. I think when we get clear episode names and descriptions, we can post it to the episode list. Just keep a look out for the upbasis sites, and no it said mako played in both seasons. But these days they can find actors that sound like the originals in no time. lol.</li>

<dd>Mako's replacement was in the second season. You clearly hear his voice in Tales of Iroh. We also will not be using TV.com as a source for episodes as we've already decided long ago that no official page will be made until Nick.com or TVGuide (or we did use AnimeNation once due to a pre-viewing) gives us it's air date and name. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 21:24, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the most part, yeah, Mako does do Iroh in season two, but there are parts in some of the latter episodes that are pretty clearly someone else.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>)</sup> 23:51, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">References</span></h2>
<p>Since when is it ok to use other Wikipedia pages as a citeable reference? That is completely unacceptable. That is the equivalent of someone publishing an [original research] document and then citing it as fact in another [original research] paper. Wikipedia can't be cited, that is the whole reason why everything must be externally cited.</p>
<p>Now then, if something from an episode needs to be cited then here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php" class="external free" title="http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php</a> - Episode transcripts</p>
<p>Use the transcripts, they are the only freely available non-Wikipedia source of verifiable episode content. So cite the appropriate transcript page instead of the corresponding Wikipedia page when you reference an episode.</p>
<p>I will not be the one who will go and modify all the references. I will, however, be the one who deletes all those inappropriate internal references, as that is just terrible article writing. I will allow for time though before I delete them. In fact I will allow a lot of time since there are a lot of references, just make sure it gets done. Sorry to be a jerk, but it's better to have no reference than a possibly falsified one (which is what EVERY Wikipedia article is). <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_of_Ice_3d30.html" title="User:Sage of Ice">Sage of Ice</a> 02:27, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not entirely accurate, I'm afraid. All one has to do to cite an episode is to use <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_episode_0190.html" title="Template:Cite episode">template:cite episode</a>. When you use that, you aren't citing the article on the episode, but the episode itself, which is acceptable. If you think that's wrong, maybe you should nominate that template for deletion, but as long as it exists its perfectly valid to use.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>)</sup> 05:58, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
