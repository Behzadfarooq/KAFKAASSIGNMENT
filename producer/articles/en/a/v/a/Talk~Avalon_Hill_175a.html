<p>Didn't Avalon Hill also pioneer the concept of using a hexagonal grid? I seem to recall (and this is totally off the top of my head, so I could be wrong) that the very first Avalon Hill wargame used a square grid, but it was realized that this posed too many problems with movement and other issues, so the idea of the hexagon was introduced. Does anyone know if this is true? <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoulpatch_82fb.html" title="User:Soulpatch">soulpatch</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I just looked at the Hasbro page, and it does mention that Tactics used a square grid, but it doesn't mention whether Charles Roberts came up with the idea of using a hexagon for subsequent games or not. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoulpatch_82fb.html" title="User:Soulpatch">soulpatch</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>If I remember correctly, yes, the first wargame to use hexes was James Dunnigan's Jutland game for AH. If anyone has access to Dunnigan's book, Complete Handbook to Wargames, it should confirm this. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the book right now... --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatton1138_c8fd.html" title="User:Patton1138">patton1138</a> 16:39, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That doesn't seem right to me. Also not having looked at the book, but going from memory... the first AH game I played (c. 1965) was <i>Afrika Korps</i> and it definitely had a hexagonal grid. I know that I was playing that and other hexagonal games when I received a promo mailing (or maybe an article in <i>The General</i>) about the impending publication of <i>Jutland</i> (which our chronology lists as coming out in 1967). In sum, I'm quite prepared to believe it was Dunnigan's invention, but it was introduced before <i>Jutland</i>. Incidentally, I've never played <i>Gettysburg</i>, but I vaguely remember reading at some point that it was being switched from hexagonal to something else (presumably square). I think there was an article about the change in <i>The General</i>. For some reason the subheadline "Hex Version Was Hexed" sticks in my mind. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 17:18, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, now that you bring dates into the matter, it doesn't seem right... The dates are correct, btw. Man, I wish I had that book on-hand.

<dd>According to <i>The Complete Book of Wargames</i> by Jon Freeman, the <i>D-Day</i> of 1961 was the first to use hexes - Roberts was supposed to have gotten the idea from Rand Corporation somehow. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 18:34, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I've heard the Rand Corporation story before (don't mean 'story' as in lack of veracity). I found an on-line version of Dunnigan's book. But on a quick scan, it's missing the story that I remember; must've been somewhere else I read it. The story went along the lines of whoever playing games on their college dorm bathroom's hexagon tiled floor. --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatton1138_c8fd.html" title="User:Patton1138">patton1138</a> 01:35, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's a blurb from a review on Gettysburg: <i>1958 Gettysburg was before hexes were used in wargames. In 1961, Charles Roberts first adapted hexes, and came out with an astonishing number of hex wargames that year. It's hard to tell which one was the "first" hex wargame, but I seem to remember him once writing that it was D-Day. But I've heard Chancellorsville from someone else, so am not sure.</i><a href="http://grognard.com/reviews1/getty64.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://grognard.com/reviews1/getty64.txt" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatton1138_c8fd.html" title="User:Patton1138">patton1138</a> 01:39, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Checking the index to the 1992 edition of Dunnigan's <i>The Complete Wargames Handbook</i> doesn't seem to turn up any mentions of pioneering use of hexagons with his <i>Jutland</i> game. However, Peter P. Perla's 1990 <i>The Art of Wargaming</i> does mention on pages 115-116: "In games such as <i>Chancellorsville</i> and <i>D-Day</i>, the original square grid was replaced by the hexagonal pattern in common use today. The source for this innovation, one of the most influential devices ever employed in the hobby, was the Rand Corporation.</p>
<p>"In the early 1950s Rand had contacted Roberts and in a circumspect manner inquired about the source of the CRT used in <i>Tactics</i> (and virtually all of the early Avalon Hill Games). Roberts's CRT bore an uncanny resemblance 'to the more complex one that Rand was using to wargame World War III and other horrors.' The fact was probably somewhat embarrassing to Rand when they discovered that Roberts had devised his table in about fifteen minutes, basing it on the popular military notion that an attacker required a three-to-one superiority in order to be reasonably assured of success. After this encounter with the think-tank wargamers, Roberts became more interested in Rand. Later, he saw a photograph of one of the Rand gaming facilities and noted that they were using a hexagonal grid. This grid allowed movement between adjacent hexagons (or hexes, as they are more frequently called) to be equidistant, whereas movement along the diagonals of a square grid covered more distance than movement across the sides of the squares. Roberts immediately saw the usefulness of this technique and adopted it his subsequent games." – WendellM 17:06, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added mention of Charles S. Roberts, the founder of company. I didn't know whether to use <i>Charles <b>S.</b> Roberts</i> or just <i>Charles Roberts</i>.

<p>I don't really think Avalon Hill should be listed as a "Defunct companies" (category). It is now a brand of Hasbro.

<dd>The corporation is defunct, which is what would be suggested to me by the phrase "defunct companies." I'm not sure about the "computer companies" listing, though.

<p>They made one that did poorly (their attempt at their board game <i>Civilization</i>). This was not their main claim to fame, however, so I don't think it is appropriate to list them as such. They were known for their board and table-top games. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot"></a> — <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 14:33, Jun 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>More than one I think - there was a computer 3rd Reich and others that I remember.

<dd>It was originally created by Bertell Ollman, a Marxist professor. I know that at first he was publishing it himself. He had originally intended just to make a few sets for friends and students, but it proved very popular, so he wanted to make more available and got in over his head with the self-publishing. He then wrote a book about the whole experience, <i>Class Struggle Is the Name of the Game: True Confessions of a Marxist Businessman</i> <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0688006450</a>. From what I've read (summaries and reviews of the book), it wouldn't be at all implausible that, after a brief taste of the entrepreneurial life, he sold the rights to the game to AH or some other company. I find a couple online references to it as an AH game, such as <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1510/Class+Struggle" class="external text" title="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1510/Class+Struggle" rel="nofollow">Board Game Geek</a>.

<p>Yes, it was also an AH game. I have a copy that is probably a 2nd Ed. I literally just packed it away this evening and can't remember the date, but think it was from the early 80s. It's in a brown box and has a picture of Marx on the cover.</p>

<dd>80s sounds about right. That's the year that it started showing up in AH catalogs that came with AH games. And believe me, I've got quite a few of those things! --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatton1138_c8fd.html" title="User:Patton1138">patton1138</a> 11:43, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would anyone mind if we separate, in the listing, the games that were published post-Hasbro from those published pre-Hasbro?

<dd>Got to agree that they should be kept as many of them will eventually have articles. No reason you can't reformat the list to make it less of a visual imposition and de-redlink/write-20-words about games that will clearly never have their own articles.<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 05:24, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, this has bothered me a lot on other articles that I contribute a lot to. What we've done there may be an option here. We could create a list or, better yet, two lists of games (one for Original games and one for Hasbro games) and link to them. Say, List of original Avalon Hill games and List of Hasbro Avalon Hill games? This would significantly trim down the size of the article and just leave the prose as the bulk of the article. As a matter of fact, I <b>strongly propose</b> we do this, based on how much space the games take up. Everyone else: <b>Support</b> or <b>Oppose</b>? — <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 15:18, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't mind a "List of" article, but it should be a single article, even if it contains two lists.

<dd>I have to say the recent rearrangement of the list pointed up just how much space the list is taking up on the page, and that moving it/whatever is probably a good idea. (I'll probably follow whatever we do here on the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simulations_Publications_f132.html" title="Simulations Publications">Simulations Publications</a> page.) My main problem with a list is that it should <i>eventually</i> be a virtual mirror of a <a href="../../../a/v/a/Category%7EAvalon_Hill_8681.html" title="Category:Avalon Hill">Category:Avalon Hill</a> (which would make sense to have). If we did two categories it'd be even closer. So... what I'm trying to say is that I want the complete list—the more so because it will be quite a while before there's enough articles for a Category page to even approach a complete list, <i>but</i> I want the list to still be useful when such a Category <i>is</i> a complete list. This means either additional data, or a non-purely alphabetic ordering scheme. We have publishing dates, and that's good. We have occasional notes about the games, do we want to systematize that? Or am I just thinking too much? --<a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERindis_de5d.html" title="User:Rindis">Rindis</a> 16:09, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I think you're thinking too much.&#160;;-) All the other lists I've encountered on the 'pedia are alphabetical. While I see a listing of Avalon Hill games by date as desirable, I don't think Wikipedia is the place to do it. That is, according to practice (not policy, AFAIK), lists are always alphabetical, unless there is an overwhelming reason to make them otherwise (such as a list of battles by year). BTW, I think an <a href="../../../a/v/a/Category%7EAvalon_Hill_8681.html" title="Category:Avalon Hill">Avalon Hill category</a> is a great idea.&#160;:-)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a>, the reason I suggested two separate lists is because the two lists in this article caused a lot of headaches relating to formatting and such.

<dd>Another thought, should we really just be lumping everything from <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victory_Games_7df1.html" title="Victory Games">Victory Games</a> in with all the original AH stuff?

<dd>Well, if Victory Games designed the game and Avalon Hill published, we could make sure the list indicates that these are all the games AH <i>published</i>, but didn't necessarily design. We can add a comment on the line for the game that it was designed by Victory Games. Or it will be stated in the article itself.</dd>

<dd>I don't see this as a problem. Right now I'm working on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Electronic_Arts_games_ec9f.html" title="List of Electronic Arts games">list of Electronic Arts games</a>. It includes all the games they ever published, but they didn't develop many of them (AAMOF, EA started out as a publisher <i>only</i>--they didn't develop any games initially).

<dd>....well, that's the thing. VG was owned by AH.

<p>I agree with the current entry's description of AH in past-tense terms, and I think that it should remain unchanged. The 60s purchase by Monarch left the company's game line and purpose largely unchanged, but the 90s purchase by Hasbro changed things massively (i.e. essentially destroyed them and turned the company name into a mere boxtop logo). While the "Avalon Hill" name may live on, it no longer represents what it once did at all, and I think that the current past-tense phrasing reflects this perfectly. – WendellM 16:22, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it is standard Wikipedia convention to write in past tense - since changing tense throughout an article is confusing, and writing in the present tense is usually not encyclopedic. But your right, AH is really no longer in existence except in name only. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 16:40, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
