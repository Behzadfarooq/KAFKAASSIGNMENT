<p>The article that is used as a cite to back up the death threats claim makes a provably false assertion. The claim is made that she was threatened after releasing WWJD, and she provides the reporter with "email proof". However, the quote from that proof was actually taken from a web posting over a year ago, well before WWJD was even conceived.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:wL6jcVx9hcYJ:oldamericancentury.org/bb/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:wL6jcVx9hcYJ:oldamericancentury.org/bb/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The claim is likely false, and the article that is cited to back the claim is verifiably false. Wikipedia should not be used to lend credibility to deceit. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 16:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just a comment about "RE-added dispute tag, see talk page. This is not a game"&#160;: the original dispute tag may have been in the article that was deleted on 18 July, so nobody has removed it from this version of the article. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 17:11, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I added a dispute tag today, then found it gone a short time later, but the edit history doesn't show any of that, so I really don't know what happened. Sorry. Maybe I was only looking at a preview. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:13, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>it appears that one of the threats actually relates to a previous production by Lowery, as noted in the link above. However, there is ample evidence of renewed threats in the aftermath of the release of WWJD: for instance, the comment about masturbating to Cindy Sheehan is demonstrably from a 2006 posting on <a href="http://www.conservativeunderground.com/forum/showpost.php?p=1390125&amp;postcount=19" class="external text" title="http://www.conservativeunderground.com/forum/showpost.php?p=1390125&amp;postcount=19" rel="nofollow">Conservative Underground</a>. So it's possible that one of the threats cited in the Progressive article might be cited misleadingly, but that does not suggest that the death threats claim is "provably false". <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardjames444_81a9.html" title="User:Richardjames444">Richardjames444</a> 17:21, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I said that the claim is "likely false", and the article (Progressive) cited to back the claim is "provably false". That article should not be used to cite the claim, since even you have just admitted that it is not true. Another source should be found to replace cite 1, or the claim is considered unverified, and should be removed. The Progressive article is tainted. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I should add that the post from CU that you link above does nothing to support a claim of death threats. In fact, there isn't a threat of any kind there, it is merely a vulgar question. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:32, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And how is a reply to a thread on a conservative blog considered "hate mail"? I will rework that a little more for you. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:52, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, and there never was a dispute tag on this article. I wikified it after clicking a link on the New Articles list.

<li>I changed the Conservative Underground link from an individual post to the entire thread. It gives a more fair assessment of how she was treated when she appeared on CU to promote her flash animation. I will probably do a little adjustment of some of the other source links in the article. (probably just move them around a little, their current placement seems to add a little confusion.)<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 19:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I really have a problem particularly with The Progressive article <a href="http://www.progressive.org/mag_mc042406" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.progressive.org/mag_mc042406" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> being used as a source in this article. It is being used to verify the claim that Ava received death threats after the release of WWJD, and I have already proven that the one message that could be construed as a threat occurred BEFORE WWJD. The other quotes are unsourced in the Progressive article (and are not even threats), and I have already proven that the most important one is falsely attributed, so I consider the entire article to be tainted. If no one can come up with another source to back up the claim being made, or cannot voice a good objection, I will soon remove it as a source, and replace it with a {{fact}} tag. In the absence of any other source of a DEATH THREAT, the section should be reworded something like "Lowery claims to have received death threats after the release of WWJD...". <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:49, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tweaked it a bit more. If the Progressive article is staying, then the counter sentence that I added should stay, for balance. I will go back and add a cite for that.<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:57, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>After sleeping on it, I made a slight adjustment for NPOV, changed "crassly sexual, racist and homophobic" to "vulgar, inappropriate, and culturally insensitive". I think it sounds more encyclopedic. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:23, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I don't agree, but I'm not going to change it back. The comments had considerable overtly racist content and used homophobic slurs, and it is honest enough to note that in the article, rather than it being POV or encyclopedic, although I would take out 'crassly' as subjective if I was to do it over. In any case, if people follow the link they'll make their own conclusions.<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardjames444_81a9.html" title="User:Richardjames444">Richardjames444</a> 18:29, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did a minor spelling correction in the new text without changing the content.

<dd>I just felt that your choice of words was leaning toward inflammatory, and I wanted to tone it down a bit with more "politically correct" terms.

<p>I just saw an interview with her on Fox News. She said the threats threatened her life and the life of her mother. Please change the article to reflect this, or at least do some follow-up research. She also cited death threats posted on Free Republic's message board that were relayed to her by some of the members.</p>

<li>In general it is not necessary to link to a video if you can cite the network, date and time the video was aired. Of course, this is wide open to abuse as there is no way to tell if the clip you cite in any way supports the fact you are using it to support, but that is one of the problems with scholarship in a broadcast age, and we cannot begin to address it here. In an ideal world, a TV network would archive ALL of its news and public affairs programs much as I archive all of the radio programs that air on my networks, or the way namy newspapers archive all of their issues. Perhaps that will happen some day. But for now, just cite the videos as you would any offline source, and trust that a sufficiently motivated fact checker will find the actual video or an accurate transcript of the program. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 04:59, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yeah, I forget how to do that too! I cleaned up some of your unintentional POV. Unless you can find a RS that describes her videos as 'anti-republican' that is POV. Where is a RS saying she is homeschooled? As for previous discussion above, CU is not RS nor V, and can't be used as a source for any claims or counter claims. I will make a concession and let a bit of exclusionable content remain, saying that there is some dispute regarding the threats, even though all the counter claims come from CU and FR. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a> 08:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Something that is blatantly and obviously against Republicans is, by definition, anti-Republican. One does not need to cite it and calling it such is not OR. Tell me - why is it just the "anti-Republican" descriptor that is in question here? Why not "anti-Bush," too? Why, because it's obvious that many of her animations are anti-Bush. One does not need an outside RS calling her animations "anti-Bush" in order to to call them "anti-Bush."

<dd>Hello, Jinx and FAAFA. I don't mean to butt in, but I seem to have made a habit out of it recently. Unless I am unclear on the nature of the debate in this section (which appears to be whether it is NPOV to pronounce the subject's work as anti-republican or not), and if you'd like an outside opinion, the way I'd handle it is this. From a cursory glance, the subject's animations appear to criticize specific people who are members of the Republican party. While I have not watched any of them myself, the NPOV way to portray this would be to specifically detail some of the notable subjects discussed or mentioned in them. That is to say, In animation X, Ava Lowery criticizes person Y using Z details (images, statements, etc.)</dd>
<dd>The vital thing to remember, of course, is the way that the article's voice must withhold any but the most explicit interpretation or value judgment; that should be left to the purview of the readers. If either of you guys has any question, just drop me a note on my talk page.

<dd>Hi, all. Kuzaar's suggestion expresses my own: make a list of ten or so names of the videos she's produced, and if they're ambiguous regarding the content a short phrase of summary; i.e. - "How Repulicans Really Care" with something like "Accuses Republicans of a double standard", or "Contrasts comfort of Republicans against suffering of troops", or something like that. That obviates the need for extraneous sources, and the links can go directly to her page. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:17, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have some concerns as well. I have tried over a fairly long period of time to assure that this article was factually accurate. See the factual accuracy dispute section above. Unfortunately, most of the evidence is from non-RS sources. The Progressive article itself (which I consider probably not RS either) has some verifiability problems, as some of the statements put forth have been shown to have occurred long before the context of the article. I submit that the marginal notability of the subject of this article stems from incidents that can be shown to probably be a hoax. Bottom line, this article suffers from chronic and probably unresolvable problems with POV, notability, verifiability, and copyright violation issues. There are also new EL rules that this article probably violates as well. I am seriously considering putting it up for AfD again. I don't think it can survive a second round because of the multiple issues. During the first AfD, I saw a post by Ava on her site wondering why there is even an article about her on Wikipedia, so I don't think she really cares one way or another. Perhaps it is time to put this article out of our misery. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 14:57, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>AfD? LOL! With 50,900 Ghits, active current Gnewshits from MSM, Interviewed by CNN, FNC, written about in the NYT, and written about by Cindy Sheehan? Why would you think that AfD - deleting an article on a highly notable individual - would be the correct course of action vs RfC? I'm sorry that you think that one source may have the date wrong on an insult that you claim came from a forum you frequent, but you think that is actually a reason for an AfD??? The date of one insult? I asked Admin Kuzaar to informally mediate this article, as I expected problems after I removed the anti-Ava POV that came from two editors who I contend are heavily biased against Ava and were doing some serious axe grinding. We'll get this sorted out! - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a> 17:46, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You have your facts wrong there buddy, the post that debunks the Progressive timeline comes from an archive of Ava's own site, (correction, it is from POAC, but is undisputably her post, see photo in profile and link to peacetakescourage.com) a post that she made herself. Therefore, it qualifies as a primary source in this article, so I'm not sure why it was removed. I suggest you go back through the history to before I ever edited this article if you want to see some POV axe-grinding. I worked very hard with one of Ava's friends to bring this article to a more neutral and accurate account that was acceptable to both sides. We had reached a consensus, and this article was fairly dormant until you decided to stir it up again. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:51, 21 November 2006 (UTC) <b>further</b> If I recall correctly, it was RichardJames, a friend of Ava's, who insisted on a link to CU to show how eeevil we were. The link I insisted on was the primary source of Ava's post, which shows that she received the death threat almost a year before anyone on CU had ever even heard of her. So please justify why you removed the primary source. Otherwise, it goes back in. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:57, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmmmmm. Let me see if I have this right. You admit above that someone on a NN forum you frequent - a forum that itself was deleted from Wiki for Non Notability - told Ava, a 15 year old at the time, to 'masterbate' (sic) (AND SICK) to a picture of Cindy Sheehan - one article mentions that forum - but because of the forum's Non Notability, perhaps thought it was a generic term for the 'conservative blogosphere' - they possibly get the date wrong on said incident, and you think that constitutes a hoax? AND a reason for an AfD??? Do you think that perhaps 'some' members of that forum would perfer not to have that info linked to on Wiki, or even perhaps prefer to have the entire article and 'insult / threat' issue 'disappear'? People like Cindy Sheehan, and Ava - AND Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter get death threats ALL THE TIME. One conservative blogger was just arrested for sending numerous REAL death threats - and you contend her claim of possible death threats might be a publicity stunt???!!! CP - I need to warn you - BLP applies to talk pages too. That assertion itself may be a violation.

<li>You think too much for your own good. You already removed the only thing that I ever wanted scrubbed from this article (the link to CU), so thank you. However, you also removed a proper primary source of a post by the subject of this article, which contains verbatim the same "threat" which appears in the Progressive article, which had nothing whatsoever to do with WWJD or CU. They not only got the date wrong, they got the video wrong, the year wrong, and the perpetrators of the "threats" wrong. I said I am only considering an AfD. I have a 100% success rate with AfD's I have nominated, so trust me, I will not nominate an AfD unless I am pretty sure it won't mess up my average.

<li>Your "unfrigginbelievable" type of comments are part of the problem you are having. I tried to remove the CU link in the past, but a friend of Ava's insisted on its inclusion. In the interest of gaining consensus, I went along with it, because it actually showed how inoccuous the replies to the thread that Ava started on CU were. I prefer that there not be a link to CU in this article, because CU really had nothing to do with Ava, outside of a thread she started on CU to troll her video. CU was accused by DUers of making death threats against Ava, and that is the only reason I even came to this article some months ago. I would prefer that this article exist, and be NPOV and verifiable. If this article is going to be used by you to reignite the POV pushing of the past, then Houston, we have a problem, and an AfD may be the best solution. You can thank yourself for that.

I have worked with people who disagree with me to make this article more accurate. It was mostly fabrication before I came along, and I never "picked on" any little girls during that time.

<dd>Exactly what parts did you find to be "BIASED and POV?" It doesn't seem much different than what you were changing it to other than added information and attempts to insert even worse POV (if any existed in the first place). Okay, yeah, the article really sucked because (A) the subject is only nominally noteworthy and there is very little information about her available and (B) no one who gives a darn about her, her activities and her website gave a darn about improving the article. As for your goals, they are as obvious as the first day you started contributing to Wiki. You make broad and boastful proclamations about "fairness," "accuracy" and your devotion to Wiki guidelines, but you always end up contradicting it all. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinxmchue_0531.html" title="User:Jinxmchue">Jinxmchue</a> 04:40, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>The current section which Hwnmbn changed it to fails to be verified by the source provided. It seems to be original research. I believe the section above states the situation more accurately, and is better sourced, including a primary source of Ava's production. As an alternative way to resolve this, I propose that the "threats" section be completely removed from the article.

<li>The rules are STILL: Self-published sources (such as blog posts) may be used as primary sources in articles about the subject.

I don't know where you and Ben are getting this idea, but that is the fact. Blogs are not reliable sources to source claims about anything else, but they ARE appropriate to use as a primary source to document what and when the subject of an article said or posted, as long as authorship is not in dispute. If what you think the rule is was really the rule, then WP would be left with a great deal of unsourced information. If you still dispute this fact, then cite me chapter and verse of where this rule has changed. I already pointed out to Ben above where it is covered in current policy. If someone is telling you otherwise, then they are wrong.

The proof that there is a credibility problem happens to be a post that Ava made nearly a year earlier on POAC. This is all covered in the first two sections of this talk page from last August.

<p>My input, not that it was asked for is according to first party standards for sources, if its known and can be shown that the forum poster is the person in question, the post can be used to identify their views or statements. This has to be in a situation where the person can be identified. In this case if its her website she is posting on she will be noted as webmaster or admin etc. Thus allowing her to be identified, however if its on another site, where it can be someone faking to be her, that would not be appropriate. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 22:44, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did not write the "conflated" part, RichardJames444 did, after seeing my evidence that the Progressive article was factually flawed. In the interest of avoiding an edit war, he and I worked together. He wrote that part, and I left it at that. That editor was initially defending this article against my edits, until he realized that my concerns were valid. Go back in the edit history a page or two, and you will see what I am talking about. Also bear in mind that this all occurred last summer, when I was still a fairly green editor. I agree that it smacks of original research, but I was trying to be accomodating. If FAAFA would simply stop trying to find ways to attack me with things that I did not even write (or wrote in my user space long ago and left unfinished/unsourced) for just a few minutes, and go back and read this talk page, and look at the edit history, there would be a lot less frustration all around. I am really getting sick of the depth of bullshit being thrown at me. Almost all of my wiki time lately has been tied up with dealing with this guy. Nobody reads this article anyway, so you guys do what you want, and leave me out of it. If I see a problem, I'll pipe in. OK?

<dd>I was arguing against an irrelevant point you were pushing, which is that blog posts are NEVER allowable EVER. It really had nothing to do with the specifics of this article, but with the policy in general, which is not an unusual left curve to find oneself veering down when arguing with you. I simply reverted the section to a previous consensus version, which while containing some OR, at least had SOME kind of source to back it up. The text I was reverting from was OR, and had nothing backing it up. (Mentions of ongoing police investigations which were not found at all in the source cited. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ava_Lowery&amp;diff=89270571&amp;oldid=89266293" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ava_Lowery&amp;diff=89270571&amp;oldid=89266293" rel="nofollow">See diff</a>.) As I have stated repeatedly, I prefer the section not be there at all, considering the sourcing we have available. Why did you not have a problem with the part I removed in the above diff? Is is because you recruited that person to come here and help fight the neocon cabal while you were attacking and mocking WP policy, and personally attacking WP editors from off-wiki? I refuse to work with you any further, because you are constantly on the attack. You never stop. The last message you left on your talk page is a good case. You list a series of my "transgressions", yet nowhere in that list is there any actual violation of WP policy by me. But you do manage to admit to wikistalking an admin, and make disparaging remarks about him as well. I have never dealt with such a constantly combattive editor as you. No, you haven't improved at all. You've gotten worse. You've wasted way too much of my time, so while I may or may not respond further, it will not be because you "won" or scored some sort of point I can't refute, but because I refuse to be baited by you further. Now stop attacking me and engaging in pointless arguments, and get to work on improving this article. That would be a way to show improvement on your part. As I have already said, I am done editing this article for now. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 12:41, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(UI)TB, I see you just deleted my attempt to include sone 'criticism.' Perhaps I didn't paraphrase it perfectly. I watched the vid a couple more times, and it went like (referring to yearlykos) CL: "These bloggers played your clip on the jumbotron. Do you think they would have done that if you were 25... or 35?" CL also described the juxtaposition of the Christian hymm and injured Iraqi kids as 'almost flip'. Might that be appropriate to include? - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a> 07:12, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All this talk about Ava not being "notable" enough -- and all that stuff about an AfD -- is kind of silly; for better or worse, Ava Lowery has become a notable individual and will remain so for a while -- even after her animated productions fade from the public eye -- because of the symbol she has become to the anti-war movement as well as what she represents to public cyberspace.</dd>
<dd>That said, i think the business about the CU citation has gotten out of hand. Although the article was undeniably POV prior to FAAFA's entry, still it seemed as if on this particular point the issue had been settled. With the great changes that FAAFA has worked into the article already, the passage as it stands reads with *much* less bias. I don't understand why the wording cannot be re-worked a little bit around the rhetorical structure that had already been settled upon.</dd>
<dd>In other words, i think Crockspot on this point has a quite legitimate and supportable complaint. Witness:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Lowery's claims of having received death threats remain controversial. Emails given to reporters following the publication of WWJD, while vulgar, are not specifically threatening.<a href="http://www.progressive.org/mag_mc042406" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.progressive.org/mag_mc042406" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Documented death threats were made against Lowery in response to an earlier animation and were apparently conflated into an article discussing the right-wing response to WWJD<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:wL6jcVx9hcYJ:oldamericancentury.org/bb/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:wL6jcVx9hcYJ:oldamericancentury.org/bb/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Could easily be incorporated with FAAFA's edits, and changed to something like this:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The release of the "WWJD" animation spurred contentious public reaction.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Ms. Lowery received emails that were indisputably intimidating, and together with web postings expressed rhetorically vulgar, obscene, hateful and in some cases illegal and/or physically threatening intent (particularly with regard to a minor).<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></dd>
<dd>Yet Lowery's claims of having received death threats evoked controversy of its own.

<dd>Regardless, federal and local law enforcement agencies deemed it serious enough to launch investigations<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> which, as of December 2006, remained inconclusive.</dd>

<dd>There obviously need to be more citations here, but i don't see a problem with including the blog and thread in question; this is a biographical stub, and as such Ava's personal blog is relevant. Meanwhile, if the accusations and such were made on other blogs i'd remind everyone that those are likely to disappear into archives before too long, at which time new sources will need to be found anyway. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 09:51, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, i'm not entirely sure that "Ava's...spurred contentious public reaction" is, on its own, satisfactory. The whole reason she's notable now is because an awful lot of people also responded positively to her animations, no? But since this is under the "Threats" section, perhaps it would be o.k. to just say "Ava's...spurred contentious reaction amongst some political groups", or something like that.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 10:31, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do they still respond? Has she recieved news coverage since the past, if not its best to stick to whats documented. Also

<p>"Ms. Lowery received emails that were indisputably intimidating" sounds rather PoV.

<dd>According to some editors, it seems everything Ava Lowery does is under dispute, whether it be the extent,importance and longevity of her contribution to the anti-war cause, her "notability," the existence of threats against her, and if they DO exist, the severity and origin of said threats. If she were so insignificant, why expend so much time and energy disputing every one of these points? I contend attracting this much attention makes her notable in the eyes of those editors arguing against her notability. As for whether this wiki entry is relevant enough to stay, Ava Lowery is still making animations which are being seen, she is still being interviewed by print, radio, and television outlets. The "disputed" threats are under investigation by federal and state law enforcement agencies. My question is where and why did this "contentious" debate begin?

<p>Nope, I'm not saying she isn't notable, just the opposite. But now that I have you here... Over and above her body of work, her multiple national media interviews, her presence in the blogosphere, the intense reactions from some quarters, and the entry of law enforcement, what does she have to do to become "notable" in YOUR eyes?

I know that both editors do try to be NPOV here, but they cannot escape the selection bias of which articles they choose to "improve" or their history of having strong opinions on those subjects. I do not edit the George Bush article simply BECAUSE I know my own bias would lead me to a NNPOV selection bias no matter how seemingly NPOV my contribution would be. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 19:59, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ben, you know better than to make an accusation like that without being able to back it up. Unless you can provide a link to anywhere that I have ever referred to Ava as "Ava the liar", you have just violated <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. I have already stated that I will not edit the content of this article until you guys have worked something out. I have never had direct contact with Ava, and I don't even think that I ever posted to Ava's thread on CU. My opinion about her notability was based upon the content of the article at the time I expressed the opinion. The article did not assert her notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Now that many more sources have been added, the article does assert her notibility, and I no longer am making that case. I actually think this article is now vastly improved, and hope that you can all work together to come up with a truly neutral article. Now, I am pretty much out of it so PLEASE stop invoking my name in a negative way, or I will start making administrative complaints.

<dd>Working from memory. If you are not one of the ones who were chewing on this young lady in the "Ava The Liar" threads, then my sincere apologies.--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 21:28, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I appreciate the apology. Not everyone on CU walks in lockstep, and can be painted with a broad brush. I participated very little (if even at all) in the Ava or Andy threads. I do seem to remember some people even taking some shit from other CUers for being mean. While I may not have participated, I was well aware of what was going on, and what the real deal was. When I first found this article last summer, it was basically an OR hit piece aimed at conservatives in general (much like Andy's article was when I found it around the same time). I tried to insert balance, worked with another editor from the "other side", and struck a compromise that we both could accept. I was a green editor, and I was also compromising, so it wasn't a perfect article. But it wasn't an Ava hit piece either. I consider myself a pretty reasonable guy, but I won't stand by and allow people to use Wikipedia as their personal club to wield against their enemies. If an article was brought to my attention that was biased in the opposite direction, I would take (and have taken) the same action. You may not believe it, but I do try to be neutral on WP. As I admit on my user page, I realize that my biases may make me more likely to proactively seek out bias against conservatives, that is only human nature, and alot of editors and admins do it. Look at your own watch list. I'm sure you watch liberal articles for vandalism. BUT, I will try to get rid of unsourced bias and libel wherever I find it. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 21:40, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I *do* accept that you try to be neutral. It is unconscious selection bias that I wonder about. I have been consciously not editing articles about right wingers that I cannot stand because I know that no matter how neutral the content I would add would be, it would be content that could not be divorced from my selection of an article about a subject I find distasteful. This is why you will probably never see me editing <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Hannity_4353.html" title="Sean Hannity">Sean Hannity</a>.

<p>Wait a second, that makes no sense. So all Ben had to do is revert back, send them a sign he stand by his edits and make them go to the talk page? Is that what you are saying is the accepted protocol? Please excuse this wiki novice.

<dd>What I am saying is that when Ben reverted TBeatty, and then TBeatty reverted back, he should have taken that as a sign to use the talk page, not revert another time and tell TBeatty to use the talk page, its hypocritical. By reverting TBeatty again, he was starting a revert war, regardless of his request for talk page usage, since he decided not to use it himself.

<p>I only found this article while doing RC patrol. I've been watching this for the last several days and would like to add my own opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li>"she and her work have received <i>significant</i> media attention"</li>
<li>"She was the object of <i>considerable</i> conservative criticism"</li>
<li>"She is also a person of <i>considerable</i> interest in the blog world"</li>
</ul>
<p>These are subjective interpretations. For example, an op-ed in the NYT and a CNN interview don't count as significant media attention in my mind. Furthermore, I can't find these words used in the references (maybe I'm just dense). Perhaps we could just remove the adjectives?</p>
<p>As for the quotes that were reworked by Tbeatty, I don't understand why this was reverted. What do these quotes provide that cannot be provided by just summarizing them as Tbeatty did?</p>
<p>Finally, someone above asked about conservative criticism that has been published in a credible source. LexisNexis and Newsbank don't return anything.</p>

<dd>I agree about 'significant' etc.. I changed 'significant' to 'national' as CNN+ are national outlets. I deleted the other adjectives as suggested. I re-added the quotes. The NYT quotes descibes the VIDEO and is needed for an understanding of the content, that made her presentation' possibly the best'.

<p><b>Again...</b> I attempted to include sone 'criticism.' Perhaps I didn't paraphrase it perfectly. I believe Tbeatty deleted <i>"Carol Lin of CNN asked Ava in the BlogBuzz interview, <s>possibly rhetorically,</s> if Ava thought that some of her notoriety might be due to her young age more than anything else."</i> I watched the vid a couple more times, and it went like (referring to yearlykos) CL: "These bloggers played your clip on the jumbotron. Do you think they would have done that if you were 25... or 35?" CL also described the juxtaposition of the Christian hymm and injured Iraqi kids as 'almost flip'.

<dd>AFAIK there is no WP:CONFRONTATIONAL policy I may be breaking, or may have broken in the past. There are however WP:CIVIL, and WP:NPA, etc, and I am working dilligently not to break these. BTW, although I rarely edit there, I read the discussion concerning the '9/11 Attacks', and 'Allegations of US state terror' articles <b>every</b> day.

<p><i>"Carol Lin of CNN suggested that much of Ava's notoriety might be due to her young age. In regards to her appearance at the Kos Convention she asked. "These bloggers played your clip on the jumbotron. Do you think they would have done that if you were 25... or 35?". This point has been made by others as well. Lin also described the juxtaposition of the Christian hymm and injured Iraqi children in 'WWJD' as 'almost flip'."</i></p>

<dd>I guess it's a shortened version of 'flippant'. I've read/heard it used by others too. <i>"Flip: adjective glib; flippant"</i> We could add flippant in parenthesis after the quote. - <i>"...and injured Iraqi children in 'WWJD' as 'almost flip'."</i>(flippant) - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a> 23:08, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Here are the two quotes from Carol Lin&#160;:</p>
<p><i>"Ava, taking a Christian hymn and putting it to pictures of suffering Iraqi children -- what is it you're hoping to accomplish (?)-- because the disparity between the two -- it almost comes across as flip."</i></p>
<p><i>"These bloiggers played your clips on the jumbo screen at their big annual convention -- I mean in some ways do you feel you were being used by them by them -- because would they have done that if you were a 25 year old or 35 year old?"</i> I feel it's OK to remove the POV template. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a> 08:27, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the template again. Jinx added it, yet did not detail his specific objections as to why he thought the article POV, thus its addition was improper in the first place. He <b>did</b> object to 2 words, which he himself removed from the article. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ava_Lowery&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89824847" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ava_Lowery&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89824847" rel="nofollow">Link</a> These templates are 'serious business', and are not meant to replace discussing issues in talk.

<p>What follows below are instructions for using NPOV template:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>How to initiate an NPOV debate</b></dd>
<dd>If you come across an article whose content does not seem to be consistent with Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> policy, use one of the tags below to mark the article's main page. Then, on the article's talk page, make a new section entitled "NPOV dispute [- followed by a section's name if you're challenging just a particular section of the article and not the article as a whole]". Then, under this new section, clearly and exactly <i>explain</i> which part of the article does not seem to have a NPOV and why. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a> 00:20, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, no. I <i>RE</i>-added it after you inexplicably removed it along with another earlier edit. I didn't add it to the article originally and I don't know who did, but as far as I can tell, there was no reason for you to remove it without noting why. In fact, there <i>still</i> is no reason other than your faulty reason that I have not asserted non-neutrality in talk. So back it goes <i>again</i> and I will ask that it not be removed <i>again</i>. I would suggest asking the person who originally added it if you can take it out now. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinxmchue_0531.html" title="User:Jinxmchue">Jinxmchue</a> 04:26, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Shotwell noted, looks like it was Crockspot, so I'd ask him if he wants it removed or if he wants to pursue a NPOV discussion. My thoughts on the issue are that while the first section has improved considerably, the article remains of questionable POV. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinxmchue_0531.html" title="User:Jinxmchue">Jinxmchue</a> 05:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's <b>not</b> the way a NPOV template is to be used. The template is used <b>in conjunction</b> with explaining the specific reasons <b>in detail</b> of why the person adding the template feels the article or section is POV. I know some people on Wiki (not saying this applies to anyone here) think that templates are a fast easy way to cast doubt onto an article, but that's not their intended use. The whole section on 'alleged death threats' that Crockspot objected to isn't even in the article anymore. The continued presence of template without supporting documentation is a violation of WP. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a> 05:47, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That percentage of her article being quotes by another person is unenclyclopedic. Wikipedi is not a random collections of quotes by people. Use Wikiquote for that. For her biography, criticisms and praises should be summarized in a neutral and sourced way. There is no reason to quote anyone extensively in a biography especially if the quotations are not from the subject. Either the quotation can be summarized as a notable point of view or it cannot. Using quotes extensively makes it look like the back of a bad movie cover where all the praise is summarized as quotes from notable critic. Encyclopedia's don't have their articles assembled as a large percentage of quotations. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 02:22, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Funny Tbeatty - you had no probem adding BLP violating quotes that were <b>actually</b> from the back of a bad movie box cover (The Clinton Chronicles) when it suited <b>your</b> agenda! - but you do have a valid point about the amount of quoted material. I'll summarise the quotes from the NYTimes article and Carolyn Lin, Cindy Sheehan's quotes, being from a notable person in the same arena as Ava can stay. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">FaAfA</a> <a href="../../../f/a/i/User_talk%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_8a6a.html" title="User talk:Fairness And Accuracy For All">(yap)</a> 02:58, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not surprising that you A) mischaracterize this as being similar and B) don't udnerstand the difference between using a source as a fact about itself vs. quoting verbatim a third party source used as puffery. I didn't object to paraphrasing the Clinton Chronicles box. I objected to your wholesale removal of reliably sourced information under the guise of BLP. In this case, I paraphrased the praise by the subjects who were quoted. I am not sure why you find that objectionable. Look at the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ava_Lowery&amp;diff=114204781&amp;oldid=112155327" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ava_Lowery&amp;diff=114204781&amp;oldid=112155327" rel="nofollow">diffs</a>] and comment on what's objecionable to paraphrase? --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 03:06, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
