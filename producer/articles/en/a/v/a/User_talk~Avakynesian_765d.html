Dan, or "Fabricationary", or whoever is on here. I would like to ask why everyone is deleting the " Lord Strachan " Page? THIS IS NOT VANDALISM!!!! THIS IS TRUTH!

<p>Thank you Dan, here you are - Lord Robert Keith Strachan House of Lords - Heaton and Others (Respondents) v. Axa Equity ...Lord Strachan heard the twelve actions together and in April 2006 he gave judgment in all of them. The parts of his opinion dealing with liability and with age ... www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldjudgmt/jd020425/heaton-3.htm - 30k - I don't know if this is what you want, but it's some publicity about Lord Strachan. It's a website url. Thank you for your time, but, perhaps; If I give you the iformation and images and such for Lord Strachan, could you maybe make it? It shouldn't be that hard to find info, or images, but I already have them, so if I give you this stuff, perhaps could you do it? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvakynesian_aa02.html" title="User:Avakynesian">Avakynesian</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Avakynesian_2fb6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Avakynesian">contribs</a>) 04:48, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Would Tripod.co.uk be reliable? I mean, it's one of the leading in-style info sites in the UK today, but I assume you're American or Canadian? So there should be some mention on the News of him if you're Canadian?</p>

<dd>Tripod.co.uk is a free webhost, not a reliable news site. Provide a link to your teenaged Lord Strachan making news in BBCworld or the Associated Press, and then I'll believe in his existence and notability.

<p>Hey, Avakynesian, thanks for the tip. I just discovered how to copy and paste stuff so I made a personalized hompage, you should make one too, it looks blank and we don't know much about you.

<p>Thanks for having a look Avakynesian, the bossy thing, I agree, and it's very formal as well, we is all mates 'ere until someone starts bossing someone around. How was Windsor? Do you mean Windsor, ON or the one near Heathrow. How's the weather there? News here says the N Hemisphere is on a massive heat wave, it's midwinter here in Hastings and about 19°C and we're getting sick of it, must be nice where you are though.

<p>I see your userpage looks a lot like my userpage - in fact, as of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Avakynesian&amp;oldid=68048524" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Avakynesian&amp;oldid=68048524" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, it was an exact copy.

<p>Well I guess that saying is very true; but I basically copied your page because: 1) I don't know how to make a user page 2) I've basically got all of those interests and such (except Sailor Moon and American Idol) and 3) I speak some of those languages that you do; but not all. Infact; I don't know how all of the texts and stuff survived, as I deleted them off of my page earlier today, because I can't and won't take credit for all of the stuff you did, or the user page you created, but I needed something to start with, you know? I hope this was true and you do beleive in that. Otherwise, I suppose if you dislike what I did, you can just tell me and I take it off, but thank you for talking to me about it! User;Avakynesian</p>
