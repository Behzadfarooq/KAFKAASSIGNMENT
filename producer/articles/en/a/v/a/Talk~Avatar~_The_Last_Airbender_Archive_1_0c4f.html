<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dark Avatar theory</span></h2>
<p>Since this is just a theory posited by someone on a fan forum that likely has no basis (even if it <i>is</i> popular), is it really necessary to talk about it under the plot synopsis? I think generally fanon isn't listed on WP pages (via <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>).<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirogtheconq_2809.html" title="User:Virogtheconq">Virogtheconq</a> 19:14, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. This is an encylopedia, not a rumor mill. Furthermore, such theories do not describe the actual plot in the slightest, but rather state a fan's speculation of where the plot may head; theories most certainly should not be included in the show's Plot Synopsis. The "Dark Avatar" theory should be removed. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrototime_62d7.html" title="User:Prototime">Prototime</a> 21:35, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Page Quality</span></h2>
<p>The reference to Yuuyan Archers in the "Secondary Characters" section should possibly be removed as the "Yuuyan Archers" is simply a generic name for a group of fictional individuals, none of which have been given actual individual names, hence showing the ineligibilty of Yuuyan Archers to be considered a "secondary character".</p>
<p>The external references are arguably not NPOV as it merely points to fan sites (possibly added by the webmasters themselves to increase traffic?) and not a link to an official site by Nickelodeon or Viacom.</p>
<p>The episode summaries should also contain date when it was originally aired.</p>

<p>Hey everyone here! To answer your question first person who posted here, Avatar is currently on hiatus (is that how you spell it?) No new episodes till next year!&#160;:( Isn't that horrible! The next season has 22 episodes i think. Whoever did this page did a great job! Anyone who wants to discuss avatar did you know that nick.com has 5 message boards you can post on about avatar? Its fun stuff. My nickname (username on nick) is Zarfunkel by the way</p>
<p>HEy everybody its me Zarfunkel again and guess what?! I was absoulutley wrong. THe new season is this fall!!! Yay! 20 new episodes not 22 i think. Anyway I got this information off nick.com so it should be right!</p>
<p>The only thing this page needs is pics. RentACop 20:24, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>For some reason Nick hasn't been re-airing episodes from Fridays on Saturdays, but instead airs reruns. That makes it somewhat easier to miss episodes. --<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvice_796f.html" title="User:Evice"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɛvɪs/</span></a> <a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvice_f753.html" title="User talk:Evice"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/tɑːk/</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Evice_7d9a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Evice"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/kɑntɹɪbjuʃ(ə)nz/</span></a> 04:37, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The new season -- as in, second half of book 2 -- starts up in September, just like it did last year. And, just like the rumors spread last year, it does NOT start next year in January. Every Book has 20 episodes, no more or less. 68.171.240.254 14:40, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The word <b>Bender</b>, refering to one who bends, is always capitalized. Likewise, <i>Airbender</i>, <i>Earthbender</i>, <i>Waterbender</i>, and <i>Firebender</i> are always capitalized, and are one word each.</li>
<li>The act is <b>bending</b>, without capilization (unless it is the first word of a sentence). This would be <i>airbending</i>, <i>earthbending</i>, <i>waterbending</i>, and firebending.</li>
<li>Following these rules, <b>bends</b> and <b>bended</b> and other variations of the act of bending would not be capitalized.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Also found on Nick.com about <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badgermole.html" title="Badgermole">Badgermoles</a>:
<dl>
<dd>"These giant animals are a cross between a badger and a mole. Badgermoles use <b>Earthbending</b> to make tunnels and travel underground, where they hunt for prey and live. Badgermoles were the first <b>Earthbenders</b> -- they are blind but they use their Earthbending to feel the ground and "see". A little known fact about the <b>Badgermoles</b> is their love for music -- if the right music is played, you can get a <b>badger mole</b> to do just about anything."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As evidenced by this paragraph, Nick.com might not be the best source for canonical naming conventions -- it's riddled with inconsistencies, like "Badgermole" and "badger mole". I'd say that "[element]-benders" are <b>always</b> capitalized, but "[element]-bending" has been either, and I see more value and consistency in keeping it capitalized along with the people who perform the action.</dd>
<dd>As an appended rule, although it says "badger mole" above, I have seen "Badgermole" far more often. The rule should be to <b>always</b> capitalize hybrid animal names, and that the two animals names should be one <b>or</b> two words, as specifically evidenced in writing. However, names that do not consist of two animal names such as "Canyon Crawler" are most definitely two words.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>wait, why are we capitalizing all animal names? They are still just animals, I see no reason to capitalize their names for general use. As for when hybrid names are joined, *shurg*, I've got no call on that, I just mostly used the names AvatarSpirit let me use. Maybe there should be a larger rule about it. Some names, like badgermole, look good joined. Others, like buffalodeer, look better seperate.</p>
<p>As for earthbending, I vote that we keep it uncapitalized like an art form similar to painting, writing, ect. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> 06:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>By that logic, why capitalize Benders? "They are still just people, I see no reason..." I have <b>always</b> seen animal names capitalized where it is evident that the writer knew <i>Avatar</i> well, i.e. on most official sites/writings, etc. Where people have written it like "badger mole" above, they obviously wrote it all in lowercase because they were thinking of the animals <i>we</i> are familiar with in our world, which never are capitalized, and hence why the space was also added, because we consider them separate entities. But these are not our animals, they are different, otherworldly creatures we <i>aren't</i> familiar with, and thus we should use the name conventions that are provided for us. Again, currently on Nick.com's flash Avatar site, when viewing individual episode summaries, the "Creatures" section for each capitalizes <i>all</i> animal names, even both words when there are more than one. The first capital letter's importance could be argued, but the fact that the second word (when present) is also capitalized proves that capitalization should be canon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for spacing, yeah, it's up to how it looks and how they say. I wasn't really trying to make a definite rule out of it, as it might've seemed, but to say: "It's a definite rule that there is no rule." ^_^</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And you really think that we should have "<u>E</u>arthbender" but "<u>e</u>arthbending", when they're so similar at a glance? I think it'd get confusing and seem like the article needs copy-editing to readers who don't know about the series; we should stick to the same for both noun and verb. Since it's definitely "capital Bender", I'm swayed to capitalize the action, but I guess it <i>is</i> up to your personal preference... On that note, we should find out what others think about it in another talk section.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Where is Kyoshi Island?</span></h2>
<p>Where is Kyoshi Island in the Avatar world? I added it to the Earth Kingdom places, and was told that's not the right place for it. I re-watched the episode, and the characters are definitely dressed as Water Nation, but it was pulled from that page. I know they're not Fire Nation or Air Nomads. In which nation's territory does this island fall? <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELesoria_3a0f.html" title="User:Lesoria">Lesoria</a>, quite confused, 00:39, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is confusing. It seems to be a south Earth Kingdom Island, but from the dress it looks like it might have Water Tribes settlers in it's past.</p>
<p>The suggestion from Distant Horizons is that it is in the south either the white islands making it Air Nomad area or in the yellow islands near the main contanent making it Earth Kingdom territory. The text just says that it's a southern island somewhere.</p>
<p>My opinion is that it might be an Earth Kingdom land (Given the nature of the avatar from there) with Southern Water Tribes connection.</p>

<dd>Spot coloring of blue clothes do not a Water tribemember make. Katara didn't say anything about an island Water Tribe, after all. Of the nations, Earth Kingdom inhabitants are the most heterogenous in clothing and ethnic makeup. (remember the Great Divide? Yellow, white and brown) I'm inclined to view Kyoshi's green clothing, and her and the warror's square head-ornament motifs (Echoing those of Earth Kingdom troops) as marks of the southerly system of Eath Kingdom islands shown on the world map. There would be no snowless ground in the Poles, and Aang would be shrieking if they were Air Nomads.

<dd>All right, I'll add Kyoshi Island back to Earth Kingdom, with a note on the edit saying such about the card, but if anyone takes it off of there, I'll ignore it from there.

<p>no it does not it is a colany occupied by both it may be a agreemant from both nations to make one which water tribe people follow rthe rules of the water tribe and same for earth kingdom kind of like how washinton dc is made from maryland and virgina djf2014</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, Are you saying Avatar Kyoshi was born in a colony and centuries later it is a disputed colony? The Avatar has <i>one</i> native element.
<dl>
<dd>Disputed colony?... Southern Water Tribe is defenseless, Northern Water Tribe constintly on the defense, Earth Kingdom would not attack their own colony, Aang is the only known Air Nomad, and they have stayed out of the <i>Fire Nation's</i> imperialist war.

<dd>Ok, Avatar Day answered or did to a degree, the town was connected to a mainland with dry, Earth kingdom, environment until Avatar Kyoshi divided it from that mainland and created Kyoshi Island. So... I'll have you chose what it means for yourself. --Azaza767 00:35, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The section just lengthens the article to an absurd length. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 01:09, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Existing sites in the Wiki link listing for "Avatar: The Last Airbender" include informative fan pages, forums, screencaps, and art galleries. Distant Horizon just added an oekaki capability in the past few days. We've developed a fan service site (AvatarSpirit.Net<a href="http://www.avatarspirit.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.avatarspirit.net" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) which includes the above as well as topic-specific chat, complete episode transcripts, audio clips, and a php/mySQL-based crew/VA/character/episode database which allows easy identification of ALL crew involved in each episode and what role they played in each. The database includes plenty of fields to expand on our knowledge of each member of the crew, with integration into the whole. We also have staff educated in classical and asian history and are including articles drawn from this knowledge. I respect that Wikipedia is not a fanlisting, but I would respectfully request we be added to the short list given the unique content we're providing the Avatar fan base.</p>
<p>It should be noted our production credits are extensive and as complete as existing info allows. This might help with addressing the above topic.</p>

<dd>At the time you posted this message, we were being linkspammed by at least one user (a very frequent occurance, hence the disclaimer and totalitarian 'tude) so our standard links may not have been reflected.

I've gone over avatarspirit.net and it is quite impressive considering how much time it has been out. Your production credits are indeed extensive, but stil not quite enough content for right now.

<dd>The production credits are actually complete for every episode thus far, including the Season 2 premier, and crew content includes everything I've been able to find anywhere on the 'net including links to Bryan Konietzko's band and Bobby Rubio's comic. We've got transcripts for every episode save 1x11 and 2x01, which will be done shortly. The credits and transcripts are unavailable anywhere else and complement Wiki in areas where Wiki has chosen not to cover. Filling out our content we have screens for every episode, a range of audio clips, character bios (with links to episode descriptions and VAs), and episode descriptions (with links to all crew and characaters). The one area we're still 'under construction' is with merchandise, but Wiki has that pretty well covered. I was operating under the impression the justification for adding another fan site to the Wiki list would be that the proffered site provide content not covered already by either Wiki or another linked fan site. Our credits and transcripts accomplish that. We're still actively developing content, though. Please suggest what other content unavailable anywhere else would be useful and we'll see what we can do. Our goal is to be a service to the fans, and we're always open to ideas on how to better accomplish that. Thanks!</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Character Pictures</span></h2>
<p>I made an edit to put character pictures with the Major characters. However, it does need to be discussed first so I reverted it afterwards. Here is what I made and suggest we do something similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender&amp;curid=1620586&amp;diff=64935164&amp;oldid=64907008" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender&amp;curid=1620586&amp;diff=64935164&amp;oldid=64907008" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender&amp;curid=1620586&amp;diff=64935164&amp;oldid=64907008</a> Katara's picture would need to be changed and her summary lengthened a bit. Please discuss, I know one of our reasons for not making featured article before was lack of pictures. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> 22:46, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I like that version. Keep in mind, however, that the ultimate way the page displays depends on the browser, system resolution, etc., so it's not necessary to put the large number of spaces between Katara's and Sokka's paragraphs (even if the former is a tad lean). <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirogtheconq_2809.html" title="User:Virogtheconq">Virogtheconq</a> 23:08, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Though it looks more dynamic to have alternating images (left, right, left, etc.), I think it would be much neater in this case to have them all on the right. Possibly without the frame, too. Just shrink it and don't use the <b>thumb</b> keyword. --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrisu_ca1c.html" title="User:Crisu">Crisu</a> 02:53, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So we are for it as long as we fix the formatting of how to display it? Katara's picture would need changing and her summary lengthed and am I the only one that doesn't like Aang's current picture? If we green light it I'll change add it back. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> 05:30, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I like the idea. I do agree that the frame on the pictures is unnecessary, and am unsure about whether the pictures should alternate positions or be aligned on the right (I'd have to see both versions first), and what pictures themselves should be used can be discussed, but as far as the actual idea goes, I'm all for it. It definetley helps to spruce up the page a bit. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrototime_62d7.html" title="User:Prototime">Prototime</a> 05:54, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also like the idea, although Katara's needs to be a little longer to prevent from running into Sokka's paragraph as has been said previously. I know hers used to be longer but someone shortened it. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedsparta_08a2.html" title="User:Redsparta">redsparta</a> 06:17, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added the pictures. However, the following might need to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean-Up of all the summaries so that they are mostly equal in length (I really have no idea what else to add to Katara, I tried)</li>
<li>New Picture for Katara and possibly Aang, Sokka, and Iroh (who should be listed as General Iroh IMO)</li>
<li>Decide on formatting. I looked at all left and alternating and I have no opinion either way.</li>
<li>Increase the picture size?</li>

It does look a bit lopsided with a big Sokka bio and a small Azula one, but once they even up (H2P's first suggestion), then I think it'll look great. I second the "new pic for Katara" idea.

Why are you doing this? –<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrototime_62d7.html" title="User:Prototime">Prototime</a> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPrototime_2eb0.html" title="User talk:Prototime">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Prototime_0748.html" title="Special:Contributions/Prototime">contribs</a>) 18:01, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ok, 1. Fyre, you arent one of the 3, so dont worry. 2. Proto, that was not the one I was bringing up. I believe, well, I know, it was on a different page. Just a respons that I got. And it has been delt with. But, since yo brought it up, quick question for you: Why did you have to open up a whole new page, saying that I had no show-info? When I even told the episodes that I got my info from. 3. As to why, well, come to my original topic first. It was only to a topic that was replied to, in a rude way. But as I said, it has been taken care of, by the person I had the problem with. ~Sayasha</p>
