<p>Any reason you keep changing the stuff i'm doing on Porridge? I mean, I'm doing the bulk of the work (let's face it, the information on porridge was unfairly small before I got started on it), and you just keep chipping in and undoing my work. I'm not getting indignant over this. I appreciate that this is an unfortunate side effect of the nature of the site, but please, have a bit of consideration next time that when you're messing around with a newly changed site, it may still be a work in progress. For example, I fully intend to complete all the cast and characters still in red within the next few days. Cheers. --<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 21:05, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought it best to remove the quote taken from the BBC web site as it was probably substantial enough to be a copyright violation. There were also lots of typos, which I thought uncontroversial changes, and other standard copyedits for readability. I can see why you'd be unhappy at my delinking the characters; sorry about that. I didn't believe they would be worthy of separate articles. It's hard to tell when someone has "finished" editing... As you say, it's the nature of the beast, I don't mean to tread on your toes. -- <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvaragado_c759.html" title="User:Avaragado">Avaragado</a> 22:07, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Avaragado,</p>
<p>I have noticed that whilst copyediting <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Tomlinson_e719.html" title="Chris Tomlinson">Chris Tomlinson</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Rawlinson_0d12.html" title="Chris Rawlinson">Chris Rawlinson</a> you have removed the non-breaking space referred to in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Style_for_numbers.2C_weights.2C_and_measures" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Manual of Style</a> and removed a couple of sentences. Personally I think that the removal of the year subsections makes the page more difficult to look at. I can't really see any gain in your edits except that you added to your number of edits?<a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScraggy4_3045.html" title="User:Scraggy4">Scraggy4</a> 17:53, 31 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I hadn't spotted that entry in the manual of style - thanks for the note. The Rawlinson article originally included, for example, "110&amp;nbsp m" - which is interpreted by browsers as "110" then a non-breaking space then a breaking space then "m". The correct way to do this is "110&amp;nbsp;m" - note the semicolon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To me, year subsections seemed visually cluttering. The year of the achievement is already present in the name of the championships, so no information has been lost.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe my copyedits improved the articles. If I were concerned only with my number of edits then I'd spend all day editing my own User page rather than trying to improve other people's articles. -- <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvaragado_c759.html" title="User:Avaragado">Avaragado</a> 21:38, 31 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Seeing as you were once previously interested in a naming convention, I'd like to invite you to vote on adoption of <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28television%29_fd20.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television)</a>. Voting is taking place on the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28television%29_2a37.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (television)">Talk page</a> and ends on Sep 13 2004. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> 23:26, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your comment raised a concern in my mind. When this was being discussed before, the majority felt that (TV series) was the best dismbiguator. This is the last edit made before the convention was written - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28television%29&amp;oldid=5314018" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28television%29&amp;oldid=5314018" rel="nofollow">Aug 17th</a> - so take a look at the vote and discussion sections and see if you agree. I've left a comment back on the vote page, but your vote seems not based on your actual preference, but because you perceive a group needs to re-visit it. If so, then I'd ask you to let the vote itself determine the convention's merits and decide consensus. For that to work, though, everyone needs to vot only on it's merits in their mind. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> 13:51, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Athletes should go in British category as they normally compete under Great Britain. Similarly, rugby players should go under England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, snooker players go under English, Scottish Northern Irish, Irish, etc, otherwise it is nationalist POV. This is no information loss as place of birth and details of competition in Commonwealth Games (the only place where athletes compete under different flags) can be put in the main text. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc_Harris</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 18:45, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

As do tennis players. To do otherwise may be construed as nationalist POV, and doing it this way keeps them together, since they compete under the same flag, and thus makes the categorisation simpler. As it happens, there were only about 5 Welsh athletes and a similar number of Scots, and it's hardly worth categorising them separately. As a compromise, it might be possible to put the athletes atleast into coutries because that's how they compete at the Commonwealth games, but they do that very rarely <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc_Harris</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 19:32, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Scottish athletes do not normally compete under Scotland. Therefore, they should be categorised under British. This makes all those who compete under the same flag appear on the same list, hence making it simpler. You perhaps have a marginal case for having them in both, but certainly not just the Scotland category. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc_Harris</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 19:54, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello all - my FIFA data-mining program is now nearing completion - I have already used it to post a complete article which details all of the matches invovled in <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_2006_-_European_Qualification_Groups_ecd5.html" title="Football World Cup 2006 - European Qualification Groups">Football World Cup 2006 - European Qualification Groups</a>. I can post articles of equal detail for each confederation with ease now.</p>
<p>I am debating with myself as to whether I should go one step further and give each match it's own report - complete player listings, substitutions, yellow/red cards, goal scorers, names of referee and other match officials&#160;; 85 percent of the program to do exactly that is written...</p>
<p>Let me know what you think of the article I have posted for the European qualifiers - if there is any way in which it can be improved/tweaked.</p>
<p>I look forward to receiving any feedback you can offer. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphod_Beeblebrox_d699.html" title="User:Zaphod Beeblebrox">Zaphod Beeblebrox</a> 09:45, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there - thank's for your input on the qualification layouts&#160;; I do think that it needs to be wiki-fied&#160;; I wrote my original version in pretty much raw HTML simple because that was the format I was most comfortable with - the tweaks you've suggested in your revision look very good indeed - I think a splash of colour in the headers to bring the entire page to life - a very nice touch indeed.</p>
<p>I've been busy looking at other (non-wiki!) activites for the last couple of weeks, but should be able to spend some time on this at the weekend. One thing in particular I am interested in doing is a more details (maybe 6-10 line) match report for each match, listing starting team/bench, any substitions made, goal scorers, yellow/red cards, match officials, etc Should not be difficult, as FIFA have all this stuff on their website - Have maybe 20 to 25 of these on a single page to keep it down to a managable length. Will prepare a sample page to show you what I am thinking about - and again, feel free to make suggestions for improvements.</p>
<p>So - in short, nice work on the design - I'll work on implementing that (and a lot more) at the weekend...</p>

Since you are among the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits_8bec.html" title="Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by number of edits">top 1000</a> Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at <i>minimum</i> those on the geographic articles. Over 90% of people asked have agreed. For More Information:</p>

</ul>
<p>To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the "<b>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</b>" template into their user page, but there are other options at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_namespace_f54f.html#Licensing_Templates" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User namespace">Template messages/User namespace</a>. The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Option 1</b></dd>
<dd>I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:</dd>
<dd>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>OR</b></p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Option 2</b></dd>
<dd>I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below:</dd>
<dd>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</dd>
</dl>
<p>Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain, you could replace "<b>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</b>" with "<b>{{MultiLicensePD}}</b>". If you only prefer using the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, I would like to know that too. <i>Please let me know</i> what you think at my <b><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk page</a></b>.

<p>I just wanted to send along my thanks for your work on the Cultural References section in the Dad's Army page. You cleaned it up quite nicely and it reads much better (especially from the way that I started it). I'm finding it fascinating to watch the way things unfold and evolve here at Wikipedia so, again, thanks and cheers. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnetteD_5345.html" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnetteD_a71f.html" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 19:14, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And in addition thanks for cleaning up the bits I have blitzed. I was listening to Howard Jones' "What is love" at the time, on repeat, and his bewitching synthesiser music made me lose track of time, space, and ultimately coherent thought. Magnificent fellow, Howard Jones. His music gets better the more you listen to it. I have been listening to it for six hours straight, now... the same song, "What is love". It makes a lot more sense, now, after six hours. But I am only beginning to understand what he was getting it, with those three simple words. <i>What is love? Baby, don't hurt me - don't hurt me, no more</i>. Surprisingly up-to-date sound for a single released in 1984, too.-<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 20:34, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some guy - ragusan is the handle - has edited the text you entered a few years ago about Lloyd entering Kosovo. Given the comment he makes I assume he is some sort of ultra serbian nationalist.</p>
