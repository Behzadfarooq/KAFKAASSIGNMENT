<p><a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome%2C_newcomers_06aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers">Welcome</a> to Wikipedia, Avalon! My name is Ryan, aka <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcetic_Acid_31d1.html" title="User:Acetic Acid">Acetic Acid</a>. I noticed that you were new and haven't received any messages yet. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first, since it uses different formatting than other sites that use <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_4c4a.html" title="HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascading_Style_Sheets_981c.html" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</a>. In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:</p>

</ul>
<p>There are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAcetic_Acid_8f87.html" title="User talk:Acetic Acid">talk page</a>. Please be sure to <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">sign your name on Talk Pages</a> using four tildes (~~~~) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right?&#160;:)</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. We can use all the help we can get! Have a nice day. Sincerely, <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcetic_Acid_31d1.html" title="User:Acetic Acid">Ryan</a>. 12:44, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I had a similar problem and made my own which you may prefer to the one currently on your page in terms of colours.

<p>Hi Avalon. When one comes across an article that appears to be un-encyclopædic or un-intelligible, it should be proposed for deletion. This is done under a process called <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">Vfd</a> or <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">Votes for deletion</a>. Only articles and some Wikipedia-space pages are deleted under Vfd. <a href="../../../t/m/_/WP%7ETM_6db7.html" title="WP:TM">Templates</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_4162.html" title="Wikipedia:Images">images</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategory_37f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Category">categories</a> are deleted via <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">Tfd</a>, <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">Ifd</a> and <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">Cfd</a> respectively. Some pages qualify for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion</a>, including inappropriate or vanity articles. However, it is best to use that process only if you are familiar with what qualifies for speedy deletion.</p>
<p>Deletion can be quite an emotive issue on Wikipedia as it can only be carried out by <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Administrators</a> and is in most cases irreversible. At present, Vfd is having quite a polarising effect, with Wikipedians forming "like-minded" groups such as the Inclusionists, the Deletionists and the Mergists. Generally, I shy away from Vfd lest I become involved in one of the more controversial deletions. I typically only voice my opinion on Australia-related Vfd's. However, don't let this perturb you. The great majority of deletions pass without even a smidgen of discontent.</p>
<p>But I digress. To get back to your query, I have nominated <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayserispor.html" title="Kayserispor">Kayserispor</a> for deletion (see <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPages_for_deletion_Kayserispor_2cb1.html" title="Wikipedia:Pages for deletion/Kayserispor">Wikipedia:Pages for deletion/Kayserispor</a> to vote). It might have qualified for speedy deletion, but foreign language pages on this English Wikipedia are best put to Vfd with the hope that someone can translate them.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 09:00, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looking at my watchlist, it seems my explanation of Wikipedia deletion procedures was un-necessary: I see you've voted several times already&#160;;-).

<p>Hello, I'm reasonably new to Wikipedia and I'd like to ask you a question.</p>
<p>You wrote/made(?) the Category: Orders of knighthood in Jan 05. I think it ought to be divided into sub-categories by nation. Two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Fully agree <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESaga_City_3d30.html" title="User:Saga City">Saga City</a> 08:59, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>How do I do it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvalon_8adf.html" title="User:Avalon">Avalon</a> 00:42, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I only know the one way, and it may not be the <i>approved</i> way as I find the guidance pages here almost incomprehensible, however as it works I'll set it out:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Find an order of knighthood for country XYZ and put it into a category called Orders of knighthood of XYZ. As the category does not (yet) exist it will be red-linked. Click on the red-link and create the new category in the same way as you create new . Your new category's entry may minimally include only 2 categories itself namely Orders of knighthood by nation <b>and</b> XYX. At the first time Orders of knighthood by nation will itself be redlinked. All you need to do is create that as a category is put Category:Orders of knighthood into it to link it the one I created back in January.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>By the way, I'd only been contributing to Wikipedia for about six weeks then, so don't let being new discourage you. I did some sorting out the categories for awards and decorations and this was part of it.</p>
<p>Let me know it works (or doesn't work) <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESaga_City_3d30.html" title="User:Saga City">Saga City</a> 08:59, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am appalled at your claim: "Australians are so supine you can do anything to them." I challenge you to a duel at 40 paces. You have choice of weapons. Maybe the <a href="../../../m/e/e/Wikipedia%7EMeetup_Melbourne_d848.html" title="Wikipedia:Meetup/Melbourne">Wikipedia:Meetup/Melbourne</a> would be the appropriate venue.</p>
<p>I also notice that you "practice" law. Is that the accepted spelling of the verb "practise" in Australian legal circles these days, or are you simply lying down like a good supine Australian and letting the Americans walk all over you, or are you too apathetically Australian to know or care about the difference, or ... (please insert alternative explanations here). Cheers <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 07:17, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/a/User_talk%7EAvalon_16fa.html" title="Edit section: Titled people on LoPbN">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Titled people on LoPbN</span></h2>
<p>Thank you for your diligent efforts at adding titles like Lord and Sir in <a href="../../../l/o/p/LoPbN_8d81.html" title="LoPbN">LoPbN</a>. Sometimes such a title is the quickest way for a user to be sure which among similarly named persons they are after.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is in general important to realize that the list, like many of those on WP, exists for the purpose of navigation rather than information. It is a list of people with biographical articles (or for whom there is a reasonable hope of bios being added). It is absolutely <i>not</i> a reference for information on the correct forms of names. (That worthwhile info has its proper place in WP: primary name for a person is part or all of the title of their bio, and other correct names, and erroneous but common ones, appear in the body of a good bio, where there is plenty of room for information on how good or bad those versions are.)</p>
<p>In particular, in a LoPbN entry, the piped version (what is to the right of the vertical-line character inside the link markup) of a name that includes a surname must have the parts of the name in the order used for alphabetizing that entry. A dramatic case could be Jim ap John, who could well have (since the use of "ap" is so little understood) three entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>ap John, Jim among the Ap names</li>
<li>Jim ap John among the Ji names</li>
<li>John, Jim ap among the Jo names</li>
</ul>
<p>Which versions of the name are right or wrong is completely irrelevant to LoPbN: they are there solely to get both the expert reader and the clueless ones to the article, where everything can be made clear without its explication getting in the way of the navigational task.</p>
<p>Your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_by_name:_At&amp;diff=27596732&amp;oldid=25709354" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_by_name:_At&amp;diff=27596732&amp;oldid=25709354" rel="nofollow">edit of the At names</a>, like many (at the least) of your LoPbN contributions miss this point.<br />
"*<a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Attenborough_a7cb.html" title="Richard Attenborough">Richard, Lord Attenborough</a>" may not appear among people named "Att..." thru "Atw..." bcz that version of his name makes him a person named "Ric...". (Tho, BTS, that version of his name cannot appear on <a href="../../../r/i/c/List_of_people_by_name%7E_Ric_81b3.html" title="List of people by name: Ric">Ric</a> |, bcz anyone misguided enough to look up a modern title-bearer that way will quickly see that we do not let such formality interfere with access, and take the obvious stop of looking under "Att...".)</p>
<p>A little less disruptively, "*<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Attenborough_e6b7.html" title="David Attenborough">Attenborough, Sir David</a>" should be "*<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Attenborough_e6b7.html" title="David Attenborough">Attenborough, David, Sir</a>", for the same reason that no one will look for him under D or S: the surname is indipsensible in identifying him; the next step is not to separate the knighted Attenboroughs from <i>hoi polloi</i>, but Davids from all other given names, and then finally the Sir Davids from the other Davids. "Attenborough, Sir David" is harmless as to its effect <i>on that page</i>, but it is unacceptably harmful in undercutting the confidence that Sir David Jones will be found before, and not after, Samuel Jones.</p>
<p>As i say, though, there's no question in my mind that the information you're adding is good; i don't want to discourage you. Thanks.<br />

<p>_ _ Well. I wrote you with the hope that your edits reflected simply bold editing: shooting from the hip &amp; getting a change out there where it can act as a concrete example to stimulate discussion of what is or isn't productive. (This process is inefficient, but crucial to the underlying concept of WP.) That working assumption underlay what i chose to say: my description of part of the consensus that i started working within two years ago, about how the list should work. (The experience of my edits on the list and its infrastructure -- edits numbering in the thousands, i'm sure -- has, BTW, only strengthened my confidence in that basic approach.)<br />
_ _ In replying, you begin</p>
<dl>
<dd>I cannot accept your contentions.</dd>
</dl>
<p>as if you were closing, not opening a discussion. You continue, ambiguously but troublingly,</p>
<dl>
<dd>I note you do not support them with any Wikipedia guidelines.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You have thereby described a fact. It's a fact that is irrelevant to the discussion i was (&amp; am still) trying to start (although my initial heading left my intent merely implicit).<br />
_ _ The new heading i've added above makes it explicit: it's worth asking what will work well. That's what i gave you my informed opinion about, seeing that as leading into a collegial discussion. (And one thing an ethical jurist learns is to recognize situations when conciliation serves a common interest that may be harmed by rushing into explicit clarity about who has what unilateral power of resolution. In fact, lest i stifle that process, i'll forgo speculating here about why your agenda gave explicitly documented practice such high priority.) And while your response led me twd some sense that we were in two different discussions, that could be wrong, and i think i can set all of that aside for now.<br />
_ _ It's probably worth my assuming you considered responding more directly to my logic. (E.g., i wish i had some sense of the extent that you agree or disagree with me, that this is about navigation and that <i>conveying</i> information (about correct names and the like) can be left to the bio articles.) You may well have found the stress of my verbal style too great an impediment. (One extremely hostile editor has described me, with some justice, as a "grammatical hurricane". I'm sympathetic, tho i'm not very good at making it easier to follow me.)<br />
_ _ You made two closely related points that seem fertile ground to me. One was</p>
<dl>
<dd>...“Bloggs, John, Sir” simply looks clumsy.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, yes, of course, though i thought i had adequately disposed of any relevance of that fact in my (as yet unchallenged) focus on navigation. In any case, you were good enough to let me know that we agree about the <i>order</i> entries should have relative to each other, which is very helpful. (BTW, i find you astute in pointing out <i>both</i> the orders of name elements you do for Bloggs; i considered only one order -- e.g., in my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_by_name:_Bur&amp;diff=27421373&amp;oldid=27417883" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_by_name:_Bur&amp;diff=27421373&amp;oldid=27417883" rel="nofollow">edit (re R.F. Burton)</a>, soon after the first reversal of yr work re "Sir" that i made a non-default summary for. FWIW, i have not yet found any reason for significantly preferring one over the other. [smile])<br />
_ _ But i digress. You made "clumsy" sound like an esthetic concern, but the word's underlying sense is about inefficiency of action.</p>
<ul>
<li>I <i>am</i> concerned, on reflection, about what i'll call the 3rd of these 3 elements of navigation:
<ol>
<li>Mobility is built into the server &amp; browser: following lks &amp; scrolling move you around in the data.</li>
<li>Directional guides: the indexes at the tops of LoPbN pages, and the ToCs on all the medium to large pages, provide sign posts that get you closer to a small group of entries; then the entries themselves support homing in, visually, on the entry you came looking for.</li>
<li>What i would compare to the nameplate next to the doorbell, i.e., the means of <i>confirming</i> that you've reached your destination.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I think (my) "many commas" format is IMO the <i>least</i> clumsy means of seeing which direction to move the eye next, in each of the several times (per entry sought) that the user unconsciously glances up or down. My new concern is that that format neverhtheless leaves a clumsy final mental step (one-time per entry sought) for the user to go through. That is to say, if we're talking about your General Sir John Bloggs, it is ideal, for that final step, to have the name there in (your) "no added commas" order, i.e. in exactly the order used in this sentence; in contrast, the many-commas format forces the user to permute "Bloggs, John, General Sir" back into the doorbell nameplate version, possibly via a little of trial and error. Unfortunately, having it in the no-extra-commas order (or to be precise, having the <i>neighboring</i> entries in that order) multiplies the (unconscious) processing that must be done as the user homes in on Bloggs, by glancing at Bloags and Blongs entries, and then at, say, Blogge and Blogguman entries. (If that really is completely uncompelling to you, we can talk more explicitly about the cognitive psychology and the implicit binary search algorithm that i see as inherant to the process.)</li>
<li>For me, the current bottom line is that you've drawn my attention to the hypothetical value of having a no-extra-commas version in the entry, for that final third element, but i can't imagine how it can make up for the <i>loss</i> of efficiency from giving up the advantages of many-commas format on the repetitive second element. And, nevertheless, i'm tantalized by the possibility of replacing the 2nd element by something <i>other</i> than the many-commas formats in the entries. Take a look at <a href="../../../w/v/-/List_of_people_by_name%7E_Wv-Wz_bf98.html" title="List of people by name: Wv-Wz">List of people by name: Wv-Wz</a>, rather than my describing it, and if you want a few more examples (some larger), follow lks from <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_Argus_for_LoPbN_Templates_54bb.html#Pilot_pages" title="User:Jerzy/Argus for LoPbN Templates">User:Jerzy/Argus for LoPbN Templates#Pilot pages</a>. I am imagining the section hdgs &amp; lk-less text lines providing element 2, and converting the lk'ed lines (bio entries) to no-extra-commas format to optimize the 3rd element.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>_ _ The other "fertile" thing you said is</p>
<dl>
<dd>See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_people_2caf.html" title="List of English people">List of English people</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>which (at the risk of being a smart aleck) makes me want to say "See <a href="../../../b/r/o/List_of_people_by_name%7E_Brow_6ba4.html#Brown.2C_John" title="List of people by name: Brow">List of people by name: Brow#Brown, John</a>". I did look at the English list (which is not a list of people by name, but a couple dozen quite small lists by name, and one four-screenish list of Eng. authors by name). It looks quite workable to me, with the possible exception of the authors: those authors have the only list that remotely begins to hint at a question that is crucial to the ones you are raising:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Is this list scalable?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>LoPbN has gone thru 2 levels of metamorphosis whose evidence survives; perhaps it started as 26 pages of names and an index, or perhaps there have been 3 metamorphoses. Each metamorphosis reflects the previous non-scalable design reaching its limits. (Someone counted the names as being in the low 20 thousands, about 15 months ago, with probably less than 10% increase in pages (to abt 670 now), tho i guess the numbers are not very useful. In any case my expectation is that it's still scalable for a good while yet, but there could be a surprise in store for me. In contrast, IMO the List-of-English-people format is (unless its growth is stagnating) awaiting the breakdown in usefulness that will be resolved in its first metamorphosis.<br />
_ _ Your suggestion to consult that list makes me think that you haven't really grasped the difference between the 100 or 125 writers and lists two or three orders of magnitude larger. The John Brown section is AFAIK unique so far, but i don't believe we are anywhere near the goal of getting all bios lked from LoPbN, so i take no bets. In any case, "enough quantity means a change in kind", and i urge you to look at that page on one hand, and on the other hand, at LoPbN sections of 15 to 25 names where all the names have several letters in common but no more than two or three people share any one surname. I think you'll get some feel for the human-factors element of the scaling problem.<br />

<p>Hi. Have you checked the "text size" setting in your internet browser? It's quite easy to change this accidentially. For instance, in Internet Explorer you can change the text size setting by holding Ctrl down while you roll your mouse's scroll wheel. In Internet Explorer, go View - Text Size and select "Medium". I'm not sure what to do in other browsers, though.</p>
<p>If that doesn't fix your problem, try clearing you cache, as you may have a corrupted version of the site's CSS file. Hold down Ctrl on your heyboard and click "refresh" or "reload" when you're viewing a Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>Well thats TV for you... i mean to be truly honest as far as i know he didnt actually stay in the original cottage as much as the show would have you belived... it was used more as a set the a family home.. He has raised his family in Dorset but i think they have been at the house/farm a lot longer than you'd think. For the most part Hugh appeared at the cottage only for filming purpouses and left the rest of the maintainence to be done by his lackys. The same can be said for his RCHQ (which was originally my families Dairy Farm) though he would appear for some filming and at occasional events for the most part it was his set of cooks, groundkeepers, and stockmen that kept the thing running (even i looked after the polytunnels and the animals, and i also did parking at the events) --- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulley_2f3a.html" title="User:Paulley">Paulley</a> 11:48, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was surprised to see an Australian contribution to the talk on million / thousand million / milliard debate in the Talk page for the “Long and Short Scales” entry , and further surprised to see that some Australians long for the days of yore when “milliard” held sway. I added two contributions there which I have appended here “for your perusal” as I believe it is proper to say. I too am an Australian, and while not a Monarchist, I am not particularly anxious to see the Queen go, as I believe that the ascension of Charles and Camilla will accomplish that in due course. Neither I am particularly a Yankophile, although I do find it puzzling when sentiments like yours concerning allegedly slavish adherence to American trends are broached. We are, it appears to be solely slavish to British customs and traditions. The notion that Australia is simply incapable of generating custom or tradition of its own is so pravalent that most of Australian cultural life outside of sport is effectively paralysed. As a small example, consider some idiomatic names for currency before 1966, Prior to that time, Australians happily spoke of a tray (for a threepence), a zac (for a sixpence), a bob (for a shilling), and a quid (for a pound)- even if all these were imported British idiom. Decimal currency was introduced in Australia in 1966, and 41 years later there is not a single familiar term for any of the new coins or notes. Why not? Because Australians have been taught that unless we are TOLD what to say or do by or overseas betters, then we would simply be “up ourselves” if we were to invent words, or phrases.</p>
<p>American culture has to its credit Edgar Allen Poe, Emily Dickensen, Walt Whitman, Herman Melville and many others, who cannot be matched by any Australian writers. This fact alone renders it risible that we are exhorted to turn away from American custom. We could do well to learn from American manners and mores concerning invention on every level. Here's an example of what I am driving at. Contrary to popular opinion, the term ketchup or ketsup is not a stupid American whimsical name for tomato “sauce”. Ketchup comes from the East Indies, as the Indonesian sound of the word would suggest. It was a spicy condiment that gained currency in the Old Dart. The popularity of the new world fruit the tomato, soon meant it became an ingredient in these traditional condiments, and thus: “tomato ketchup”. As you see, the term has a long, interesting and immaculate pedigree. On the other hand, “tomato sauce” has the characteristic Australian hestitancy to ever come up with a new word for a new thing, lest someone tell us to “pull our head in”. “Sauce” covers a large and ambiguous field. It could concievably refer to a paste, a puree, or a number of other sauces. Yet the simple and practical use of the word ketchup brought howls of dismay from those who thought we were “slavishly following” American foolishness. The same goes for “French Fries”, which true-blue Aussies must patriotically avoid. Indeed, we are expected to keep referring to “chips”. That would be fine, except the same word is used for what otherwise are called “crisps”. Then, in order to avoid the “french fry”, and in order not to appear like a “galah” in coining a new word, we must rely on “hot chips” and “cold chips”, which must certainly go some way to displaying the lack of daring and imagination that so afflicts our culture.</p>
<p>A patriotic Australian friend of mine, who is also gifted musically, recently told me he had always been puzzled as to what happened to musical culture in Australia. In the maligned nation of the US, they invented Jazz, Country and Western, Tin Pan Alley, Soul, Gospel, Bluegrass, Rock and Roll etc. New variants keep emerging: Disco, Rap, Hip Hop... Now, whatever happened to Australian music? There is just a giant gaping hole there. And yet a significant portion of our early white residents were Irish convicts, and Ireland is renowned for its folk music. I would venture to say that what happened to this strain of potential culture is what happened to just about everything else in Australian history. The pursuance of such a musical tradition might be seen to remind us of our convict heritage,and so was quickly and forcibly buried. In fact, instead of trying to build a new and vigorous culture on our British roots, the call came that we should be “more British than the British”. This can best be seen in the University of Sydney' s motto: “Sidere mens eadem mutato”: or “the same knowledge under a different Heavans”, a notion so lacking in ambition or gumption that its pursual would have meant that no new knowledge from research or otherwise could ever come into being, as it would not then he the “same knowledge” as that of the parent country. I do not know if there has been much study of pre-Federation Australia, but it appears to me that there was a radical and innovative element to it – and with quite some sympathy for the American Revolutionary experience, their Bill of Rights, and their passion for democracy. All this was largely smothered with the advent of Federation, when a fully lickspittle adoration of all things British came into force. It had that special feature of all reactionary colonial outposts of imperial powers. The colony began to believe that the Mother Country was the absolute epitome of all virtues, and any deviance from them was at best churlish, at worst, treacherous. As such, Australians would be standing up for the National Anthem (not our own of course) in cinemas across the land, even when the practice had, somewhat embarrassingly, been discontinued in the Mother Country.</p>
<p>I should not be misunderstood as denigrating the values of the British Way. I do however, think that the kind of loyalty that you show towards it goes beyond anything reasonable and useful. It is boundless and partisan support which has no question at all about the value of ANY aspect of British history or tradition, and allows for so very little indigenous development of our own culture. It is precisely this attitude that saw children of my generation being taught that Australian history outside of its glorious compliance to British demands at Galipolli, were affairs best forgotten, that Australian letters and poetry were intrinsically inferior to anything written in the Old Dart. Gradually, Australia became a sleepwalker, uninterested in itself, scared to look at itself, snobbish about its English antecedents and ashamed of ones that weren't. Have you ever thought how it came to be that the U.S. has 50 states all with wonderful names, and yet most of ours are named after points of the compass?</p>
<p>Lastly, might I say that I am astounded as to how you could possibly imagine that an Imperial Federation of Britain could ever have been possible. Even today, Australia, and I imagine I speak for you as well, do not in any real sense feel themselves to be part of a British Commonwealth. Of course, we don't mind thrashing them at the Commonwealth Games, but apart from that, the less we have to do with them the better. Australians do NOT regard themselves as being in the same boat as the Indians and the Africans. They see themselves as whites who are literally the sons and daughters of pioneers and even convicts. Most of the others are members via the historical fact that they were defeated by a foreign invader, and then colonised. On top of this insuperable fact, you might give thought to the fact that Australia's population is the merest fraction of that of the African and Indian Commonwealth components. India has a BILLION (or thousand million as I imagine you would put it) people by itself. We have 20 million. Our voice would simply be drowned out. <a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMyles325a_c306.html" title="User:Myles325a">Myles325a</a> 12:27, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>(Below is a note I made earlier today, and another follows this one.)</p>
<p>I know Wikipedia follows a non-partisan policy with regard to spelling and word-usage, but there comes a time when excessive loyalty to this principle can become a fetish and a burden, and such is the case here. There is such a thing as the natural atrophy of usage where customs, experience and new needs combine to favour some usages over others. In such cases, some variants become first “rare”, then “obsolete', then “archaic”. Over time, the “American” use of million, billion and so on, has comprehensively displaced the notion of “milliard” and “billiard”, the latter often not even included in many dictionaries. There is an excellent reason for this, whose meaning has exercised me of late, but wherefore I know not. I began to notice that there are numerous instances where the “American billion” makes itself useful, but comparatively few (outside of astronomy) where the old “English billion” does so, although I am not quite sure why. The Earth's population is about 6 billion for example, and having to say 6 thousand million is a nuisance. The populations of China and India are both about a billion (US). Virtually every numerous aspect of Planet Earth can conveniently be expressed in US billions and (occasionally) trillions. Had the English / French system prevailed, and considering that milliard never took off, there would be no new word to deal with numbers between a million and 999 thousand million, a silly state of affairs. I would be intersted to hear any views about why so many parameters can employ US billions, from social and economic and financial studies (one can have US “billionaires” but hardly English ones for example), and the natural sciences, and so few are amenable to the English billion and its offshoots.</p>
<p>Please, let a hundred flowers bloom and a thousand thoughts contend on Wikipedia, but let's not flog a dead horse. Some things are better left to rest in peace. <a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMyles325a_c306.html" title="User:Myles325a">Myles325a</a> 12:27, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>For a subject as well-masticated as this one, it is surprising that an important detail has not been more adequately dealt with. Experiment: go and ask a naïve subject: “Which is bigger, an American Billion or an English Billion?” If they reply correctly that the English one is, then ask them “By how much?” You will probably find that most people don't know. In fact, from my experience, most people, hearing the phonemic set “illions”, just assume that the amounts are very large, but there is not much to be made of it. In fact, an English Billion is a THOUSAND TIMES larger than the one adopted by her erstwhile colony. That would throw anybody's paperwork out. The gap grows more immense as the numbers become larger. The English Trillion is a full MILLION times larger than that of the US. And so it goes, the discrepancy between the English and American variants grows exponentially as the hierarchy ascends. This fact is the most salient in the whole discussion, and while it is implicit in the material included in the table, it would be illuminating to add a column on the far right which would spell out the scope of this progression</p>
