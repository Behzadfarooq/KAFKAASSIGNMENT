<dd>There are a lot better similarities than those, trust me. But, unless they come as close as the current example in The Guru (to the point that it may as well be word for word) it shouldn't be added. It's way to easy to just add small similarities mostly because Star Wars follows the traditional styles of common myth as presented in Hero With A Thousand Faces. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 22:32, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The similarity to Star Wars mainly comes from the fact that both trace an archetypal cycle, not that the creators of avatar wanted to specifically hint at star wars (though, who knows, this might be their objective). While i agree that a section on similarities to star wars is unneed, a broader "how avatar fits into archetypal theory" could find its place in an wikipedia article. -(<a href="../../../y/2E/k/User%7EY.krzepicki_fa2f.html" title="User:Y.krzepicki">Y.krzepicki</a> 03:05, 7 December 2006 (UTC))

<dd>There are a lot of similarities between Book 2 and The Empire Strikes Back revealed in The Guru and The Crossroads of Destiny. The Guru is essentially the same as Luke's training with Yoda. Note that Yoda and Obi Wan insist that Luke stay and finish his training rather than save his friends. Likewise, the guru insists that Aang stay and finish his mastering of the avatar state instead of going to save Katara. Also, at the end of both The Empire Strikes Back and Book 2 of Avatar, the main characters leave the invaded city in defeat with the city's leader. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeaneberhard_30e9.html" title="User:Seaneberhard">Sean Eberhard</a> 20:00, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Err, that one is a tough one. Technically he could, but it would mostly be plot summary.

<ul>
<li>I don't see any reason why he shouldn't...Azula's got her own page, and Appa's probably had just as much of an impact on the series as she has. Although Appa doesn't say anything, there's a lot that can be drawn from his relations with the other characters, and there have easily been four episodes (The Chase, The Desert, Appa's Lost Days, and Lake Laogai) where a large portion of the storyline centers on him. If you look on Appa's section in the major secondary characters page, you'll see that there's a lot of stuff to be added anyways. If someone's willing to make the transfer, I say go for it. <a href="../../../y/_/b/User%7EY_BCZ_9daf.html" title="User:Y BCZ">Y BCZ</a> 04:12, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nobody should have there own page. All of the character articles are rarely used since nobody is going to go through the trouble to look at seperate articles. All the descriptions should be on one page. Otherwise, no point. In addition, at the time I wrote this comment, Appa was not even in this article. There wa just a link to a list of creatures. Please put him in.</p>

<p>See here the thing, the trading card game provides the official names for the moves (rather than have shout them out in the show, another inorganic cliche down) so should we just I don't know, make an official article for them all, kinda like the Naruto-jutsu page (except quite a bit more organized)? For example, the technique (lets call it that) that Jeong Jeong used in the Deserter and Azula used in the Chase to make their escapes is known as "Swirling Flames". While the daggers that Zuko used in the first episodes of the first and second season are called "Twin Fire Daggers." Also the swiping move Aang's always doing with his staff is the "Pendulum Swing." See how it works? Eh. --3 November 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>Who would need this information? Unlike Naruto, which I'll admit to never seeing, I'm guessing those moves have some significance to what they are/do, sort of like the different moves in DBZ. However, in Avatar, those moves have no real meaning, they are just a bending move. The card game names them because they need to, the show has to reason to give emphasis on certain moves because the moves themselves have no significance in the show (other than the air scooter and water whip). <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 15:21, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. Most of the Avatar moves *MIGHT* have a specific name. This is typical of martial arts, where specific kicks, mounts and other elements are all given names to diferentiate them. However, in any kind of real fight, a martial artist is going to be be chaining moves, stances and attacks together to create somthing that will bring about victory and not yelling attack names like an anime character! Besides, the Naruto Justu lists are getting huge, and we don't need that kind of cruft here. 23 Nov 2006</dd>

<p>I think the descriptions of the main characters are too long, especially Iroh's. I think each one should be around three sentences long because each character has their own article. Thanks! 70.137.180.59 03:06, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree, the descriptions of the main characters are too long. It makes the whole article too bulky. Each description should have only a few sentences about who that person is, personality, etc. It shouldn't drone on and on about her/his history and include things about what each character did in each episode. All the details should be in each character's personal article. <a href="../../../j/a/z/User%7EJazzpizzazz5000_2e61.html" title="User:Jazzpizzazz5000">Jazzpizzazz5000</a> 06:39, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You do have a point with the length of the character descriptions, but there are too many characters to make there own articles. It becomes too confusing and unmanageable. Besides, that means that someone would have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create and article for each character.</li>
<li>Copy the text from this article and possibly lengthen it to make it a full article.</li>
<li>Delete the character descriptions from this article.</li>
<li><b>Create new shorter descriptions for every article.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, there would have to be people constantly improving so many articles SEPERATELY. It is much easier if they stay in this article. 71.247.34.36 01:35, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Merge Articles</span></h2>
<p>There are four instances in which ANOTHER article is written for that topic. This article is too broken up unless the episode list is added to this article. Since this is a TV show article, the core bascis of what has to be in it should be character descriptions, plot, history, and epsiode list. Without the episode list (which most visitors will be looking for), it becomes difficult since you have to navigate back and forth between the two articles.</p>
<p>Another part is the list of creatures in Avatar. The main reason I want to merge these to is because to main creatures are too important to be in a seperate article. I am talking about Appa and Momo. They are in a seperate article even though they are one of the most important features of the show. There are two options to solving this: Add a description for Appa and Momo to the list of creatures and leave the rest in the other article (with a link to the other article) OR merge the article completely.</p>

<p>This quote is when this article was nominated for featured article. As you can see, some of this has changed like there being no images, no long introduction, focus on show creation, and focus on creation influence. However, editing on the article has been too drastic. The quoe above says the article focused too much on epsiodes, but now the episodes are not even in the article! There has to be some kind of list and description of the episodes! Another problem is you need to <b>cite your sources</b>! Otherwise, there is no comparable source in case there is an argument. There is a weak point in the plot synopsis and premise due to its unusual shortness (I think I made up the word shortness). Finally, there needs to be more credits. Yes, it does mention the characters voices (even though I wish there was a small description on each) but there are no animators or other relative credits. At the least, there should be a list of other people who worked to create Avatar (animators, producers, sketch artists, etc.). In addition, as mentioned in another discussion, Appa and Momo should be mentioned in the article at some point.</p>
<p>Don't come over here and tell us what to do when you clearly have no idea what we have even done. I'm reverting vandalism by day to the character pages so obviously they get read. To move them here would make it too long and it's not needed unless Wikipedia suddenly told us we needed to cut down on the number of pages being made. Secondly, Appa and Momo are both on this page. Appa needs to be moved to main character but since his page is still being developed we're holding back. Momo is mentioned as a major character and his full bio is on that page.<br />
Plot synopsis should be short, that's why it is called a synopsis. The episodes have been moved because if they were here on the main page it would just become cluttered. That page, also, gets visited enough that it should have it's own page.<br />
Lastly, about credits, we have posted what we know. We can't post a full list of all the animators because it would be too large and not all of them work on every episode. We can make a seperate page if need be, but no one really cares as none of the people on that list will be anything recognizable.<br />
In conclusion, next time, read the article and look at how it has changed because as of now it simply seems like you are talking out of your ass and not really saying anything helpful/useful to our editing. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 06:45, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Appa now has his own page and this brings up the question of is he a min character and should he be in that catagory? I don't think so. He's not human and there's not enough about him.

<dd>Dude, where were you when we were making the page in the first place? Appa has his own page now and is no longer on the major secondary characters page. The move was made after a consensus was formed due to how much impact Appa has had on the show, especially recently and due to his relationship with Aang. Momo's not a main character because he's purely a comic-relief pet, while Appa has played a role in the plot of the series as well as several individual combats.

In addition, I did a partial copy edit and revision up to end of the Characters section.</p>

<dd>Not sure how old the above comment is but... I find something very wrong with the main characters section. It sounds like it was written by someone very young. I think the whole section should be looked over and given a more mature, academic, objective-sounding tone. --<a href="../../../h/t/m/User%7EHtmlism_e997.html" title="User:Htmlism">Htmlism</a> 00:18, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mature, academic, and objective-sounding? I can understand mature (some of the sections could be improved), but academic? Objective-sounding? Are you saying we should do psychoanalysis on the characters and describe their behavior in less simplistic terms? And I don't see how you could make them more objective-sounding when they're all based on observations, and not in an opinionated manner. Explain the problem more clearly before you expect us to agree that there is a problem that needs to be fixed. <a href="../../../y/_/b/User%7EY_BCZ_9daf.html" title="User:Y BCZ">Y BCZ</a> 00:44, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, the Nick web-site is used as a source for a lot of info on Avatar, and that makes sense since Avatar is a Nick production, but how reliable is the web-site?</p>
<p>I just noticed a note on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crossroads_of_Destiny_40c3.html" title="The Crossroads of Destiny">The Crossroads of Destiny</a> where it says that, according to the Nick web-site, Aang never successfully opened the seventh chakra. I checked, and that's true, the site does say that, <b>but</b> I also noticed something else: It was just plain wrong in its description of the episode. It had dialogue that was not in the show, inaccurate descriptions of Aang's entrance into the Avatar State towards the end and, though I stopped reading to come and write this, probably more errors.</p>
<p>If it's wrong on this episode, who knows what else it's wrong about? Can we trust it as a source? <a href="../../../j/b/k/User%7EJBK405_a584.html" title="User:JBK405">JBK405</a> 01:35, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The show is the first source above all others. Nicks site is the second.

<p>Oh, I know that we take she show over everything else, that's the pretty standard way of accepting canon, so if there's ever a contradiction (Like in Crossroads of Destiny) I just keep the shows information, but I wonder about information not revealed in the actual episodes.

<dd>Well the only actual contradiction to the site is the show or the co-creators themselves.

<p><a name="Genetics" id="Genetics"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Genetics</span></h2>
<p>Under "Fighting Styles", there is a sentence explaining that the ability to bend in the show comes from genetics and spirituality. I'm all for this thesis, but there is a problem:</p>
<p>The example used as the pro-genetics argument (the twins in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fortuneteller_88f7.html" title="The Fortuneteller">The Fortuneteller</a>) is actually counter-genetics.</p>
<p>See, the twins depicted in the epidose are identical twins. You can argue that I don't know that for a fact but, if look at them, you'll find it a hard claim to refute.</p>
<p>See, <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identical_twins.html#Identical_twins" title="Identical twins">identical twins</a> always contain the exact same copy of genes, so long as the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontogeny.html" title="Ontogeny">ontogeny</a> is properly maintained. This is because identical twins are formed from one single fertilized <a href="../../../o/v/u/Ovum.html" title="Ovum">ovum</a>. This ovum has acquired a set assortment of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genes.html" title="Genes">genes</a>, half from each parent. This ovum then undergoes a complete <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitosis.html" title="Mitosis">mitotic</a> division. The result of this will be two fertilized ova that will both grow to become a separate fetus, but that will both have the exact same set of genes.</p>
<p>Now that the science is out of the way, what does it mean? It means that if earthbending is a genetic trait, then both twins would have the ability. Both twins would have the same genes, and thus both twins would be capable of earthbending, since they are identical twins.</p>
<p>This fact alone <i>would</i> pretty much dictate that bending can't be genetic. How else would you explain the presence of the ability in one identical twin but not in the other, if they have the exact same genes?</p>
<p>--&gt; Now, for the purposes of the article, this is where you can stop. The bit about genetics on the article needs to be removed because it is just scientifically incorrect. Unless anyone has a concern about this, I will be deleting it shortly.</p>
<p>---&gt; Having removed the only thing that seemingly pointed bending ability towards being partly genetics-based, the rest of this article will provide a new pro-genetics hypothesis. It can not be inserted into the article, however, as it is well... just a hypothesis, so it's merely for discussion.</p>
<p>Here goes.</p>
<p><b>However</b>, turns out that there is still a possibility for bending to have a genetic factor. It comes from mutations. The only thing that would give one identical twin a genetic difference from his identical brother would be <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetic_mutation.html" title="Genetic mutation">genetic mutation</a>.</p>
<p>It is very possible then, that one of the twins suffered a mutation that either enabled or disabled his ability to bend.</p>
<p>I would like to think that is mutation is an "enabling" one. I would also like to think that it is spirituality-associated mutation. This would mean that there would be two kinds of people in Avatar: benders and non-benders.</p>
<p>Benders have the bending gene, non-benders don't OR have a non-functioning one. However, a high degree of spirituality could effect the genes of an individual, causing a mutation which would grant non-benders the ability to bend.</p>
<p>This would be the most logical conclusion given that the Air Nomads are all benders due to their spirituality.</p>
<p>I could go on and present even more complex mechanisms for spirituality-genetics cooperation involving <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcription.html" title="Transcription">transcription</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_product.html" title="Gene product">gene product</a>, and other stuff, but then I'd be writing an essay, which is something I'm already in danger of doing.</p>
<p>So I shall leave you with this, currently the only pro-genetic argument present <i><b>in the series</b></i>:</p>
<p>Bending distribution.</p>
<p>Notice how benders of a certain element only seem to be born in the respective elemental nation? There were no earthbenders born in the North Pole. No firebenders born in Ba Sing Se, at least not that the show has shown. This distribution pattern is identical to that of an <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_selection.html" title="Gene selection">evolutionary gene selection</a> pattern.</p>
<p>What this means is that the more a specific population increases, the more prominent its genes will become. Because the North Pole is such a good place for Waterbenders, their migration from the Earth continent left more earthbenders behind. As these earthbenders reproduced, the frequency of their gene, the earthbending gene, also grew while the frequency of other genes decreased. Eventually, through selection, only the earthbending gene was left in the population.</p>
<p>And that seems to be the world we see now in the show, so I am very much pro-genetics affecting bending ability. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_of_Ice_3d30.html" title="User:Sage of Ice">Sage of Ice</a> 11:21, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Very in-depth. Fortunately, I understand what you are saying.

<p>Actually, I can quite easily make the argument that we don't know for sure that they are identical twins. Fraternal twins can often look quite alike, especially when they're young. Example? <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary-Kate_and_Ashley_Olsen_ef3c.html" title="Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen">Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen</a>. They're faternal, yet in their youth they played the same character on a TV show.

<dd>As you've said, we still don't know for sure. It cannot be stated as a fact and as a pro-genetics argument in this article if it is not verifiably true.

<dd>Looks good. Now that I take a closer look, it seems like the twins thing was as evidence of spirituality (ie, saying they're identical twins and only one can bend, so it must be spiritual) but a direct quote saying spirituality is involved is far better.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>)</sup></dd>

<p><br />
All should feel free to discuss possible pro-genetics arguments here. Currently, there isn't a good enough argument to keep on the article.</p>
<p>My argument:</p>
<p>Yue is a being that is infused with the Spirit of the Moon, the spirit that is the source of all the Waterbender's powers. She is infused with this Spirit, the Spirit that fuels ALL waterbending, and yet she is incapable of bending. I find this to be the most solid evidence towards a genetic factor given the spiritual nature of bending.</p>
<p>Someone has disagreed and has removed it from the article. That's fine. Let's discuss possible factors here and see if we can come up with something else.</p>
<p>The Fire Lord bloodline is not good enough yet, mainly for the fact that Lu Ten's firebending ability hasn't been confirmed. Until then, we can't just assume and say the entire bloodline consists of benders. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_of_Ice_3d30.html" title="User:Sage of Ice">Sage of Ice</a> 18:11, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, I have to point out that we don't know Yue wasn't a Waterbender. The Northern Tribe only allows females to use Waterbending to heal, and Yue never had an opportunity to display any proficiency in that skill.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, I think we can say that all members of the Fire Lord's bloodline <i>seen in the show</i> are Firebenders, and leave out Lu Ten entirely. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerald_Alberich_21e3.html" title="User:Herald Alberich">Herald Alberich</a> 18:25, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I KNOW there is a source out there somewhere where the creators talk about bending being a mix between spirituality and genetics. 10 points to whoever finds it. Also, why would Lu Ten be put into battle if he wasn't a firebender. As we saw in Siege of the North, it certainly seems that the only people sent into battle (military, not naval) are firebenders. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 18:44, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And that's not what we saw at all in the "Siege of the North". As I've said below, there were many soliers who marched in with spears, swords, and shields and never threw a single blast of fire anywhere. There were most certainly not firebenders. There was also the hammer throwing guy who clearly can't firebend if he chose to use hammers instead of fire blasts. Lu Ten could easily have been put to battle without being a bender.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>But let's keep going. We know that the Rough Rhinos all served under Iroh at one point. He mentions this in "The Library". Yet of the entire group, only one of them is a bender: Colonel Mongke. Yes, it's official that the others are not benders, it's stated in the official Nick site. Clearly, however, the Rough Rhinos are an elite and respected platoon part of the army, Iroh even says that they are "legendary", despite only one of them being a bender.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, what about the Yu Yan archers? They are elite and extremely respected, yet are not benders. Non-benders can rise in the ranks just as much as benders if you're skilled enough.</dd>

<dd>Lu Ten was almost certainly a firebender. He was part of the army, and all members of the Fire Nation army have shown to be firebenders.

<p>We can assume and suppose many things about the intricacies of the Fire Lord selection process and how Lu Ten fits into that, and what that means about his bending. Regardless, "almost" certainly isn't good enough for a factual article.</p>
<p>And not all members of the army have been shown to be Firebenders. If you watch <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Siege_of_the_North_8e01.html" title="The Siege of the North">The Siege of the North</a>, you'll see many members of the army charging in with spears in hand, not blasting fire everywhere. It's very possible that Lu Ten was not a bender. You really think Iroh would hesitate to put him on throne for that?</p>
<p>Yes, Yue could have been a bender, and it's true that it wasn't specifically mentioned that she wasn't.</p>
<p>All this means is that both of these arguments are assumptions, therefore unfit to be in the main article. So I guess we'll need to keep searching, or wait it out. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_of_Ice_3d30.html" title="User:Sage of Ice">Sage of Ice</a> 18:41, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know that this debate has pretty much ended, but I just wanted to put my two cents in. I would lean towards the “spirituality” aspect. For example, Tibetan masters claim supernatural abilities like <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telepathy.html" title="Telepathy">telepathy</a> are a “Learned” skill. They call it “messages on the wind”. It starts with the master sending messages to the student, who can hear it, not because he is telepathic yet, but because of the pure focus of his master’s mind. Supposedly, after doing preparatory exercises, the student eventually is able to send these messages to others. Then, over time, the distance between the master and disciple is gradually increased until both can be anywhere in the world and still communicate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is a more “physical”, tangible skill known as <i>Long-gum-pa</i> (“Wind Meditation”), which allows a practitioner to run literally for days without stopping for food, water or rest. Some masters are supposedly as fast as horses and can run 200 miles a day or more. From what I have read, the training involves lessoning the body’s weight through psychic training. According to several accounts from western explorers during the 1920’s (or somewhere around there), these people run in (what appeared to be?) twenty foot strides and their gate seems to resemble the rythmic recoiling of a bouncing ball. Some masters supposedly wear big heavy chains to keep them from being blown away. Kind of like <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Idle_417b.html" title="Eric Idle">Eric Idle</a>'s character "Berthold" from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Baron_Munchausen_18e1.html" title="The Adventures of Baron Munchausen">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a></i> who wore <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ball_and_chain.html" title="Ball and chain">ball and chains</a> to keep him from unexpectedly using his superspeed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The skill of the "Respa" (if I remember correctly) is where a practitioner learns to increase their body temp to the point that they can melt snow from around them and dry multiple wet sheets (in turn) draped around them. The ultimate goal of this art is to be able to reside in the high mountainous regions completely naked. The body acts as a reactor which keeps the master warm. Just in case you think I’m a nut, my info comes from the books <i>Magic and Mystery in Tibet</i> by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_David-Neel_3a65.html" title="Alexandra David-Neel">Alexandra David-Neel</a> and <i>Beyond the Himalayas</i> by <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murdo_MacDonald-Bayne_4841.html" title="Murdo MacDonald-Bayne">Murdo MacDonald-Bayne</a>.</dd>

<dd>They came straight from the opening shot of the ""Avatar"" world map in any episode. I just modified them to remove background color and reduce the pixel size. Other than that, it's a screenshot at its most basic. We have plenty of other screenshots already up on the site, and those seem to not be an issue. Furthermore, this same map can be seen on the official Nick site and on many known third-party websites. No one has had a problem with them yet. If these breach fair use rationale, then a lot of things do too, which would be a shame.</dd>

<dd>I used them, instead of the unicode characters, for the article because they are far more accurate. Calligraphy can be a hard thing to read depending on how it's done; I wanted everyone to see how the show did it, so that they could interpret it themselves. Is it a fair use breach? <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_of_Ice_3d30.html" title="User:Sage of Ice">Sage of Ice</a> 23:16, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if the same characters can be produced otherwise, then it is. One of the requierments regarding fair use images is that they be irreplaceable. If there is another way those characters can be rendered (and don't ask me, I know next to nothing about all this business with Chinese characters) then we can't use fair-use images to depict them.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>)</sup> 23:21, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it seems my question is answered, so the true question now is whether the calligraphy is different enough from the Unicode to be unique, and therefore allowable under fair use. I know there are those who would draw a hard line and say Unicode qualifies as a free alternative, but the screenshots also depict the calligraphy mentioned in the section just below this one, which is certainly not replacable in Unicode. Perhaps we could add "as seen above" to that section to further justify their inclusion, and (if we must) remove the picture already there. Also, they need fair-use rationales, which have been added to the other shots. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerald_Alberich_21e3.html" title="User:Herald Alberich">Herald Alberich</a> 05:22, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When <a href="../../../a/a/n/Aang.html" title="Aang">Aang</a> was a child, he unknowingly revealed that he was the Avatar when he chose four toys out of thousands. These four toys were the same ones that past Avatars had chosen for generations when they were children, revealing that Aang was the <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of the Avatar. This same test is used by <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibetan_Buddhist_ac28.html" title="Tibetan Buddhist">Tibetan Buddhist</a> monks when a reincarnated <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalai_Lama_3904.html" title="Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a> is expected. Visions of the monks reveal who the Dalai Lama is, and this test finalizes that he is, indeed, the reincarnation. In addition, the successor is expected to show signs of continuity with the previous Avatar, such as being born within a week of the death.</p>

<blockquote>

When a child is discovered who nearly answers the prescribed conditions [--time and place of birth, family name, etc.—as set by the <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulku.html" title="Tulku">Tulku</a> before his death], a lama clairvoyant is again consulted, and if he pronounces in favor of the child the following final test is applied.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A number of objects such as rosaries, ritualistic implements, books, tea-cups, etc., are placed together, and the child must pick out those which belonged to the late <i><a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulku.html" title="Tulku">tulku</a></i>, thus showing that he recognizes the things which were <i>his</i> in his previous life”.</p>

<p>First, I want to note the book I got the passage from was first printed in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>. Second, I’ve gone to the page linked with the first paragraph and failed in finding any reference to the Dalai Lama. I believe the quoted passage from the second paragraph explains the situation better, especially about the test involving the Tulku Lama's former possessions. Does anyone else think this should replace part of the current paragraph? I wouldn't care if it was cut down just to present the bare facts.</p>

<p>It's not the exact same test, but the general gist is the same, at least according to the Dalai Lama article. Whether or not that justifies its inclusion in this article is still a little sketchy, due to sourcing: without some source outside a fansite saying the test was derived from the Tibetan custom, its inclusion doesn't pass the source test, and it's just speculation (though fairly obvious). <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirogtheconq_2809.html" title="User:Virogtheconq">Virog</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Virogtheconq_1bbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Virogtheconq">It's not</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EVirogtheconq_c1d6.html" title="User talk:Virogtheconq">my fault!</a></sub> 15:12, 18 December 2006 (UTC) <a name="Criteria_1a" id="Criteria_1a"></a></p>
