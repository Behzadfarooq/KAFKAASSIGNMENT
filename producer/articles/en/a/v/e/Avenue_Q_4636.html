<p><i><b>Avenue Q</b></i> is a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_theater.html" title="Musical theater">musical</a>, which was originally conceived by Jeff Marx and Robert Lopez. It opened <a href="../../../o/f/f/Off-Broadway_ce94.html" title="Off-Broadway">off-Broadway</a> at the <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vineyard_Theatre_e0f4.html" title="Vineyard Theatre">Vineyard Theatre</a> in March <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> (where it won that season's Lucille Lortel Award for Best Musical), and it has been on Broadway at the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Golden_Theatre_0654.html" title="John Golden Theatre">John Golden Theatre</a> since <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_31.html" title="July 31">July 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. It surprisingly won the 2004 <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Award_ddaa.html" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</a> <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Award_for_Best_Musical_d95e.html" title="Tony Award for Best Musical">for Best Musical</a> as well as Tony Awards for Best Score and Best Book of a Musical, defeating the much bigger-scale, front-runner musical of the season, <i><a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicked_%28musical%29.html" title="Wicked (musical)">Wicked</a></i>.</p>
<p>The music and lyrics are by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Lopez_b1ff.html" title="Robert Lopez">Robert Lopez</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Marx_4c65.html" title="Jeff Marx">Jeff Marx</a>. The book is by <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Whitty_ebab.html" title="Jeff Whitty">Jeff Whitty</a>. The original production was directed by Jason Moore and choreographed by Ken Roberson. The puppets were designed and constructed by original cast member <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Lyon_0c50.html" title="Rick Lyon">Rick Lyon</a>.</p>
<p>The show is largely inspired by (and in the style of) <a href="../../../p/b/s/PBS_66e9.html" title="PBS">PBS</a>'s <i><a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_dd3a.html" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a></i>, with a mix of live characters, <a href="../../../p/u/p/Puppet.html" title="Puppet">puppet</a> characters, short animated video clips and bouncy songs performed on a rundown street set. However, the characters are in their twenties and face adult problems instead of those faced by pre-schoolers. Some of the songs are risqué about <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_porn.html" title="Internet porn">Internet porn</a>, and other subjects that wouldn't be mentioned on <i>Sesame Street</i>. But in the end, the show's hopeful message about the characters finding purpose through helping others and getting through problems by realizing that they are only "for now" is very resonant.</p>
<p>Several characters are recognizably <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parodies</a> of classic <a href="../../../m/u/p/Muppet.html" title="Muppet">Muppet</a> characters. For example, the roommates Rod and Nicky are adult versions of Sesame Street's <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_and_Ernie_ca15.html" title="Bert and Ernie">Bert and Ernie</a>, and <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trekkie_Monster_e618.html" title="Trekkie Monster">Trekkie Monster</a> seems to be based on <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookie_Monster_c348.html" title="Cookie Monster">Cookie Monster</a>.</p>
<p>Because of its adult content and "full puppet nudity" (including graphic simulated sex between puppets), the show specifically disclaims any connection to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children%27s_Television_Workshop_2e32.html" title="Children's Television Workshop">Children's Television Workshop</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jim_Henson_Company_9183.html" title="The Jim Henson Company">The Jim Henson Company</a>. However, both Marx and Lyon previously worked for <i><a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_dd3a.html" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a></i>, as have the other puppeteers in the original cast. In an interview with Britain's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>, addressing the question of potential conflicts with Henson, Marx claimed, "during early previews in the States we invited <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Henson_01c3.html" title="Jim Henson">Jim Henson's</a> widow and children and they could see that what we were doing was a homage and love letter to Sesame Street."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>A <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_metropolitan_area_7d8f.html" title="Las Vegas metropolitan area">Las Vegas</a> production opened up at the <a href="../../../w/y/n/Wynn_Las_Vegas_d492.html" title="Wynn Las Vegas">Wynn Las Vegas</a> in September 2005, and closed in May 2006 due to poor ticket sales and building conflicts.

A national tour has been semi-confirmed on the official website.

<p>The show begins with the "Avenue Q Theme", and then we meet Princeton, an optimistic recent college graduate with a useless degree in English, is looking for an affordable apartment in New York City ("What Do You Do with a BA in English?/It Sucks to Be Me"). Walking along Avenue Q, he meets a group of neighbors: Brian, an unemployed aspiring comedian; Kate Monster, an assistant kindergarten teacher who can't get a date; Nicky and Rod, two roommates who are fed up with each other; Christmas Eve, Brian's fiancée, a Japanese immigrant who wants to work as a therapist but doesn't have any clients; and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Coleman_50e0.html" title="Gary Coleman">Gary Coleman</a>, former child star of the TV show <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diff%27rent_Strokes_b869.html" title="Diff'rent Strokes">Diff'rent Strokes</a>, who now works as an apartment superintendent. They are all trying to find out whose life sucks the most. Everyone unanimously declares Gary the winner because people are constantly stopping him to ask him "Whatchu talkin bout, Willis?". Princeton likes the neighborhood, and everyone welcomes him to his new home.</p>
<p>Rod is about to have a quiet time at home reading his favorite book when he is interrupted by Nicky who wants to share a story about a gay man he met on the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_Subway_7c6e.html" title="New York City Subway">Subway</a> earlier that morning. Rod gets defensive at the mention of homosexuality, and Nicky assures his roommate that he would have no problem accepting Rod if he were gay ("If You Were Gay").</p>
<p>Princeton struggles to discover the purpose of his life. He finds a lucky penny that was made in his birthyear and decides things are looking up in his search ("Purpose"). Christmas Eve, Brian, and Gary all explain their purpose in life. Princeton then meets Kate in the street and asks what her purpose is. She tells him about how when she was younger, she wanted to go to a place made specially for monsters. Princeton asks whether she and Trekkie Monster are related, but Kate is repulsed at the idea, calling him racist. Princeton then claims that she and her dream of a monster school are also racist, and they agree, along with a few other neighbours, that ("Everyone's a Little Bit Racist"). Later, Princeton is approached by the Bad Idea Bears, two innocent-looking teddy bears who encourage him to spend his money on beer rather than put it in the bank.</p>
<p>Kate receives a phone call from her boss Mrs Thistletwat telling her that because she has <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_surgery.html" title="Cardiac surgery">heart replacement surgery</a> next week, she needs Kate to fill in in her absence in the morning, and that she may teach an entire lesson on whatever subject she likes. Kate decides that she will teach about the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>. But she finds out from Trekkie Monster and the other men that ("The Internet is for Porn"). Kate thinks Princeton might have a crush on her, and when he comes over to deliver a ("Mix Tape"), her suspicions are confirmed. Princeton then invites her to the Around the Clock Café that night.</p>
<p>At the café, Brian performs the opening act ("I'm Not Wearing Underwear Today") and then introduces Lucy the Slut, who sings ("Special"). Having had an enjoyable evening, Kate and Princeton are ready to go home, but the Bad Idea Bears suggest that they have some harmless <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Island_Iced_Tea_eb7e.html" title="Long Island Iced Tea">Long Island Iced Teas</a> (Absinthe Daiquiris in the London show) and play some drinking games. While Kate is retrieving a round of drinks, Lucy tells Princeton that when he's ready for a real woman, she'll be around. In their drunken state, Kate and Princeton are convinced by the Bad Idea Bears to go home and have sex. Gary Coleman is called by other tenants to tell Princeton and Kate to quiet down, but Coleman says that ("You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want [When You're Making Love]").</p>
<p>Rod cannot sleep while Nicky snores loudly in the next bed. Nicky begins to talk in his sleep about his attraction to Rod. Rod is jubilant because it seems that his secret crush is mutual. However, he wakes to discover that it was <i>he</i> who had been dreaming. Meanwhile, Kate and Princeton lie in bed and explain how happy they are with each other. Princeton gives Kate his lucky penny as a gift to let her know how much she means to him ("Fantasies Come True").</p>
<p>The next morning, Kate wakes to Mrs Thistletwat's voice on the phone. She has missed the morning classes she was supposed to teach. Kate, angered by all this, quits her job. Princeton asks her to be his girlfriend and to accompany him to Brian and Christmas Eve's wedding. At the wedding, the neighbors ask Nicky whether Rod is gay. Nicky confirms that Rod is a closeted homosexual; Rod overhears him and vehemently denies this, stating that he has a whole second life that no one has ever heard of--including a Canadian girlfriend ("My Girlfriend Who Lives in Canada"). Rod then throws Nicky out of their apartment.</p>
<p>Princeton, scared of commitment after witnessing the wedding, breaks up with Kate. Kate ends the first act with a note of defiance ("There's a Fine, Fine Line").</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/e/Avenue_Q_4636.html" title="Edit section: Act Two">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Act Two</span></h3>
<p>At the top of act two, Princeton sits alone in his apartment ("It Sucks to Be Me [Reprise]"). After two weeks, he is in debt, unemployed, single, and still purposeless. The Bad Idea Bears try to convince him to hang himself, but with no luck. Brian, Christmas Eve, Trekkie Monster, Nicky, and Gary Coleman arrive to take Princeton back outside to remind him that "There is Life Outside Your Apartment". On the way, they meet Lucy the Slut, and Princeton decides to take her home with him. Angry at Princeton, Kate talks to Christmas Eve, who explains that the reason Kate is angry at Princeton is that she loves him so much ("The More You Ruv Someone"). Kate comes to Princeton's apartment to give him a letter, inviting him to meet her at the top of the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_State_Building_5b2a.html" title="Empire State Building">Empire State Building</a>. He is in the shower when Kate arrives, so she gives the letter to Lucy, who promptly destroys it.</p>
<p>Nicky has been staying with Brian since he was kicked out, but Christmas Eve can't take having a puppet slob in the apartment anymore. They throw him out on the street, and Nicky has to beg for money. Gary Coleman laughs at Nicky's downtrodden state, admitting that he cannot help feeling a sense of ("<a href="../../../s/c/h/Schadenfreude.html" title="Schadenfreude">Schadenfreude</a>") at the sight.</p>
<p>Lucy has abandoned Princeton, who goes out looking for her. Kate, angry that Princeton seems to have stood her up, throws the penny he gave her off the Empire State Building. Many yards below, an unsuspecting Lucy gets hit in the head by the falling penny and knocked into a coma. At the hospital, Kate visits Princeton and they attempt to work out their problems, but Princeton is still not ready for commitment. Nicky and Rod encounter each other, and Nicky tries to apologize, but Rod won't listen. He consults with Christmas Eve, who tells him everything will be okay. Nicky is out on the street, Kate is alone on the balcony of the Empire State Building, and Princeton sits at Lucy's bedside. All of them ponder what it would be like to go back to happier, easier times ("I Wish I Could Go Back to College").</p>
<p>Passing Nicky in the street and reluctantly giving him a quarter, Princeton realizes that he should be thinking about other people. He decides to raise the money to build Kate's monster school. Nicky realizes, after reluctantly giving Princeton all his money, that he needs to find a way to get back to his apartment and resolves to find a boyfriend for Rod. Together with Gary Coleman, Brian, and Christmas Eve, they raise some money ("The Money Song"). It's not enough, so they ask Trekkie. When he finds out what it is for, he remembers his hellish school days ("School for Monsters"), and donates $10,000,000.00, earned by investing in pornography ("The Money Song [Reprise]").</p>
<p>The completed monster school is revealed to Kate. Christmas Eve and Brian then announce that they are leaving Avenue Q for the Lower East Side. Brian is becoming a consultant, and Christmas Eve has landed a high-paying client with a lot of problems. Everyone believes it's Rod, who arrives on the scene with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champagne_%28beverage%29.html" title="Champagne (beverage)">champagne</a>. He finally reveals that he is gay. He has lightened up and invites Nicky back in. Nicky has found him a boyfriend named Ricky, who looks just like Nicky only more muscular. Meanwhile, the Bad Idea Bears have found <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">scientology</a>, and Lucy has recovered from her injury to become a <a href="../../../b/o/r/Born-again_Christian_f9dd.html" title="Born-again Christian">born-again Christian</a>. Kate cannot believe that the monster school is finally a reality--or that Princeton devised the whole project. Princeton asks her for a second chance, and Kate says they'll take it a day at a time ("There's a Fine, Fine Line [Reprise]").</p>
<p>A young kid, just out of college with a useless BA in English, comes to look at Brian and Christmas Eve's for-rent apartment, and Princeton has a revelation. This kid is in the same position he was, and he must pass on everything he's learned. He has found his purpose: to put all his knowledge into a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_theatre.html" title="Musical theatre">show</a>. Everyone immediately shoots the idea down, and the kid <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finger_%28gesture%29.html" title="Finger (gesture)">flips Princeton the bird</a> and departs angrily. Princeton worries that he may never find his purpose, but the others encourage him to cheer up. Life may be bad at the moment, but everything in life is only "For Now."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/e/Avenue_Q_4636.html" title="Edit section: Other Avenue Q songs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other Avenue Q songs</span></h2>
<p>So far, there are five <i>Avenue Q</i> songs that are not in the actual show itself and one song written for and cut from the London production.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Tear It Up and Throw It Away": the only original number cut from the show. The plot of the song is that Kate Monster receives jury duty and won't be able to go to the aquarium with Nicky. However, Nicky tells her that jury duty is a load of crap and nobody will notice if you just don't go. The song was written back when the concept was mooted for cable TV, not Broadway. Since the number has no relevance to the plot as it is today (and Kate Monster and <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trekkie_Monster_e618.html" title="Trekkie Monster">Trekkie Monster</a> (the actor plays Nicky as well) have a duet anyway in "The Internet is for Porn"), it was the first thing thrown out, and they wrote Schadenfreude as Nicky's duet (this time with <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Coleman_50e0.html" title="Gary Coleman">Gary Coleman</a>). Even though it was cut out of the musical way before the show went on, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Lyon_0c50.html" title="Rick Lyon">Rick Lyon</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_D%27Abruzzo_00a6.html" title="Stephanie D'Abruzzo">Stephanie D'Abruzzo</a> recorded the song with a full orchestra and released the mp3 (easily found on file-sharing programs). The song is not found as a bonus track on the cast recording, but it is included with a souvenir program.</li>
<li>"Rod's Dilemma": Written for Tony voters, this song cleverly disguises the Tonys as Rod's choice for voting for his rotary club's president. He is largely undecided, and the residents of Avenue Q tell him to "vote his heart". Princeton reminds everybody that "it's a secret ballot, so nobody has to know who you voted for!" The song even pokes fun at how it's trying to take the honest way to grab Best Musical, when the end chorus proclaims "Vote Your Heart! [faintly in the background] (On Avenue Q!)" Many claim this song won them the Tony, and it is available to hear on the official website.</li>
<li>"Only in Vegas": This song was written for Vegas promotion. It features <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Lyon_0c50.html" title="Rick Lyon">Rick Lyon</a> as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Wynn_%28developer%29_f538.html" title="Steve Wynn (developer)">Steve Wynn</a> telling the cast of <i>Avenue Q</i> how happy they will be in Vegas. The song was performed on Regis and Kelly and in some press and media events. The song is also noteworthy in that it is the first song written for <i>Avenue Q</i> to not try to bear similarities to <i><a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_dd3a.html" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a></i> songs, but rather pay tribute to Vegas showroom songs. It, as well, is the first <i>Avenue Q</i> recording to not feature the original Broadway cast.</li>
<li>"Rod's Christmas": This song can be found on the CD <i>Broadway's Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 5</i>. In this song, Rod is the headliner at the beautiful Don't Tell Daddy's Cabaret and Night Club. He states that Christmas is the time of year where he can combine his two great loves of "Christmas carols, and showtunes". He then goes on to sing a Christmas medley of "Oh Come, All Ye Faitful", "Angels We Have Heard On High", "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen", "The Holly and the Ivy", "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear", and "Go Tell It On the Mountain". He gets no applause. Other <i>Carols for a Cure</i> recordings featuring Avenue Q cast members include Lucy the Slut singing "Go Tell It On the Mountain" and "The Holi-Daze", which includes the entire cast, just not in character.</li>
<li>"Time": Made with the London cast (actually only one member), it was used in London previews, showcased on the video screens at the buffer of intermission. It featured a video of Nicky <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathroom_singing.html" title="Bathroom singing">sitting on the toilet, singing</a> about how he is taking his time before the next act begun, with the stagehands yelling at him to get out. It failed miserably during the previews and was immediately removed. The CD, however, is being released with souvenir brochures (Programs) and can be found, unlike the Vegas song. The cut video is also available on <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>. It also features a short appearance by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Lucas_7d1b.html" title="Matt Lucas">Matt Lucas</a>.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/e/Avenue_Q_4636.html" title="Edit section: Las Vegas Production">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Las Vegas Production</span></h2>
<p>On September 8, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, a second production of <i>Avenue Q</i> opened up at the <a href="../../../w/y/n/Wynn_Las_Vegas_d492.html" title="Wynn Las Vegas">Wynn Las Vegas</a> hotel and casino in <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_metropolitan_area_7d8f.html" title="Las Vegas metropolitan area">Las Vegas</a>. This made <i>Avenue Q</i> unable to tour, and only available to be produced in Vegas, New York and outside North America (e.g. London, where it opened in June 2006).</p>
<p>From September 2005 to the end of the year, the show stayed in its original Broadway form, with two acts and an intermission, as on Broadway with two different casts classified as the Blue Bear and Yellow Bear Casts.</p>
<p>In Vegas, in a brand new 1,200 seat theater built specially for the show, there were some differences from the Broadway production, including new digital projection screens, a new reprise of "It Sucks To Be Me" for Princeton at the top of Act Two and a newly orchestrated entr'acte, new orchestrations for "Purpose", a trimmed "The Money Song" and a whole new rock arrangement of "There Is Life Outside Your Apartment", as well as a few new jokes more suited to Vegas audiences. These changes have since been incorporated into the Broadway version.</p>
<p>In mid-January 2006, the show was cut to 90 minutes, removing the intermission and trimming 10-15 minutes of material:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cuts were made to the songs "Mix Tape", "Fantasies Come True" and "Schadenfreude".</li>
<li>The scene after "Fantasies Come True", where Kate loses her job, but gains Princeton as a boyfriend, no longer existed. It was only implied that Kate and Princeton are a couple at the wedding.</li>
<li>Since they deleted the intermission, Princeton breaks up with Kate, but instead of singing "There's a Fine, Fine Line", Kate simply walks back into her apartment. The TV screens then flashed "Three Weeks Later", zipping right to the scene (in what would be act two) that immediately follows the deleted "There Is Life Outside Your Apartment". Lucy simply showed up, now reading as that she's been seeing Princeton for a while.</li>
<li>The Bad Idea Bears now showed up when Lucy tears up Kate's letter.</li>
<li>The hospital scene between Kate and Princeton was extended with newly written dialogue, with Kate actually saying that she lost her job, and wondering why Princeton would want Lucy. Princeton's words only made her cry. She then sang "There's a Fine, Fine Line", which replaced the now-gone "I Wish I Could Go Back To College".</li>
<li>The scene in which Rod tells Christmas Eve that he misses Nicky was thrown out.</li>
</ul>
<p>The setting of the Vegas version of the show remained, of course, still New York.</p>
<p>Another difference between the Broadway and Vegas productions was that the merchandising in Vegas was far more extensive, including many souvenirs which were not available at all in New York.</p>
<p>Steve Wynn went so far as to dress twenty cabs in orange fuzz to promote the show. They had "Q" in white letters etched in front.</p>
<p>Though the show was reported to have sold consistently at roughly 65% (of 1,200 seats, 10 performances a week) and to have been profitable<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, it was announced the Vegas production would close on May 28, 2006, after only a 9 month run. The reason for the closing was said to be <i><a href="../../../s/p/a/Spamalot.html" title="Spamalot">Spamalot</a></i>, for which the Wynn had also bought rights. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spamalot.html" title="Spamalot">Spamalot</a> was originally going to be housed in a new theater to be built alongside Avenue Q. However, the construction of a new theater would have intruded on the Wynn's popular golf course and that, combined with Avenue Q's unspectacular sales record, prompted the Wynn to close Avenue Q and move <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spamalot.html" title="Spamalot">Spamalot</a> into its theater instead. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spamalot.html" title="Spamalot">Spamalot</a> will begin previews at the expanded and redubbed "Grail Theater" in <a href="../../../m/a/r/March.html" title="March">March</a> of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>.</p>
<p>The closing of the show in Las Vegas released the Avenue Q producers from their exclusivity agreement and therefore it is presumed that plans for a tour and/or sit-down productions will be announced shortly.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/e/Avenue_Q_4636.html" title="Edit section: London Production">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">London Production</span></h2>
<p>A third production began performances in June <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> in London's <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_End_theatre_47e0.html" title="West End theatre">West End</a> at the <a href="../../../n/o/%C3%AB/No%C3%ABl_Coward_Theatre_6024.html" title="Noël Coward Theatre">Noël Coward Theatre</a> (recently renamed from the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albery_Theatre_9b52.html" title="Albery Theatre">Albery Theatre</a> - Avenue Q is its first production) with <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cameron_Mackintosh_9bb7.html" title="Cameron Mackintosh">Cameron Mackintosh</a> at the helm. The show previewed on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">June 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> and received its European premiere on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_28.html" title="June 28">28 June</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. Avenue Q is currently booking in London until <a href="../../../2/6/t/26th_January_a83d.html" title="26th January">26th January</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2008.html" title="2008">2008</a>. It is only the third production of the musical in the world, and the first outside the United States. The London show created its own official <a href="http://www.myspace.com/avenueqlondon" class="external text" title="http://www.myspace.com/avenueqlondon" rel="nofollow">Avenue Q Myspace</a> site, to keep fans upto date with news and special apperances. The production also unveiled a brand new logo for the show (visible on the production's <a href="http://www.avenueqthemusical.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.avenueqthemusical.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">UK website</a>), presumably since the original logo, styled after the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_Subway_7c6e.html" title="New York City Subway">New York City Subway</a> system <a href="../../../1/_/%28/1_%28New_York_City_Subway_service%29_e76b.html" title="1 (New York City Subway service)">graphics</a>, would have little resonance with a London audience, however both logos are used.</p>
<p>The most noticeable initial change was that Gary Coleman was assumed not to be well known enough for a UK audience, and the character was changed to just "Gary - that famous kid from TV" and cast as a male actor instead of a female. This also caused a rewrite of the orchestration's nod to Diff'rent Strokes in "It Sucks To Be Me".</p>
<p>In subsequent performances however, after audience polling, the character's name was changed back to Gary Coleman, and the original dialogue of his catchphrase: "Whatchoo talkin' about Willis?" has been reinstated after a trial of "Try havin' people stopping you and saying 'I thought you was dead!'". His line in "It Sucks To Be Me" is however different from the Broadway Show, stating - "I was the cutest little black kid on TV. I made a zillion dollars that my parents stole from me. My life was over when I hit puberty. But I'm here, fixing the toilets, on Avenue Q!"</p>
<p>Also changed in "It Sucks To Be Me" is Christmas Eve's line 'Tried to work in Chinese Restaurant' instead of 'Korean Deli'. There are slight alterations all the way through however, for example 'Those stupid Polacks' in 'Everyone's A Little Bit Racist' to 'Those French people are such assholes', Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx stated this change was not for any cultural reason, they just thought it was funnier.</p>
<p>In 'The Internet Is for Porn', instead of being embarrassed about what he did after sending Kate the e-card, Princeton nods his head vigorously with his mouth open. In 'Special', Lucy headlined in The Vatican City instead of Celebration, Florida and London instead of Bangkok. And at the beginning of intermission, an animation shows the word 'Intermission' colliding with 'val', leaving the more-British 'Interval.'</p>
<p>A few bits of music were cut for example the middle of 'Schadenfreude' (Straight A students getting B's, cutting off Oscar speech etc) and 'Watching A Frat Boy Realize...' was changed to 'Seeing a Drunk Guy realise...' Also the pacing of 'Purpose' is longer and slower in the beginning than in the original version. The music at the beginning of 'Life outside your apartment' is also slightly rockier than the original. The changes mostly come from the Las Vegas version of the show.</p>

<p>As stated in the Broadway <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playbill.html" title="Playbill">Playbill</a>, the scene is a fictional street located "in an outerborough of New York City"</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> (which is the quintessential innerborough of New York City) has well-known Avenues A, B, C, and D, making up the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alphabet_City_34f0.html" title="Alphabet City">Alphabet City</a> neighborhood (where <i><a href="../../../r/e/n/Rent_%28musical%29.html" title="Rent (musical)">Rent</a></i> takes place; now considered part of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Village%2C_Manhattan_7407.html" title="East Village, Manhattan">East Village</a>). Some say Avenue Q is the hypothetical extension of that sequence: far from Manhattan, where the rents are actually affordable for recent college graduates. However in the play, Brian and Christmas Eve eventually move from Avenue Q to the East Village, making this even more unlikely.</p>
<p>Alternately, Avenue Q could be in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midwood.html" title="Midwood">Midwood</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravesend%2C_New_York_0378.html" title="Gravesend, New York">Gravesend</a> area of Brooklyn, where there are also Avenues A, B, C, etc. all the way up to Avenue Z, with a few exceptions. One of the exceptions is Avenue Q; the street between Avenue P and Avenue R is known as Quentin Road, named for the youngest son of President <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. The <a href="../../../q/_/%28/Q_%28New_York_City_Subway_service%29_4db1.html" title="Q (New York City Subway service)">Q subway train</a>, whose symbol used to be a Q in an orange circle resembling the Avenue Q logo, travels through this neighborhood, and the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_Highway_%28BMT_Brighton_Line%29_53e0.html" title="Kings Highway (BMT Brighton Line)">Kings Highway station</a> is almost on Quentin Road.</p>
<p>The authors have stated that Avenue Q, the show's namesake, is fictional and is not related to this or any other particular street.</p>

<p>On September 30, 2004, the day of the first <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">Bush</a>-<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">Kerry</a> presidential debate, the cast of Avenue Q presented their version, with portrait puppets of Bush and Kerry created by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Lyon_0c50.html" title="Rick Lyon">Rick Lyon</a>, called <i>Avenue Q&amp;A</i>, on a special stage set up in the middle of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Times_Square_cdcd.html" title="Times Square">Times Square</a>. Eighteen television networks covered the event. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Lyon_0c50.html" title="Rick Lyon">Rick Lyon</a> puppeteered George W.

Each puppet sang to the other in response to questions from Avenue Q's concerned "residents", and then the whole cast sang to the rain-drenched crowds to "Vote your heart!".</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/e/g/Regis_Philbin_22e7.html" title="Regis Philbin">Regis</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Ripa_60b6.html" title="Kelly Ripa">Kelly</a> puppets created by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Lyon_0c50.html" title="Rick Lyon">Rick Lyon</a> hosted the first few minutes of an episode of <i><a href="../../../l/i/v/Live%21_with_Regis_and_Kelly_9a52.html" title="Live! with Regis and Kelly">Live! with Regis and Kelly</a></i>. Rod and John Tartagalia were "man-on-the-street"-style interviewers on the 2005 CBS broadcast of the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macy%27s_Day_Parade_2376.html" title="Macy's Day Parade">Macy's Day Parade</a>.</p>

Rod played "The Head".</p>
<p>In another <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_AIDS_Day_f5c0.html" title="World AIDS Day">World AIDS Day</a> benefit the original cast of Avenue Q and the cast of the recent Broadway revival of <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fiddler_On_The_Roof_221f.html" title="Fiddler On The Roof">Fiddler On The Roof</a> came together to present a ten-minute performance which was essentially a spoof of "<i><a href="../../../f/i/d/Fiddler_On_The_Roof_221f.html" title="Fiddler On The Roof">Fiddler</a></i>" called "Avenue Jew". It begins with Trekkie Monster posing as the fiddler playing a badly sounding version of the Fiddler Theme and when he finishes, Trekkie just eats the fiddle. In a sort of epilogue to Tevye's story, he, his wife Golde, and his two remaining unwed daughters arrive on Avenue Jew, an area inhabited by Jewish puppets including: Kate Monstervitz (played by Kate Monster), The Matchmaker (played by Mrs. Thistletwat) and the rest of the Q cast (minus Lucy The Slut) who played Jewish versions of themselves. Avenue Jew is also home to some human Jews such as Brian and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannukah.html" title="Hannukah">Hannukah</a> Eve (played by Christmas Eve), the human Jews are fed up with the puppet Jews upstaging them constantly and there is great division between them. Jewish-American Princeton (played by Princeton) arrives (to the dismay of the humans who have yet another puppet to contend with) asking "What do you do with a B.A. in Yiddish?". One of Tevye's daughter's, Shprintze, falls in love with Princeton but Tevye forbids their union and, after a "If I Were A Rich Man" pun, it seems there is no hope for the couple. Rod interrupts begging The Matchmaker to find him a gay Jewish man he can marry and The Matchmaker obliges by setting him up with one of the new human arrivals: Lazar Wolf (Tevye is surprised Lazar is gay, but Lazar simply states that he is "a lonely man"). Jewish-American Princeton and Sprintze tell Tevye that they wish to be married, after a brief interior monologue Tevye consents and the couple run off to prepare. Rod and Lazar Wolf also wish to be wed, so they decide to ask permission from the Tsar... who just happens to be <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> (in puppet form). Bush forbids gay marriage, insisting that marriage is only for heterosexuals. Bush is interrupted by <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Brantley_ffda.html" title="Ben Brantley">Ben Brantley</a> who appears to ask where exactly the real Jewish people in the cast are, and the company finish with a rousing finale telling us that "everyone's a little bit Jewish" and "in theatre you can be whatever you want to be".</p>
<p>Songs that are spoofed in this performance are listed here:</p>
<p>SONGS FROM 'AVENUE Q'</p>
<ul>
<li>Avenue Q Theme (becomes the Avenue Jew Theme)</li>
<li>What Do You Do With A B.A. In English? (becomes What Do You Do With A B.A In Yiddish)</li>
<li>It Sucks To Be Me (a few lines of this are sung, with different lyrics, by Benjamin Brantley, complaining about Broadway directors casting against type, race, ethnicity and sexuality)</li>
<li>Everyone's A Little Bit Racist (becomes Everyone's A Little Bit Jewish)</li>
</ul>
<p>SONGS FROM 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF'</p>
<ul>
<li>Tradition (a small part of Tradition is turned into an argument between the puppets and the humans over who is better)</li>
<li>If I Were A Rich Man (becomes If I Were A Human, a joke made by Jewish-American Princeton)</li>
<li>Matchmaker (sung almost exactly the same as the original version however this time it is Rod asking for a homosexual Jew to marry)</li>
<li>Tevye's Monologue (becomes George W. Bush's Monologue as he forbids gay marriage)</li>
<li>Do You Love Me (Brian asking Hannukah Eve)</li>
</ul>
<p>In November <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Avenue Q's website held a "One Night Stand" contest, calling for people to register their puppets and see whose was most worthy to be put next to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Lyon_0c50.html" title="Rick Lyon">Rick Lyon</a>'s. Eventually, the contest narrowed to ten entrants, and later to three, at which point the worthiest puppet and puppeteer were voted on. Andrew MacDonald Smith and his puppet Maurice Tipo won, and thus, on March 10, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Andrew MacDonald Smith and his puppet Maurice Tipo appeared onstage during a show performance, appearing in a <a href="../../../c/a/f/Caf%C3%A9.html" title="Café">café</a> scene, singing the opening song and <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtain_call.html" title="Curtain call">curtain call</a>.</p>

<p>In October 2006, Jonathan Root and Princeton presented the award for Best Young Adult Novel at the Quill Book Awards.</p>

<p>The original Broadway cast recording of <i>Avenue Q</i> was made on Sunday, August 10, 2003, at Right Track Studio A, 168 West 48th Street, New York City. The producer of the album was Jay David Saks, one of RCA Victor’s most experienced Broadway and Classical producers and the winner of several Grammy Awards. The album contains almost all of the music from the show, with the cast and band that opened on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre on July 30, 2003.</p>
<p>The album was released on Monday, October 6, 2003 with the number 82876-55923-2.

It was nominated for the Musical Show Album category in the 2004 Grammy Awards (information from <i>Variety</i>, December 7, 2004).</p>
<p>The musical supervision, orchestration and arrangements for Avenue Q and its cast album are by Stephen Oremus.</p>
