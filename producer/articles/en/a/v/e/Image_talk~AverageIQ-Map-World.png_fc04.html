<p>Australian sub-morons would like to know how this image was derived ... maybe we can import some more of those brilliant Chinese to explain it to us. Use little words please. Oh, wait, maybe we should move this discussion to the simple English wiki.</p>
<p>IQ Scores are centered at 100 so any deviation from that (over a large, random sample of people) would mean that the test was inappropriately centered. This deviation could be the result of culturally-linked questions and different tests being used in different areas. Suffice it to say, this map is 100% rubbish.</p>

<dd>Keep - let's make clear - IQ tests don't measure intelligence or worth - they just measure something. Not surprised Australian aborigines test poorly - how could an aborigine relate to the logic and written language questions on an IQ test? How could a white American suburbanite survive in the outback? The map shows only that some people created a test, called it "IQ test", and passed it around. Doesn't mean much, settles nothing. (If there is a global environmental disaster -- and survival skills become important -- and the aborigines and Bushmen survive -- and the highly refined people don't survive -- now, that will settle it.) <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.228.224.131_acd1.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.228.224.131">68.228.224.131</a> (talk) 04:12, 21 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I done be ejibicated and I think this map could me just bout nothing with IQ. I think it i should be bout inteligents.... your loving Tassy! \</p>
<p>This map is BS, it says it's only for "indigenous" people. So what they're saying is most Australians somehow aren't really native.</p>
<p>I'm sick and tired of this racist nonsense, because it arbitrarily discounts some nations' people as being "indigenous" and others not. Fact is, every country has been formed by conquets, migrations, etc. The Chinese we know of today expanded out from the Yellow river valley, colonizing and intermarrying with the people who lived in the rest of today's China. Jared Diamond wrote an article "How Africa Became Black" about the Bantu expansion where it was the same instance of colonization and intermarriage. Hell, the ancestors of the Zulu arrived in what's modern South Africa after the Dutch did. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rsol55 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rsol55_f59c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rsol55">contribs</a>) 02:45, 21 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>I agree. technically speaking, everyone in the world emigrated, directly or indirectly, from africa as early homonids, and setting some arbitrary date at which any other cultural movement is considered different somehow is nonsense. The idea of the I.Q. map is not objectionable, but one that excludes a significant portion of the world's population for obscure reasons should be taken down until a sutable replacement can be found.--MulletManDan 21:00, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>First of all, the image should be renamed to reflect the true chart data. Secondly, I don't think Lynn intended to spark a nationality debate. This is simply a map reflecting the IQ's of the indigenous populations around the world. Indigenous meaning those inhabited in the past few millenia. He is not denouncing the citizenships of anyone in those countries. Lastly, the chart is taken way out of context. The Aboriginal population here is small, have been socially repressed and social integration isn't as well established as other countries. An IQ average does not reflect the intelligence of a social minority.Shiidii 02:57, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unsupportable chart, seemingly intended to be inflamatory and to make broad generalizations about global culture. Fails reasonability on the grounds that testing patterns for IQ of illiterate cultures and isolated groups have not even been established in many cases. Fails to distinguish appropriately amongst indiginous peoples, current occupants, transitory individuals, etc. Not endorsed by an organization large enough to bring true credibility to the information.

<p>Keep it!! I've emailed it to a load of people because i think its funny. I agree with the earlier point however that an average american couldn't survive in the outback, and similarly an aboriginal cant do an IQ test. (IQ can change drastically with a little practice.) I would have no faith that this data represents anything other than a good laugh.</p>
<p>As someone who has consistently scored high on IQ tests, I have to agree with the above statement. I couldn't hit a lick in the middle of nowhere, but I can damn sure do standardized tests. call me arrogant, but i know that while I'm smart on paper, I couldn't find my dinner if my life depended on it. IQ tests don't take that into account. I vote that the image is a moot point and no educational value is derived from its presence. 71.164.216.188 19:08, 24 January 2007 (UTC) P.s. I will get an account someday.</p>
<p>I say keep it. Certainly it's a highly controversial topic, but the sources are referenced, and also the controversy surrounding it is mentioned each time the picture is cited -- so what's the problem? There are articles on Wikipedia that discuss Holocaust denial etc -- I certainly think that's @($@ed up but it doesn't mean we shouldn't at least be talking about it and documenting it. Tribalsushi 09:46, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Furthermore, it's generally recognised that IQ tests are a) not a reliable indicator of intelligence, and b) can be (and often are) culturally biased. This isn't an intelligence map, it's an IQ map. Tribalsushi 09:51, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This map doesn't represent the average IQ of people from countries/regions, it represents the average IQ of <i>indigenous</i> people. Completely disregarding the fact the IQ tests aren't a reliable test of intelligence and prone to cultural discrimination/profiling; as well as other things that should be cleared up (validity of source material), <b>the title is at best misleading</b>, at worst deceptive. I have no opinion towards deletion, and discussions about IQ tests are for somewhere else, but incorrect labeling of a map or chart is not worthy of wikipedia. CgaWolf 04:21, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This seems to conflict with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_literacy_rate" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_literacy_rate" rel="nofollow">map of the world literacy rate.</a> Notice across the horizontal from north Africa through the middle east to southern Asia where there is alot of red indicating areas with very low literacy rates but the iq map shows that entire region as having an average iq of 85 to 90-- Then in southern africa where the literacy rate is more comfortably arround 70-80% and southern portion of Africa with iqs of 70 or less. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Adovid (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adovid_14a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adovid">contribs</a>) 04:44, 31 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
