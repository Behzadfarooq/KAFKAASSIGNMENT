<p>Avengerx, Thank you for commenting on my contributions.</p>
<p>Regarding your question "where does this quote come from?" It was extracted from &lt;Wikipediahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_%28constellation%29"&gt;</p>
<p>And in regards to your concerns that someone "less interested in the topic than myself may come along and tear it apart", I am not overly concerned about the permanecy of my additions. I only wished to contribute what I had picked up in my research on the 2012 subject. I reckon that some of my statements might be based on false notions and information once and a while but mostly I try to cite actual Wikipedia links in my discussions as often as possible in order to aid relavant research on the part of the readers.</p>
<p>As you also stated, this concern arises in case "...it remains this unfinished." However, as I understand from the about Wikipedia link on the homepage, "In comparison with most web-based resources, Wikipedia's open approach tremendously increases the chances that any particular factual error or misleading statement will be relatively promptly corrected." In this way, I have hoped that my additions, if not entirely misleading or irrelevant, may remain a part of this site and if need be, corrected by other visitors with greater insight and knowledge than I have included in my additions.</p>
<p>I will try to limit my additions in the future and try to only leave insightful, informative, and brief discussions. As for the existing documents, I will try to cite their sources and edit/ clarify/ shorten/ or correct any finding that I may later come across. - <a href="../../../t/p/a/User_talk%7ETParsons_e1da.html" title="User talk:TParsons">TParsons</a></p>

<p>My apologies for the comment with my reversal, I should have looked more closely before I spoke. There was however a problem associated with your corrections there — it seemed to introduce an antiquated version instead of the current one. I am sure it was not intentional. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 17:04, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dan100, you keep adding the Tentative info under Music Videos, and people keep deleting it. Instead of getting into revert wars with these people, why don't you cite a reference or address it on the Discussion page. I personally haven't heard anything about a 'Tentative' video, and obviously neither have others. I'm sure you have something to base your information off of, so please make a reference in order to save us countless reversions. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAvengerx_450d.html" title="User:Avengerx">Avengerx</a> 16:12, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Avengerx what a cool name dude it means you avenge jerks like me right? How can you take your job and Wikpedia seriously. I mean come on no one cares about wikpedia except a few geeks who haven't seen the light of day for years and there diet consists solely of hot pockets. Oh but I should show some respect you are a member of the <b>WIKPEDIA ANTI VANDALISM UNIT</b> the next time I decide to vandalize a page I expect you to show up with a the WAVU Swat Team. I'm sure you and your cyber superhero friends could beat me hands down in a Magic card duel. The thought just sends shivers up my spine. My vandalism was pretty darn funny though you have to admit and a fairly good satire on modern day Islam. I guess I'll leave you to your work of making sure punk 11th graders like me don't screw up HUMANITIES GREATEST PROJECT AND THE ONLY HOPE FOR WORLD PEACE WHICH IS The OMNICIENT The OMINPRESSENT <b>WIKPEDIA</b>.</p>

<dd>Mr Anoynomous User, I am sorry that you feel that way about me, but I must say I was surprised to recieve such an angry follow-up. Considering that that edit was made in <b>December</b> I really hope it didn't take you three months to type that response. Within that time frame I would have assumed you could have employed spell-check. From my studies of Islam I saw your edits as uneducated and purely inflammatory, which was obviously your intention. I hold no personal grudge against you, because I know one day you'll be older and more mature. <b>Also</b> I would like to point out that I haven't editted articles for this site en masse since early February, so I don't think your critique of me is very accurate. I do not eat Hot Pockets, as I much more prefer frozen quesidillas or fresh made pizza. I also don't know how Magic cards work, but I do have a friend who is in something like the top 20 in the country (so I guess you were right on one point). And finally, I don't believe that Wikipedia holds any hope for world peace, and I don't believe that Wikipedia's stated mission of bringing knowledge to foriegn countries will be successful or worthwhile. I instead enjoy Wikipedia for the same reason that you do, for the grand social experiment it is; and for the ability to pull up knowledge on any topic regardless of how innane it may be. Thank you, and have a nice day. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAvengerx_450d.html" title="User:Avengerx">Avengerx</a> 14:40, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey Avengerx If you consider my response angry you’re quite wrong because I could have come up with far more scathing insults. The fact is I was only joking and having a little fun at the mild expense of someone that is half way across the country. Off course my edits were intentionally inflammatory and very funny at least to my teacher and classmates. The truth is I preformed my vandalism/comments on a school Laptop that I rarely use therefore my response came so late due to the long interval between my logons to Wikipedia from that particular IP address. As far as me being “immature” I can only say that I know Wikipedia’s mission quite well and think that it is a worthy endeavor, actually I have made many contributions at my home computer via a real username after the incident in December. I can ensure you I’m not your typical one dimensional pimple faced hormone crazed self centered teenager. I too hold no particular grudge against you being that I have no idea who you are. Everything I did was born out of incessant boredom while in English class. Alas in the end we are both just two nerds on Wikipedia with time on our hands sharing in a eternal brotherhood of internet geeks except that I have no affinity for frozen food. Oh and by the way I put this one through spell check just as a salute to you Avengerx old chum,</dd>

<dd>First, I would like to express to you how much I enjoy my correspondence with you. Second, I would like to thank you for using spell-check, as it is much easier on my eyes. Third, I would like to let you know that I am actually English by birth, and that I use 'mate' on a regular basis. I'm not sure why anyone would falsibly use English vernacular, its not exactly a very hip thing to do as far as I know. If you contribute to my User or User:Talk pages further, I would appreciate it if you would refrain from vandalising my page. Also, let it be known that you have influenced me to remove myself from the Wikipedia Counter Vandalism Unit, because its obvious that I am no longer very active in the Wikipedia community. No response is necessary, so I bid you a final adieu, and ma'salaam. Avengerx 03:59, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Come now Avengerx no need for such drastic measures as removing yourself from the AVU. I was hardly implying that you should leave it in my comments. Well I', closing this chapter in my life as a wikipidian. --<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.84.48.221.html" title="User talk:68.84.48.221">68.84.48.221</a> 04:16, 17 March 2006 (UTC) is really an alter ego for me a way of carrying out black ops. I am now going to use the name Igilli which I alluded to in our previous correspondence and have been using for some time. I find our relationship quite entertaining and I will write an article on it soon.

<p>Hi. I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking a look at the article above, and expanding it further, or adding any sources appropriate for our English Wikipedia. I've already built it from a one-sentence stub using the sum total of my knowledge on the subject. Specifically, someone raised questions about the etymology of Semitic definite articles that I just couldn't answer. So I'm trying to recruit other Wikipedians with Arabic/linguistic expertise, such as yourself. Thanks very much! -<a href="../../../f/s/o/User%7EFsotrain09_ca86.html" title="User:Fsotrain09">Fsotrain09</a> 19:56, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
