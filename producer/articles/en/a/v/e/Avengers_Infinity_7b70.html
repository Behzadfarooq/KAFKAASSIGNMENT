<p><b>Warning: Spoilers follow.</b></p>
<p><b>Avengers Infinity #1: "Lost in the stars..."</b></p>
<p>The issue starts with Monica Rambeau (Photon) reminiscing about her time as a super-heroine and an Avenger, and a remark by her father makes her consider picking that life up again. Meanwhile, in deep space, Quasar (Wendell Vaughn) is having similar feelings, when he receives a distress call from a distant planet. The world, a Rigellian colony, has been devastated, its people eradicated. On Deneb-7, Tigra (Greer Nelson) is getting bored partying alongside Starfox (Eros), and they decide to go look for adventure together. Quasar, still on the razed planet, sends a message to the Avengers, requesting help from everybody that´s available. Soon, Photon joins Thor and Moondragon (Heather Douglas) aboard the latter´s ship, and within minutes, they reach the distant planet to meet Quasar, as well as Tigra and Starfox, who also responded to his call for help (Both Thor, who was once enthralled by her, and Tigra express distrust in the manipulative Moondragon, but she states she has changed since then). Quasar reveals he has found a single survivor: the Jack of Hearts, another Terran superhero. He is comatose, his armor breached, but Moondragon reads in his memories that he was attacked when he approached the Rigellian colony; his final recorded thought mentions "the Infinites". Practically immediately, the ship is attacked by a speechless, man-sized robot, a "Servitor", who stands up to all gathered Avengers, and when Thor smashes him in two with his hammer, the two halves, absorbing raw material from their surroundings, both grow into a complete Servitor. Outside the ship, the other Avengers find themselves surrounded by an army of the unstoppable robots...</p>
<p><b>Avengers Infinity #2: "...Naught but ants!"</b></p>
<p>Starfox and Tigra take on the army of robots, successfully defending Moondragon, the still comatose Jack and Quasar, who was rendered unconscious by the first Servitor in its initial attack. Inside, Thor turns the full force of his fury on the increasing number of Servitors, while Photon flies down into the planet in neutrino form, to find out where the army of robots is coming from. Once Moondragon manages to wake Quasar, he makes short work of the Servitors by trapping them underneath massive quantum-created anvils. While Thor manages to take out a legion of Servitors with a massive lightning bolt, Photon appears again, telling them that underground, there are millions more Servitors, who keep increasing in number by drawing on the planet´s mass itself. Thor, spurred on by a desire to avenge his friends, the Rigellians, wants to fight on against the new numbers of Servitors, but Photon tells him it is futile. It takes a stunning blast from the attacking robots which injures her to get him aboard the ship. Aboard the ship, the Avengers flee the planet; Photon is given medical treatment, and Moondragon proceeds to psychically probe Jack of Hearts. Afterward, she tells the others that the Servitors´ only goal is to break down the entire planet into a molten mass by absorbing the planet´s crust into their bodies until it is breached, and they themselves are melted down by the superhot core of the planet. As the Avengers witness how the now lifeless planet is transformed into a giant glowing orb of molten ore, Jack of Hearts wakes up, just in time to exclaim that the Servitors´ masters will now appear. Indeed, a spatial rift opens, and through it first passes a titanic hand, and then an armored, humanoid being... the size of a planet!</p>
<p><b>Avengers Infinity #3: "They walk among the stars!"</b></p>
<p>The Avengers look on helplessly as the gigantic entity starts molding the planet, despondent that they could do anything to stop such a being, but Moondragon reminds them even a microbe can bring down a much larger being, then introduces a newly-outfitted and revived Jack of Hearts. He retells them what they already know, and it is decided that Photon will attempt to enter the mind of the "Infinite", while Jack, connected to her by Moondragon, will translate the data she sluices through. But the vastness of the mind of the planet-sized being drags her in, and the other Avengers have to go in to rescue her, leaving Tigra (who cannot fly) behind. As they enter the immense head, they observe the titan has formed the planet into a gigantic tube or cylinder. While Starfox, Jack, Moondragon, Thor and Quasar battle hordes of Servitors to reach the brain of the "Infinite", Tigra witnesses the arrival of several others beings like him, each carrying a gigantic curved cilinder, each presumably formed out of a planet. Even as she watches, the giants start fusing themselves bodily to the cilinders to form a growing arch of incomprehensible size. The Avengers reach the giant´s brain, and as Jack drags Photon out, he receives some final and critical data. Horrified, he understands the true purpose of the enormous being, which by now has become part of a closed circle - a ring the size of a planetary orbit, clamping the very star once orbited by the planet they came to save. And then, a new spatial fissure appears... and as before, a gigantic hand reaches through... intending to grab the newly formed <i>handle</i> and dragging the entire galaxy away by it!</p>
<p><b>Avengers Infinity #4: "The hand of the Infinites!"</b></p>
<p>The Avengers flee the "Walker", as the immense robot is called, and as they return to their ship, Jack explains the intention of the Infinites: once the immeasurable hand grasps the ring, an energy web will almost instantaneously connect all the stars in the Milky Way. The Infinite will then move the entire structure to a new location, billions of light years away, which will result in the death of all life forms in the galaxy. Moondragon believes that the only thing that can possibly halt this is intervention by Eternity, the embodiment of all life in the universe, and by focusing the will-power of her compatriots through Quasar´s quantum-bands, they succeed. Eternity appears and seizes the colossal hand, wrestling it for a moment, before it and he are drawn back into the Dimension of Manifestations, a "place" where cosmic entities interact. Here, the Infinites, shadowy giants who claim to be "greater than any single reality", confront Eternity, demanding an account for his defiance of their will. Eternity protests that they are playing with the substance of his realm, upon which the Infinites respond that they only seek to improve the flow of the galaxies´ energies, by rearranging them. The seven heroes, still embodied within Eternity, proceed to offer their reasons for opposing this design, one by one. As they make their case, it becomes clear that the Infinites, far from being malevolent, simply were ignorant of the fact that life can exist on planets, which to them are small as pinpricks. In the light of these new facts, the Infinites abandon their plan, and one of them sacrifices his own life force to restore the planets that were destroyed and fill them with life again. The Avengers land on the restored Rigellian colony, which is now a virtual paradise (Albeit, as yet, without animal life), and reflect on the awesome events they have experienced, before setting out to go back home.</p>
