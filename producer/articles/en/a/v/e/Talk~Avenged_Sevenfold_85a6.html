<p>Let's try to make this NOT sound like a fanboy slobber piece, hmm? Specific objection: Last sentence. Piece overall reads more like a fluff piece than a real biography.</p>
<p><br />
I agree. The part stating "The band's use of grandiose guitar solos has restarted a trend of groups signing up talented lead guitarists in the hope of achieving the same sort of cult-like fan following as A7X." is complete non-sense. Bands have been doing that since the 80's and before, it hasn't changed. The only thing that has changed is the public's awareness of it. A7X is merely using this tactic of "grandoise guitar solos" (if you want to call it that) because it has worked for previous bands, such as power metal bands. If they really used grandoise guitar they would most likely be considered power metal more so than Metalcore.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"such as power metal bands." - Avenged Sevenfold stole a power metal riff. 'Nuff said.</p>

<p>The article claims the band's lyrics "bear no resemblence to religious teaching". They do, however, contain many Biblical references, though they might not pretain to any specific doctrine. This seems worth mentioning to me, since this statement could lead one to believe that A7X's lyrics are not influenced by the Bible, though they clearly are.</p>
<p>Why would they be influenced by the bible? They all got kicked out of Catholic school? I don't believe so. The only song I've heard that pertains to the bible is "Chapter Four."

<p>What about "Beast and the Harlot" on City of Evil? that song is riddled with references to metaphors found in the Book of Revelation.</p>
<p>"Beast and the Harlot" is not just riddled with references, the theme of the song is stright out of Revelations.</p>
<p>The article also says, "The predominant lyrical themes are ... and Apocalypse." Yes, the story of "Beast and the Harlot" is found in the book of revelations, but countless other bands have similar songs and they are not accused of being influenced by the Bible. I think its only a reference.</p>
<p>Yes. "The Beast and the Harlot" is about Babylon. Oh wow! They do it on purpose to ridicule the bible.

<p>Well if they're against God, I care. It doesn't matter as I've moved away from metalcore to some degree and as far as their new album goes, I'd rather listen to Guns And Roses. Btw, noone has said a clear cut answer: are they or aren't they anti-God?</p>

<p>I think that specifically the first two albums should be cited as metalcore. City of evil, and most likely following albums, totally stray from metalcore and are actually metal. I've read several interviews and articles that say the band was palnning on changing style since their second album, <i>Waking the Fallen</i>, but didn't because of fear of a negative response because of such a drastic change. So the question is: are they metal or metalcore?</p>
<p>There is no answer to the question. They were considered metalcore when they released "Waking The Fallen" and "Sounding The Seventh Trumpet". And now with "City of Evil" they are considered metal. No true answer to the question. Because no one knows. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearAwayTheFunerealDress_03d9.html" title="User:TearAwayTheFunerealDress">TearAwayTheFunerealDress</a> 15:29, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If we want to get technical about it, Avenged Sevenfold was considered more of a hardcore band when they came out because of there more evident punk influences ('Darkness Surrounding' for example.) Waking the Fallen continued with more of a hardcore sound than a metalcore sound drawing comparisons to such bands as Atreyu (before they turned emo and As I Lay Dying) and now they have moved on to Metal. But thats just my opinion.</p>
<p>Well A7X called themselves metalcore in an interview but hey...whatever. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearAwayTheFunerealDress_03d9.html" title="User:TearAwayTheFunerealDress">TearAwayTheFunerealDress</a> 16:29, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Avenged Sevenfold has stated themselves as being a metalcore band. However, each of their albums change styles. Sounding the Seventh Trumpet was more of a heavy/hard rock type of album. It wasn't heavy metal, but it was heavi<i>er</i> than the other two. Waking the Fallen is probably the best example of metalcore in the Avenged Sevenfold album listing. And because M Shadows blew a blood vessel in his throat, City of Evil is just where they want to be -- melodical metalcore. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanesOL79_0715.html" title="User:CanesOL79">CanesOL79</a> 15:28, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes I guess that explaination works for them. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearAwayTheFunerealDress_03d9.html" title="User:TearAwayTheFunerealDress">TearAwayTheFunerealDress</a> 16:23, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Eh.. I wouldn't ever guess that City of Evil was metalcore. "Melodic" or not. Its sounds very metal. The Band has heavy metal influences anyway, save Zacky Vengeance, but the fusion of his punk tastes engergizes the music. Despite all of these genres today, i don't even care really when it comes to A7X. I like it, and I guess that's all that counts.</p>
<p>Melodic metalcore doesn't make sense. The riffing in "City of Evil" is closer to Iron Maiden and Judas Priest than metalcore. The vocals are melodic and the riffing is straight ahead classic metal. They've pretty much dropped almost all of their metalcore sound, and very few instances of riffing similar to "Waking the Fallen" or "Sounding the Seventh Trumpet" are evident. It's my opinion that the genre should be changed to Metal with a sentence about their earlier releases being more Hardcore/Metalcore influence. When I initially read the article, it sounded to me like "City of Evil" was going to be another Metalcore album due to this reason, when that's clearly not the case. I think it should be changed ASAP. <a href="../../../j/e/w/User%7EJewofunk_7d49.html" title="User:Jewofunk">Jewofunk</a> 12:17, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe Metal would be a good classification for A7X. They still seem to have some metalcore influences on their new cd, but it is much more metal than anything else. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearAwayTheFunerealDress_03d9.html" title="User:TearAwayTheFunerealDress">TearAwayTheFunerealDress</a> 15:21, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's undeniable that they have some metalcore influences, it's just that overall, metal fits better. <a href="../../../j/e/w/User%7EJewofunk_7d49.html" title="User:Jewofunk">Jewofunk</a> 07:45, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>They're not metal. Unless of course you think Guns And Roses is metal. It's called "Hard Rock" yes, it is a genre no it's not some wide undefined genre like people say. It's a valid genre and that's where their new album falls under, not heavy metal and certainly not power metal. I'll admit that they're is some speed metal in there, but even bands such as Motorhead aren't really considered metal by purists. The band is Hard Rock with some metal influences. End of story.</p>

<p>Avenged Sevenfold's music before City of Evil is metalcore, alt.core, and maybe grindcore. City of Evil is Hard Rock, Alt. Rock, and Metal. 24.190.90.188</p>
<hr />
<p>Avenged Sevenfold's music before City of Evil was metalcore, but now they have turned to emocore (but still a little bit of metalcore). Avenged Sevenfold should not be considered as metal since it is more like emocore with a little metalcore touch. By th way, no metalhead would say it is metal... Most Avenged Sevenfold fans are emos and commercial punks. Avenged Sevenfold never was grindcore... listen to bands like Pig Destroyer if you want to get what grindcore is all about...</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not Grind, it's not prog. Emocore is completely different too. It's metalcore, now hard rock/metal. <a href="../../../x/d/i/User%7EXdiabolicalx_68c5.html" title="User:Xdiabolicalx">XdiabolicalX</a> 20:55, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Avenged Sevenfold can be classified strictly as metalcore or emotional metalcore (also sometimes labelled emocore, but different from hardcore emo also sometimes called emocore) for Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and the Warmness E.P. Waking the Fallen is very avante-garde but can still be classified as metalcore with some post-thrash elements to the music. City of Evil transcends metalcore entirely but couldn't possibly be called emocore by any stretch of the imagination. They posess none of the characteristics of emocore or emo in City of Evil. More or less they are just Avante-garde metal with metalcore influence that transcends a pathetic attempt at categorizing. And remember kiddies, having emotional lyrics and being popular with lame emo kids does not make a band emo. There is an actual musical aspect to emo and emocore that many bands who are labelled as such often lack.</p>
<p>Too bad emocore is an oxymoron. "emotional hardcore punk hardcore punk" is stupid. Anyone that wears black is now a 'emo' when they used to call us 'goths'. Anyway, point is no metalhead thinks A7X is metal because they're not. Maybe metal in your dad's "pop metal" book, but as far as traditional heavy metal, they're not. They are Hard Rock [a very valid genre by the way] with speed metal influences. Enough said. And grindcore?! Think Napalm Death's newest album. And they're first two albums were metalcore, just a more unique kind.</p>

<p>Another thing, Burn it Down was never a single. They just had a live video on it on their site. God!</p>
<p>To correct you all, number one: Burn It Down part one and two DO exist. They were promotional videos released before City of Evil was released. They were small clips of the live video, with other parts taken out.

<p>My mistake, hadn't heard enough of the album to judge it. From what I remember of it now, it lacked what was common to metalcore, but had much in common with alt. metal. Whatever, I don't feel like arguing. I do approve of what the page looks like right now though (metal/hard rock/hardcore). That should cover just about whatever genres they play or have played in, no? EDIT: I got it, it's those damn vocals, that ruins this whole album for me. You'd think it'd be good to get rid of the screaming... Either way, I don't have problems with 'metal' as long as hard rock and/or hardcore stay there as well. --<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyouga_27f8.html" title="User:Ryouga">Ryouga</a> 21:27, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Avenged Sevenfold is simply metal, THEY'RE NOT HARDCORE...Why do you classify A7X as a Hardcore band? Hardcore bands are Black Flag, Casualties, Unseen, Lower Class Brats all of those are PUNK bands...A7X has nothing in common with any of them. So explain to me how they are Hardcore?</p>
<p>158.125.1.113 - A7X have in the past played metalcore, which can't be denied, whether the new album is or not. WHat I'm saying is you cannot disallow 'metalcore' as a genre if they released however many albums in that genre. If the term 'metalcore' bothers you, as I know I usually use it as a derogatory term, I say put metal. It is wrong to label them as metal because some diehard fans think so, on top of that, they were metalcore, and that WILL REMAIN as one of their genres. --64.231.37.125 21:21, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ryouga- you have no idea what metalcore is. Seriously you should look it up. Sounding the Seventh Trumpet was a metalcore album, no question, the hardcore and metal influences were both clear. However the band now plays a style that has nothing in common with metalcore. Because of the variety in the styles A7X plays, they cannot really be pinned down to one subgenre, but debating the fact they play metal music is ridiculous.--158.125.1.113 18:55, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Ryouga they ARE NOT metalcore, I read an interview by A7X and M. Shadows (Lead Singer) clearly said "I've always classified our music as metal"</p>
<p>A7X = Not Metal. Metalcore or not, I don't care, this is not metal. I don't know who keeps putting 'metal' as the genre, but it is incredibly stupid. If Slipknot is not metal, this isn't either (I'm not saying A7X is nu metal, so don't go there.) --64.231.37.125</p>
<p>If we cannot agree on classification, then it is only fair that both genres are included. I think the arguments from both sides are strong enough for that. Make of it what you will. (My opinion, though, they still are metalcore. And I really do not see any resemblance between their so-called 'classic metal' and the classic metal of bands like Priest and Maiden.) -- 64.231.158.189 19:51, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Metal-Archives has not listed them for one reason. They are still metalcore. SCREAMING does not make a band metalcore, they still have poppy choruses (beast and the harlot) and breakdowns, things common with metalcore. If you like them that's fine, metalcore doesn't mean they suck.

<p>I did research on Encyclopaedia Metallum and just because they don't list Avenged Sevenfold as metal, does not mean Avenged Sevenfold is or isn't metal at all. This "encyclopedia" is merely another site full of opinions of countless random people all across the internet. I would take it more seriously if the only people giving opinions were involved in the music industry and I knew in what specific way they were involved... that way I would at least know that the genre placement is being done by individuals who know what they are talking about. When it's open to the public in such a way to collect "information" which is opinion and not real information... then I would be more likely to pay attention. Therefore, I disregard what that site has to say, it is irrelevant, full of opinion and probably wrong on as many counts as it is right.

-"It's undeniable that they have some metalcore influences, it's just that overall, metal fits better." Metal does not fit better; A7X still does not produce true metal, it is too poppy sounding overall. Yes, the last album was not like the others, and had more classic metal influence, but not nearly enough.

<dd>Since everyone who is NOT in Avenged Sevenfold disagrees on them being metal or metalcore and everyone IN Avenged Sevenfold is 100% sure they are making metal music and it's their band and all... let's respect that and let people come to their own conclusions... on their own. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.215.204.240 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.215.204.240.html" title="User talk:66.215.204.240">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.215.204.240_2c38.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.215.204.240">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>Okay, you people piss me off! Avenged Sevenfold are not "poppy" okay? They are from southern California, for god's sake, give them a break! Being in that area means that regardless of who you are, you're still going to end up with a lot of pop and punk influences. As is said by Matt Shadows himself, "We're from southern Cali, so we grew up listening to Rancid and Green Day, but at the same time listening to stuff like Slayer. So we were like, 'I want to play in a band like that,' 'But I want to be in a band like that!' We compromised the two and made metalcore." See? You don't have to be as stupid as you sound now, do you? -Emogoth</p>
<p>Dumb, they sound poppy sometimes, and nowaways everything with "screaming" is metalcore these days, real metalcore calls for bands like Converge and SHai Hulud. The first person is right, just because they may have things that may be associated with metalcore it doesnt mean they are a metalcore band.With a name like Emogoth no one is going to take you seriously at all, to me you just sound like another kid cashing in the new fad. -raf</p>
<p>Okay dumbass, you asked for it. Converge is actually classified stoner jams, I am in fact an emogoth, and if you really want a fad, listen to that shitty hip hop. You don't seem to know fuck about real music, so shut up before I make you! Emogoth 16:23, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you know so much about your music, why is it so important that you gotta make post on message board asking people to come here and support you? if it was a few years back, i bet your name would not have Emo in it. YOU should research about real music. make me shut up? go ahead and try. - raf</p>

<p>Just an FYI: A7X had a Tshirt a while back (availible through Hopeless Records at the time, because they didn't have their own merch site) that said "Heavy Fucking Metal" on it. That is at least an indication on what the band considered themselves at one point. I don't have any sources, because I can't seem to find the shirt anymore. I think labels are too personalized now-a-days anyways. People are too concerned about fitting in, or being individual, depending on preference. I would consider all of A7X's stuff Metal (of varying degrees) just because it sounds like other music that is labelled Metal. 64.237.142.244 20:54, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A7X said in an interview that they play "real metal music" (whatever they consider real metal to be) [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKL2gasnXJk&amp;search=avenged%20sevenfold%20mtv" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKL2gasnXJk&amp;search=avenged%20sevenfold%20mtv" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] this is the source. I find it hard to categorise A7X since they have lots of different influences like punk rock, heavy metal, classical etc. - Disposable 1:44, 01 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>i think they're origional, there own genre</p>
<p>They are Hard rock</p>
<p>Some of the songs are not original at all. Trashed and Scattered's intro is stolen from Falconer's song The Coronation. The song Unholy Confessions is ripped off of Spirit Crusher by Death. And even Chapter Four is too reminiscent of Iron Maiden's song The Clairvoyant to be considered the least bit original. Yay for metalcore ripping off heavy, death, and power metal artists.</p>

<p>Why is the band under the category of "Rock Musicians of the Political Right"? If this is going to be added as a relevant category, it at least deserves some mention in the article, because it is not obvious.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The inclusion of the band in this category is more for M Shadows, who has stated in interviews that he is a member of the Republican Party and was a deep supporter of George W Bush in the 2004 election.</p>
<p><br />
The article claims the band's lyrics "bear no resemblence to religious teaching". They do, however, contain many Biblical references, though they might not pretain to any specific doctrine. This seems worth mentioning to me, since this statement could lead one to believe that A7X's lyrics are not influenced by the Bible, though they clearly are.</p>
<p><br />
I think that specifically the first two albums should be cited as metalcore. City of evil, and most likely following albums, totally stray from metalcore and are actually metal. I've read several interviews and articles that say the band was planning on changing styles since their second album, <i>Waking the Fallen</i>.</p>
<p>Avenged Sevenfold was considered more of a hardcore band when they came out because of their more evident punk influences ('Darkness Surrounding' for example.)</p>
<p>Avenged Sevenfold has stated themselves as being a metalcore band on past albums.</p>
<p>I believe Metal would be a good classification for A7X. They still seem to have some metalcore influences on their new cd, but it is much more metal than anything else.</p>
<p>It's undeniable that they have some metalcore influences, it's just that overall, metal fits better.</p>
<p>When it comes to Avenged Sevenfold, you can either love them or you hate them. However, if you have something so incorrect and just nasty to say, find somewhere selse to put it other than the article and/or this discussion.</p>
<p>Opinion is neither fact nor fiction. Therefore it is not helping people who want to find facts. If A7X is crap the reader can findout for themselves, not because of crappy comments.</p>
<p>It's all a mater of opinion really and the reader should be able to decipher for themselves if this particular band is crap or not.</p>
<p>Some people just need to stop vandalizing this page and let people decide for themselves if the band is good or not.</p>
<p>I personally think that the band is great and I wouldn't change them for the world.</p>
<p>False information about Johnny Christ's religious affiliation has been removed.</p>

Here is one for starters and I think in this case it would be the most important. <a href="http://www.avengedsevenfold.com/main.html" class="external free" title="http://www.avengedsevenfold.com/main.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avengedsevenfold.com/main.html</a> Click on the biography link on the bottom (it won't let me directly link to it) and you will see that they call themselves a hard rock band. So maybe, to make everyone happy to some degree it can be changed to hard rock. I have read countless magazines that talk about their MUSIC (I'm not talking about rumors in articles, here) which call them metal. I have not seen them labelled as metalcore since Waking the Fallen, with the exception of the kids on this website. The band would feel grossly misinterpreted by this term being used to describe their music. You're right, there is nothing wrong with metalcore, no one with any sort of intelligence would argue such a thing because it's all a matter of taste and it isn't the point. The point is that regardless of some silly "enyclopedia of metal" website and what they think, this band does not feel they play that type of music, they don't want to be associated with that scene, they have been quite vocal about it and the vast majority of their fans know they do not play metalcore music. So if someone wants to change it to hard rock, that would be much more accurate. I was simply putting metal because that is what a lot of press has said and that is what M. Shadows has said more times than I care to remember. As I said in my earlier comment on here, the band feels that they are certain things and not certain things and regardless of what anyone else says about it, it isn't their band. -66.215.204.240</p>
<p><br />
While I'm at it, I would also like to let you guys know that interviews in the press about this band and the things the press has to say about their personal lives are not accurate. I will have a link to prove this soon, as well. This is why I have been deleting some random personal information... because not only is it false, but its source is not being posted so that people can make a reference between what is fact and what has been said in an interview, where they have said many many times that they lie, make up stories and play jokes on the press. -66.215.204.240</p>

"If you read the earlier posts you would have seen that even if we don't talk about sex and drugs at this point, it still is part of the articles people write about us. Like most people (no offense) there is obviously a lot you don't understand about the music industry. We have no choice if we get put into a teen mag. (btw i haven't seen this). Magazines don't need any permission to write about us or do articles. If we were to see something or hear something we didn't like was going to press we would have no control over it. We are a band, people write what they are gonna write, people feel the way they are gonna feel and there is just about nothing we can do about it." This was written by the singer, himself on their site, to prove my point that a lot of the magazine articles about this band probably shouldn't be taken seriously... making none of them good candidates to go on wikipedia. I'm not doing this to be a nuisance, I just want to prove to you that I am not vandalizing these pages, I'm simply taking out what is rumors/unsourced/straight up wrong/personal opinion. I, like the rest of you, want the page to contain truth. -66.215.204.240</p>
<p>Perhaps you're not familiar with how an encyclopedia works. If a magazine publishes something, and then the singer denies it, you do not simply delete the information altogether. Instead, you leave what the magazine reported, and add something like "this has been denied by ___". There is no reason to give more credibility to the band, because they might just be concerned wtih making themselves look good, whereas magazines usually have some journalistic standards and will publish things that they can back up. Look at it this way: if Hitler said he never started a war, would you delete that from Wikipedia?</p>

<p>It really doesn't matter what you think the band is. What is important is that you can verify what is written here. Since some magazines seem to disagree with the bands assesment of itself why don't you write something along the lines of "....while they see themselves as <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal.html" title="Metal">Metal</a> musicmagazines like &lt;insert name&gt; classify them as <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metalcore.html" title="Metalcore">Metalcore</a> ...

Further suggestion--- Wouldn't it suffice to say in the article that the band's genre is disputed by many between metal, metalcore and hard metal? Then once somebody asks the band which genre they consider themselves, make THAT genre their listed genre. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_J._L._Marshall_9569.html" title="User:James J. L.

<p>I know this isn't helpful at all to the discussion, but I have to say your comparison is hilarious, but very accurate. I especially like the part where you say it's like calling Mozart emo, the thought of someone actually doing that made me laugh pretty hard. Anyways, back on the subject, I agree Avenged Sevenfold are completely not nu metal...if anyone called them that I would pretty much have to hit them very hard, they have nothing in common with Korn, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Orgy, etc. besides the fact that both bands use guitars. - <a href="../../../r/a/z/User%7ERazorhead_4e38.html" title="User:Razorhead">Razorhead</a>, 9:32 PM 6 August 2006</p>

<p>People, they are METALCORE. They aren't classified as such to be insulted, it's simply a genre. If the band said they were Northern Hyperblast Whistle Metal some of you would believe them. You fanboys take them more seriously than they take themselves. They ARE NOT hardcore punk, get this through your skull. For instance, listen to a hardcore band such as Black Flag, and take note of their musical style. Then, compare this to Avenged Sevenfold. It's not shameful to be metalcore, so stop taking metal elitists so seriously and understand that metalcore is JUST A GENRE. Convalesce990 19:26, 13 June 2006 (UTC)Convalesce990</p>

<p>I'm sure you like them, and thus want your favorite band to be rememberd as X-tra brutal heavy metal, and would also like their word to be taken as gospel. But no, it doesn't matter what they say, they aren't heavy metal. Which brings me to the article, in which they are listed as heavy metal/metalcore. This is redundant, as metalcore is the fusion of heavy metal and hardcore punk. I would expect better out of those who frequent Wikipedia, as this information is readily available on the website.</p>

<p>A band cannot be hadcore punk/metalcore, since metalcore is the fusion of hardcore and heavy metal. The moron who disputes this shouldn't be listening to any core. The listing of hard rock is fine, because an advanced listener could probably find elements of hard rock in their music, especially their new album which strongly shows their influences.

<dd>I'm sorry, but that's just wrong. Any two genres can be crossed, even if one of them is already a cross of what it's being crossed with. It's just a matter of how much influence is taken. Think of it as breeding dogs. You cross a border collie and a german sheppard. After this, you mix the collie/shepard with another german sheppard. Now you have a dog that is definately a german sheppard, but looks like a collie too. <a href="../../../g/o/p/User%7EGopherbassist_0392.html" title="User:Gopherbassist">Gopherbassist</a> 22:40, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm considering contacting Larry Jacobson, their Manager, and seeing if he can help out with the article. It's just a quick email or MySpace message away. But until then, we really need to stick together with this article. It's a good article, don't get me wrong, but we can make it a lot better, in my opinion.

<p>Is it really true that The Rev is engaged to Leana &amp; Zacky V dated Gena for 2 years? Of course, M. Shadows has a girlfriend named Valerie for twelve years now, and Synyster was(?) dating Valerie's sister.</p>
<p>Rev IS engaged, it is said Zacky broke up w/ his girl. Syn is single cuz he did date Valaries twin.</p>
<p><br />
First of all, this is personal information and it's no one's business. So, I'm not going to tell you if it's true or not. I understand that now that Valary is the main character in their latest video, and a former manager of the band... she does have a place in the band's story and for that reason, I agree with her inclusion in these articles. She has played a large role in the success of this band. The other girls, or lack thereof (read: private information that is not needed in these articles) are best left out. This goes for other family members and friends who are not directly involved in the history of the band. For example, appropriate inclusions would be:</p>
<p>Brian's father, for playing guitar on the album. Brian's long-term girlfriend, Michelle, who makes his clothes and is creating a clothing line for him. Cam Rackam, a friend of the band who does their latest artwork.</p>
<p>Everyone else should really just be left out of it. I'm sure they'd prefer that, as well. I would also like to ask anyone who is listening to rumors of break-ups, relationships with porn stars, etc. to be very wary of their sources because none of these things are true and they are started by jealous 14 year old fans (most of their fan-base) in response to learning of their happy, long-term relationships. 66.214.118.69 02:15, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
ok well we know about pretty much every other celebrities personal life what makes them different? and i would like to let the person who stated that the rumors are startes by jealous 14 year olds, i am a 14 year old and i do not create rumors about anyone or anything. the people who are responsible or starting rumors are jealous people with no lives who sit at a computer all day in chat rooms, blogs, journals, and message boards creating nasty lies because they ether dont like the person they are creating the rumors for or they have no life, and it could be both. and yes im sure there are some stupid little boys and girls out there that are jealous because they want to date members of them band and all i have to say for them is grow up.--70.58.187.92 05:57, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
No one said you were to blame. There are intelligent and idiotic 14 year olds in the world, just like there are intelligent and idiotic people of every age. The reason the age of 14 is brought up is because, frankly, the fans who have been causing problems not only on this site, but several others over the years, are in this age group. Does that mean every 14 year old Avenged fan is an idiot? No. But, there's a significant portion of them who are. And that's the truth. For another thing, just because certain celebrities let their personal lives become more public doesn't give anyone the right to dig into everyone's lives, celebrity or not. It's still rude. Anyway, I agree with the changes that have been made, as far as keeping their personal lives out of it. 66.214.118.69 22:43, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok I am not understanding why someone deleted the member biography pages. Almost every other band that has a Wikipedia entry has members biogrphies unless there is too little or nothing known about the band. And someone posted that personal information should not be posted, why not, again there are very many other bands on Wikipedia that have all their personl information on them. What makes Avenged Sevenfold undeserving of these things. i have had alot of people aske me where they can find information about the band members and i have directed them to Wikipedia, and know someone has decided to remove that information. I think the member biographies should be put back up.</p>

<p>Not that it matters to me one way or the other, but isn't saying that Avenged Sevenfold left such-and-such because it's a dying genre, and then tacking on "and it is" after that the antithesis of the Wikipedian <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">NPOV</a>? Because whether or not a genre or subgenre of music is dying seems to me a very subjective POV and a hell of a hard thing to prove factually unless you're prepared to study hundreds of pages of Billboard charts and SoundScan data, and by the time you finished with that your "dying" genre would probably have rebounded back to popularity anyway.

<dd>The only way that Metalcore is dying is that bands such as A7X and Trivium are changing their styles to fit whatever their fans now think is cool, which just so happens to be Hard Rock/Metal, look at Trivium for example they started out copying Melodic Death Metal then jumped to Metalcore after KsE hit it big and now they've jumped to a sound reminicent of Metallica which no one can deny as he is even copying Hetfield's vocals. I have it on good authority that they have dropped the screaming because that is a "barrier" to the mainstream. However this can only be good for metalcore as it wont be such a bad word any more that it's not related to these bands. <a href="../../../x/d/i/User%7EXdiabolicalx_68c5.html" title="User:Xdiabolicalx">XdiabolicalX</a> 13:31, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I thought that statement was bias, also. I'm glad to see it was removed. As much as I personally dislike metalcore, it is its own genre and I haven't seen any signs of it "dying" any more than it always has. It got popular a couple years ago and then faded a bit, like most genres do. But it's still around, Avenged Sevenfold just isn't a part of it. It's fine to leave their opinion in there, in quotations... but to state it's dying like it's a fact, is incorrect. 66.214.118.69 00:49, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no need to dispute the genres of Avenged Sevenfold anymore for it does not matter. Due to the disappointment of makings after Waking the Fallen this band does not require a genre nor a name.</p>
<p>Every Band needs a genre catagorisation for indentification classifacation and just info.Paladin91 19:45, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There haven't been disputes in some time. Everyone came to the same conclusion, more or less... so I really don't know what you're talking about. And your personal opinion towards the end has even less to do with the situation. 66.214.118.69 04:45, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I think we had it settled. Waking the Fallen and before = metalcore, and COE to present = heavy metal/hard rock?</p>

<p>Someone keeps changing the guitarists' guitars. They should be for Zacky: Schecter S1 Models (Elite, Vengance Custom Models) and for Syn: Schecter C1-FR (White, Seymour Duncan Invader pickups, dot inlays) and Syn Custom Avenger Models. Whoever is changing it back to its incorrect form is most likely getting it from Chapter-Four.net, where it states the guitarists' equipment incorrectly: they have not added Syn's Avengers and does not state that Syn rarely uses his C1 anymore. Also, Zacky's equipment is incorrect stating that he uses the "Pro" S1 Model, which does not exsist. I'd appreciate it if before anyone changes the equipment, that they consult this first. --<b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a href="../../../b/o/a/User%7EBoadrummer_5b0b.html" title="User:Boadrummer"><span style="color:#Red">Boa</span></a><a href="../../../b/o/a/User_talk%7EBoadrummer_83eb.html" title="User talk:Boadrummer"><span style="color:#C85A17">Drumm</span></a><a href="../../../b/o/a/User%7EBoadrummer_Esperanza_0784.html" title="User:Boadrummer/Esperanza"><font color="green">er</font></a></font></b> 05:36, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, read this before changing any of the listed guitar equipment. Syn and Zacky ONLY use the guitars listed (S-1 Models /C-1 FR and Avenger Models)and NO OTHER ONES. A few times I have had to change it back from things ranging from the wrong model to guitars produced by completely different companies than their sponsor: Schecter Guitar Research. Know that there is no such thing as a Schecter S-1 Pro, Syn no longer uses Gibson or Ibanez guitars, and that both guitarists have their own custom models that they play almost exclusively. <b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a href="../../../b/o/a/User%7EBoadrummer_5b0b.html" title="User:Boadrummer"><span style="color:#Red">Boa</span></a><a href="../../../b/o/a/User_talk%7EBoadrummer_83eb.html" title="User talk:Boadrummer"><span style="color:#C85A17">Drumm</span></a><a href="../../../b/o/a/User%7EBoadrummer_Esperanza_0784.html" title="User:Boadrummer/Esperanza"><font color="green">er</font></a></font></b> 06:09, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Don't Merge.</b> I don't believe the page is simply a news article. It has information that was released by the band that regards the album, which will obviously be updated as more information is released by them.

<dd><b>Do not Merge.</b> While I typically do not believe in creating article placeholders, there seems to be enough information and page establishment that the article should stay as is. I believe that when fans and interested parties are searching for this said album, this collected resource will actually be beneficial within that search. Once the album is scheduled for release with a name and date, this article should be moved to the standard album title (article) format. -- <a href="../../../i/m/m/User%7EImmunity_1f16.html" title="User:Immunity">immunity</a> 22:19, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whoever put melodic hardcore for the genre of A7X in the beginning introduction is a dumbass. Melodic hardcore is used to describe bands like Anti-Flag and Rise Against. I just wrote that they are a heavy metal band, since I'm pretty sure everyone can agree that they're metal, of whatever variety.</p>

<p>Come on, as much as I hate both emo and this band they are far from emo. I realize emo has become a general insult online but really, this is so very incorrect. I know this has been disputed to death on this talk page but having them labeled as an emo band is cleary some elitist control freaks attempt at being "cleaver" or funny. Hell just say "Avenge Sevenfold is a band from..." and leave the genre out of the opening paragraph. --209.107.119.85 06:00, 21 January 2007 (UTC) duesch bagget--209.107.119.85 06:10, 21 January 2007 (UTC) man you people are discussing who knows a7x better. here i got an idea, SHUT-UP and just listen and love the music.

<p>You people take the genre of this band way too seriously. Who gives a fuck.</p>
<p>Its true who cares what genre they are just enjoy the music.</p>
<p>I think personally that A7X perposally makes they're music sound unique just to drive stupid people that have to put a label on everything insane.</p>

<p>I noticed that the article mentions that the name "avenged sevenfold" comes from Genesis 4:15, which says "therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold...." I was wondering if the person who wrote the article (or anyone who happens to be reading this) knows if that is really true. Since their name contains the word "avenged," which implies vindication, it seems incorrect to say that their name came from a verse that has "vengeance," meaning punishment more than vindication. Instead, the actual phrase shows up in Genesis 4:24, which says "If Cain shall be <i>avenged sevenfold</i>, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold." I wonder if their name actually came from the story of Lamech than specifically the story of Cain?</p>

I'll have to see if I can find the interview - or whatever I read this in - again, but I know I read somewhere that Avenged Sevenfold said themselves that, that <i>is</i> where the band's name came from. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunrise55_5d1e.html" title="User:Sunrise55">Sunrise55</a> 21:24, 15 February 2007 (UTC)SPLEEEEEEEENNNN!!!!!</p>
