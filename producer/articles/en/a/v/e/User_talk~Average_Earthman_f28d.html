<p>Hello, stuff like <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Service_Provider_022e.html" title="Network Service Provider">Network Service Provider</a> is a speedy deletion candidate and should be tagged with {{msg:delete}}. No use tagging it with {{msg:vfd}} and going through the VfD process for rubbish like that. And, BTW, if you tag something with {{msg:vfd}}, you should also list it on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a>. But for this one, if you haven't already added it there, I just suggest changing the tag to {{msg:delete}}. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 13:28, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wenura Dissanayake - just a list of stats, last sentence bizarre. No google hits, does he exist?</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I wonder would you consider reversing your decision to delete <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_Olympic_medals_count_for_2004_c694.html" title="European Union Olympic medals count for 2004">this article</a>. I have substantially rewritten it. A united EU team is not going to happen. I've discussed potential EU co-operation towards the olympics, and kept the table. I believe the table is valid, for us Europeans/EUians to see how the area has fared as a whole. Please comment on my talk page if you still feel the article should be deleted.</p>

<p>Debrett's <i>Correct Form</i> states: "It is not customary in formal usage to combine the style emanating from other sources with titles conferred by the Sovereign.

<li>I've had a look at the page, and can see you've done a lot of thorough work on it, but I'm sorry to say it still doesn't make it notable for me. I'm not looking for quantity or depth of detail, more the shining light that says why this is a particularly notable school. I'll congratulate you on the thoroughness, but my opinion of the level of note needed for a school clearly differs on the fundamental level from yours. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 12:20, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<li>You are right. There's nothing really notable about this school, yet. It's too young (only 6 years). But I think it would not hurt anybody if this and all high schools that had somebody write a thorough article on them could "stay". As mentioned in different parts of the discussion, this article is of interest to about 3,000 people every year (1,000 students and their parents). Over 20 years, it will be of interest to more than 50,000. Maybe a few of those will contribute continously to the article. I estimate that eventually Wikipedia will let High Schools "in", as it is customary for Colleges and universities. Why not start now?--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 12:30, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<li>Unless the article is trivial, rude or non-factual, or occupies a space better suited to a different topic, there's no reason to delete it. I could imagine prospective parents looking their local schools up on the internet would find the encyclopaedic article most useful. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickshanks_6da8.html" title="User:Nickshanks">Nicholas</a> 18:22, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I am contacting people who previously helped to vote to delete a generally objectionable photograph by a vote of 88 to 21, and who might be unaware that immediately after that image was voted to be deleted someone posted <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html#Autofellatio_2" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">another which was very similar in content.</a> My objections to this, and the previous image that was voted to be deleted might be based upon reasons far different from any that you have, but I <b>do</b> object to it, and consider the posting of such images to be acts of asinine stupidity, which burdens the project and its major educational aims in ways that they should not be burdened, and can be extremely detrimental to the acceptance and growth of WIkipedia's use and influence. Thus far those who I believe to be in the extreme minority of Wikipedians who would like to include these images, many who have been channeled to the voting page from the article with which it is associated have dominated the voting, 23 to 12 (as of the time that I composed this message). I would like to be somewhat instrumental in shedding a bit more light upon the issue, and if possible, helping to turn the tide against its inclusion. It might also be necessary to begin making an effort to establish an explicit Wikipedia policy against explicit photographic depictions of humans engaged in erotic, auto-erotic, or quasi-erotic activities. To my limited knowledge such images have <i>not</i> been accepted as appropriate <i>anywhere</i> else within this project, and frankly I can agree with those who are casually labeled <i>prudes</i> for opposing their inclusion, that they should <i>not</i> be. <b>Vitally important information that might be unwelcome by some is one thing that should never be deleted, but <i>un-needed</i> images that can eventually prevent or impede many thousands or millions of people from gaining access to the great mass of truly important information that Wikipedia provides is <i>quite</i> another matter.</b> There are vitally important distinctions to be made. Whatever your reasons, or final decisions upon the matter, I am appealing for more input on the voting that is occurring at <b><a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html#Autofellatio_2" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion</a></b>. ~ <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a> <a href="../../../a/c/h/User_talk%7EAchilles_ced4.html" title="User talk:Achilles">†</a> 04:22, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It has been pointed out to me the error of my ways by another. It is, I am given to understand though, not just a question of individual preference, but part of the Wikipedia protocol that one does not include editorial comment within the article.

<p>In November 2003, there was a VfD debate over <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunset_High_School_%28Portland%29_6fd2.html" title="Sunset High School (Portland)">Sunset High School (Portland)</a>. The debate was archived under <a href="../../../s/u/n/Talk%7ESunset_High_School_%28Portland%29_65ea.html" title="Talk:Sunset High School (Portland)">Talk:Sunset High School (Portland)</a>.

<p>I am writing to you because you have participated in such debates before. There still does not exist a wikipedia policy (as far as i can tell) over what to do in regards to articles about specific U.S. public school. My hope is that a real consensus can come out of the debate, and a real policy can take shape.

<p>Wikipedia is mostly black-and-white with respect to notability. For example I fail to see why the second 1992 guy is better than the one you want to delete. He is not <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rambo.html" title="Rambo">Rambo</a> either.</p>
<p>Also, there are plenty of discussions about categories vs. lists, with many people insisting that both tools have their share of usefulness. Many people see no harm in a list of 800 or even 8000 persons. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. See, e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a>. I don't care if they will list a milliion of them.</p>
<p>This is not the first case when it is difficult to decide what is in and what is out, but please remember, there should be a kind of consensus in this type of decisions (and not only for year 1992), otherwise it is just a discrimination with respect to this poor marginally notable guy, but who IMO is not less deserving than next best pornstar.</p>

<p>Sorry, I forgot to answer your direct questions.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>it your intention that the year pages should list the birth of everybody born in that year with a Wikipedia article?</i>
<dl>
<dd>No. My intention is ensure fair treatment. As long as you have guidelines in place about births/deaths, kick them boys out. Otherwise no-no.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>should we list all of them?</i>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say we should not delete them without fair reason. The same problem was, e.g., with articles for high schools. People are divided 50-50 about their notability.</dd>

<p>I noticed that you did the same in some other years. I am not going to chase you everywhere, since I don't really care about all these persons.

<p>I understand your concern, but when fan of porn stars catch up with the existence of these year/month articles, are you willing to spend your time to fend them off? Forget pornstars. What about the gray area, persons of medium noitability. Who will decide? Shall we vote each person again? You are lucky that this TV boy does not have much fans here. (I am ready to forget him, if you delete him again.)</p>
<p>But I am repeating, if you are really concerned with the issue (I am not), you <b>have</b> to start a common discussion. The year page says "Births". It does not say "Birth of real cool guys." And you will eventually waste lots of your time.</p>

<p>Hi Earthman!</p>
<p>The question you posted at Beepjeep is a good one. In general, "hoax" is not a good reason to speedy. The scrutiny an article receives when it is speedied is very small, and that can lead to some factual articles being deleted when they have been mistaken for hoaxes. Take a look at the userpage of <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> and you will find some examples of articles mistaken as hoaxes, and saved when they have been verified.</p>
<p>As for "patently" untrue as I think the Beepjeep article is, where do we draw the line between patently untrue and just untrue? What would you do if you stumbled across an article like this:</p>
<p><i>Karlsson is a fat boy who has a propellor fastened to his back. Because of this propellor he can fly. He starts this propellor by pushing a button in his bellybutton. And Karlsson is the best person in the world.</i></p>
<p>Looks quite ridiculous until you see the article <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karlsson-on-the-Roof_5b3b.html" title="Karlsson-on-the-Roof">Karlsson-on-the-Roof</a>.</p>
<p>Now with that said, I <i>was</i> quite tempted to speedy it, but decided to "play it safe" by bringing it to AFD instead.

The 2005 <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL_Grand_Final_9ad3.html" title="AFL Grand Final">AFL Grand Final</a> was one of the biggest sporting events watched in the world by millions of viewers.

Watch the full Grand Final of 2005, which was a history-making event. A 72-year drought was broken, one of the longest in sporting history.

<p>If you take issue with Mr. Raja's listing on recent births, perhaps you should nominate the article on him for deletion. Yes, he is not the world record holder and that is not his claim to fame. His youth (15 years old) is one of the major factors that give him notability and as such a listing for his birthdate seems very appropriate. Secondly, he has been featured very prominently in the media including a listing as the primary story on Yahoo News, an AP article that appeared in hundreds of newspapers, and a Today Show appearance. I will relist him and welcome you to continue this debate on the page's discussion page. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnestIsTheMan_bd1c.html" title="User:ErnestIsTheMan">ErnestIsTheMan</a> 21:12, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well I've checked the website already and why would UoN give false figures? If you try their website it just won't give any figures all together. I could only find research grants that total about 100 million pounds but no endowment figures. It is also hard to find these figures for the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_School_of_Economics_2cfc.html" title="London School of Economics">LSE</a>, so I'm wondering if these UK public schools have little need for an endowment if their government funding is comparatively large. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchonMeld_d946.html" title="User:ArchonMeld">ArchonMeld</a> 17:27, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This forum sounds like a big event; I think it's jumping the gun to speedy-delete the second article and the first article probably needs some consideration as well. Pingfan is a new user and new users tend to go away if they see their articles disappearing for what seem like obscure reasons (even if they make sense to us); you might explain on the talk page what you're looking for.</p>
<p>I've already put {{hangon}} tags on both articles.</p>

<dd>The forum sounds like a big event, yes. But then 'Sir Alan McIlwraith' <i>sounded</i> like a soldier. I put the explanation in the edit history summary - they were adverts. 128.243.220.42 12:10, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Um. Because I was assessing articles for <a href="../../../m/i/l/WP%7EMILHIST_2318.html" title="WP:MILHIST">WP:MILHIST</a> and got a bit lazy, basically.

<p>The examples you gave are not really examples of the curse in popular culture. They are just articles about or mentioning the supposed curse. In order to be considered, I think we need something like a movie, a book or even an extended comedy sketch or song about it. Something to show how the curse itself has entered popular culture. If you have any suggestions, mention them in the article's discussion page. <a href="../../../r/h/i/User%7ERhindle_The_Red_036b.html" title="User:Rhindle The Red">Rhindle The Red</a> 03:54, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I note your previous contributions to the above page.

<li>Not surprised they've reached a stalemate, to be honest.

<p>I see you and I created different articles on the same person within about an hour or two of each other (on the day this was widely reported in the UK). Your article has some details mine is lacking, with one small problem, the title is spelt wrong (<a href="../../../m/a/m/Mamohet_Weyonomon_5ceb.html" title="Mamohet Weyonomon">Mamohet Weyonomon</a> instead of <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahomet_Weyonomon_1f13.html" title="Mahomet Weyonomon">Mahomet Weyonomon</a>). Someone has suggested a merge and I was wondering if you'd like to transfer the relevant details over. I was going to do it myself, but I thought you would know the article better.
