<p>Oh, I see what you're doing. When you move a page, a redirect is automatically created from the original location to the new page. There is no need to go through and update all the links to the old page. However, if there are any redirects that pointed to the old page, <i>they</i> should be fixed.

<dd>I see. I thought that it was proper Wiki policy to change the links instead of having them go to redirects. If it's OK to leave them, I'll do that from now on. There were only about 5 pages that linked to the old one, so it wasn't a big deal, but if there were many I can see how it would be a waste of time.

<p>With great displeasure I saw that in the new article <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mule_Keys_451b.html" title="Mule Keys">Mule Keys</a> you converted the km figures to miles, with the remark that the United States would use miles. Even if this were true, I don't think that the English language wikipedia is owned by the United States. I also don't think that the United States is the only country where English is spoken. In addition, millions of users whose native language is not English, use the English-language wikipedia to look for information, since it has the most information. And most of the world uses the metric system. And the United States is changing, too:</p>

</ul>
<p>Therefore, I dare to change the article back to usage of metric units. Thank you for your understanding.--<a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatzer_f095.html" title="User:Ratzer">Ratzer</a> 13:04, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Direct quote from the Wikipedia manual of style "For subjects dealing with the United States, it might be more appropriate to use U.S. measurements first, i.e. mile, foot, U.S. gallon. " The article pertains to a place under jurisdiction of the USA, therefore USA measurements should be used. The distance between islands in the USA is measured in yards, feet or miles, not kilometers or meters. If metric measurements MUST be used for the rest of the English speaking world outside of where the article pertains, they should be listed in the parenthesis, not the USA ones, since the area the article pertains to is in USA and is subject to measurements used in the USA. - Oh, and the USA is not even close to changing over to metric. I'm not sure where you got your information, but you've been sadly misinformed. - <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverette_4e19.html" title="User:Averette">Marc Averette</a> 03:15, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you had referred to the Wikipedia manual of style at the moment you made your changes, you could have shortened this discussion. I certainly do accept what the manual of style says (as I don't place myself outside of the Wikipedia community but consider myself part of it), "U.S. measurements first", but I do not accept your interpretation of it that you can drop the metric units as you please. If there is a first, there MUST also be a second. - I gave you two indications of the USA changing to metric, and I am adding a third now:</dd>
<dd><br />
1. Microsoft Encarta in English (Microsoft is a U.S. company)</dd>
<dd><br />
2. Exclusive use of metric units in NASA World Wind (NASA is a U.S. government agency)</dd>
<dd><br />
3. Exclusive use of metric units on the pages of the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bureau_of_the_Census_395f.html" title="Bureau of the Census">Bureau of the Census</a>, which is a U.S. government agency, e.g. <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTGeoSearchByListServlet?ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;_lang=en&amp;_ts=184471117172" class="external free" title="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTGeoSearchByListServlet?ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;_lang=en&amp;_ts=184471117172" rel="nofollow">http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTGeoSearchByListServlet?ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;_lang=en&amp;_ts=184471117172</a>, where the area figures of all units, states, counties, county subdivisions, places, census tracts, blocks, etc. are given in m² (square meters)</dd>
<dd><br />
These are hard facts, not misinformation (of course you may find other examples where still U.S. customary units are used, but this won't disprove my point since I'm not contending that the USA has gone completely and exclusively metric yet). You may however keep using U.S. customary units.--<a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatzer_f095.html" title="User:Ratzer">Ratzer</a> 07:10, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
1. Microsoft is a private company that happens to be a multinational, therefore they choose to go with the most common world measurements. Irrelevant.</p>
<p>2. Same applies to NASA, since it's their World Wind site, chooses to express their data in worldy metric. I can assure you all data given to USA television &amp; radio weather forecasts is in imperial units.</p>
<p>3. I went to the Bureau of Census, the exact link *you* gave, and guess what? I clicked on the 'map' tab, chose 'select geographic type' = state, highlighted Florida, clicked 'Map It', and what was the first thing I saw? 1625 MILES across. The bottom of the map shows the scale of the map as being 1625 *miles* across, not kilometers or meters. Now, what were you saying about the Census Bureau "exclusively" using metric again?</p>
<p>USA is using imperial units and there is no "change" on the horizon that I can see. Temperature is in Farenheit, road markers are in miles. That's just the way it is here. These are hard facts. - <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverette_4e19.html" title="User:Averette">Marc Averette</a> 14:56, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On 3., I take back the "exclusive". All area figures that I have seen were in square meters. A bunch of them I used in the islands table of the <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mule_Keys_451b.html" title="Mule Keys">Mule Keys</a> article. Go ahead if you wish and change the whole table to square yards, but please leave the square meters in parentheses.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In general, the discussion of a change toward metrication is moving away from hard facts to evaluation. To me, the examples show a change toward metrication, to you, they mean nothing. We might just leave it at that. Whenever I have a chance, I'll put your yard and mile figures back into the Mule Keys article, with the metric figures in parentheses, but I don't think the table, all with original census bureau figures, should be changed (adding customary units would just destroy the design of the table).--<a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatzer_f095.html" title="User:Ratzer">Ratzer</a> 21:53, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree not to change the table. The table is straightforward scientific data and should be left just as it's sourced. The only things I wish to change are the primary paragraphs of articles that state only metric data. If it's a place in the US, it should have miles, degrees Farenheit, pounds, etc. because that's how the data is actually measured here. The metric equivalent could be put after in () for other English readers. The entire scientific world uses metric (including the US). Perhaps this leads to the false impression that the US is 'changing', but I don't see it happening in either of our lifetimes. All road signs, media reports and official (legal) documents here use imperial measurements. The schools here teach both systems, since it must be known for any type of science or engineering degree, and it would be beneficial for all the world to use the same system, but I'm afraid that's a long, long way off. - <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverette_4e19.html" title="User:Averette">Marc Averette</a> 23:00, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there, I saw that in the article <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_Island%2C_Florida_3faf.html" title="Stock Island, Florida">Stock Island, Florida</a>, you changed Raccoon Key to Key Haven. You present no reason for this change. I do greatly respect your local knowledge, and I understand that Key Haven is a common use name of the island in question, but it is not the official name as defined by the U.S. Board of Geographic Names. Is there an agreement in Wikipedia to prefer common use names over official names? Someone without local knowledge who uses authoritative sources like <a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=151:1:830975740071754724" class="external autonumber" title="http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=151:1:830975740071754724" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> to find Key Haven doesn't get anywhere. The detailed USGS topographic maps also show only Raccoon Key, not Key Haven. So what's the point? It would seem correct to me to use the official name first, and the common use name in parenthesis.--<a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatzer_f095.html" title="User:Ratzer">Ratzer</a> 09:04, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It appears that Raccoon Key is still the official name, as no maps that I can find list it as Key Haven either. The problem here is that everyone local refers to it as Key Haven. If you were to ask someone directions to Raccoon Key, they would most likely tell you there is no such place. Mention Key Haven, and anyone local would immediately point you in the right direction. Same is true for Marathon. Everyone seems to call the island "Marathon Key", although there is no such place. It's true name is Key Vaca. Perhaps Key Haven is too small to be listed as a CDP. The community name is definitely Key Haven, since there is a large decorative welcome sign at the entrance that says Key Haven in gold script. The civic association amongst the islanders that care to join is called the Key Haven civic association as well. Also the main road on the island is Key Haven Road, Key Haven Boulevard and Key Haven Terrace are also streets there. The article is also Key Haven, not Raccoon Key. If it is the official island name however, I'd have no objection to putting it back to Raccoon Key, although almost nobody that is local and reads it will know what it refers to. - <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverette_4e19.html" title="User:Averette">Marc Averette</a> 16:42, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dalbury pointed out that it's Wik policy to use the most common name as the article name. Perhaps if the introductory paragraph for Key Haven was re-worded to say "Key Haven, officially named Raccoon Key...?

<p>That is a great photo! I am being picky, but is there any way you can chop off the bottom part with the boat and the time stamp?

<dl>
<dd>It sure is. I have to take a new photo every month just to keep up. Right now there are more cranes on the skyline than there are buildings.

<p>Hi there, first I want to wish you a happy new year! Would you care, as a local resident, to apply for geographic name changes for those of the Lower Keys where official and local use names do not coincide, as outlined in <a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov/pppdgn.html#3-B" class="external autonumber" title="http://geonames.usgs.gov/pppdgn.html#3-B" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>? I would be curious of how this process works, how long it takes and how easily name changes are approved. I am mainly thinking about Tank Island/Sunset Key, Dredgers Key/Sigsbee Park, and Raccoon Key/Key Haven, but maybe you know more obvious cases.--<a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatzer_f095.html" title="User:Ratzer">Ratzer</a> 06:56, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is there a way to apply online, or does it require a petition? Sounds like something the officials in Key West and Monroe County would have to bring up at meeting and petition votes for. If there's a way to apply or at least get the ball rolling online, I'd be happy to do it. - <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverette_4e19.html" title="User:Averette">Marc Averette</a> 15:53, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The application form is on <a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov/docs/a-c.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://geonames.usgs.gov/docs/a-c.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. This is a PDF document that must be printed out and filled manually, and then returned by mail to the address given on the top right. It doesn't say that individuals cannot apply, but of course some evidence is required. So, only the application form is available online, the rest works the old way, as it seems.--<a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatzer_f095.html" title="User:Ratzer">Ratzer</a> 19:26, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I'm wondering about the Seaquarium edit. Don't you think both sides should be presented in the article? I backed up my contribution with sources, and left the part about Seaquarium helping with conservation.

<dd>There's been recent page blanking vandalism to the article. I reverted it since the added info was suspiciously similar to the other vandal edits. This happens occasionally on heavily vandalized articles. If there are reliable sources for the info you added, feel free to add it back. If one of the administrators feels it's questionable, it may be deleted at a later time, but in the meantime I'm willing to check out the facts for myself. The seaprison site appears to have an agenda - not the best source, but a reliable media site might. As long as the current info &amp; photos aren't blanked for no valid reason, I'll leave it alone. - <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverette_4e19.html" title="User:Averette">Marc Averette</a> 03:22, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

There is a simple nomination process, which you can check out on the division subpage, to make sure each candidate for collaboration has enough interested editors. This is a good way to get a lot of articles to a quality status quickly. Please consider participating.

<p>You wrote:</p>
<p><i>I was born and raised in Key West, Florida. Genuine key lime pie has meringue on top. The source you cited is complete bunk. It is someone’s personal website and is not reliable. It is irrelevant how you or people you know in San Francisco make the pie. San Francisco is not in the Florida Keys and your opinions have absolutely no merit in regards to authentic key lime pie. The description before you vandalized is accurate. You should check with proper sources become a bit more informed before you attempt to make corrections on things you know absolutely nothing of.</i></p>
<p>Hello, Averette. We Southerners certainly are passionate about our food; I won't dispute that. I appreciate your passion.</p>
<p>I was always told growing up in Miami that authentic key lime pie had graham crust and no meringue. Maybe this is yet just another subject in a long, itemized list of food items that we Southerners are known to debate about ad nauseum;</p>
<ul>
<li>"fried green tomatoes: dip in cornmeal or dip in egg batter?"</li>
<li>"Pepsi or Coke?"</li>
<li>"Chicken salad - made with mayonnaise or Miracle Whip?"</li>
</ul>
<p>Etcetera ...</p>
