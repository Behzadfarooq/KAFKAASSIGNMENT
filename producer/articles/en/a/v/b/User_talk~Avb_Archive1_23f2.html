<p>I'm comparatively new here and haven't participated in any debate here before, so if this isn't formatted right, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I am becoming severely irritated at what I have added about the science-fiction/Asperger thing being removed as supposedly anti-Aspie. I am not, having both ADHD and a lesser case of AS myself, and with a son similarly afflicted.</p>
<p>I am anti-cultural bigotry. There is a long, established history of science fiction being regarded as "that crazy Buck Rogers stuff", with a similar lack of regard for those who read it. This whole "that explains the science fiction weirdos -- they all have a personality deficit disorder" attitude is a slam which stains anyone who is a fan of the genre, and it is NOT "neutral point of view" to let a bigotry, even one held by a professional in the field, go unremarked-upon. Try substituting some other group for Star Trek fans in Attwood's remark, like Jews or blacks or Democrats, and see if it still sounds harmless.</p>

<p>Dear Christian friend,</p>
<p>I saw you on the list of Christian Wikipedians and wanted to let you know about something. The other day, someone nominated 12 Christian biography entries for deletion! They include a Christian university list of people (not unlike 68 other lists like it)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_people_by_university_affiliation_-_USA" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_people_by_university_affiliation_-_USA" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, presidents of universities, and authors of many books.</p>
<p>Since that time, people have been voting. Please take this message as a call to vote; not a call to vote a certain way. I respect you and your ability to come, read the entry, and make a wise decision. In other words, I‚Äôm not vote stacking or campaigning; simply letting you know something that you‚Äôd probably like to know.</p>
<p>By the way, my friend recently started an organization called <a href="http://wiki4christ.com" class="external text" title="http://wiki4christ.com" rel="nofollow">Wiki4Christ</a>. If you‚Äôd like to join a network of Christians with a purpose on Wikipedia, please see the site!</p>

<dd>In general I do not like this type of canvassing but I have to say that the two articles I checked out (Mike Randall and Thomas Ice) are definitely keepers. While I do not agree with quite a few of their particular insights, these people are <b>clearly notable</b>.

<p>Just a quick comment as you've been taking a bit of a "beating" lately... <i>I</i> find you very reasonable and quite easy to work with. And I tell people up front, I <i>know</i> I'm hard to get along with! Then again, if you can't get along with the Dutch, you can't get along with anybody. &lt;grin&gt;</p>
<p>I know that's overly broad but--at least so far--everybody I've met (online or offline) that's from the Netherlands has been a great example of what I understand is a national ideal of tolerance. Of the countries in Europe, were I to move, the Netherlands would be near or at the top of a very short list. I admire your country and hope you folks stick to your ideals even in the face of recent trouble with radicals who take advantage of the openness and tolerance.</p>
<p>(Not to mention, my state and country has a <i>lot</i> we could learn from your country about levees and protection against storm surges. I live just outside New Orleans which city is a definite example we aren't doing so well on that particular front.)</p>
<p>In an abrupt change of topic, I was diagnosed (turns out, incorrectly so but we didn't find that out for some time) with CFS/FMS. My mother also is believed to have FMS. That stuff could drive you crazy. Even though it now appears that's not what's going on with me, what is happening shares a great deal in terms of symptoms. It's not fun. Not at all. <i>Definitely</i>, don't let the Wiki stress you out. It's not worth the "flare ups." <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<p>Thanks for your recent edits. I note you changed the adjective form of the topic of 'Epidemiology' from 'Epidemiological' to 'Epidemiologic', are you sure&#160;?

<p>This is not much of a compromise when none of the blatant factual inaccuracies raised in section 23, 25, 29 and 30 of this discussion have been addressed. Anybody who does even the slightest research into most "facts" in this article will find them to be embarrassingly wrong and unfair to Messianic Judaism. Whenever somebody tries even the smallest adjustments to make this article unbiased and accurate, Eliezer rejects their changes and threatens to block them. I am more than willing to retain the services of a Conservative Jewish scholar who teaches at an accredited university. His expertise includes Messianic Judaism. Allow him to write an objective article that gives a neutral point of veiw. Then we should lock his version of the article against vandalism. Can we agree to that as a true compromise? 85.65.219.226 06:52, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your comments and your good faith attempt to engage this controversy. The reason I am getting annoyed is that some editors are trying to preempt the vote -- that you and I both voted in -- by changing <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> from a redirect (as it has been for months) to a disambig (which is the subject of the vote!). In any event, if you read <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28CN%29_0829.html" title="WP:NC(CN)">WP:NC(CN)</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conflict_12e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conflict">Wikipedia:Naming conflict</a>, and <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28precision%29_9b4a.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (precision)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (precision)</a>, I think you will find that our policies require us to go by the "most common usage" of the term. The most common usage of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> refers to that Church of which the Pope is head. We had an extensive, very repetitive debate about this at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Talk%7ERoman_Catholic_Church_3f0f.html#REQUESTED_MOVE_to_Catholic_Church" title="Talk:Roman Catholic Church">Talk:Roman Catholic Church#REQUESTED MOVE to Catholic Church</a>. I believe the rules require us to have <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> moved to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>, maybe with a disambiguation <i>link</i> at the top. But that has been voted down now, and now they are even trying to muddy the waters even further, in my view. The point is: the overwhelming majority of people who type "Catholic Church" are looking for info on that Church of which the Pope is head. Right? --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyphen5_402f.html" title="User:Hyphen5">Hyphen5</a> 16:18, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now <i>available for download!</i> Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Suggestions_Being_Considered" title="WP:VandalProof">here</a>. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof. Thanks to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a>, I now have an account on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://test.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">test.wikipedia.org</a></span> with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof, which I plan to make available in the near future. An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_SHM_0af5.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/SHM">simple history merge</a> tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Download" title="WP:VandalProof">download and install version 1.2</a> and take it out for a test-drive. As always, your <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_suggestions_a7f1.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/suggestions">suggestions</a> for improvement are always appreciated, and I hope that you will find this new version useful.

<p>Hi, I have a message on my talk page saying I vandalised the Mitsubishi Eclipse article. I don't know if this message was auto-inserted as a result of a spam tag on my user page, or if you misread the situation, but allow me to explain.</p>
<p>User:68.101.64.76 has been repeatedly adding a link to his car club (Florida Eclipse Club) to the external links section. As it is a very small (&gt;70 members), very regional club, in existence for less than two months, and because he has never added any actual content, I removed this link. Before doing so, I left messages in <a href="../../../m/i/t/Talk%7EMitsubishi_Eclipse_efed.html" title="Talk:Mitsubishi Eclipse">Talk:Mitsubishi Eclipse</a> and <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.101.64.76.html" title="User talk:68.101.64.76">User Talk:68.101.64.76</a>. Eventually, because he did not respond and repeatedly restored his links, I sent an e-mail to the owner of the site. Since then, he has been deleting content on my talk page and elsewhere, affixed a "spam4" tag to my talk page in two positions, and continued to spam his link.</p>
<p>I'm glad a third party is now involved in this, to give further assistance and mediation. I'm trying to leave a paper trail on <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">User:DeLarge</a> detailing everything, but his reverts are making things difficult.</p>
<p>Thanks -- <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 07:25, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks very much for your intervention in the matter. I think it would help greatly to have a third party mediating and would appreciate if you could communicate with him, since I'm worried User:68.101.64.76 feels it is a personal vendetta I'm waging.</dd>
<dd>I'll go to the abuse report section too. Thanks again for all your assistance. -- <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 08:32, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You recently reverted a paragraph deletion of <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temporal_Cold_War_98a5.html" title="Temporal Cold War">Temporal Cold War</a>, probably as part of RC patrol. I appreciate your efforts and I understand how you could misidentify the edit, but there is a legitimate debate on inclusion of that paragraph ongoing on the Talk page. Deletions by editors disagreeing with its inclusion have now been reverted several times without comment on the content. If you feel the paragraph should be included, feel free to join the discussion on the Talk page. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 19:00, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem. I've tried RC patrol once or twice, but my sanity couldn't take it. The least I can do is point things out when I believe you've accidentally run awry.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 19:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your help. I'm not quite sure how I got sucked into the article. As I mentioned on the Talk page, I just kind of stumbled onto the page and decided to wade into NPOVing it. Somehow I got somewhat personally attached to it, and I think Yaron and some others may have thus chosen to disregard my opinions to some extent. While a few other editors expressed support, your involvement (which has produced a version more sparing than my original preference, but which I agree with in terms of policy conformance) as a true outside opinion seems to have made a real difference. Thanks again.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 23:29, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I noticed you reverted an anon edit to <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G. Crawford">User:Brian G. Crawford</a>; while I don't have a checkuser to back it up, there's strong evidence that this is Brian editing while logged out (both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=63.23.13.190" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=63.23.13.190" rel="nofollow">63.23.13.190</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=63.23.71.90" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=63.23.71.90" rel="nofollow">63.23.71.90</a> come from the same place) as he is currently blocked.

<dd>Hi again, I didn't mean to be confrontational about the edit, so please excuse me if it came across as rude! I was acting under the assumption that you were reverting it for being an anon edit to another user's page, whereas the situation looked a bit more complex. Nevertheless, it seems unnecessary overkill to revert one edit (of several made by the same anon, others retained) where it's in the nature of an otherwise inoffensive 'farewell' comment. I wouldn't personally characterise it as sockpuppetry, as even blocked users are typically able to edit their user pages unless the pages are protected. (Additionally, the term is usually applied to accounts rather than anon edits.) It also doesn't appear to be divisive, but I won't do any further reverting if you disagree on that count. All the best, <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font>iggurat</a> 22:36, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
