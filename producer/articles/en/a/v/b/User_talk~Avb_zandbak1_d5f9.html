<dd>From a mailing list post by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>, Wikipedia's founder:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If a viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;</li>
<li>If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name <i>prominent</i> adherents;</li>
<li>If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) <i>regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>I would be very much obliged if someone could explain to me why we need consensus to disallow inclusion of a viewpoint supported by a single editor while no editors have presented a single citation for 6 weeks.</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think I'm being held to a higher standard than any other editor would be if Dr. Attwood had written about any other group.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>AvB, you live in the country of Anne Frank. If Dr. Attwood had said the exact same thing about "Jews" instead of "<i>Star Trek</i> fans", you wouldn't have to look for a citation on the world wide web, from an official source, to know that there would be Jewish people who would be objecting.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If Dr. Attwood had said the exact same thing about "Muslims" instead of "<i>Star Trek</i> fans", you wouldn't have to look for a citation on the world wide web, from an official source, to know that there would be Muslims objecting. In fact, if he had said such a thing about Muslims, given what is occuring in Denmark and Syria even as we speak, you know that not only would there be objections, the objections would be undoubtedly voiced in the form of riots and <i>fatwas</i> against him.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The only reason we can't find any citable objections by <i>Star Trek</i> fans to what he said is simply that fans <i>aren't aware</i> of what he said. At the risk of immodesty, I consider myself knowledgable on many topics, both popular and obscure, and I never even heard of Tony Attwood until my elder son was diagnosed with AS in 2000 and my wife and I began researching the affliction.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As I said elsewhere, it isn't that Dr. Attwood said this about <i>Star Trek</i> fans which is the issue, it's that he said it about a <i>group of people</i> without regard to their individuality.</dd>

<dd>My personal view here is not really fixed. When you said you were not the only SF fan who thinks Attwood's remark is a problem, I believed you. I hear your arguments and am not convinced there is no problem here. My point was that it can't go on Wikipedia without the citations. This doesn't say anything about me, you or Wikipedia - it says something about the real world. There is no big upheaval about Attwood's remark or you would have your sources. (I seem to recall an encouragement that people who can't get their viewpoint into WP could try and get a journalist/newspaper/whatever interested - maybe somewhere in the Help/policy/etc pages here.) But my ideas, like yours, do not matter as long as we can't cite sources. If you want to see an example where I am not impartial, just take a peek at the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Wessely_fbc0.html" title="Simon Wessely">Simon Wessely</a> article, its Talk page and its history. I (and many others) would like to add a viewpoint held by the largest minority among CFS patients. But I can't because I have no reputable sources other than personal communications. And you know what? I still think <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> is a good rule. Because for every person who has something worthwhile to share that hasn't been published elsewhere, there are a hundred who only *think* they have something worthwhile to share but will, in effect, ruin the encyclopedia by drowning out the good stuff in their static. WP:NOR, WP:CITE etc. allow editors to keep the nonsense out without needing judgement calls whether or not it is nonsense. WP:CITE is objective.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Has David ever considered approaching Attwood to share his concerns? Probably more productive than trying to voice them in Wikipedia articles.'</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It occured to me five years ago when I first encountered Dr. Attwood's remarks, about the same time that I gave an extremely positive review to the book <i>Asperger Syndrome</i> by Ami Klin, <i>et al.</i>, on Amazon.com. If I had a known, reliable papermail address, e-mail address, or business telephone number (I wouldn't presume to call him at his home) for Dr. Attwood, I would have asked him to clarify his comments long ago...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>...but in the context of Wikipedia, wouldn't that be original research? (Asked sincerely, not as sarcasm.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Definitely; but if Attwood listens to you, you will have reached your goal (I think). His response may also help shape your view of the man, and while you can't introduce the info into article space, you certainly can report it on Talk pages everywhere.</dd>
<dd>I actually read some of your reviews on Amazon and saw one or two of your usenet postings - I must admit that the picture of you I formed there was the reason why I thought we might be able to grow some mutual respect. What I saw on WP almost seemed a different person. I STILL think this is because some of the rules here are so counter-intuitive and led you to taking them personally.</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>Has David ever considered the (not Wikipedia policy related) point separately made by me and JzG that advertizing Attwood's remark via Wikipedia is counterproductive? I take it the whole point of these edits is to prevent the remark from possible (mis)use to the disadvantage of SF fans.</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I did not introduce Asperger Syndrome into the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trekkie.html" title="Trekkie">trekkie</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction_fandom.html" title="Science fiction fandom">science fiction fandom</a> articles, I was just trying to deal with what others had posted already. I was more than pleased to take JzG's suggestion of removing AS and Attwood references from them as giving them <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undue_weight.html" title="Undue weight">undue weight</a>. I hadn't done so before that because I had been under the impression that simply removing them would have been considered vandalism. (Hey, I'm still learning stuff here. I make no claim to be a Wikipedia expert.)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, I know you didn't post the original remark there. I was just making the point that you have a goal, e.g. trying to prevent damage, warning people against this type of generalizing, etc. - and suggesting that you may have better options towards realizing that goal.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think the time has come to correct David on a number of points. (Just off the top of my head - this is just the tip of the iceberg, but I have no stomach to go back into the reams of personal attacks posted on Wikipedia talk pages by David. But I think these points - mainly restricted to some that refute the above claim that I know nothing about SF fans and/or SF fandom - will suffice). But first I need to point out to David that I feel very strongly that, in stark contrast to the <i>edits</i>, the <i>editor</i> is not important. Hence, the following is not required or intended to defend my edits but mainly serve as a warning, telling David to <b>shut up</b>...</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of our differences, I have <i>never</i> told you to <b>"shut up"</b>, as you so boldly put it. This is <i>extremely</i> rude. (<a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think it measures up to some of the things you <i>did</i> say though. Make your bed and lie in it, as they say. I'm sure you can handle a little criticism like this, especially from someone you've been calling names all over the place.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>...about <i>me as a person</i>, just like I do not discuss him (except for opinions introduced into article space of course).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>What?</i> This whole <b>page</b> isn't you discussing me rather than article content? [ shakes head ] I have asked you <i>repeatedly</i> to not discuss me, or hassle me, or harass me, and it hasn't stopped you in the slightest.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Reread and see that I usually talk actions and edits, not people. I can't help it that you saw Wikipedia process as harassment. It was the only thing I could do other than getting nasty myself, and I do not want to do that. While some of the things you did did raise some eyebrows as I'm sure you've noticed. Especially requiring other people to stay away from parts of article space without any backing by at least a couple dozen or so votes against them from a User Conduct RfC, or an ArbCom decision against them... is simply 'not done' here on WP. I don't know if you intend to edit a lot, but if you do, you may want to participate in some of the debates around e.g. articles nominated for deletion (see <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>), user conduct RfCs, add your views to article RfCs and see how other people do it - all useful to Wikipedia, all part of the fast track to get oneself acquainted with the "lay of the land."</dd>

If he does not comply, regardless of whether he is right or wrong in assessing my views, I will retract my invitation (yep it's still standing) and post that third <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> warning.</p>

<dd>Obviously I beg to differ here. Also, I believe that telling someone you will post a warning template is one step friendlier than doing so straight away.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, and this is something I have tried to avoid, this is going to cast some real doubt on David's ability to judge the character of others based on their Wikipedia edits.</p>
<ul>
<li>I learnt to read with the Dutch SF comic Cliff Rendall and another one called "Archie, de man van staal" published in weekly installments in the Sjors magazine. These stories changed my life forever. I became an avid reader, devouring other styles, but nothing came near SF. The ASAR spacecraft will probably be one of my last (and fondest) memories to leave me a couple of decades from now. At the time my church viewed TV as a devilish invention but I remember visiting a neighbor just to follow episodes of a black-and-white tv series called Okkie Trooi that had an SF slant if only because they involved transporting to a different planet.</li>
<li>I am an avid reader and own (and have read and re-read) over 600 SF books. I also have some 1,000 other books on my bookshelves and have read at least 500 SF library books/e-books/magazines/etc.</li>
<li>I have viewed virtually all major SF movies and quite a few not-so-major ones. You do not want to start me on Blade Runner (unless you have hours to spend listening)</li>
<li>When it comes to TV, Startrek (TOS) is one of my favorites. (I like its sequels a bit less, which explains why I am not exactly fluent in Klingon.)</li>
<li>My oldest son (who as an 8-month-old laughed his head off at Kryten's sampled electronic sneeze after a sip of a drink on his birthday - watching the Red Dwarf BBC series if you think I'm saying Kryten is in Star Trek) has collected all available Star Strek episodes. When I told him someone on Wikipedia thought I knew nothing about SF and its fans, he smiled and lent me the Trekkies and Trekkies2 documentaries (I haven't had a chance to watch them so far).</li>
<li>My other son is deeply involved in fan fiction.</li>
<li>I am not too involved personally in SF <i>fandom</i> (the commmunity thingie) but I have considered myself an SF fan for about 45 years and counting, and I am rapidly being surrounded by SF fans that do participate in a global SF community - i.e. SF fandom.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I wrote that you had "...not mentioned [yourself] to be a science fiction or <i>Star Trek</i> fan", by which I meant that you had not mentioned yourself to be a member of active fandom -- in retrospect I should have made that more clear; and that your "expertise on fandom...seem[s] to me to be minimal at best...." (Please note the qualifiers.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Reread what you said - you were quite sure you had me down to a t in this regard.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You above confirmed that, saying you are "not too involved personally in SF <i>fandom</i> (the commmunity thingie)", which is what I was talking about. I was discussing your authortitativeness with regard to "<i>fandom</i> (the community thingie)", not whether you had ever read any science fiction books or watched any science fiction movies or television shows.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I only added the citation needed tag. You have no idea how good or bad my edits to SF fandom can be, simply because I haven't edited it. You can;t judge my edits until I make them and you can't make me stay away from articles or edits. Only ArbCom and Jimbo can.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I was <b>not</b> attacking you or attempting to insult you. I was only referring to whether or not you had sufficient knowledge of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction_fandom.html" title="Science fiction fandom">science fiction fandom</a> and <i>Star Trek</i> fandom to currently write authoritatively about them with regard to whether or not the majority of active fans were likely to have Asperger Syndrome.</dd>

<li>I intend to visit the USA next year (and to attend at least one major SF convention) and view David's contention that he is not goofy enough to start an international libel suit as a direct threat, especially since my personal details are readily available on the Internet, and have been for some 10 years.</li>
<li>I am a man, not a woman.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Would you please get off the paranoia wagon? Even if I <i>did</i> want to sue you for libel, which -- sigh -- for the third time -- <b><i>I DO NOT</i></b> -- I don't know your last name, I don't know where you live, I don't know what convention you're attending, or when. I don't <i>want</i> to know any of this. I never knew of you until this brouhaha began. Heck, I managed to even get your gender wrong.
<dl>
<dd>I believe you now. But you should realize that the mere mention of legal proceedings may earn one an instant ban by Jimbo. You either press charges/whatever, or you don't, and you are only allowed to talk about it on WP IF you really go forward with it. Those are the rules.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The reason for that last, by the way, is that when we first started disagreeing about this in late December, I looked at your User page to attempt to get some idea of where you were coming from in terms of viewpoint. At that time you just said you had children, not your current phrasing that you <i>and your wife</i> have children. I don't speak Dutch, and I mistook your first name for a feminine name as most names ending in "-ie" that I know are feminine. I apologize for my mistake.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Apology accepted but not required; it was the reason why I updated the page. I'm not offended by your getting my gender wrong; it just illustrated why I thought you had been reading me all wrong.</dd>

<ul>
<li>I do not feel that Tony Attwood is God's gift to mankind, or its Aspie/Autie subset for that matter. I own one of his books and like many others in non-NT chat rooms/e-mail lists I feel he is as often right as he is wrong where he is trying to describe our inner world. (This view cannot be added to WP articles per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> unless a reputable paper writes about it).</li>
<li>I have stayed cool as per both my character and WP guidelines, and will remain cool no matter what David says, and no matter how much he is testing the limits of my tolerance. Others should, however, not let my silence fool them into believing that his opinions of me are anywhere near the truth, his assertion that I am some kind of "professor-lover" out to protect Tony Attwood being just one example. I am, as visible from my other edits, interested in the processes in place to build Wikipedia and in becoming a good editor. (If I were anything like the strange person David describes, I would probably have written Attwood to accuse Wikipedia and David. Instead, I tried to keep Wikipedia neutral and also to protect Wikipedia (and David) against libel claims from Attwood by editing the articles per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>/<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>IF we need consensus: Highlighting some additional points regarding the current consensus status of the disputed inclusion of David's comments</p>
<ul>
<li>Several points made by David have reinforced my opinion that we should be very careful to include such accusations, especially where unsourced, in a (professor's) biography. David has done his very best to illustrate why he believes Attwood's remark makes him a cultural bigot, and a dangerous one due to its possibly grievous consequences for SF fans. Just assume for a sec he's completely right and ask yourself where that will lead us if we say such things unsourced. If David is right about the consequences, such as his California example, the Wikipedia article now contains grave accusations that simply HAVE to be fully and meticulously sourced.</li>
<li>I've been arguing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for positively months now. Taking it back to the talk pages will be a very brief affair. I've been there, done that, got the T-shirt - consensus was achieved long before David earned two warnings on his talk page and an admin became involved.</li>
<li>Consensus: (1) Of all the editors working on the Asperger syndrome article over the past six weeks, NO ONE disputed my edits of David's comments on the Attwood remark. Except for David of course. (2) I reached a consensus with David on the Asperger Syndrome article (I did not fully understand <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> at the time). It looked like this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asperger_syndrome&amp;diff=32553147&amp;oldid=32542586" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asperger_syndrome&amp;diff=32553147&amp;oldid=32542586" rel="nofollow">diff</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAsperger_syndrome&amp;diff=32577974&amp;oldid=32571140" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAsperger_syndrome&amp;diff=32577974&amp;oldid=32571140" rel="nofollow">diff</a>. When I removed the controversy section of the Attwood article after waiting a week or so for responses on the talk page, David responded by reverting both my edit of the Attwood article AND my edit of the Asperger syndrome article (reverting the compromise I had worked out with him weeks before) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asperger_syndrome&amp;diff=34349045&amp;oldid=34309597" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asperger_syndrome&amp;diff=34349045&amp;oldid=34309597" rel="nofollow">diff</a></li>

<p>Since I expected the results from the Attwood article discussion to carry over to the Asperger Syndrome, I invited editors there to participate in the Attwood discussion. Only one of them did. Another had already - after earlier discussion with David - said that s/he whould not oppose further edits by other editors regarding David's comment. I see the absence of comments from current AS editors (except for ManekiNeko) on the Attwood talk page as predictive: of the current editors, no one will come forward to support inclusion or exclusion, in which case policy will take precendence. If others come forward, it will be to support my removal of the comment (but not the remark). The same goes for the SF fandom and Trekkie articles (where I never disputed or edited David's contribution other than adding the citation needed tag)</p>
