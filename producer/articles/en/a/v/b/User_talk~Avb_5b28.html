<p>Thanks for restoring back the article to a properly footnoted system and including the additional edits. I was pretty annoyed after all my hard work fixing the citation/footnotes to have it reverted and the anon user instruct me on my talk page to leave the article alone. I had reverted back once (which was instantly re-reverted), but as I generally try to follow 1RR, I thought it then best to see if other editors might join in the discussion. Hopefully the additional comments by JDW on their talk page plus Alteripse and your involvement will help encourage the anon to accept there there are common approaches taken to citating, and of the need to work in collaboration with other editors rather than trying to "own" articles. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 23:08, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><s>David Ruben has accused me of owning the Shaken Baby article. I was upset as to how he was restructuring the footnotes yesterday. I took great pains to keep them in a medical/scientific format and looking profesional. He was color coding and making the page look like a Christmas tree including the references. In addition, to adding extra junk into in the citations. I would not have objected to the change in reference listings, except the format and the information does not need to be changed. I tried to take out one of the color changes and totaly screwed up the references and reverted to an older page to keep the page from being screwed up.</s></p>
<p>I see that he has removed all of the references for Dr, Viera Scheibner, including a quote from her paper "All examples of what Caffey considered "typical battered baby" fractures and periosteal bleedings in his papers, are in fact typical scurvy fractures and bleedings." Her paper reviewed all of Caffey's papers and additional papers and studies. Caffey even has acknowledged that scurvy was found in his first six cases that had fractures and subdural hemotomas. Apparently he was not educated as to the signs of scurvy and did not attempt to educate himself. His ignorance concerning scurvy and others is no reason to delete this information that has been medically and scientificaly documented for for close to 90 years from this page. All the Shaken Baby Syndrome has been based on in Caffey's own words is a "theory" and "a variety of circumstances."</p>
<p>David also deleted the reference for the Ommaya study (1968)in conjunction with the US Department of Trnsporation. I posted a link to Pub Med and the citation for the journal article, as numerous scientic articles that are posted on line, for validation. He has also delected the "and lactose intolerance" for the 2nd time. Some one else put it back and he deleted again; this needs to be listed.</p>

<p>Is there any way to ask David for the 2nd time not to change the format of the references? PLEASE I sent him the following note:</p>
<p>May I ask why you are changing the references and moving the years? Apparently you have no idea what the proper format is for medical and scientific refences.

<dd>My original attempt at editing the article was to move the non-associated full citations from the manually mantained reference section, to the coresponding points in the article where inline links occured. As far as I can tell, this did not involve removing any of the citations already present - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shaken_baby_syndrome&amp;diff=80505833&amp;oldid=80335898" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shaken_baby_syndrome&amp;diff=80505833&amp;oldid=80335898" rel="nofollow">edit history</a>. The only External link to move was that of (Oral 2003) which was placed in the Signs and symptoms section at its previous first mention as a Harvard link (anyway Harvard links are supposed to refer to an entry in a Reference section not an External link). On looking at the edit difference, in the Prevention section "lactose intolerance" indeed got accidentally left out of the displayed text, but only because it was placed inside the opening &lt; ref &gt; tag for its reference:
<dl>
<dd>Hence had&#160;: <i>&lt;ref&gt;"Lactose Intolerance," Better Health Channel, Victorian Government, Australia [http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/BHCV2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Lactose_intolerance?OpenDocument "Lactose Intolerance"]&lt;/ref&gt;</i></dd>

<p>The council expired one month ago, but due to the current position of the group the current council will remain until the position of the group can be assessed, and whether it would be sensible to keep Concordia going. For most decisions, however, it will be decided by all who choose to partake in discussions. I am trying to relaunch because of the vast amounts of new members we have received, demonstrating that the aims are supported.</p>

<p>Hello Avb, thank you for the helpful notes left in my inbox. I'm brand new to the Wiki way, and really only intended to fix a few spelling mistakes. I've now read nearly every article on Wikipedia regarding best practices &amp; rules, including those to which you linked. One funny thing: I've been notified by a bot that my edits are not being approved. It's frustrating (and understandable, if the bot tells truth) but I'd really like to contribute my fixes. What constitutes a "new user," and how is the next level attained? I'll keep reading in the meantime - if you respond then I'm grateful, and if not, c'est la vie. Once again thanks to you, and Happy New Year! DC</p>

<p>Yeah, I know you deleted your message on my talkpage but I'll chance a reply anyway (not on the Freudian slip though).</p>
<p>I've not worked on the CFS page for a while either, and I <i>am</i> fully aware of the fact that you play a large role in the online CFS commununity. The article presently suffers from some major problems. I'll offer you my views here, and perhaps we can come up with some form of framework to take this major topic to a new level.</p>
<ul>
<li>CFS is poorly defined. The systems that are in place (Oxford, Fukuda, Holmes, etc) are perceived as being inadequate.</li>
<li>There is no gold standard in the diagnosis of CFS. The complete lack of a useful diagnostic modality makes it almost impossible to generate a clinically homogenous population for an intervention (or even "natural history" trial).</li>
<li>There is a wide gap between what patients feel and what doctors can understand.</li>
<li>There are various schools of thought as to the pathogenesis. Some favour a psychiatric paradigm, while others find explanations in virology, autoimmune disease, endocrine causes and toxicology. These schools of thought are not well-defined, with members of the "psychiatric school" not excluding an organic cause and vice versa. I personally find myself in agreement with a hybrid approach (mental maladaption to a physical cause), but remain open-minded as to new perspectives.</li>
<li>There are a lot of people - probably too many - who claim they have found <i>the cause</i> of CFS (think of HHV6 and its incessant hype).</li>
</ul>
<p>What the article needs is for its principal editors to agree that the above are real problems that need addressing. There is <i>nobody</i> who has the final word, and that includes Simon Wessely as far as I'm concerned. It will become a nice exercise in epistemology, but I'm not afraid of that. We also need to agree that <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTRIB_743d.html" title="WP:ATTRIB">WP:ATTRIB</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> need to reign supreme in the CFS article.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear I was the one who drove you to despair initially. You didn't go into details, so I can't address this specific point. But it looks like our initiative is needed to turn the CFS article from a pile of unorganised POV junk into a shining light of Wiki quality. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 17:05, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think you're confused on exactly what the issue is. Those of us who were discussing something on the Talk page of the article were *not* discussing changing the article main page. We were discussing the template added to the historical talk page (in effect). Our comments, which were completely constructive in our own opinion, were wiped during active discussion. And a cadre of editors wants to try to force us not to talk on that page. That is not relevant to Consensus. Consensus did not dictate that no one can talk on a historical talk page, as far as I know. That is the issue. Can a person talk on a historical talk page. That's the sole issue. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 23:55, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Thanks for showing alternatives to the constant harrassment and bickering too common in the Barrett-related articles. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 03:55, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi AvB,</p>
<p>Thank you for your input, and though Levine2112 has not taken your advice well, which can be understandable considering you were also preparing a case against their evidence against Fyslee, I can see that you meant well. I suggest, that like myself, you disengage from trying to "advise" Levine2112, as this is likely to be poor use of time for the both of you.</p>
<p>Again thank you for your effort and good luck. Cheers <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethaniol_eabe.html" title="User talk:Lethaniol">Lethaniol</a> 16:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you! I think you're much more patient than I am.

<dd>It sure is hard to learn everything here with a disability. I too have my down days and can't remember a thing. I try real hard though.

<p>Hi AvB, probably time to let things go. Trying to stop these editors is just not worth it. Methinks he is just goading you into allowing you to say something "improper" so he can use it against you in some other imaginary context.

<dd>Thanks for the advice. You're probably right but I think I've created an opportunity for him to show he's not a troll so I'm hedging my bets right now. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<strong class="selflink"><small>talk</small></strong> 11:11, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have to agree with Shot info. Don't allow yourself to be baited. People seem to fall for baiting more often then not and it's really not worth the stress or the hassle of it all. I think what has been said proves without a doubt that back then it wasn't common for certifications.

<p>When you see any of my bloopers you fix it and tell me about it so I know and hopefully don't repeat and I'll do the same! With both of us being disabled especially with memory issues (my memory problems is mostly do to lots of medications I have to take) and so forth, it never hurts to have someone keep an eye out.&#160;:) I personally appreciate any help I get from anyone, that includes spelling errors, links or what ever. Can you believe I actually got published a long time ago with my writings?! It seems like another life time though now. I can't even figure out how to put the little talk boxes on my user page, yet anyways, but I'm still going to work on it. You take care, I have to say I enjoy your writing style. You are very precise and do your homework. I hope we see each other around. &#160;:) --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrohnie_e91b.html" title="User:Crohnie">Crohnie</a> 13:22, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed your comment on the talk page of this article. The source I used was the Chicago Tribune article that I referenced. I also have seen copies of articles from newspapers in the Twin Cities and in LaCrosse, Wisconsin from the mid-1990s that has similar information. I tried to be darn careful when I wrote that article NOT to put anything in it that wasn't backed up with a citation. If he thinks the newspaper article was libel, one would hope he would be suing the Chicago Tribune, because everything in the Wikipedia article is from the Tribune. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookworm857158367_aed8.html" title="User:Bookworm857158367">Bookworm857158367</a> 21:21, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I like what you did with the paragraph, but I agree with Arthur Rubin that we've got too much about NCAHF and their (stupid) legal stance. However, the current version is now in many ways worse than the original. I was thinking of reverting it back to before you started working on it, but thought I'd bring it up with you first.</p>
<p><b>Old version:</b> A California court dismissed a lawsuit filed by Barrett's organization NCAHF that accused a homeopathic pharmaceutical company (defendant) of "false advertising" and "unfair business practices."[29] Plaintiffs presented no evidence, apart from the testimony of two expert witnesses, to prove any of the elements of their claims.[30] The court stated that by law, the testimony of both witnesses (Barrett and another member of the board of NCAHF) should be given little weight, because neither witness was qualified to testify as an expert on the issues raised. Plaintiffs mistakenly argued that the burden of proof should be on the defendant to prove that its products were safe. The court further stated that both witnesses were "zealous advocates" rather than "neutral or dispassionate witnesses or experts".[30]</p>
<p><b>Current version:</b> In 2001, Barrett testified before a California court as an expert witness in NCAHF v. King Bio. The court found that "Dr. Barrett lacks sufficient qualifications" in the area of "FDA treatment of homeopathic drugs" and indicated that his evidence in this area should be given little weight by law.[29] The court further stated that Barrett and a co-witness were "zealous advocates of the Plaintiff's position, and therefore not neutral or dispassionate witnesses or experts. In light of these affiliations and their orientation, it can fairly be said" they "are themselves the client, and therefore their testimony should be accorded little, if any, credibility on that basis as well."[29]</p>
<p>The current version doesn't have the clear context of both expert witnesses being NCAHF board members. Thoughts? --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 16:52, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
