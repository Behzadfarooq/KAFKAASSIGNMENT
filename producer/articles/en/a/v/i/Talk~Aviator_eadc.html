<p>Personally I do not think JFK jr would qualify as a well know aviator. He may have been a well known public figure but this guy was far from beening well known for his flying.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(please sign your comments; presumably you are Captain433180) - I would agree at first blush, but the list does already run a continuum from the Wrights to people like Dennis Quaid and John Travolta. Then there's John Denver, sadly in the same category as JFKJr. It's a bizarre list anyway - no Ernie Gann at present? - but the community needs a decision what "well-known aviators" means. If it means "well-known people who fly or flew" it could be endless. If it means "notable people who are primarily known to history or currently for aviating" we might be able to make it more precise but less interesting (Branson in or out?) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidBrooks_470e.html" title="User:DavidBrooks">DavidBrooks</a> 18:17, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>sorry about forgetting the signature. Anyways, my beef was that when this incident happened very few people knew that he had valid licence, may it be tragic and thats one of the things that people will remember him for I still think its a weak addition. But I do agree that this list is a strange one and he should stay until there is a more clearly stated who/what qualifies. However, most people know that Travotla flies and as well as Harrison Ford (who is not on the list). To resopond about Brandson...I not sold on the guy but I would have to say yes. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain433180_cb25.html" title="User:Captain433180">Captain433180</a> 00:11, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No prob; I got scolded myself recently for the same thing. I think two lists: people who are primarily known as aviators and people for whom piloting is a factor in what we know about them. JFKJr would fit in the 2nd list, if only because of the notoriety around the accident. Some people are on the cusp; I'd put Bach and St Ex on the 1st list for example. I also think all the details about US certificates don't belong here and volunteer to branch it off. The pages relating to various ratings need rationalization anyway.</dd>

<p>I just realized <a href="../../../a/v/i/Category%7EAviators_aeb0.html" title="Category:Aviators">Category:Aviators</a> points directly to 128 entries (including this one, of course), and indirectly to several more. So is this list redundant? Perhaps this list should be limited to people of particular note. I think most of them in the Category list are "pure" pilots, but not all: it includes Harrison Ford, King Hussein, and W. Given that, does the list on this page actually include the most prominent members of each category? I'm not even particularly well-steeped in the history. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidBrooks_470e.html" title="User:DavidBrooks">David Brooks</a> 00:37, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, definitely. Licensing is a different topic. I am working on the Pilot licensing in Canada article. The ones for the US and UK are just as involved. There is no point repeating all that here. Icitrom 12:25, 30 July 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>This is clearly the wrong title for the page. I suggest moving this back to "Aviator" and possibly adding the reference to the videogame in the disambig paragraph. That means an administrator has to delete the new "Aviator" disambig page.

<p>You can pilot a boat and a ship and neither of these is similar to aircraft flying. I think the term <b>Piloting</b> or <b>Pilot</b> needs its own page; that is to say, not just a disambiguation page. All of these types of piloting share a common theme.

<p>1. There are very few military pilots listed. Anyone like to add? 2. The title was <i>Other</i> famous military pilots, which is misleading. I'll take out the 'other' - but someone may want to rethink all this.--<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_in_Devon_2e6d.html" title="User:Tony in Devon">Tony in Devon</a> 13:59, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Co-pilot currently redirects here. I will be changing the redirect to <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_officer.html" title="First officer">First officer</a>, since that's almost universally how the term is used. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorkk_d740.html" title="User:Storkk">Storkk</a> 12:04, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a very brief Rocketry stub with above title which it has been suggested comes to this page. Sounds a good idea. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_in_Devon_2e6d.html" title="User:Tony in Devon">Tony in Devon</a> 13:19, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>look, this article is <i>weirdly written</i>, and it feels pretty awkward reading it. Please <b>normalize</b> the article. 83.25.255.134 00:06, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
