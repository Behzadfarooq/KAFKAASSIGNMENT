He was possibly the one with the greatest technical skill of the early aviaton pioneers. He had made a fortune on his machine gun construction and spent almost seven years to construct an aircraft. It weighed almost 4 tons and was powered by two 180 hp steam engines. On 31 August 1894 he made his first attemt to lift off. The craft ran on four wheels on rail tracks. It never really lifted off and crashed and was destroyed when it reached the end of the rail line. Maxim also constructed other unsuccessful models. He is today most famous within aviation circles for his wind tunnel tests.</li>

The same year he flew 15 and 20 meters respectively, after having taken of from a hill. Many years later, he and his friends claimed that he was the world's first motor-powered aviator.

<li><b><a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustave_Whitehead_929f.html" title="Gustave Whitehead">Gustave Whitehead</a></b> (Gustaf Weißkopf) (1874-1927) arrived to the USA from Bavaria by the end of the 19th century. He was a skilled technician, craftsman and a visionary. According to himself, he flew 270 meters at a height of 15 meters with a motor-powered aircraft during the night of 14 August 1901, near Bridgeport, Connecticut. The aircraft had a boat-shaped fuselage. The two propellers were driven by two 20 hp acetylene gas engines. This event is mentioned in the New York Herald. By April 1902 the American Inventor publishes a letter from Whitehead, where he tells of his two flights, 3 and 12 kilometers respectively, across the Long Island straits. None seems to have noticed the article and no comments were made until 1937 when the book <i>Last Flight of Gustave Whitehead</i> was published. Whitehead might have flown before 1903, but the claims suffer from lacs of valid evidence. A small Connecticut-based group is fighting for the Whitehead cause since 1963. Whitehead himself would go on to construct some other, less successful aircraft, e.g. a bizarre helicopter equipped with 60 propellers, which never took off.</li>
