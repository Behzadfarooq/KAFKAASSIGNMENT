<p>I understand the views you express on your userpage; however, I would like to ask you to please stop attacking everyone and everything with which you disagree. Many of these problems could have been resolved if you had merely taken Martin's advice and removed the link, at least until you could reach a compromise. I'm sorry you're having some hard times at Wikipedia, but I think you just need to slow down and stop interpreting everything as a personal attack on you. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 01:52, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h1><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/i/User_talk%7EAvillia_Archive2_24f8.html" title="Edit section: Indefinite Block">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Indefinite Block</span></h1>
<p>The reasons listed for my block:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have indef-blocked Avillia (talk • contribs • page moves • block user • block log) after a string of very serious incidents. I'm bringing it here for review: 3RR and edit-warring on Criticism of Wikipedia (edit|talk|links|history|watch). Reposting of private IRC logs onto Wikipedia. Hacking of AWB to remove safety features such as the CheckPage. This was subsequently used by vandals to make fast-paced vandalism. A similar thing was done with VandalProof, another piece of software that has a check feature. A FreeNode official has investigated and confirmed that Avillia has been using IRC DCC exploits that affect me and others on the #wikipedia channel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
In order:</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, the Criticism of Wikipedia article was reverted by Jaranda saying I did not have talk Consensus. I did. I apologize when she explained it politely on the talk page, and I said to restore parts she considered in contest, which she did.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, you bet I posted 'private IRC logs' onto Wikipedia. I still stand I was in the right on that, and I will not back down. The issue was resolved after a few days, and that was that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thirdly, I was fully within my right to modify AWB to remove the authentication. I later removed it by a polite request. FreeAWB has -not- been used to make fast-paced vandalism; I clearly identified FreeAWB as itself and linked my userpage in every edit summary. In either case, edits are the responsibility of the users who do them, not me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fourthly, if there is the 'holy partition' between IRC and Wikipedia, where one does not affect the other, why am I being blocked for this duration over a supposed hack attempt? I have reviewed the evidence and while I plan on disputing the change with numerous people after it being used as justification, IRC should NOT be used as justification for on-wiki actions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fifth, I would point out that I have had direct or indirect conflicts with every person in support of my removal on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, with no exceptions. Cyde, Essjay, Benon, Pschemp, Tawker, all <a href="../../../c/v/u/WP%7ECVU_b199.html" title="WP:CVU">WP:CVU</a>, half of which I have had direct issues with, the other half which have clearly shown bias, and Jaranda who was involved with the edit dispute. Additionally, Ral315 has kept a extremely sharp eye on Criticism of Wikipedia historically, and has now used this singular issue as grounds for full reprotection (<b>not</b> semi-protection).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sixth, with the exception of one short duration block issued by <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">User:NicholasTurnbull</a>, I have not once been blocked in relation to any of these issues, and if there are grounds for a 3RR block, they do <b>not</b> equate to a indefinite block.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm requesting a unblock, if for nothing else, then to allow the dispute resolution process to handle this. There are numerous actions here which do not conform to policy, and numerous actions which I personally define as direct administrative abuse. If for nothing else, let process decide it.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Passerby non-sysop comment.</b> To whatever admin comes across this request for unblock, I'm the author of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html" title="WP:VandalProof">VandalProof</a> and was among the first involved in a dispute with Avillia. While I strongly disagreed with his actions at the time, I feel he has made ammends for the IRC logs, the FreeAWB incident, and his conflicts with me. For the record, he never succeded in removing authentication from VandalProof, and that was one of the reasons given for blocking him. I don't feel this user currently poses a threat to Wikipedia, and I find his indef block rather drastic (unless I've missed something). Had you asked me a couple of weeks ago, I would have said "Ban him!", but now he's apologized for his actions, taken down the IRC logs, taken down FreeAWB, and has actually begun helping me to improve VandalProof. I might also note that, at the time he began logging his IRC conversations, it had not yet been "officially" stated in policy that this was prohibited--as I understand it, that was first introduced into policy during Swatjester's RfA. There may be a need for a dispute resolution or an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a>, but I think indef blocking is quite unnecessary. Anyway, that's my two cents on the matter. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 04:25, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've talked about my comedial, sarcastic, gimmicky membership to the <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a> twice. Once to SushiGeek as a joke following a GNAA crapflooding attack, and once in #wikipedia after I was specifically asked by another participant.</p>
<p>As to the accusations of me being disruptive to Wikipedia suddenly; Here is my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=100&amp;target=Avillia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=100&amp;target=Avillia" rel="nofollow">edit history</a>. See how the only article I've edited in a week is Criticism of Wikipedia, and how I got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Criticism_of_Wikipedia#POV_slant." class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Criticism_of_Wikipedia#POV_slant." rel="nofollow">consensus</a>, waiting 24 hours to any objection?</p>
<p>I removed what was somewhat to blatant POV and I asked someone else to reincorporate the Britannica-Nature argument, as I was not familiar at all with that situation. She reverted it saying, and I quote, "discuss in talk page before making a large edit like that"...Which I did. I reverted it back, saying I did, and she reverted it once again. So, I reverted it again, she went to talk, she brought back the previous version and removed what was blatant POV. (A violation of 3RR on her part, as well). It was a misunderstanding, and that's it. I said I was sorry right there on the farking talk page.</p>
<p>So, what's left. Me 'disrupting' IRC, where there has been no proof to the contrary and it has been handily used as a excuse to try and indefinite block me? My creation of a software 'used for fast-paced vandalism' when no diffs have been provided? Reposting of private IRC logs over a month ago?</p>
<p>By the way, since I'm on a soapbox: Good job at the personal attack in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AAvillia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AAvillia" rel="nofollow">block summary</a>, Cyde. Same to you, Essjay, with your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=52066204&amp;oldid=52065838" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=52066204&amp;oldid=52065838" rel="nofollow">bad rubbish</a> comment.</p>
<p>One last note: I thought stacking consensus was wrong? Isn't it funny that 5 administrators managed to come across and support my block within less than a half hour? Isn't it even funnier how all of them are well known CVU members, and half of them have administrative access to all CVU channels?</p>

<dd><i>"See how the only article I've edited in a week is Criticism of Wikipedia."</i> Quite. I'm just not seeing anything to justify an extension of good faith to a person who openly admits being one of the more poisonous trolls on the net, who doesn't deny charges, made by generally reasonable people, of frigging software to vandalize Wikipedia, who hides behind technicalities when his history of disruption of IRC is discussed, and who falsely accuses other editors of consensus-stacking. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>
<dl>
<dd>You are not supposed to see anything to justify a extension of good faith. You are supposed to see something to justify removing that extension.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'll say it again: The GNAA is a joke. I've only told two people of my affiliation, one privately as a joke following a flooding attack, and one in #wikipedia when directly asked. I have not participated in GNAA actions on Wikipedia or on Freenode, nor do I want to. Membership to this group isn't hard; two membership requirements, one copy-pasting something as a first post, and the second being watching a parody movie and answering questions. I don't brag about it, I don't support many actions, and quite a few people in the GNAA aren't fond of me.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for IRC: There is no definite proof that I have disrupted the operations of Freenode or #wikipedia. A Tor node was used with my ident, my lastname, my email, my version. Three of those you can change in dialogues in mIrc, one with a very well-known set of scripting commands. The timing seems a bit convenient, no? Anyway, if we can now block for IRC, let me know; I'll grep my logs, we could have half of #wikipedia blocked by morning!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Third: I have denied charges. Have you read this page?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Fourth: The software was made to vandalize Wikipedia just as much as VandalProof and AWB were made to vandalize Wikipedia. I have not told anyone to vandalize with it, and '<i>still</i> there is no one citing a diff with the edit summary my variation uses, let alone a abusive one.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Fifth: False accusal? Two well known CVU members, three members of CVU staff. Only one, if any, is known to patrol AN:I. It is extremely unlikely that all of them happened to come across that in the course of patrolling, let alone in the space of a half hour, let alone all five supporting it, let alone without giving rationale considering none of them should have been familiar with every single thing I was accused of. Quick votes, without barely enough time to review the evidence (or lack thereof)... Either extremely irresponsible pull-first-and-ask-questions-later administrators, or they are all extremely familiar with my situation (gogo wikistalking), or they were 'instructed' (I use the term loosely for all the possible meanings) to vote that way.</dd>

<p>Since it appears my time at Wikipedia draws slowly to a close, endless harassment at every turn, constant and systematic dissemination of my life on the internets at every straightaway, double-standards and calvinball used to justify abuse and cronyism, and no one seeming to care much about showing good faith, or not being a dick, or for the policies which they were given their abilities to uphold and follow...</p>
<p>And since I'm here, sorrowful and lonely, but most of all anchored to my humble abode for a phone call related to why my editcount has dropped in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Avillia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Avillia" rel="nofollow">recent times</a>, what better time than to write a extremely long winded essay about Wikipedia, my experience, and the fundamental flaws thereof, while hopefully generating some naive tangent of empathy and guilt in those I target.</p>
<p>I wish I could be poetic enough in my sarbeonceo to describe things from the point of an outsider looking through a proverbial looking glass on a tiny world with tiny boys and girls, without any pedophillic overtones, something memorable and heartfelt... But if I could be, I'd be off writing award-winning novels and not giving a damn about some collaborative encyclopedia project on the internets.</p>
<p>So, anyway, rather than have a elequent prose and structure in suit with the fancy words I've been using, I'm just going to bound from random topic of interest to random observation until I get this talk page to 100kb and complain when someone comes by and archives it for me.</p>
<p>First, let's go about my damnation, the <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a>. Once apon a time, I joined it. There was a interesting point of view there, one which still exists, and one which could arguably be purer than many of those I've had the pleasure of experiencing here on Wikipedia. Yeah, you heard me. I've enjoyed a lot of the opinions of the members of the GNAA than Wikipedia, as one would expect a 'troll' and a 'vandal' to have after going through what I've gotten through. But, rather than string personal attack after personal attack to strike a self-inflicted finishing blow, I'll talk about the GNAA and my limited experience.</p>
<p>Amazingly, the members of the GNAA aren't as idiotic as you might expect. Just like <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Stewart_101d.html" title="Jon Stewart">Jon Stewart</a>, there is what could be argued as definite contempt for stereotypes, standards, and bureaucracy. You go to the average discussion forum with something like <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8260059923762628848" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8260059923762628848" rel="nofollow">9/11 Loose Change</a>, and you'll probably be pawned off as a nerd who urgently needs to get a tinfoil hat big enough for his head. Try the same in the GNAA, and you'll get a good hour long conversation about it. I cite Loose Change because, interestingly enough, it's a true-to-form example. Someone mentioned it in the GNAA's IRC channel, and there was a long discussion, point to point with <i><b>intelligent</b></i> points and counterpoints. Take someone else, like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Blaine_9cbc.html" title="David Blaine">David Blaine</a>, and you'll get a sect of people amazed and a sect of people who call him a pathetic slum craving attention. Unique and generally thought out viewpoints.</p>
<p>When I joined the GNAA once apon a time, I didn't know much about Slashdot, or Wikipedia, or much else. What I saw was a community with a very sharp grasp of wit and sarcasm, something which I really found lacking in the world at that time. So, one first post later and one <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5121649266422516795&amp;q=" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5121649266422516795&amp;q=" rel="nofollow">giant racial slur of a movie</a> later, I was in and that was that. I learned more, and, you know, I wasn't happy. I'm not fond of crapflooding, I'm not fond of logicless copy-paste bullion into every thread, and by and large I didn't participate. (Nor have I at <i><b>all</b></i> in relation to Wikipedia, if you've been trying to look past the <a href="../../../f/u/d/FUD_f18b.html" title="FUD">FUD</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bias.html" title="Bias">bias</a>.) For a pretty long while, I fell out of it completely. Later, I crawled back up, got in. Did a few things to curry favor in things that didn't just matter, taken credit for it all when asked or accused.</p>
<p>And, maybe I'm just trying to see the world through rose glasses and perfumed air, but I guess I don't see the logic behind discriminating against someone based entirely on their affiliations rather than their actions. I mean, I wouldn't be complaining about it if I had crapflooded IRC channels or vandalbotted articles here on Wikipedia, or hell, even done much disruptional at all aside from random god-forsaken <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_post.html" title="First post">first posts</a>. But, you know, I am. I guess I just hope that people can be a bit more logical, or a bit more emotio... No, rather, a bit less biased and clouded by shams and slander.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's four good paragraphs right there. Now's a good a time as ever to commit while I write the next hunk of garbage.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>You need to be careful about the company you keep. These past few days people have been using the DCC exploit against me on FreeNode. Well, I finally installed the fix, found out who it was, contacted a FreeNode official, and he dealt with it, confirming that the guy is in GNAA and has been banned in the past. I'm not saying <i>you're</i> doing this, but someone in the group you are affiliated with is. So you need to carefully pick the company you keep. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>Cyde&#160;Weys</b></span></font></a> 01:29, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>People getting pissed off about other people's votes at RfA and spewing platitudes like "if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all" pisses me off. Let me give you a tip, Mdd. RfA isn't your mother's tea parlor, it's a place where peoples suitability for adminship is evaluated. Harsh things are said there as a necessity. Furthermore, everyone is allowed to voice an opinion, it's up to the closing bureaucrat to decide whether that opinion matters towards consensus. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 16:54, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
