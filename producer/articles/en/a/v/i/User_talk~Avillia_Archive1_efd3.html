<p>Welcome to the wonderful world of the Freemasonry pages. I've got little interest in the main freemasonry page, but you see me editing some of the other pages including <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism_and_Freemasonry_e6df.html" title="Catholicism and Freemasonry">Catholicism and Freemasonry</a>.</p>
<p>The majority of the editors are Freemasons, and are very protective towards an institution to which they've given a large amount of their adult spare time. They are also rather fed up with the anti-masonry propoganda on the internet. This however has the unfortunate effect that they will not accept any criticism (if you think that's an exageration one said that there were no legitimate criticisms of Freemasonry - and that was one of the better of the better ones). Some of them have resorted to vandalism and blanking of referenced sources.</p>
<p>This has not been helped by an anti-Masonic editor, Lightbringer, who keeps coming back as a different sock puppet every few weeks. However, now many of the Masonic editors now use the excuse that anyone who puts in any material that is critical of Freemasonry as being a sock of Lightbringer and routinely blanking material.</p>
<p>That's probably 10% of why the editors can't get along. It's sad and you're welcome, but be prepared for some real abuse. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 20:47, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but looking over it there are some parts which should remain, like the screenwriting credits. If you think it's good, alright, change it back, just saying. --<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvillia_e750.html" title="User:Avillia">Avillia</a> 05:22, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>None of the truly famous screenwriters get lists of screen credits like that -- they just get a few mentions of their famous movies. The Dev Benegal page should not be ten times longer and more detailed than the pages for people of much greater accomplishments. (See <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salim-Javed_b5f8.html" title="Salim-Javed">Salim-Javed</a>.)

<p>Hey... Any particular reason for reverting my edits to this page? It's a shambles of a page, I'm just trying to bring it up to standard. What I've been deleting is basically bollocks that someone's written as a joke. Please leave the edits, or email about it at least!</p>
<dl>
<dd>All I see when going on a vandal reversion is a page that's been the topic of a lot of discussion being repeatedly blanked. Please copy the complete source into a text editor, make all the edits you need to, and drop it in one swoop. I know that a few others have been talking about the page as well, as the repeated blanking does, despite your intentions, appear to be vandalism. Sorry for the inconvience. --<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvillia_e750.html" title="User:Avillia">Avillia</a> 21:06, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia may not be censored for minors, but that does not mean that it is acceptable for articles to include a bunch of off-topic links to bizzare pornography. The article is about a certain website, and none of those links had anything to do with that site other than that they included pornographic images similar to those used by the site. - Conrad Devonshire 03:07, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I say again, check for consensus on the talk page. Pardoies of Goatse seemed alright for the topic, and a quick check of Talk didn't show consensus to remove. By the fact it was there and wasn't recently vandalized (unRVed vandalism) I assume there has been a editing consensus.

<dd>AutoWikiBrowser is legitimate software, which has, if my understanding is correct, been approved by a bureaucrat and I know to a fact that it is used by administrators.

<dd>Yet both of those require a form of approval, and can be denied the privilege. Your "free" AWB does not require any sort of approval, and there's no way for administrators to stop vandalism with it apart from simple blocking- users can create new accounts and continue to vandalize with it. The approval of AWB was partly because of its strict approval structure. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 14:33, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>1. Why take so many steps to secure it when the mere presence of such a tool would attract fairly seasoned vandals? I'm sure as hell someone willing to write a Squidwardian vandalbot would rather take the five skips to patch the protection schemes of AWB or VP. 2. The tools themselves aren't exactly things a newbie would find out about quick, possibly by design: A vandal would actually need to be fairly familiar with the structure of Wikipedia aside from "Edit it and hope it isn't reverted within 2 minutes", as it's not particulary prominently linked anywhere: This could even be further enhanced by changing 'AutoWikiBrowser' to 'AWB' in the subst summary. And, of course, 3.

<dd>Are you completely unable to recognize that all you've done with removing the authentication is to make it a *prime* target for vandals to easily download and use?

The point of these protocols is to make it <b>more difficult</b> for vandals to turn them into tools of mischief--you're the one trying to make it easier for them. As I remarked on VP's talk page, any vandal will the skill and patience to reverse engingeer the executable and remove the authentication would be much better off writing his own vandalbot scripts more finely atuned to his purpose.

<dd>Yes, but wouldn't that highly dedicated and intelligent vandal find it soooo much easier to simply write his own scripts? I guarantee you that if my goal was to bring down Wikipedia or commit mass vandalism via a vandalbot, I could certainly write an app much more suited to that purpose than VP. What I'm concerned about are: 1) the severely ill-intention vandal finding this cool tool and saying "I could do a lot of damage!", and as both VP and AWB (especially AWB) are becoming very widely known, it's not so unlikely that any ole' idiot would find these tools and know how to use them to do harm. 2) The inexperienced user accidentally using it in ways it should not be used, a common problem with AWB users who go through removing invisible spaces and clogging recent changes, thus the need for <i>experienced</i> users. 3) The non-vandal and possibly well-known and respected user using my tool in an edit war or to harass others while we can do nothing but watch. 4) Similarly, the good user turned bad, who pissed off at some wiki policy, goes about vandalizing while we can again do nothing but watch and block his infinite sockpuppets. 5) A new breed of Willy's, who unlike the original, don't need to know how to code the scripts themselves--they can download mine. By the way, I should note yet again that my tool is <b>FREEWARE</b>, and I feel you're wearing out your welcome with many developers. There always does seem to be that one bad egg who takes something great, something like GPL, and ruins it for everyone--ultimately what you're doing is convincing everyone that it's a bad idea to release source code. Maybe that's your intent, maybe you're a rogue from Microsoft trying to halt the freeware competition, or maybe you really are as extreme about GPL as you claim to be. In any case, thanks to you, I will never again consider licensing VP under GPL. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 03:26, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First: If it can do as much damage as you claim it would, wouldn't it be very advantageous to a vandal to both do his damage AND cause a good deal of trouble for the author of a generally helpful program? Second: Experience comes through experience. A user with 1000 edits or a user with 10 edits does the same with the help materials offered for AWB (next to nil, if I'm not confusing projects). Three: <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> is a amazing rule. Four: Blocking is a amazing tool. And, Four: Please don't licence it under the GPL if you plan on compromising the spirit of the GPL, which is free use and free modification. --<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvillia_e750.html" title="User:Avillia">Avillia</a> 03:46, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have removed the link to "FreeAWB", as this is potentially highly disruptive. Do not add it back, or any other links to the filefront page.

<p>I know this is not a legal issue, it is an issue of what is best for wikipedia. Please try and understand how this looks from my point of view, I have invested countless hours carefully developing a tool to aid in some tasks, I was also aware that this tool could be abused by vandals and more importantly missused by clueless new editors. So I spent a significant amount of time adding a restriction, and now you have just removed it claiming a "philosophical spirit", this is highly frustrating as I would never have released the software if I thought it would be used like this. Not only that but your actions are clearly counter productive to your own cause, as I am obviously not going to update sourceforge from now on, and AmiDaniel is obviously not going to release his software for further development. I suggest you remove the links to filefront and just use the normal version. When the dust has settled you could even help develop the original version, I think that would be a vastly superior outcome for all concerned than the alternative. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 20:30, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One last thing: I understand you want to promote the "spirit of the GPL", which I generally agree with, but this is an unusual situation, as usuage of the software affects other people as well. So I would politely ask you to respect the spirit that the software was developed with. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 20:45, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Avillia. I would like to kindly ask you to stop making available a modified version of AWB, which does not have the check to the AWB checkpage. I do not believe that this check is a serious hindering for any wikipedian. Applying for the inclusion on the check page is easy and handled quite promptly.</p>
<p>The original creator of AWB, Martin (Bluemoose) is not happy if you are providing such a modified version. While I agree with you, that there is nothing that you violated in doing so (if you publish your modified sources, which I believe is trivial), I personnally urge you to remove that exe from the Interent, as this <i>is</i> controversial. I do not believe that providing this modified exe is worth the trouble.</p>
<p>This would be a very kind action from your side. Please do us this favor, as I am sure you also do have an interest in keeping a good reputation of AWB. This is in the interest of all AWB users.
