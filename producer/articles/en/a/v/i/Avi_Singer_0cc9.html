<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/i/Avi_Singer_0cc9.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
<p>Singer was born in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Pedro%2C_California_5d03.html" title="San Pedro, California">San Pedro, California</a> a port town within the city of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, considered by Singer to be the "stinky little <a href="../../../g/o/o/Gooch.html" title="Gooch">gooch</a>" of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Singer's parents were both born in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>, having left in the mid-1980s due to their opposition to the <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalist.html" title="Fundamentalist">fundamentalist</a> government and in hopes of finding that whole "<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Dream_e7af.html" title="American Dream">American Dream</a>" thing everyone always talks about. Avi was an accident. His parents told him so early in life, but reassured him by saying, "You were our ticket to America." Singer jokes that he's been since "reduced to a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stub.html" title="Stub">stub</a>." Singer's first laungauge was <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a>, and he'd learned English by first grade. His father had already known the English launguage, due to the fact that he had lived in the U.S. years before he met Singer's mother, during a trip back to Iran to visit family. He left the United States a graduate student, a bachelor in his physical and intellectual prime, and returned broke, married, worn down, and expecting a baby boy. "No wonder he hates me," Singer remarks, "I totally fucked his shit up."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/i/Avi_Singer_0cc9.html" title="Edit section: Education">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h3>
<p>Singer attended <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Henry_Dana_Middle_School_ad50.html" title="Richard Henry Dana Middle School">Richard Henry Dana Middle School</a> and had developed a problem acclimating to the strict ways of the schools very early on. He cut himself off from the rest of his classmates during middle school and routinley ditched school and cut classes. When he did attend class, he'd typically sleep through it. The school responded by putting him in special ed classes and Impact, though to no avail. He got straight Fs.</p>
<p>His parents and the school reacted by placing him in a school for troubled and <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mentally_challenged.html" title="Mentally challenged">mentally challenged</a> kids, where he met an early muse for his writings, his close friend, John Nuttman. Though normally on friendly terms with most students, they were harassed still in this new school, this time by their teachers who considered Singer and Nuttman rabble-rousers, who were, Singer and Nuttman both agree, "total douchebags." Singer and Nuttman took to playing pranks on teachers and administrators, circulating incendiary pieces of art, playing hookie, and smoking <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a>. Singer recalls in <i>Fairy Tale</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Back in the slave days, resistance was not a blueprinted master plan. It was a way of life. Of course, there were uprisings and revolts and so on. But they were relatively few, and usually unsuccessful. On the other hand, daily acts of resistance and noncompliance were constant and took many forms. Slaves would leave their hoes and rakes and other metallic tools out in the rain so they’d rust and become useless. They’d urinate in their masters’ food. They’d steal livestock and sell them in secret. They’d do all kinds of treacherous things. In the 1800s, a prominent Louisiana surgeon and psychologist, Dr. Samuel A. Cartwright, attempted to explain the mental disease that was causing North American slaves to resist slavery and desire freedom. He called it “Drapetomania”. John suffers from Drapetomania. Every day, during every break we get, John, this scruffy, poofy-haired whiteboy, he’ll go to the cafeteria and steal a dozen little cartons of 2% milk, and put them in his backpack. Then, he’ll go for a stroll. He’d make several stops. The principle’s office, the dean’s office, the school police, the library, the school gym, and the classrooms of six of his least favorite teachers. He uses a paperclip to make his way in. He leaves it right under their desks or at the edge of their doors so the milk would spill into the rooms. Twelve milks. Eleven targets. The other one, he’d drink. Because he’d get thirsty from walking around and the water fountains have wads of gum stuffed in them so you can’t drink. Milk. Open. Tipped over. Always in the same places. Facing the same direction. Glup, glup, glup. Out onto the carpet and then sinks into the fibers. The smell, the smell of old feta cheese mixed with vinegar, it gets worse with each passing day. Each week. Month after month. The stains are virtually irremovable. It drives the teachers crazy. By the time the janitors get to the spill, all of it has seeped into the carpet and there is really nothing else that can be done. Except throw away the little carton. He’s been doing this for years. There are cameras all over the school but there are so many kids swarming the place that it is easy to get lost in the crowd. And, over the years, John has become a master in his craft. Like Andy Dufrain pouring dirt out his pant legs on the Shawshank prison yard. John, he is the Spartacus of his generation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Singer attended San Pedro High School. In <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a> things got a little better, but a little worse. He did most of the same until he met his writing partner and co-founder of Something Dancey, Ed Roy Murrin. They made an immediate connection, due to the fact that they were the only two kids in the school read <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>. Due to their common tastes and interests, not to mention their pissed-offed-ness at the world around them, they quickly began collaborating on ideas and trying a hand at numerous mediums of artistic expression. From music, to independent film-making, to literature and art. As Singer says, "Nothing is off limits ... Except interpretive dance. That's totally off limits." Singer has since dropped out of high school and is pursuing other options.</p>

<p>Singer is currently preparing to launch Something Dancey magazine with fellow founder Ed Roy Murrin, and co-editors Cecil Del Toro and Mickey Issac Grace. It is to be an indepenent, non-profit magazine dedicated to the advancement of alternative art and living. It is meant to be, as Singer puts it, "a soapbox for our brothers and sisters to stand on and shout, and, if necessary, throw a Molotov cocktail or two." Though the issue is ready for printing, the crew is currently addressing financial and distribution concerns. The launch date is estimated for early 2007.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/i/Avi_Singer_0cc9.html" title="Edit section: Religion and Politics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Religion and Politics</span></h2>
<p>Singer is known for his outspoken views on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a>. His parents were traditionally <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslims.html" title="Muslims">muslims</a>, though actually far more on the atheist/agnostic end of the spectrum. Singer considers himself an <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheist.html" title="Atheist">atheist</a>, but puts little importance on the label:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, I don't know if there is a God out there. And quite honestly, I don't think I even care. Because whether or not there is some higher power, some impetus or purpose for our universe or the infinite collection of other universes bound to exist infinitely beyond our reach, the fact of the matter is that I am screwed no matter what. Even if there was some vague purpose in existence, why would I be so arrogant as to assume I'm a part of it. The universe went on without me for eons before I was born, it'll manage just fine after I'm dead and in the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite his lack of faith in God, Singer tries to keep faith in human kind, though it can often be difficult. He is an avowed <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist.html" title="Anarchist">anarchist</a> of the libertarian socialist variety, resenting the authoritarian designs and tendencies of major political and economic institutions. He is an avid reader of <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Zinn_965b.html" title="Howard Zinn">Howard Zinn</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Blum_02dc.html" title="William Blum">William Blum</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, and identifies strongly with the political philosophy of 19th Century anarchist thinker <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>.</p>
