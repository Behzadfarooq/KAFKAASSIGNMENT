<dd>Thanks. That was an oversight, that I've now corrected. They now all (except asian bird flu) point to this article. I also fixed the flu template link so the avian flu link goes here. And I fixed the H5N1 template's influenzavirus A link so it says that is what it is (before it said avian flu).

<p>I removed the word virus caused the horse, dog and swine flu articles didn't have them. But does avian flu, in the "correct" form, refers to the virus or the diesease? --<a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodo_bird_75a9.html" title="User:Dodo bird">Dodo bird</a> 21:01, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Flu" is a disease, not a virus. But people are often inexact when communicating, so while "flu" isn't a virus it is often used to <b>refer</b> to the virus. I did not care to go into all that in every single flu article. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 22:46, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So what's the rational for the revert? Did the facts get twisted after my rewrite? I just reworded the main points to make it more understandable(hopefully) and remove the links I find unecessary. --<a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodo_bird_75a9.html" title="User:Dodo bird">Dodo bird</a> 23:24, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your rewording made it worse. You deletions are completly unacceptable. They not <b>just</b> a list of links. Read it. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 00:42, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do understand that they are not just a list of links(yes! I read before I edit), I just find them unecessary. Look at the current wording of the sentence
<dl>
<dd>So "avian flu", "bird flu", "avian influenza", and "bird influenza" all mean the same thing; but are all used to mean these very different things:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Is the reader supposed to know what that means? The attempt to overexplain doesn't seem to make it clearer. What I did (or thought I did) was to make it clearer. I didn't just delete those links, I worked them into the newer version.If you look at the seven links, three of them("The influenza A viruses", "Influenza A viruses which are adapted to birds" and "Flu from influenza A viruses which are adapted to birds") points to the same article. So avian flu refers to the influenza A. The reader already knows that from the main article tag and the two mention of it in the first paragraph. Having three different terms point to the same article is going to confuse the reader. The other links are found in the article main section and see also section and I would say the wording of the articles give enough "clues" on the usage of the terms. And more detailed explanations for the terms are only a click away. --<a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodo_bird_75a9.html" title="User:Dodo bird">Dodo bird</a> 16:30, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm sorry that you don't understand what you deleted. Yes, the reader is expected to understand it. It is clear and plain english and only needs to be taken one word at a time to understand. You might believe you understood what you deleted, but your words above clearly show you don't. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 17:43, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anyway, this conversation proves we have a clarity issue, so I've started the below vote on what is the clearest way to say what is being said. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 18:10, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think you missed my point. Is the "so avian flu, bird flu etc... means the same thing" statement necessary? Doesn't the opening line "Avian flu (also known as...)" explain exactly that? <strike>And are the terms avian flu, bird flu, avian influenza really interchangeble</strike>.--<a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodo_bird_75a9.html" title="User:Dodo bird">Dodo bird</a> 19:03, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And since the strict meaning of Avian flu means the flu caused by the influenza A virus(already linked as main article), the other meanings are "incorrect" and shouldn't be associated as what Avian flu can mean but left as internal links in the main text. The reader can do his/her own association. -- <a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodo_bird_75a9.html" title="User:Dodo bird">Dodo bird</a> 19:51, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just another minor qn. Ignoring the portion I removed, is my reworded text<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avian_flu&amp;diff=45463155&amp;oldid=45450813" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avian_flu&amp;diff=45463155&amp;oldid=45450813" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> factually correct?--<a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodo_bird_75a9.html" title="User:Dodo bird">Dodo bird</a> 20:01, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All four options don't touch on the point I was trying to make. If we have to keep a similar format, I would make it this way.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The terms <i>avian flu</i>, <i>bird flu</i>, <i>avian influenza</i>, and <i>bird influenza</i> are used interchangably to mean
<ul>
<li>the influenza A virus, influenza A virus adapted to birds, flu caused by the influenza A virus adapted to birds (the technically correct meaning). See <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenzavirus_A_0f17.html" title="Influenzavirus A">influenzavirus A</a></li>
<li>the flu acquired from the influenza A viruses. See <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza.html" title="Influenza">influenza</a></li>
<li>the H5N1 strain of the influenza A virus. See <a href="../../../h/5/n/H5N1_77bb.html" title="H5N1">H5N1</a></li>

<dl>
<dd><i>avian influenza</i> is a more formal version of <i>bird flu</i>, <i>avian flu</i> and <i>bird influenza</i> are mismashes of formal and informal terms. 20061018</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I use "See (article)" (which may not be an ideal layout/formatting) so that the first three terms will not have three links pointing to the same article. Transmission and spread of H5N1 would ideally go under "See also". --<a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodo_bird_75a9.html" title="User:Dodo bird">Dodo bird</a> 19:35, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added a section in the article to clear up what you seem not to be getting since if you aren't getting it, others will be in the same boat. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 21:02, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OMFG!!! Do I appear that stupid? Dumbing down of the article is exactly what I don't want. I understand why the terms are interchangeble, I just don't understand why there is a need to state explictly that the various terms can mean this and this and this. And you have not really replied to the points I made so far, other than assuming I'm totally lost. You may be right though.--<a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodo_bird_75a9.html" title="User:Dodo bird">Dodo bird</a> 21:26, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read through the article very carefully a few times and picked out exactly what information was present. As it turns out, there was a lot of repeated statements, and a lot of unnecessary ones along the lines of "&lt;word&gt; can be used to refer to any influenza A virus, but can also be used to refer to the influenza A diseases: bird flu, swine flu, horse flu, or alternatively, any influenza A virus-induced disease caused by viruses including bird flu virus-disease" (where everything after the first comma in that sentence is extraneous and quickly degenerates into complete nonsense). The article is much shorter now but I think it reads much better. I honestly think I did an OK job, but maybe I didn't. I also tried to change the tone a bit to get the point across that this article is about the term itself, not so much scientific info about the disease/virus/whatever. What do you guys think? --<a href="../../../j/c/i/User%7EJCipriani_4ece.html" title="User:JCipriani">JCipriani</a> 00:11, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>While "clear" is good, "useful and clear" is better. Links are useful, and have absolutely no bearing on clarity whatsoever unless you have trouble following blue text as opposed to black (if they confuse you then turn down the blue levels on your monitor&#160;;). Redundant links are not useful, they are just messy, so you may want to follow traditional Wikipedia style and remove all but the first links to any given article. As far as the italics go, I think they are important for the following reason: these pedantic differences, despite common belief, are not interesting. However, assuming that describing such differences actually is important, then making the operative words in each phrase italicized will definitely clear up the finer points that are too subtle for most sane people to understand. I mean that in the most friendly and constructive way possible, though.&#160;;) --<a href="../../../j/c/i/User%7EJCipriani_4ece.html" title="User:JCipriani">JCipriani</a> 00:28, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article should not be under the heading "Avian Flu" but rather "Avian Influenza" or "Bird Flu" because avian influenza is the accurate scientific term for the disease and bird flu is the most common name used by the news media and the general public. It should probably be under "Bird Flu" because that is the most simple and common term for the disease. This is a potential plague that could affect billions of poor and illiterate people around the world who simply refer to it as bird flu so there is no reason to confuse them and the general public by insisting that the more complex "avian flu" be used. But some people just want to show off how sophisticated and scientific they are... (added 7 April 2007)</p>

<p>It wasn't obvious enough for me - I had to come to the talk page to realise there was more under H5N1. Perhaps something like "More information on the current situation can be found under..." right at the top would be handy? Currently the pointer to the other page is halfway down, in the middle of what appears to be a (very) mild rant about the usage of the term. And 'see articles linked...' isn't very helpful - there are 24 articles linked from this article. Obviously, if I had clicked on them all, I would eventually have found the extra coverage - but I was only mildly interested in the first place, and just wanted to know about the current situation. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamTarn_706f.html" title="User:CamTarn">Cammy</a> 21:32, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Technically it should read "'Flu" with the apostophe, but no one really cares about that anymore. In the lab where I work, 'Flu is usually used to refer to the disease as it manifests himself ("He's down with the 'Flu," "Those birds have the 'Flu," etc.) and Influenza is used to talk about the microscopic virion itself.

<dd>Yes, of course, people are stupid, but there's no need to make the article match them. If you want to educate people treat them as if they have a brain. This article is repetitive and large chunks of it belong in an article in the wiktionary, such as "<i>"Flu" is short for "influenza". The two words mean exactly the same thing. No difference in meaning, only a difference in spelling and pronunciation.</i> and <i>"Bird" and "avian" used as an adjective in front of either mean exactly the same thing.

<dd>Intro Paragraph that specifies that the term avian (or bird) flu (or influenza) represents any disease in birds that is caused by an <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza.html" title="Influenza">influenza</a> virus, which would include the current strain of the avian flu that is feared to become transmittable to humans: <a href="../../../h/5/n/H5N1_77bb.html" title="H5N1">H5N1</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second Paragraph: Keep the paragraph on influenza a (because it's the only other paragraph that adds information), but change to: All avian flu is caused by type "A" influenza viruses. All subtypes (but not all strains of all subtypes) of this species are adapted to birds.</dd>

As far as what to do with this article, IMHO the current content should be removed entirely and replaced with something along the lines of "avian flu is frequently used to refer to any of the following things:", with a list of links to more useful Wiki articles like Influenza A and the various HxNx articles as well. Now, while it's true that my take on the author is purely subjective, one fact that does remain is that the information present in this article is not useful to somebody who was trying to find out about avian flu, aside from the links it contains. --<a href="../../../j/c/i/User%7EJCipriani_4ece.html" title="User:JCipriani">JCipriani</a> 23:45, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>btw, in reference to "I'm sorry you feel <i>"Flu" is short for "influenza"</i> is not needed because <i>you</i> don't need it. 13 year olds read this too." well, I'm 13. I learnt that flu and influenza are the same thing when I wuz <i><b>8</b></i>. On top of that, I'm doing a Social Studies project on the bird flu, came here hoping for some <i>info</i> on it.

<p>Avian flu viruses are noninfectious for most species. When they are infectious they are usually nonsymptomatic, so the carrier does not have any disease from it. Thus while infected with an avian flu virus, the animal doesn't have a "flu". Typically, when illness (called "flu") from an avian flu virus <i>does</i> occur, it is the result of an avian flu virus strain adapted to one species spreading to another species (usually from one bird species to another bird species). So far as we know the most common result of this is an illness so minor as to be not worth noticing (and thus little studied). But with the domestication of chickens and turkeys, we have created species subtypes (domesticated poultry) that can catch an avian flu virus adapted to waterfowl and have it rapidly mutate into a form that kills in days over 90% of an entire flock and spread to other flocks and kill 90% of <i>them</i> and can only be stopped by killing every domestic bird in the area. Until H5N1, this was basically the whole story of avian flu so far as anyone knew or cared. Now with H5N1, we have a whole new ballgame with H5N1 inventing new rules as it goes with behaviors never noticed before, and possibly never having occured before. This is evolution right before our eyes. Even the Spanish flu virus did not behave like this. What is worth mentioning about illness from avian flu viruses we have in <a href="../../../h/5/n/H5N1_flu_a8ad.html" title="H5N1 flu">H5N1 flu</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flu.html" title="Flu">Flu</a>, and the subtype articles (<a href="../../../h/5/n/H5N1_77bb.html" title="H5N1">H5N1</a>, HxNy). <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 06:55, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just read... "out of the ballpark"?, "from this flock, to this flock, to that flock, until every last domesticated bird is slaughtered". Reading this, it sounds like a drama-ridden panic button... or just a genocide against the avian race. Seriously, this needs to be rephrased, reworded, and made more relevant to what the flu is, rather than a dramatic representation of the crisis... keep it seperate. - unsigned</p>

<p>Bird Flu will Kill us all in 2010 Main articles: H5N1 and H5N1 flu As of 2006, "avian flu" is being commonly used to refer to infection from a particular subtype of Influenza A virus, H5N1, which can cause severe illness in humans who are infected. Currently, this strain is transmitted by contact with infected birds, humans, and it is now considered to be airborne-prone virus. COmputer studies show that at the current rate of contamination from the virus, 80% of the Earth will be affected by 2010 and that the whole population will be wiped out in the following year.</p>
