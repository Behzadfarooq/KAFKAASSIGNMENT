<p>I noticed from your comments on the WLUM article that you do photoshop. I have a request that should be easy for you: PLEASE draw the course map for <a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_America_c87c.html" title="Road America">Road America</a>. You can find a source image <a href="http://www.astonmartinracing.com/content/allsites/documents/road_america_42891638-614c-4db8-8345-69eb2d9ae675.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.astonmartinracing.com/content/allsites/documents/road_america_42891638-614c-4db8-8345-69eb2d9ae675.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Eyeballing it should be good enough. Labelling the corners would be cool. Skip the length. You can move my fans image down, the track layout is much more important. I am not efficient at drawing.

<p>Adding a link to Playboy's criticism of Brett Favre is not vandalism. I added it to the page and you deleted it as "vandalism". That's improper. There are plenty of accoldaes for Favre on the page, it's only fair to include a legitimate (and sourced) criticism. I've included it on the page once more. Do not delete it.</p>
<p>For the record, this is what I wrote: Favre was named the Worst Player in Pro Football by <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy.html" title="Playboy">Playboy</a> in the fall of 2006. <a href="http://www.playboy.com/arts-entertainment/features/worstplayers/football.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.playboy.com/arts-entertainment/features/worstplayers/football.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_158.104.6.61_74aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/158.104.6.61">158.104.6.61</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/8/User_talk%7E158.104.6.61.html" title="User talk:158.104.6.61">talk</a>)</small></p>

<dd>It appeared to be vandalism, I mean, I didn't even know playboy had a sports column. The article is ridiculous. It's not credible and is by who now? Playboy.com? Criticism (if even included at all) should be by reliable sources and by credible columnists. See <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> also. It's ridiculous to say he is the "worst player in pro football". If he was the worst player in pro fooball he wouldn't be starting. If Favre is the worst player, than what is <a href="../../../r/e/x/Rex_Grossman_d9eb.html" title="Rex Grossman">Rex Grossman</a>? This is just a writing of a disgruntled bears fan. It's not even an article. It's a two paragraph rant on Brett Favre. Very non-encyclopedic.

<p>While your creation of {{<a href="../../../g/r/e/Template%7EGreen_Bay_Packers_seasons_1224.html" title="Template:Green Bay Packers seasons">Green Bay Packers seasons</a>}} is indeed a good thing, I have seen discussions where users have poo-pooed the idea of templates having red links in them. Since this template is essentially full of them, what should we do? Do you have plans to create (at least) stub pages for these articles? Are all of them even notable? --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Bee_6533.html" title="User:King Bee">King Bee</a> 04:49, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I imagined some day, all these articles will have some information on them. Currently, the only NFL pages (I think) that have the seasons are the Bears and the Raiders. I believe all these are notable, but yeah, red linked templates are frowned upon. I'll have to do some stubbing I suppose to get rid of these. The next article I was going to create was the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967_Green_Bay_Packers_season_dfc5.html" title="1967 Green Bay Packers season">1967 Green Bay Packers season</a> with the infamous Ice Bowl. I probably should've gone to the talk page first. I think stubs would be a good idea, with a results table, and then expanded to include draft picks, stats, ect. The full blown pages would include each game summaries I guess.

<dd>In adition, they all should be notable, because there are pages on every teams 2006 season this year, and teams like the Cardinals and Raiders are awful this year, and are less notable than any other season.

<dd>As I said in the fair-use rationale, that picture illustrates his football career, in an infobox dedicated to it. It is not used to identify him as his face isn't visible. He won't play again, so therefore <i>any</i> picture of him playing is an unrepeatable historic event. It thus meets all the fair use criteria. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 19:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The picture I uploaded was indeed taken by myself before the Packers @ Bills game this November. The image in the infobox is scaled down to about 35% of the size of the high-res original that I have, though. I wish I could have gotten some better pictures of him from the front, but that was the best that I have that would be suitable for the article (I have some in-play shots that are a bit more blurry and that were taken from a greater distance than this pre-game one). --<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><a href="../../../p/s/u/User%7EPSUMark2006_e6e5.html" title="User:PSUMark2006"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #036;">PSUMark2006</span></a> <a href="../../../p/s/u/User_talk%7EPSUMark2006_44f0.html" title="User talk:PSUMark2006"><span style="color:#69C">talk</span></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PSUMark2006_b7c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/PSUMark2006"><span style="color:#69C">contribs</span></a></span> 22:06, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I may add a little light on the policy ... the reason for using a smaller image for fair use images is that if someone is making money by selling the image, you don't want to infringe on their right to make money by offering an image just as good as what they are selling. For example, if I am selling prints of a photo and Wikipedia uses my photo under a fair use claim, if a we have a 300dpi copy, then anyone could take that image and print it out on their printer - you would be costing me money. But that isn't really an issue for a logo. It's really only an issue for a photo, or to a lesser degree, a screenshot. But really, there's an even better alternative - use an <a href="../../../s/v/g/SVG_cd15.html" title="SVG">SVG</a> version of the image. If you ask at <a href="../../../g/r/a/Wikipedia%7EGraphic_Lab_Images_to_improve_7775.html" title="Wikipedia:Graphic Lab/Images to improve">Wikipedia:Graphic Lab/Images to improve</a>, someone may be able to create one. SVG images are vector-based, as opposed to raster, and so they scale perfectly.

See <a href="../../../l/o/g/Wikipedia_talk%7ELogos_Archive_1_068e.html#SVG" title="Wikipedia talk:Logos/Archive 1">Wikipedia talk:Logos/Archive 1#SVG</a> and I know it's also been discussed at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_5c7e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use">Wikipedia talk:Fair use</a> though I don't really want to go through all of the archives to find it. Really, the objections arise from a misunderstanding of what an SVG image is. SVGs are resolution-independent. They aren't infinite resolution - they don't have a resolution. It's like talking about the color of a thought - that property just doesn't exist. Usually, just clarifying what an SVG is clears up the objections. Really, we ought to have SVG images for every logo - it makes the page look much better. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 03:59, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi, I know it's been an eon and a half since I told you I would actually help you out with the crazy task of creating pages for all the Packers seasons, but I want to ask you about what I have been doing to the 2006 season. Is it superfluous and just lame to have all the info I added, like weather and scoring summaries? I noticed that the Bears seasons have all this info, and I didn't want to be outdone (you know, that <i>rivalry thing</i>).

<p><b>Discussion2</b></p>
<p>Starwars1955 has blanked his Talk Page again, which is at least the third time that he has removed my messages. Blanking Talk Pages was considered a personal attack I thought. Anyway, I asked about the sockpuppet because I've read the Talk Pages of <a href="../../../c/u/t/User%7ECute_1_4_u_d42e.html" title="User:Cute 1 4 u">Cute 1 4 u</a> and the sockpuppets, and aggression seemed similar; but you've said they're not the same Users, so I'll leave that. Also, what’s the reason why Starwars1955 hasn’t been given an indefinite block for continued vandalism and personal attacks? The reason I’m asking this is because Opronc and Opronc-oA (an ‘‘extremely’’ obvious sockpuppet; have you heard of these Users?) vandalized my User page, <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a>’s, and <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Jack O'Lantern</a>’s. Opronc and Opronc-oA have been given indefinite blocks, yet to me, their actions don’t seem to be as aggressive as Starwars1955’s. I know that we can’t block him, but I’m just asking. To learn what the Opronc’s are doing now, read <a href="../../../o/p/r/User_talk%7EOpronc-oA_8eac.html" title="User talk:Opronc-oA">this page</a>, it's actually quite funny. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 18:09, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He is indef blocked now. Admins were slow to ban him because he's a new user and he's only edited basically one page. Starwars1955 wasn't really vandalizing, just being completely ignorant toward Wikipedia rules. There's alot of aggressive users on Wikipedia, so finding two similar users like that is not always the hardest. There's a bunch of users on Wikipedia and many editors (as myself) stick to editing articles which interest them, so I cannot say I've heard of those people as I edit a lot of sports articles.++<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAviper2k7_0275.html" title="User:Aviper2k7"><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">aviper2k7</span></a>++ 21:02, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for reviewing <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Probert_44ef.html" title="Bob Probert">Bob Probert</a> for GA status. I want to respond to several of your objections, and I would appreciate your re-consideration in light of my response.</p>
<ul>
<li>The lead section being "too short" is not an actionable complaint - what is missing? I think it is a good size for an article this size. Putting footnotes in lead sections is actually undesirable, since the facts stated in the lead section are repeated and properly sourced throughout the article, especially the statement about fighting.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Please see <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELead_b989.html" title="WP:Lead">WP:Lead</a>. A lead should be recommended around 2-4 paragraphs. A short one paragraph doesn't adequately describe the person for the length of the article.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Dates are not required to be linked unless there is a useful context, and that is decided on a per-project basis. That is not a valid reason to reject a GA or even an FA.\</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>There are many reasons why I rejected this, the dates should follow <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a>, and at least be consistent. Right now there is some of both.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The article is full of inline citations. Did you read them and click on the links? Literally everything in the article is backed up by one of the citations listed in References.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>There is a lack of citations on point of view statements. Nine sources for this article is a little low. Statements that could be tested should be sourced.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The article has an emphasis on fighting because that's what he is best known for. He was an enforcer, a claim that is well-referenced in the article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>For a professional hockey player, the article should focus on his whole career, not just his fighting.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The article has an image. Did you read it all the way through? How can you fail an article when you didn't read it?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The article has one fair-use image. I said to try to get a free image of him.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Minor language changes and wikilinking can be addressed quickly and easily by placing the nomination on hold for a day or two; outright failing the article is not necessary without even giving authors a chance to respond to criticism.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I failed it because it's not good article material. This is my opinion, and I expressed this. Fix everything and re-list it when the article is sourced better and the POV statements are cleaned up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Statements like, "he contributed the most points during the Red Wings' playoff run" really need sourcing. If you want me to go into great detail, I can, but please don't get mad at failing the article.

<p>I am not entirely against writing in the articles. Look at my edit summary to the Brewers' article.</p>
<p>Second, for some reason making the table sortable widens the table dramatically, which is not what we want. In addition, I think the batting stats and starting pitchers should be sorted by batting average and ERA, respectively. Since relief pitchers are just there to close out the games, they don't play as frequently and their stats aren't as <i>important</i>. I'm all in favor of making that table sortable. If you can change the relief pitcher's table to sortable and keep it the same width, then kudos to you. <a href="../../../k/s/y/User%7EKsy92003_bc45.html" title="User:Ksy92003">Ksy92003</a> 13:18, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
