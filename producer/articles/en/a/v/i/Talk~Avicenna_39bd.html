<p>To be consistent with Western usage the name Avicenna should be used throughout. In addition the dating system of CE (Common Era) not AD (Anno Domini) or AH is to be preferred. Remember, this is the English language page of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>...However, this is wrong: "His Latinized name is a anglicization of Ibn Sina". I can't point on a source right away, but Avicenna is the *Latin* transcription of the name, used from the late Middle Ages on, when the philosopher first became known in the West. Please don't "anglicize" too much, even in the English Wikipedia&#160;:-) --213.226.50.50 22:10, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's actually not an easy question to answer. The 1911 EB says he was "born at Afshena in the district of Bokhara" and that his father was a tax collector in Harmaitin. Modern Bokhara is in Uzbekistan but back then it was all just Central Asia. Hamadan seems to be definitely in Persia/Iran tho. <a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadcat_e804.html" title="User:Zadcat">Zadcat</a></dd>

<p>Yo all're crazy man, ibn Sina was Turkmen, and that is not mentioned anywhere in your article</p>
<p>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE,.. DO NOT MAKE RIDICUL OF YOURSELVES AND SAY THAT IBN SINA WAS A TURKMEN. HE CAN NOT BE A NOMAD. -) and I cant think of any of his writings in Turmen,. or in general Turkish lang. He ruled! Therefore the word MEDICINE ended from persian MADADE SINO (Sino's cure)</p>

-- Apparently you don't know much about anything as Turkmens weren't even in existence when Avicenna was born.</p>

<p>-- No it isn't, that's what they're called in English, if you look at any important English document their names are Averroes, Avicenna, Rhazes etc...! Why the confusion?</p>
<p>I've read Avicenna's Psychology. The term psychology there does no mean the modern practice of psychology as mental health, but more the study of the anatomy of the soul. The two are ultimately related but still distinct. The link to psychology is therefore deceptive.</p>
<p><br />
First of all,. AS far as I know the word MEDICINE has been originated from persian Madadi Sino. The idea cant offer a proof. That is what I read somewhere, but cant recall. Second of all. As it has been already mentioned Arabic language was the scientific language or prestigeous language of the time. Therefore it is true, and we have been taught that Ibn Sina accomplished part of his works in Arabic, as well as in Persian. However Samanids states is considered the first oficial Tajik state. As the editor already mentioned his father worked in Samanids administration, that gave Ibn Sina opportunity to study in Bukhara (where nowadays 90% of the population speak Tajik language). Being a Tajik, I do not deny that we belong to Persian group. Unfortunately, here what is happening here. Refering to a simple example, which will make it easier for you to understand the point, I want to finish my paragraph. Looking at an elevator some people say it is a lift (from British), but other people insist in saying that it is an elevator. AND WHY IS THIS ALL NECESSARY? THE MAIN THING IS THAT HE WAS FROM ONE NATION, THAT WE ALL ARE IN,.. ISLAM!!</p>

<p>the Psychology of Avicenna is a study on the Soul. It means, A philosophical way to studie the human soul.</p>

<p>A comment on the following sentence in the article: "(Some sources actually state that Avicenna was born in Hamadan, and a good brief biography, linked below, claims him as a Tajik from Balkh)."</p>
<p>The tajik ethnicity is ill-defined, and the meaning seems to have fluctuated in the course of history. Some say that the tajiks are descendants of arabs after the Islamic invasions, others claim they are persians have emigrated from the iranian area around 200 AD. Today some will call any persian-speaking sunni with no specific ethnic association in the afghanistan/tajikstan area a tajik, yet there exists ismaili tajiks and even an extremely small group of imami tajik. Others affiliate themselves with different tajik clans.</p>
<p>Because of this confusion around the tajik ethnicity the modern day tajiks are striving to create a national identity, and thus some tajik sites will present persian philosophers with a background from the modern-day Tajikistan area as tajiks... though this can be viewed as highly speculative...</p>
<p>It is extremely doubtful that Ibn Sina/Avicenna would associate a tajik ethnicity with himself... most probably he viewed himself a persian.</p>
<p>-- I'm Azeri/Turkic and I'm more than convinced that Avicenna was PERSIAN!</p>
<p>-- Even though I have a high regard for Persian contributions to human civilization, I think SOME of today's Persians have an inferiority complex, because they self-"persianize" all the great Muslim Scholars. Speaking Persian does not show anything about being a Persian or not, just as using Arabic does not indicate origin. It is a fact that the Islamic world was very mixed those days. Most Muslims were very mixed and spoke Arabic and Persian those days in addition to their native languages. Ibni Sina was born in Central Asia and he could very well be of Tajik or Turkic origin, as well as of Persian or Arabic. -Serkan</p>
<p><br />
“Avicenna’s ethnicity”. I found it very interesting that there is so much discussion over an obvious fact! He was Persian. No doubt about it. But there are always those who want to change the obvious. He was not Persian, he was Tajik, he was not Tajik, he was Turk… He was Persian and that is his ethnic background. Was he a Muslim? Of course he was. Did he write in Arabic? Yes he did. But “Muslim” is not an ethnic background. The moment that the world starts crediting Descartes as a Christian scientist or Spinoza as a Jewish scholar we can call Avicenna a Muslim scientist.</p>
<p>Most of his work is in Arabic for two main reasons. One, Arabic was the scientific language of the time so it made sense for him to publish his work in Arabic. The scientific language of our time, as you know, is English. I know of a Greek mathematician (She was born in Greece, fluent in German, English, and Greek) working at the Princeton university. She publishes her work in English. Now is she an English mathematician, a Christian one or an American one? You decide!</p>
<p>The second reason for Avicenna to do his work in Arabic and not in Farsi, was the religious one. If he were to publish all of his work in Farsi, he would risk alienating the religious cast and the ruler(s) of the time and that would mean imprisonment, execution or exiled to say the least. Throughout centuries Arabs, under the name of Islam, tried really hard to erase anything that was Persian. The same phenomenon happened during the dark ages under the ruling of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>As for some of the Persians suffering from the “inferiority complex”, you are absolutely correct! After all, no nation is perfect! But rest assured that those who know the history of that nation and its contributions to the civilization of the man kind are extremely confident about their heritage. Call Avicenna Turkish if it builds your cofidence. Try advocating “Arabian Gulf”in the magazines. When the dust is settled Avicenna will be known as a Persian scientist and maps will note the gulf as the “Persian Gulf”. Kiarash</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>-- I think it's quite obvious where Serkan is from, nice try!</p>
<p>--The only people with an inferiority complex are Turks and Arabs who cliam a Persian scholar who regarded himself as a Persian as their own to make themselves feel better. -Manny</p>
<p>--Well, I am ethnically Kurdish and I think I can see myself closer to the Persian. I care about the truth, I do not give a damn about ethnicities otherwise. Just to point out what is wrong with SOME of the Persians here, how can a gulf can be claimed to be absolutely Persian?! If somebody calls it Arabian, that is as legitimate as the Persian. My point is why so much fuss about this? Now, extrapolate this behaviour of yours to your claims regarding the etnicities of the middle-eastern scientists, and you might see what the problem is. -Serkan</p>

<p>Textbook Farsi is Dari. If he wrote in Persian it was not the same dialect which Iranians speak today. Persia was a VAST empire at the time of Ibn Sina. He was not "Iranian" because Iran was nonexistent. He was from Balkh which is present day Afgh/Tajik. Iranians claim all great muslim poets and writers as their own but if their poems are closely examined it is evident that they are NOT Iranian. Rudi.</p>

<dd>Yes, we can speak, and we can in fact read texts written 1000 years ago. Prose or poetry. Persian dialects are in fact nothing more than accents in practicality. The "Islamic Republic of Iran" did not exist back then. But Iranians did. With your line of reasoning, Shakespeare cannot be considered English either. Nor can Dante be Italian. And if Persians are "claiming" all those people as Iranian, well maybe it's because the land called Persia was a damn huge place in antiquity.

Here is where confusion the comes from; Tajikestan, Ghazaghestan, Bukhara, Khwarezm, Samarghand, and a few other states and cities formerly part of the Iranian plateau, and the country Iran, were at some point fairly recent in history, invaded and thus give to Russia, when Peter the Great invaded Iran.

<p>Depending on how old the reference to "Tajik" is, it might mean Arab, as "Tajik", derives from Tayyi', the name of an Arab tribe at the forfront of the Muslim conquests in the East (David M. McClory, micopsor@aol.com).</p>
<p>So Rudi with your logic, the Germans are "germanizing" Emmanuel Kant and a great many other great minds because their birthplace lies now in Russia or elsewhere! The Germans cann then disown Hitler! He was born in Austria! Nice logic!</p>

<p>Just wanted to make a point. Avicenna was Persian and tajik and Persian have the same meaning, that is Iranian-persian muslim. Avicennas mother was Zoroastrian and this is a good enough proof of his Iranian/Persian/Tajik origin as opposed to a Turkic origin.</p>

<p>I have noticed in this article as well as a few others that the world Iran or Iranian is not used and many try to justify it by saying that Iran did not exist back then. (before 1935) This is a common misunderstanding among westerners who think Iran was CREATED in 1935 and it just happened to be on the same land as Persia or that the name Iran is a modern name. which is of course wrong since the country Iran was called Iran for at least the past 2000 years( since Sassanid period) by its people but it had a different name in west (Persia) therefore I think historical Iranian figures like Ibn Sina should be called Iranian not just Persian. In Iran, Ibn Sina is referred to as an IRANIAN scientist not Persian. More importantly I am not sure if Ibn Sina was PERSIAN as far as his race is concerned since not all Iranians are Persians. He could be a Tujik or Turkman but still be an Iranians since he lived and died in the country that was called Iran. I just wanted to see what you all think of my proposal.</p>
<p>Gol</p>
<p>Ibn Sina was born in Bukhara, then part of Persia, now part of modern day Turkemanistan. So Ibn Sina is truly Pesian and all you arabs and turks can deny it but he will always remain a Persian. The only reason why he wrote most of his books in arabic is because the language of Islam was arabic, not because he was arab.</p>

<dd>It's absolutely ridiculous to say that Ibn Sino was PERSIAN. In his time, Bukhara city in Mouraunnahr(modern Uzbekistan) was invaded by Persians, but it in no circumstances is a proof that he was Persian. Avicenna as well as Al-Biruni, Al-Khorazmi is NOT Persian. They only lived in territories occupied by Persia(Iran).

Maybe the article is written by pan-Iranists. He cannot be be Persian, even though the territory of Uzbekistan. At that time there were no distinguishing people by ethnicity and no one knows his origin. Many modern Uzbek scholars write in Russian, becuase of Russian influence.</p>
<p>The most democratic way of defining his is Avicenna is the greatest scholar from CENTRAL ASIA born in modern Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Actually Uzbekistan has more right to claim this scholar as 'their' fellow'.</p>
<p>You should STOP claiming that all those scholars were Persians. No doubt Iran has very rich culture, but that does not make all the scholars "Iranian" or "Persian". Write that he is CENTRAL ASIAN!!!!</p>

<p>Fascinating article on Avicenna that I enjoyed reading. But one thing: "Ibn Sina is rarely remembered in the West today and his fundamental contributions to medicine and the European reawakening go largely unrecognised." This is puzzling. Unrecognized? Surely not! Avicenna is generally and universally regarded as one of the most important intellectual influences on European thinking for the next four or five centuries. Americans learn his name in grade school. I think he is one of the most important names in culture anywhere in the Western world--East or West--in that period of time. But it was a long time ago....it should not be surprising that Voltaire is more recognizable now. He's only been dead for two hundred years. &#160;:-) - N.

<p>In his own biography, Ibn Sina never mentioned a Persian descent, or anything of the like. Obviously, he didn't see himself as such, why are people trying to force their POV on this article? Afshna and Bokhara were part of the Islamic Caliphate at the time, not Persia. What we do know, is that Ibn Sina wrote the bulk of his work in Arabic(he didn't write similar texts in Persian, as this article is trying to imply). Even if his ethnic background was not Arab, he was extremly influenced by the Arabian culture, he wrote in it, spoke it, and thought in it. I'm sure battling on his ethnicity( Arab/Turkic/Persian) will get us nowhere. I'm taking off the Persian descent references, and correcting the mistakes done to the locales' sovereignty.</p>
<p>Also, does anyone know german? What does this reference translate to: F. Wüstenfeld's Geschichte der arabischen Aerzte und Naturforscher (Gottingen, 1840)?</p>
<p>I don't know German, but it doesn't take a genius to see that "arabischen" translates to "Arab", but what is the context? <a href="../../../m/b/_/User%7EMB_30ac.html" title="User:MB">MB</a> 16:14, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

He is sometimes mistaken for Arab because he wrote some of his books in Arabic which was the langue of science in the eastern world the same way that Latin was the dominant language in the western world but it does not mean any scientist who wrote in that is a Roman. Ibn Sina also has books in Persian. He is Persian and all the encyclopedias either mention him as Iranian or Persian. I suggested using Iranian but other people said Persian is more appropriate. In either case defining him as just Muslim is wrong since it is a vague term and it would be like saying that Dante was a Christen poet! The only argument is whether to call him Persian or Tajik but the Tajik themselves are defined as “central Asian Persians” so I think it is correct to refer to him as Persian but I still prefer Iranian.</p>

You obviously did not even consider my argument, Ibn Sina wrote most of his work in Arabic, not only because it was the language of science but also, because that's the language he was more comfortable with. are you trying to imply that all Middle-easterners are Persian?

You can not prove that he was more comfortable with Arabic, how do you know? How do you know my suggestion that he did it because it was the language of science is not correct? Beside even if he was more comfortable with Arabic that does not make him an Arab. Don’t attack me or make up things about me. I never tried to say all Middle Easterns are Persians! Britannica says he was Iranian so do you argue about their legitimacy? I don’t think they are pro Persian/ Iranian do you?</p>
<p>We can not just label him as Muslim it is too vague have you seen Dante being labeled as Christian poet?</p>

<p>Gol, I can't prove that a certain twisted fact doesn't exist: Somebody claims that a man named Arash Al-Farsi died in Tehran at 6 PM on Saturday. I can't give him sources that Arash Al-Farsi <b>didn't</b> die in Tehran( because simply it didn't happen), so does that mean that Arash did die? Obviously, you need to check your logic. Now, most people at that time identified themselves to religion, especially in the Middle-East. Just because Arabic was the language of science doesn't mean that it couldn't have been his first.Also, I know that Arabic was the language he was comfortable with, because he spoke with it, and wrote most of his books in it. Trying to twist my words won't make your arguments stronger.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are three opinions here: That he either was Tajik, Persian, or Arab. Instead of degrading ourselves to an edit war( something I saw you're keen on) let's all compromise and claim the subject controversial. That's much more professional than you screaming "Persian, Persian, Persian!" down our throats on the article.

<p><b>you have to have a legitimate source.</b></p>
<p>I gave you three sources that he was labeled either as Persian or Iranian and one of those sources are considered to be the most legitimate in the world.

<p>Weird, you previously provided a source, yet it's gone now, how come? belatedly discovered disparities, maybe? If your sources are definitive re-post this 'another source'. What's this <i>encyclopedia of the Orient</i>? Anyway, There is obvious controversy concerning Ibn Sina's ethnicity, mentioning it won't detract from any arguments. The basis of NPOV is to mention all sides, and not be biased towards a certain ethnicity, race, or religion. Obviously you're extremly biased, and mentioning he's Persian here won't make him as such. What's the matter with you?</p>
<p>The Britannica link only mentions 75 words from the whole article, it's an incomplete source. From what I got you base your arguments on him coming from what you deem "Persia". At that time, Persia was part of the Islamic Caliphate, and Khorasan was considered Central Asian, not Persian. Your weak attempts at distorting Geography are poor desperate attempts to confirm something ingrained in you. Objective researchers don't pay mind to the preconceptions they were taught, as such mentioning the controversy was the scholarly thing to do.</p>
<p>Instead, You're obviously engaging in a <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revert_war.html" title="Revert war">revert war</a>, something against Wikipedia's policies. Please adhere to them before you stand on a podium and instruct others to do so. I won't put the ethnicity controversy back, obviously from your observed childish behavior you'll propably revert it back(again). Instead, I'll wait for an editor with some sense to back me up, until then please refer to the definition of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a>. <a href="../../../m/b/_/User%7EMB_30ac.html" title="User:MB">MB</a> 19:21, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I removed the link because it would not go to the right page no matter how many times I tried to copy it. A technical difficulty but the source was correct and it was the <b>Encyclopedia of the Orient</b> which I mentioned above.</p>

<p>If you can not see the whole page on Britannica is because you are not a member. Beside why does it matter the word Iranian is mentioned in the beginning. Are you saying it will be changed in the rest of the article??</p>
<p>You are not doing revert war? I provided one of the most legitimate sources in the world and based on that changed your edits but you changed mine without any source.</p>

<dd>To those suggesting that Avicenna was more comfortable with Arabic than with Persian I can only say you have no business editing articles on this subject. Avicenna has even written poetry in the classical styles of Persian literature. Anybody familiar with the Persian language knows that these are extremely difficult styles, which you can only use if you have a command of the language well above that of ordinary (even educated) people. Avicenna most definitely had no problems with the Persian language. As already pointed out, Arabic was a language any educated person of that time was supposed to know. But well, you wouldn't say all wikipedians are English because they write in English, would you? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShervink_07f6.html" title="User:Shervink">Shervink</a> 03:16, 26 February 2006 (UTC)shervink</dd>

As it has been already mentioned Arabic language was the scientific language or prestigeous language of the time. Therefore it is true, and we have been taught that Ibn Sina accomplished part of his works in Arabic, as well as in Persian. However Samanids states is considered the first oficial Tajik state. As the editor already mentioned his father worked in Samanids administration, that gave Ibn Sina opportunity to study in Bukhara (where nowadays 90% of the population speak Tajik language). Being a Tajik, I do not deny that we belong to Persian group. Unfortunately, here what is happening here. Refering to a simple example, which will make it easier for you to understand the point, I want to finish my paragraph. Looking at an elevator some people say it is a lift (from British), but other people insist in saying that it is an elevator. AND WHY IS THIS ALL NECESSARY? THE MAIN THING IS THAT HE WAS FROM ONE NATION, THAT WE ALL ARE IN,.. ISLAM!!</p>

<p>MB, it is true that Avicenna may not be Iranian, and he may be an Arab (how can anyone logically say that, it is beyond me). On another discussion page you said, “Prophet Muhamad spoke Persian”. But, people who think that are along the lines of the same people who swear Alexander the Great was actually Turkish, and that history has done the Turkish people wrong. I guess some people believe in UFOs too, and have been trying numerous of times to edit the UFO article, saying “They do exist”. This article is not concerned with the fact that all Middle-Eastern people are not Persian; it has, however, to do with Pur Sina (Avicenna) who was Iranian. Furthermore, I have noticed that you have tried to change the birthplace of many <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persian</a> scientists over the past few weeks (Al Biruni, Avicenna, Al Khwarizmi etc.). I do realize that these facts might not be desirable to you, yet, that does not excuse your reverts. You have also mentioned that a certain article in Britannica is incomplete because it has 75 words. Unlike Wikipedia, Britannica only displays a part of an article, and you have got to pay to view the rest. However, in this case you need not to look far; I looked at it and the first thing that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a> says about <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avicenna.html" title="Avicenna">Avicenna</a> is, <b>“....born 980, Bukhara, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> died 1037, Hamadan. Arabic Ibn Sina, in full Abu 'Ali al-Husayn ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Sina.

But, you seem to play tune-def, and may be a bit biased. Now, it is important as a scholar to question the status quo, however, if you have your own hypothesis, you need to provide refrences rather than just rhetoric. What books are you reading that say this stuff are true? Any way, I have to tell you though, just because you can edit in Wikipedia, it does not mean you can insert your own off-the-wall opinions, with brute force, and without providing ONE credible source. In the face of over-WHELMING evidence provided to you in [good faith], you still try to revert the article, and at this point if you try to revert this article without proper merit one more time, I will report you if you violate the 3rr rule, as well as, report you for possible vandalism, and being a possible sockpuppet.

<dd>avicenna was not turkic at all. the only turkic empire that was able to produce such minds was the ottomans. the central asian empires were turko-persian empires. the persians took all the administration, science, scholarly, religous,etc... levels, while the turkic tribes took care of the military aspect. the central asian turks were better at fighting, and iranians were better educated, that is a fact, most educated people of the time were iranian, due to the hundreds of years of cultural development, while the turkic tribes were all nomadic. there is no way he was turkic, or arab for that matter for the exact same reasons. even arabs wrote about how persians did most of the cultural and scientific work. and even turkic tribes new that, such as timur, that is why they let the persians administer the empire while all they did was expand it. that is why the term turco persian is used for the central asian empires, and that is why persian culture has always been the dominating force in central asia, the middle east, and the ottoman empire. avicenna was tajik/persian (tajik and persian are of the same tribe) --Iranian Patriot.</dd>

<p>why don't we just call avecenna Iranian. doesn't iranian mean all iranic people(tajiks, ossetians, persians, balochis, ect).so if avecenna's definitely from Iranic origins why shouldn't we use that term?</p>
<p>you make sense, but the thing is for anyone doing research, iranian means nothing. most westerners only know of irans history as persian. iranian will just confuse the reader. also, there is some dispute between iranic peoples over the term iranian. iranian now has come to mean more of a nationality than ethnicity, because the iranic peoples now are not under one roof like they were during the achaemenids, parthians, and sassanids. some iranics dont like being called iranian, others dont mind being called iranian. however Persian works best in this context.<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIranian_Patriot_06d7.html" title="User:Iranian Patriot">Iranian Patriot</a> 16:17, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>neither was iran until the west labled it Persia on their maps. when these countries were part of Persia (iran as iranians know it) they were also called persia. the fact is that persia is the name used by the west to represent Iran. Iran has always been called iran, all iranians know this, afghans know it, tajiks know it, etc... (arya, Eron, iranzameen, and other variations for 2500 years). but the fact of the matter is that the west only knows about irans history as persia. many westerners still believe that iran was an invented name imposed on the nation by the shah in the 1930's. they dont know the truth, and to keep our history alive in the english language and in the world, we have to use the term persia.<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIranian_Patriot_06d7.html" title="User:Iranian Patriot">Iranian Patriot</a> 21:17, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He was born from Bukhara from a Zoroastrian mother and Ismaili Father originally from Balkh. He lists the languages he knows and neither turkish nor even Iranian Soghdian is mentioned. Bukhara during Samanid times was Persian speaking as Rudaki is the first poet from there. Soghdian (which is an Iranian language) was the previous language, but at the time of Samanids it was well supplanted by new Persian. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 05:44, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>---OK what about Shah Ismail what language was he speaking and what was the official language of Persia(an ancient term used till Macedonian-Hellen Massacre) And tell me who are ottomans which language was Selim the brave was using and what was the official language of ottomans and selcuks. Dont be kidding aboıut you know few Shah Ismail was a half Turkish(probably Kipcak of Azerbayjan) Arian(father side) but strange he was using Cagatay(lingua franca of asia of that times) in his court instead of persian and it is absolute that Selim was Turanic and using Persian (not even Ottoman) in his poetry. Shah Ismail sent letter to Selim in Cagatay relim replied back in Persian. Also official languages of Seljuks was Persian. Persian was used to civilise and de-militarise Turkish tribes in great Turkish empires. And even after long run migrations to anatolia from todays Iran till 1968 turkish population was 1.3 times the persian population(12 mil turanians 9 mil persians in 11 mil arians total 25mil) in Iran which is still assimilating Turks and even genosiding(google Azadistan and south Azerbajan)</p>

<p>I'm not sure what the naming conventions are here, but it seems the article should be titled 'Ibn Sina' - with a redirect from Avicenna - rather than the way it is now, considering that was his real name. Other philosophers (Ibn Khaldun, Al Khwarizmi) with Arab/Persian names have articles at their real names rather than latinizations of such (e.g. Algoritmi).</p>
<p>Also, the article internally uses both names at different places for no apparent reason - I think it should be made consistent (i.e. mention the "Avicenna" variant at the top, and use Ibn Sina throughout the article.)

<p>Tajiks and Persians are basically the same people, therefore, if it says Persian it doesnt really matter. Both are Iranic and not only that, but both are from the same tribe. --Iranian Patriot</p>

<p>are you iranian zmmz? avicenna is definetly iranic (tajik/persian most likely), can you please tell me which people dispute this fact, so that i may enlighten them... thanks--Iranian Patriot.</p>
<p>Tajik vs. Persian seems to be the newest dispute. I think Avicenna should be referred to as Persian, based on the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. His father was from Balkh in Khorassan, which is not even close to where Tajik tribes traditionally resided. 2. His father was Shia, while Tajiks were/are primarily Sunnis. 3. Avicenna never referred to himself as Tajik.</p>
<p>I would like to see solid evidence of Avicenna being a Tajik, other than a general dubious claim that every Persian speaking Central Asian has to be Tajik. In particular considering that his father had moved to Bukhara from Balkh, his original birth place. If tomorrow I move to Tajikstan, that does not make me or my children a person of Tajik ancestory.</p>

Hi Tajik,</p>
<p>You will have to provide more links or references for some of your claims. In particular my argument is that:</p>
<p>1. I am an ethnic Khorassani myself, and I am not Tajik, and I don't believe Tajiks are the main inhabitants of Khorassan, in particular the region from Balkh to central Iran where Avicenna's father came from. Please provide a source for your claim.</p>
<p>2. Also you base your claim on the definition that all Persian speaking people outside of the current boundaries of Iran will have to be Tajik. This description (which also shows up in wikipedia's definition of Tajiks) is not accurate enough. Ethnic Tajiks are a distinct tribe who also look differently from other central asians. In particular considering that the borders of Iran today is quite different from what it was 1000 years ago, your basic definition of a "Tajik" does not sound solid.</p>
<p>That said, your mentioning of Mahmud Kashgari clears up the issue about the use of the term "Tajik" 1000 years ago. Thanks for the reference. I'll have to try to find a copy of his work.</p>
<p>Can anybody check and see if Avicenna ever referred to himself as Persian or Iranian?</p>

<dd>Tajik is a <b>definition</b>. Tajik is what Central Asian Persians have been referred to in the past, and the name stuck. Tajik=Persian, and Persian=Tajik, its the same thing. I have no problem with Tajik being in this article.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 20:23, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>@ Ghlobe: if you are from Khorasan (and I guess you are talking about the modern Iranian province(s) Khorasan), then you <b>are</b> a Tajik, even if you do not call yourself as such. "Tajik" is not a seperate ethnic group, but simply another name for the people who are generally known in the west as "Persians". And usually, Persians who are from the regions East of Iran, are generally called "Tajiks". From Khayyam and Ferdousi to Rumi and al-Biruni, all of them were "Tajiks". <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tājik</a> 20:32, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tajik, I'm sure that this user thought taht Tajik was a different ethnic group. I think we both made it clear to him now that Tajik is just a definition which means: Central Asian Persian.

Sorry, but this claim requires proof. Please provide an independent source that states the term "Tajik" is not a separate ethnic group. Alternatively we can replace the term in the article with "Central Asian Persian" to resolve the dispute. Ghlobe 21:56, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since there are so many arguments about his ethnicity and it is very hard to prove 100% who he really was, especially considering the time he lived in, lets just called it an even and leave just "Persian" since Iranians and Tajiks are Persian. However there is also strong possibility he was not Persian, but I advice we leave just him as "Persian" for now, until better proof is found.

<p>There are so many sources stating that he is Persian, and so many stating that he is Turkic. Almost all of the proofs are correct about him, and have a point for either one of those.

<p>Ibn Sino is Turkic. First of all he was born in Afshona village which is 100% turk. Secondly, he lived in Seljukid Empire time. Seljukids were turkic nation and iran was part of the empire. Which means not central asia but persia was part of the central asia. Thirdly, there are people who speak persian in Bukhara but they are not persian and certainly not tajiks. They are local people whos language been enfluanced by persian culture and language.

<dd>Ibn Sina lived in the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samanids.html" title="Samanids">Samanid Empire</a> and later in the <a href="../../../b/u/y/Buyids.html" title="Buyids">Buyyid Empire</a> - he had nothing to do with the Seljuqs. Besides that, the Seljuqs were a highly Persianized Oghuz-Turkic family who ruled over a land that was overwhelmingly NON-Turkic. The Turks - including the ruling family - were a tiny minority, not even numbering 100,000. As for the "looks" - this is the dumbest example ever. First of all, we do not know how ibn Sina looked like. Secondly, the population of Central Asia 1000 years ago was totally different than today. And third: the "looks" are not really an indicator for someone's origin. May I remind you that almost NOBODY in Turkey has a "Turkic look" nowadays?!

<dd>Hi Tajik. Turk come to central asia in 5th century and they were there for long time. Secondly, there is no turkic look it is true but 1000 year ago there were turkic and persian look diferences. Even today scientes can pridect origin of the persons. Thirdly when I mean turk, I don't mean turkish. You should understand deference between turk and turkish. Example, uzbek live in uzbekistan and turkish live in turkey but both of them turk not turkish. Nation called tajik never existed, maybe some tribe name was tajik in 19 century. Main nations in central asia were turks and persians. if he is not turk then he is persian, if not persian then turk.

<dd>What are you talking about?! Avicenna mentions in his own <b>autobiography</b> that he is Persian. Besides that, the number of Turks was at that time not more than 200,000 IN TOTAL (comparable to the number of Mongols at the time of Genghis Khan). It is attested by Ghaznavid historians that the TOTAL number of Oghuz Turks living in Central Asia was at the time of Sultan Mas'ud Ghaznavi not more than 60,000 - and the Oghuz were the LARGEST Turkic group in Central Asia. At the same time, Baghdad alone had more than 300,000 inhabitants! This has been discussed so many times. It is totally hillarious to claim that Avicenna was a Turk ... and I am not even talking about the fact, that - at that time - the Turks were still predominantly a nomadic people with no interest in science or philosophy! Ibn Sina was the son of a known Persian scholar from Balkh, his mother was member of the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samanid.html" title="Samanid">Samanid</a> family.

<p>I was reading this discussion and I think people are missing some points here. When we are asking where someone is coming from, the answer is the name of the country that he is from not his ethnicity or his language. We should follow the same here. Therefore, I think the word Tajik in parenthesis which refers to his ethnicity is not appropriate here. The other confusion is about the word Persian. Persian can refer to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persian (Ethnicity)</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian (language)</a>, and residents of the country of Persia(<a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>).
