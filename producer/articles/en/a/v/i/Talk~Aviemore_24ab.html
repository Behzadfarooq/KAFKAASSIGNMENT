	    <p>"although it is sometimes erroneously considered part of Inverness-shire"? Ask just about anyone who actually lives in Aviemore which county the they think they are in and they'll say Inverness-shire. Its postal county is Inverness-shire - try sticking "1 Grampian Road Aviemore" into the Royal Mail post code tracker. It may be traditionally Morayshire, but describing this as erroneously suggest a POV here.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is erroneous because it does not lie within the traditional county of Inverness-shire! This is not a POV; it's a fact. It may well have lain in the postal county of Inverness, and if you want to mention the postal county, feel free. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 14:11, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still believe that the words inaccurate and erroneous and even sometimes are POV in this context and actually show the incorrect situation. It has - and in many locals minds still does - lain in a county known as Inverness-shire. People in Aviemore do not consider themselves part of Morayshire - unlike those in Grantown-on-Spey. I have altered the article to show - with no emphasis on any of the different classes of region - all of the current and historical geographical groupings that Aviemore is/was considered part of. Badenoch and Strathspey has been put first as it is the grouping that most locals associate with today. I hope you feel this is a reasonable line to take.--82.41.236.68 15:44, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that some people consider it to be in inverness-shire due to previous Royal Mail policies is interesting information that shouldn't be removed. The article is quite capable of saying this without downright inaccuracies such as the idea that Aviemore has ever been in the traditional county of Inverness-shire; it hasn't; it was formerly in the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_county.html" title="Administrative county">administrative county</a> of inverness-shire and has also been in the postal county of the same name. But it has never been in any traditional county save Morayshire. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 15:57, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hang on here. You accept that, by two definitions, it was in a county called "Inverness-shire". The article, before you edited it, claimed it was, variously, "inaccurately" or "erroneously" considered part of Inverness-shire. In what way is that inaccurate? It did not specify "traditional". In fact, it simply stated that people have come to consider it part of Inverness-shire. 2 out of 3 definitions of Inverness-shire contain Aviemore. It may not follow your preferred definition, but it certainly is where the locals consider it to be. I don't have the time or resources to research it, but by your preferred classification which county is Grantown in - a town which many locals feel IS in Morayshire? Looking at the map shown on the Wikipedia article it appears you may consider it in Inverness-shire - an idea a number Grantown locals are actually hostile to. It's interesting that no county description appears on the Grantown entry at all - a town which was historically more important, and is still larger than Aviemore. You have a strange desire to suggest that Aviemore has more connection with Elgin than Inverness, which has certainly not been the case for a considerable time. Do you even know the area personally? To say it IS part of Morayshire and WAS part of Inverness-shire does not accurately describe the current connections the town has - and this has been the case for a considerable period of time. While it is right to mention Morayshire here, I do not understand why you feel the need to emphasise it so much.--82.41.236.68 18:04, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry - I think you have misunderstood me. It previously read something like "<i>..is in the traditional county of Morayshire, but many consider it to be in [the traditional county of] Inverness</i>". This read (to me) as though many considered it to be in the traditional county of Inverness-shire, which it isn't, and thus to say so would be <i>erroneous</i> from a factual standpoint. Aviemore used to be in administrative county of Inverness-shire, but this administrative county no longer exists. It also used to be in the postal county of Inverness-shire, ditto. The only thing is remains in is the traditional county of Morayshire. In fact, Aviemore is still in the registration county of Inverness-shire, which differs from both the traditional county and the former administrative county. Grantown is in the traditional county of Inverness-shire, the registration county of Inverness-shire, the former postal county of Morayshire and the former administrative county of Morayshire. In the case of Grantown, therefore, it isn't currently in anything called 'Morayshire', only Inverness-shire; and two out of three definitions of Inverness-shire contain Grantown. This is largely because, when the administrative counties were created in 1889, the part of inverness-shire Grantown with in lay within the newly-created bounds of administrative morayshire, whereas when the registration counties were created, this part lay within the bounds of registrative Inverness-shire, along with the part of Morayshire that contains Aviemore! Don't blame me for this mess - blame the government!</dd>
<dd>To get to the point: it is inaccurate to say that Aviemore is part of Inverness-shire unless you specify the registration (of property, not births) county - a set of entities that aren't commonly used in popular geography. It is accurate to say that it used to be in the administrative county of Inverness-shire - because it did. It is accurate, also, to say that it is in Morayshire, which is a traditional county that has never been abolished in its original form. I don't have any desire to imply that Aviemore has or hasn't any greater connection to Elgin than to Inverness; I'm merely trying to ensure that it gets as accurate reflection of which county it is in.</dd>
<dd>And yes, I have been to Aviemore several times, and Nethy Bridge, which is also in Morayshire. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 19:01, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not going to change this back as it's not worth the hassle, but given that the "traditional county" no longer actually exists, surely it's more correct to use was than is?--82.41.236.68 15:52, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By definition the traditional county exists; it is the administrative county that no longer exists. Government reforms never abolish traditional bounds, only administrative entities. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 15:57, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
