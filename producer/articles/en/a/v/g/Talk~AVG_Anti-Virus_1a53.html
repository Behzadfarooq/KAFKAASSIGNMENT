<p>This was removed: <i>Also, when scanning POP email, it inserts a line at the bottom of every email stating "No virus found in this incoming message. Checked by AVG Free Edition."</i></p>
<p>Doesn't it? I know it used to. If it doesn't anymore, when did this practice stop? I've still received messages from people that have the AVG tag in their signature. Perhaps the version/date when it stopped should be included in the article, as I know that'd bring a lot of former users back to the product who discarded it when they found out their antivirus client used their email for viral marketing. - <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMcCart42_fb5b.html" title="User:McCart42">McCart42</a> 23:47, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When first installed, it was at version 7.0 and it didn't add any messages then either. As for earlier versions, I don't know what their behaviour was, so I cannot answer your question. I agree that the information would be useful for the article.

<p>Would like to know if anyone knows of any criticisms that AVG has at all. I have to say i have used it for a long time and my opinion of it is very good. Any criticisms anyone has of it, both positive and negative, please put in. I feel the article is a little brief and lacks any personal views both for and against (so as to get NPOV). Any addition by anyone to the article in this respect would be appreciated!</p>
<p>- Criticism would be good as what I have written only really illustrates the good points of AVG, but i've never really had any problems with the software</p>

<dd>Today, after updating AVG, it reported it had found a trojan, when in reality there was none. This only stopped after I uninstalled AVG, as it continously insisted my computer was infected. I'm now running Avast, and it does not report any trojans. I had heard AVG could cause false alarms, but this was quite annoying. 85.19.140.9 23:10, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/g/Talk%7EAVG_Anti-Virus_1a53.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Free trial&quot; - some features not unlocked until license purchased?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Free trial" - some features not unlocked until license purchased?</span></h2>
<p>I notice that the "free trial" download offered for every AVG product is the same file (avg75f_431a848.exe, today). This leads me to speculate that some magic in the license number, once paid for, unlocks the appropriate features for whichever product the user pays for. If so, this would solve the mystery that prompted me to post the following on newsgroup alt.comp.ant-virus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>AVG "Internet Security" - are all the pieces there yet?</b><br />
I installed AVG Internet Security 7.5, the 30-day free trial, over AVG Free 7.1. I'm looking for a product I can install and forget for a non-technical family member, with anti-virus, anti-spy/malware, and a firewall. The AVG Internet Security manual at <a href="http://www.grisoft.cz/softw/70/filedir/doc/AVG_7.5/AVG_Internet%20Security/User_manual/avg_isw_uma_en_75_5.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.grisoft.cz/softw/70/filedir/doc/AVG_7.5/AVG_Internet%20Security/User_manual/avg_isw_uma_en_75_5.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.grisoft.cz/softw/70/filedir/doc/AVG_7.5/AVG_Internet%20Security/User_manual/avg_isw_uma_en_75_5.pdf</a> shows control center selections I do not have, including Anti-Spyware, Anti-Spam, and Firewall.<br />
Does the "free trial" of AVG Internet Security 7.5 have limited capabilities until I pay for the product? I don't want to pay until I see what it can do.<br />
Or, was the product released before all the parts were integrated? My version seemed to be an early release - although the screen layout is slightly different, it still says "AVG Anti-Virus" (not "Internet Security") up in the corner. I can't ask AVG about any of this because I'm not a licensed user. Thanks for any advice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone here know? This is something that perhaps should be mentioned in the article if so. --<a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7ECliffC_df72.html" title="User:CliffC">CliffC</a> 19:05, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No the trials aren't limited in any way, other than the fact that they have a duration of 30 days and by the way, you can ask AVG as the trial is fully supported (just give them your trial licence number). The download page - <a href="http://www.avguk.com/doc/downloads-results/lng/uk/tpl/tpl01?prd=triisw" class="external free" title="http://www.avguk.com/doc/downloads-results/lng/uk/tpl/tpl01?prd=triisw" rel="nofollow">http://www.avguk.com/doc/downloads-results/lng/uk/tpl/tpl01?prd=triisw</a> You do need an appropriate trial licence for Internet Security, contact grisoft for an internet security trial licence <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrontovik_e3c3.html" title="User:Frontovik">Raskolnikov</a> 11:07, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also in answer to your question, the downloaded file is the same for all products (excluding Linux) and the licence number unlocks the appropriate features<a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrontovik_e3c3.html" title="User:Frontovik">Raskolnikov</a> 16:08, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks; I confirmed that yesterday after paying $100 for three 2-year licenses. The license number I received unlocked all the "missing" features noted above, and after 24+ hours I am very happy with the product. I did not contact Grisoft for a trial license number as you suggested, I just figured it would be too much of a hassle. If the 30-day trial was full-featured it would make for a better trial, but I'm sure Grisoft has considered that freeloaders could take advantage of serial multiple trials for their non-free products. --<a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7ECliffC_df72.html" title="User:CliffC">CliffC</a> 19:18, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't really understand Grisoft's business model, but maybe someone who does can look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AVG_Anti-Virus&amp;diff=103706439&amp;oldid=103699026" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AVG_Anti-Virus&amp;diff=103706439&amp;oldid=103699026" rel="nofollow">these changes made by a new account</a> and offer an opinion as to whether they are legitimate. --<a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7ECliffC_df72.html" title="User:CliffC">CliffC</a> 15:19, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In reference to the way that Grisoft works this is correct. Grisoft products are provided and supported by partner comapnies, to allow a higher level of local support. <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrontovik_e3c3.html" title="User:Frontovik">Raskolnikov</a> 13:48, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have added a link to the Grisoft International Partners so it is clear which companies are Official Partners <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrontovik_e3c3.html" title="User:Frontovik">Raskolnikov</a> 15:39, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think that it should be merged with <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grisoft.html" title="Grisoft">Grisoft</a> since this articles contains a lot of information on the <i>program</i>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephenchou0722_3413.html" title="User:Stephenchou0722">Stephenchou0722</a> 00:06, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is true, however this article contains information on Grisoft's other products as well as just AVG Anti-Virus. So it may be an idea to rename the article AVG. Any thoughts or suggestions on this?</p>
<p>I oppose this merger as <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norton.html" title="Norton">Norton</a> also has different pages for its products on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/v/g/AVG_fcef.html" title="AVG">AVG</a> is a well respected free anitivirus and anti-malware product, it deserves its own page.</p>

<p>I can agree with this, but the point I was making is that this article now covers more than AVG Anti-Virus, so at least should be renamed (i.e. shortened to AVG). What are your opinions? Although the Norton page is still Norton Anti-Virus also. <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrontovik_e3c3.html" title="User:Frontovik">Raskolnikov</a> 08:32, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can anyone please verify that the latest edit including this line "However, users of Windows Vista cannot access the help section included with AVG as of March 22, 2007." is the case? <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrontovik_e3c3.html" title="User:Frontovik">Raskolnikov</a> 08:26, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
