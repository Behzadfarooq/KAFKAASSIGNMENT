<p>It seems to me that the use of adding WikiProject banner advertising templates to talk pages has been practiced for over two years:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first time WikiProject templates were added to <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_c546.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages">Wikipedia:Template messages</a> occurred on 18 February 2004 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Template_messages&amp;diff=2436269&amp;oldid=2435936" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Template_messages&amp;diff=2436269&amp;oldid=2435936" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> These were early version of these kinds of templates when we were still using the "msg" namespace instead of the "template" namespace.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiProjectNotice_8601.html" title="Template:WikiProjectNotice">Template:WikiProjectNotice</a>, the standard model for WikiProject banner advertising templates, was first created on 8 September 2004 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:WikiProjectNotice&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:WikiProjectNotice&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>

<li><b>Strongest possible oppose</b> The situations where an article does NOT have a talk page is getting rarer and rarer.

</li>
<li><b>Obvious categorical oppose</b>. This will kill the entire concept of WikiProjects as we know it, as there will no longer be any effective way of recruiting new editors to the project.

<li>An article assessment is discussion on a talk page.

<p>By the way, you know how I realized there was discussion here (rather than on the main page under discussion)?

<p>My first question is how big is the problem that is being discussed. Does every single Wikiproject do it now? I came across a few today while nuking images, I just see them as empty pages need nuking. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 07:08, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most highway projects have been doing it, as well as some states. I've come across talk pages with 2-3 of these and nothing else. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">T</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SPUI_0b50.html" title="Special:Contributions/SPUI">C</a>) 07:09, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Pretty much every <i>active</i> WikiProject does it; pretty much every <i>inactive</i> one does not.

<p>Here's my compromise: WikiProject templates in the talkspace are permitted as long as at least one bit of conversation is posted there. That way, the WikiProjects can have their templates, and SPUI (and others) can utilize the color function. —<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker"><small>THIS IS</small> M<small>ESSED</small></a><a href="../../../r/_/w/Image%7ER_with_umlaut.png_0647.html" class="image" title="Image:R with umlaut.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/a/ad/R_with_umlaut.png" alt="Image:R with umlaut.png" width="6" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/_/w/Image%7ER_with_umlaut.png_0647.html" /></a><a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker"><small>OCKER</small></a> <small><a href="../../../m/e/s/User_talk%7EMessedrocker_915e.html" title="User talk:Messedrocker">(TALK)</a></small> 07:15, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm. I guess then it would be an expansion of the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a>; and {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-empty_b1c9.html" title="Template:Db-empty">db-empty</a>}}. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">T</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SPUI_0b50.html" title="Special:Contributions/SPUI">C</a>) 07:18, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps an expansion of CSD G8 ({{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-talk_ab3f.html" title="Template:Db-talk">db-talk</a>}})?—<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott5114_5c93.html" title="User:Scott5114">Scott5114</a><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScott5114_67da.html" title="User talk:Scott5114">↗</a> 08:50, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>That's not much of a compromise, considering how few talk pages actually have meaningful discussion on them. In most cases, a link to a WikiProject is more useful than having nothing at all. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 16:21, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another possibility would be a separate "metadata" page and tab for this sort of stuff. That would take some developer work though. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">T</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SPUI_0b50.html" title="Special:Contributions/SPUI">C</a>) 07:23, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Oppose</b>. I don't necessarily think it's productive for editors to spam talk pages that have no traffic, but I also don't see how "I need my red tabs" is an important issue. I'd support general guidelines saying that it's a good idea to avoid putting multiple wikiproject adverts on one talk page (eg. keep only the most specific one), and that it's a good idea to avoid putting adverts on non-existent talk pages. But I don't think it's an important enough issue to have enforcable rules or to amend CSD over. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 08:23, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Support</b>, having to add the tags is annoying (I usually forget) and screws up the red/blue tab convention.—<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott5114_5c93.html" title="User:Scott5114">Scott5114</a><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScott5114_67da.html" title="User talk:Scott5114">↗</a> 08:50, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Err, what does your first comment have to do with anything? It's not like you're obligated to add the tags; there are plenty of other people willing to do it for you. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 16:02, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strong oppose</b>. I don't understand why it is even slightly important to know if there has been discussion on a page before. This isn't mentioned in the proposal. If I want to post a comment, I do so whether it is red or not. I don't care if some kid once added some "naughty words" to a talk page and turned the tab blue. What does this red/blue thing even tell you?</p>
<p>What I DO think is very important is that tens of thousands of talk pages on Wikipedia now provide valuable information to users on relevant WikiProjects, status of the article (failed <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> etc.). Where should this information go, if not on the talk page? <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkerma_c63c.html" title="User:Walkerma">Walkerma</a> 17:11, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Oppose</b> per Kirill Lokshin's comments in his vote above. Also I think that there are some articles which simply cannot be reduced down to one wikiproject given the diverse nature of the subject matter of the article and the more focused and specific nature of wikiprojects in general. I see no reason to have to make a jugement call on which project is "more" important in each case and I doubt this could be done in a satisfactory manner in many cases. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Brennan_4621.html" title="User:Chris Brennan">Chris Brennan</a> 17:22, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Oppose</b> as an inconvenience at most. Consider filing a feature request to display the number of discussion edits in the tab itself. <a href="../../../g/c/h/User%7EGChriss_c192.html" title="User:GChriss">GChriss</a> 22:57, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Or maybe the number of sections? Since the tags are always placed in section 0, that'll give a better estimate if multiple edits have been made to the tags themselves. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 22:59, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Oppose</b>. Unless <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Article_validation" class="extiw" title="m:Article_validation">Article validation</a> is turned on (and how long has <i>that</i> been under development?), the entire <a href="../../../1/2E/0/WP%7E1.0_I_e12b.html" title="WP:1.0/I">WP:1.0/I</a> project would be halted because someone is annoyed at the [lack of] color of a tab. Gee. If you've got something important to say, I hope a red tab doesn't stop you. There's no benefit to this proposal, as many editors find these useful.

<li><b>Stong Oppose</b>. They are most usefull.

<li><b>Oppose</b> You say, <i>One can no longer find out if there is discussion on a talk page from the color of the "discussion" tab.</i> Why is it important to find out if there is a discussion on a page.

<p>Why not leave this an essay, and phrase it along the lines of "Please don't add WikiProject templates to empty talk pages." Seems like a simple enough thing, and I don't see why this needs the force of policy. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:04, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Strong Oppose</b> - Project templates not only help recruit editors, but it also helps assess articles on quality and importance, a function that is needed on articles without discussion as well. Plus what about {{<a href="../../../t/a/l/Template%7ETalkheader_069e.html" title="Template:Talkheader">talkheader</a>}}s? They go on blank discussion pages and serve a very useful function for newbies. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlange_d466.html" title="User:Plange">plange</a> 14:18, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Disagree on talkheader. I proposed putting similar text into the Mediawiki message, but nothing happened. My bad I guess. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 21:07, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>The loss of a redlink is such a minor, even trivial, loss compared to the gain of knowing what the rating for quality and importance is that I really can't see even this compromise as a good idea, much less the original suggestion. <b>Strong oppose</b> and suggest this essay be deleted. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:43, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I do not consider this to be a "serious flaw". However, even if it were, the injunction should be to avoid putting templates like <a href="../../../t/a/l/Template%7ETalkheader_069e.html" title="Template:Talkheader">Template:Talkheader</a> and other WikiProject templates on a talk page until after a discussion has been started on that talk page.</dd>

<p>Have the developers make the discussion tab a different colour - perhaps green - if the only contents of a talk page are transcluded templates. Everyone's a winner! --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 22:14, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
