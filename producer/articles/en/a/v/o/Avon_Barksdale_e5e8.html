<p>At the beginning of the series, Avon had control of the entire drug trade in West Baltimore. His territory included the prized Franklin Terrace tower blocks and the nearby low-rise projects referred to as "the pit". Avon ran the organization as a hierarchy with himself at the top and Stringer directly below him. They were isolated from the drugs and only handled money. Avon kept a low profile, eschewing overt displays of wealth so as not to attract attention, and avoiding being photographed. He retained attorney <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Levy_%28The_Wire%29_1cce.html" title="Maurice Levy (The Wire)">Maurice Levy</a>, who advised him on how to counter police investigation, and represented members of the organization at hearings and trials.</p>
<p>Avon kept a team of enforcers on hand for protection, contract killings and intimidation work, including his old friend <a href="../../../w/e/e/Wee-Bey_Brice_446b.html" title="Wee-Bey Brice">Wee-Bey Brice</a>. He had several lieutenants reporting to him with each responsible for trade in a different area of the West Side, and some receiving a percentage of the profits for each package of narcotics sold. Beneath the lieutenants there was typically a second-in-command and several drug dealers. The dealers would hold positions such as: "touts" who were responsible for attracting customers; "runners" who would deliver drugs to the customer; "look-outs" responsible for watching for police or stick-up gangs approaching; or handling the money and the level of supply. Each dealer would receive a weekly cash payment for their work from the lieutenant above them.</p>
<p>Every member of the organization was subject to strict rules designed to thwart police investigations. The low level dealers were not allowed to carry cell phones or take drugs. They were all aware of how to deal with police interrogation and prepared with the knowledge that the organization would protect them up to a point, but if they turned on Avon, they would be marked for death. Lieutenants and enforcers carried <a href="../../../p/a/g/Pager.html" title="Pager">pagers</a> so that they could be contacted. They were subject to the same rules as the dealers, but also knew not to talk business in cars, public places or with anyone outside of the organization. Such discussions were limited to property and territory owned by the Barksdale organization.</p>
<p>A strict telephone usage policy was applied rigidly throughout the organization. The pager messages were encoded to prevent easy tracing of the telephones used, all of which were public telephones. The code was based on simple use of the telephone keypad - numbers were swapped with their opposite across the number five, and five was exchanged with zero. This made it easily accessible to the poorly educated drug dealers. Each pager-carrying member of the hierarchy was identified by a number. When pages were returned with a phone call no names were supposed to be used, and if a name was used, the speaker was reminded not to. A separate code was used for resupply signals, which involved turning the pager display upside down.</p>
<p>Avon received his narcotics supply through a connection to a <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominican.html" title="Dominican">Dominican</a><sup title="Link needs disambiguation" class="noprint">[<a href="../../../d/_/_/WP%7ED_9a57.html" title="WP:D"><i>disambiguation needed</i></a>]</sup> organization in New York and had several other options for suppliers in surrounding cities. The main supply of narcotics was separated from the rest of the organization and held in a house in Pimlico where it could be diluted and divided into smaller "stashes" for distribution among the Barksdale towers. Once inside the towers, these smaller packages were moved from room to room on a regular basis, to avoid the scrutiny of police and stick-up men such as <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar Little</a>.</p>
<p>Avon had a main office in his front, a strip club named Orlando's. It was here, behind a locked and heavily guarded door, that the drug money was counted and secured in a safe before being sent on to its ultimate destination. Avon usually conducted his business in this office, rarely venturing onto the street. The club's owner, Orlando Blocker, was kept completely away from the drugs in order to maintain the front's appearance of legitimacy.</p>
<p>The organization laundered its profits through front businesses including a funeral parlor, Orlando's strip club, and a property developing company (B&amp;B). They also invested in property but never using Barksdale or Bell's names. The organization made campaign contributions and later bribes to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Davis_4c47.html" title="Clay Davis">Senator Clay Davis</a>, ostensibly for assistance in receiving developing contracts.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, Barksdale grew up in the terrace high-rises and avoided arrest, remaining a furtive but increasingly powerful force on the west side of Baltimore's Drug Trade. A former amateur boxer who once fought in a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Gloves_77be.html" title="Golden Gloves">Golden Gloves</a> Tournament, Avon was taught by his father how to survive in "the game" at an early age. He brought his friend, small-time thief <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Russell "Stringer" Bell</a>, into the drug trade during their teens and took over the terrace high-rises during a gang war with a rival in 1999.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Edit section: Season one">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season one</span></h3>
<p>Avon's errant nephew and lieutenant <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Angelo_Barksdale_7446.html" title="D'Angelo Barksdale">D'Angelo</a> had murdered someone in public, so Avon had Stringer pay a witness, Nakeesha Lyles, to change her story in court. D'Angelo was acquitted, but Avon chastised him for costing the organization time and money, and demoted him from the 221 Tower into "The Pit" to replace <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barksdale_Organization_37fd.html#Ronnie_Mo" title="Barksdale Organization">Ronnie Mo</a>, who had recently been arrested. Avon also arranged for <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barksdale_Organization_37fd.html#Marquis_.22Bird.22_Hilton" title="Barksdale Organization">"Bird" Hilton</a> to murder a second witness, William Gant, who he had been unable to intimidate or bribe. The body was left on display outside the 221 Tower, to send a message to people who might consider testifying. D'Angelo was shaken by the murder and began to have second thoughts about his life, but Avon persuaded him to remain loyal to the family.</p>
<p>Avon was angered when The Pit's stash was robbed by legendary Baltimore stick-up man <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar Little</a>, and he placed a heavy bounty on Omar and his crew. Wee-Bey killed <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_and_Associates_27ba.html#John_Bailey" title="Omar Little and Associates">Bailey</a>, a member of Omar's crew. Omar's lover <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_and_Associates_27ba.html#Brandon" title="Omar Little and Associates">Brandon</a> was captured and tortured by Stringer, Wee-Bey, Bird and Stinkum. In response, Omar killed Stinkum and wounded Wee-Bey, culminating with a failed assassination attempt on Avon outside of Orlando's. Wee-Bey managed to save Avon at the last minute.</p>
<p>The Pit was also subject to raids which seized a second resupply of narcotics and arrested a carrier Kevin Johnston and a dealer Robert Browning. The police also seized an entire day's profits from Wee-Bey, totalling $22,000 dollars. They also briefly seized a payment on its way to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Davis_4c47.html" title="Clay Davis">State Senator Davis</a> but were forced to return it because of his political influence. The robbery and police activity combined raised suspicion that there was a leak in the pit, and an increasingly paranoid Avon ordered D'Angelo to remove the pay phones (which had indeed been wiretapped).</p>
<p>Barksdale's front man <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barksdale_Organization_37fd.html#Wendell_.22Orlando.22_Blocker" title="Barksdale Organization">Orlando</a> had been trying to take part in the drug trade, and Avon felt obliged to beat him, warning him that the only reason he was front man was because he was clean. Orlando persisted in trying to go into the business for himself, and was arrested by an undercover state police officer. Avon promptly has his name removed from the club's license. Orlando agreed to aid the police in their investigation, and Avon sent Wee-Bey, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barksdale_Organization_37fd.html#Little_Man" title="Barksdale Organization">Little Man</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barksdale_Organization_37fd.html#Savino" title="Barksdale Organization">Savino</a> to kill him. The job was complicated when they found a woman accompanying Orlando and Little Man panicked and shot her. Avon quickly learned that the woman was <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kima_Greggs_8476.html" title="Kima Greggs">Detective Greggs</a>.</p>
<p>The shooting of a detective led to a massive crackdown from the police. Savino was forced to turn himself in, but faced a sentence of just three years because he was not directly implicated in the shooting. Avon and Stringer held a crisis meeting with attorney <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Levy_%28The_Wire%29_1cce.html" title="Maurice Levy (The Wire)">Maurice Levy</a>, who advised them to remove any possible loose ends. Avon ordered several murders, including unreliable enforcer Little Man, Nakeesha Lyles and a young dealer from The Pit named <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barksdale_Organization_37fd.html#Wallace" title="Barksdale Organization">Wallace</a>.</p>
<p>Avon finally incriminated himself on a hidden camera in his office at the end of season one, and was arrested, sentenced to seven years.</p>
<p><a name="Season_two" id="Season_two"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Edit section: Season two">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season two</span></h3>
<p>Avon continued to run his organization from within the prison through Stringer. D'Angelo and Wee-Bey were imprisoned alongside Avon, both due to serve much longer terms. Wee-Bey informed Avon that a prison guard, <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_enforcement_characters_of_The_Wire_bf56.html#Dwight_Tilghman" title="Law enforcement characters of The Wire">Dwight Tilghman</a>, was harassing him, in retaliation for the murder of a relative. Avon tried to reason with Tilghman, but the guard refused to talk to him. Knowing that Tilghman had a side line in smuggling narcotics into the prison, Avon contrived to supply him with tainted heroin, causing numerous deaths. When the warden began an investigation, Avon came forth as an "informant", accusing Tilghman of the crime. Narcotics were found in Tilghman's car, and Avon's first parole hearing was brought forward in exchange for the information. Despite being the one ultimately responsible for the crime, he is due to be out of jail within a year. D'Angelo grows more distant from Avon, refusing to take part in the scheme, and seeming depressed, even turning to drug use. Without Avon's knowledge, Stringer has D'Angelo killed in a fake suicide.</p>
<p>Because Avon's arrest was closely followed by the arrest of one of their suppliers, they were suspicious that Avon might have named them to receive a lighter sentence, and the business relationship was brought to an end. Avon recommended secondary sources to Stringer but was unable to secure anything much better. Stringer suggested that they give up a portion of their territory to their rival <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proposition_Joe_e101.html" title="Proposition Joe">Proposition Joe</a>. Avon quickly dismissed the idea, reminding Stringer how hard they worked to seize the territory in the first place. Stringer decided to act behind Avon's back and allowed Proposition Joe to move in despite Avon's order. Avon responded by contracting the feared <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_level_characters_of_The_Wire_f406.html#Brother_Mouzone" title="Street level characters of The Wire">Brother Mouzone</a> to defend his turf. After Mouzone had been shot by <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar</a> (which Stringer arranged, behind Avon's back), Avon reluctantly agreed to Stringer's proposal.</p>
<p><a name="Season_three" id="Season_three"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Edit section: Season three">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season three</span></h3>
<p>Upon his release from prison, Avon is outraged that Stringer has let their control slip as much as it has, and gets involved in a gang war with up-and-coming <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlo_Stanfield_d6f5.html" title="Marlo Stanfield">Marlo Stanfield</a>. Avon employed a woman named Devonne through <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barksdale_Organization_37fd.html#Slim_Charles" title="Barksdale Organization">Slim Charles</a> to find Marlo. She encounters Marlo in a bar, seduces him, and gives him her phone number so they can meet up again. When they later plan to meet up, it becomes clear that a trap has been set and Marlo's enforcer Chris Partlow shoots and kills a Barksdale crew member named Tater and wounds Avon in the process. Later, Marlo finds Devonne and shoots her dead in front of her home.</p>
<p>Avon and Stringer continue to clash over their leadership styles; Proposition Joe tells Stringer that he will withhold the quality product if Avon's war with Stanfield continues, but Avon believes that they will look weak. Stringer ultimately admits that he had D'Angelo killed for the good of the organization. He then gets in contact with <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard__Bunny__Colvin_6ea4.html" title="Howard &quot;Bunny&quot; Colvin">Major Colvin</a> and provides him with evidence against Avon. Meanwhile, Brother Mouzone returns to Baltimore and demand that Avon tell him where to find Stringer. Knowing it will mean his friend's death, Avon does so, and Mouzone (along with Omar) kill Stringer.</p>
<p>Avon was ultimately arrested again; based on evidence that Stringer provided, police raided Barksdale's wartime safehouse and were able to put weapons and conspiracy charges on all those present. Barksdale has five years remaining on his parole backup from the earlier charge. In addition, weapons and conspiracy charges have added another twenty-five years to that sentence.<sup id="_ref-OCS_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCS" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-AB_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AB" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
