<p>I found a consensus to exist for the adoption of the proposal. The voting saw 43 votes cast, 27 in favour, offering a 62% majority. Although at the weak end of establishing consensus, I note <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> appears to have amended his vote, which would alter the result. It also appears a number of objections are grounded on the idea that people will continue to add trivia sections. I think those opinions can be somewhat discounted, since they don't address the proposal itself, which offers advice on how to deal with such circumstances. We don't abolish <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> because people continuously add articles which require deletion.</p>

<p><i>This is a suggested guideline, not a policy.</i></p>
<p><b>Avoid organizing articles as lists of isolated facts regarding the topic.</b> A number of articles contain lists of isolated facts, often grouped into their own section labelled "Trivia", "Notes", "Facts", or "Other information". We often refer to these informally as <i>trivia sections</i>.</p>
<p>These lists can be useful for developing a new article, as it sets a low bar for novice contributors to add information without having to keep in mind article organization or presentation - just tack a new fact on to the list. However, as articles grow, these lists become increasingly disorganized and difficult to read. It is ideal to provide a logical grouping and ordering of facts that gives an integrated presentation providing context and smooth transitions. Whenever you see a "trivia section", take a look at each fact and consider how you might integrate it into the larger text, whether by inserting it into a section or adding a new section. Creating subsections to group items in the list may be helpful in the search for an ideal presentation. Integrating these facts may require additional research to establish further context, locate suitable references to cite, or identify relationships with other facts.</p>
<p>This guideline does not suggest removal of trivia sections. Instead, consider it a list of "facts pending integration" or "facts lacking sufficient context for integration". Seek to minimize it, but meanwhile leave it in place as a raw store of facts for both readers and editors to work with.</p>

<dd>I think this is a good adjustment to the original proposal. Case in point: I recently added a <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Butler_Yeats_9515.html#Popular_references" title="William Butler Yeats">Popular references</a> section to the Yeats article. This is quickly turning into the kind of long, unsatisfying list Deco describes. I'm planning on "delistifying" it in the near future, but it wasn't a bad way to collect some fun facts. —<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohndburger_f362.html" title="User:Johndburger">johndburger</a> 23:41, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's why the final draft will look more like Deco's proposal than mine...good stuff. And when FAC nominators insist that the List of Random Facts they have is good, I can finally have a guideline of some sort to back me up.--<a href="../../../o/s/b/User%7EOsbus_07fa.html" title="User:Osbus">Osbus</a> 00:03, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I support this rewriting of the guideline. I'd like to see "This guideline does not suggest removal of trivia sections" removed, though (and change the next bit to "Trivia sections should be considered" or something). <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 05:55, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, <b>Avoid Lists of Facts</b> is a good basis for a draft. Having lists of facts in an an article makes it look less encyclopedic. (Admittely, I hadn't opened an encyclopedia in the 17 years prior to viewing Wikipedia.) In an article about a political unit (country, state, etc...), a reference to a list of governors/presidents/grand-poo-bahs is useful, but the list itself does not belong in the article. A list of famous residents of a place, alumni of a school, members of an association can easily get out of hand, yet many articles have such. The draft should explain why those are not good content. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:34, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a tenable solution. But, then, this is an encyclopedia, not an indiscriminate collection of information. I think editors are perfectly within their rights to delete random trivia factoids on sight. And I'd caution against avoiding "popular culture" sections altogether; these can be nice additions to articles, provided they are well written, academically sound, and analytical rather than exhaustive. I'm currently reading a book on Jeki la Njambè (sadly, we have no article yet), an oral epic of the <a href="../../../d/u/a/Duala_people.html" title="Duala people">Duala people</a> of Cameroon, and the author devotes quite a few pages to interpretations in Cameroonian popular culture. So I guess I'm trying to say: If you've got something intelligent to say about <a href="../../../f/u/j/Fujin.html" title="Fujin">Fujin</a> in popular culture, say it. If all you have is the fact that a character in <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_VIII_4d12.html" title="Final Fantasy VIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></i> is named Fujin, keep it to yourself or put it in the Fujin (Final Fantasy character) article. But ghettoizing these sections to X in popular culture is akin to sweeping the dust under the rug. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 13:04, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the pondered answer. <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigurd.html" title="Sigurd">Sigurd</a> actually provides a very good example of what you say ("well written, academically sound, and analytical"). There's a "Adaptations and parallels" section that makes intelligent reference to Tolkien, Arthur, Greek &amp; Irish legends, and reteliings by modern authors and tv shows; then comes "References in Popular Culture", which is a random list of four uses of the name Siegfried in various cartoons and video games (I'm assuming that's what they are -- there are no wikilinks to help you). One of these sections deserves to stay; the other warrants either ghettoization or eradication. And while ghettoization (sweeping under the rug, yeah!) might seem like a failure of resolve, it should stop the same cruft from re-appearing on the main article three weeks down the road. <a href="../../../b/o/l/User%7EBolivian_Unicyclist_fb3a.html" title="User:Bolivian Unicyclist">Bolivian Unicyclist</a> 21:11, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think there's a fairly fundamental difference between that essay and this proposal - it aims to establish standards for inclusion of relatively unimportant facts, while this proposal discusses the specific technique of organizing articles as unordered lists of facts, which may or may not actually contain trivial facts. I'd suggest renaming it, but "trivia sections" is what everybody calls them. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 13:30, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it's not quite the same issue (yes, ambiguous terminology with the 'trivia'), but a list of "references in pop culture" factoids is the sort of thing that's likely to emerge from the project page's suggestion to produce "more targeted list[s] of closely-related items". It's the next problem down the line. <a href="../../../b/o/l/User%7EBolivian_Unicyclist_fb3a.html" title="User:Bolivian Unicyclist">Bolivian Unicyclist</a> 21:11, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with this proposal in general, as I strongly advocate eliminating such sections altogether. However, I can support this mild proposal for now, pending stronger wording in some future proposal stating that trivia sections should be deleted on sight. Nevertheless, the current policy skirts one of the major problems with trivia sections: The facts in them are almost never sourced as required by <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. Perhaps a stern warning could be added to the proposal regarding the absolute necessity of providing a source if you don't want your random fact about Napoleon's cat removed from the article. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 14:35, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Today I put this proposal into action with the article on <a href="../../../e/r/_/ER_%28TV_series%29_ba94.html" title="ER (TV series)">ER (TV series)</a>. I made two edits which decimated the trivia section of that article by moving the information from the trivia section into other sections of the text. If you wish, you may use that article as an example. There is still a trivia section in the article, however, it is greatly reduced from appoximately 20 items down to 5.<br />

Trivia that was valid/important to the show was incorporated into the appropriate section in a more encyclopedic manner. Any trivia that was felt unnecessary was moved to the talk page, so that people could discuss whether they thought it was valid or not (not much argument on these by the way). This has worked really well and the trivia section is reduced and the article is better partly because it's inflected with those interesting bits of info as you read. - <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepheus_6d02.html" title="User:Zepheus">Zepheus</a> 00:23, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a part of the effort to reduce trivia categories and convert them into paragraph prose, we should identify and categorize articles whose trivia sections are just too large. For that reason, I am proposing a template (and category) we could use to mark articles with long trivia sections.

<dd>Now that "Avoid trivia" is a guideline, I think this template may need to be reworded. When we say "the trivia is too large" we are implying that a small trivia section is ok, whereas the guideline is saying that we should be avoiding trivia sections altogether. I think changing it so that it is more consistent with the message contained in the guideline would be more appropriate. Maybe something like "<b>To meet Wikipedia's guidelines regarding trivia section, this section may require editing</b>. Please check this list to determine if any relevant points should be incorporated into the article, and remove any points that are not considered relevant. For further information please refer to <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_trivia_sections_in_articles_c909.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles">Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles</a>." Then rather than being categorised as "articles with long trivia secitons", they could be categorized as "articles with trivia sections". I know the wording I've suggested is rough, and needs some work, but maybe something along these lines might be ok.

<p>Recently I've been moving trivia sections in their entirity to the talk page, and calling for anyone there to help integrate it into the article. Is this a good way to handle the problem? -- <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigital_Watches_3132.html" title="User:Digital Watches">Digital Watches!</a> 05:26, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think this is a bit drastic personally. If there are many watchers, and they can take quick action in getting a section back on the article, it might be okay. But at least some of the items in a typical trivia list are of sufficient interest that I'd rather give the reader an unfiltered list than nothing at all. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 09:09, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Perhaps putting a note on the talk page <i>without</i> moving the trivia section would inform editors that this guideline exists. I appreciate that these lists can be considered as a way of holding information pending integration into the article, but a lot of editors add to the list in good faith, and I think they believe that they have achieved an aim, because they don't know that the aim is integration. Informing them would be more desirable than alienating them. If the message on the talk page noted the existence of the trivia section, and requested interested editors to work on integrating/eliminating - and contains a link to this article - it might help new editors understand what the aim is. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 14:20, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Or.... I just noticed the "the trivia is too large" template in the message above. I wonder if a "please help us integrate this trivia" template would be useful. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 14:21, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. I think this is a great idea as long as there are restrictions in place.

<dd>Right. Trivia doesn't fulfill the role of a note. I'm inferring that some trivia <i>might</i> meet that qualification, and should be elevated to note status in a particular instance, however I'm already running into problems with grouping related trivia into new sections. I decided to do a little experiment on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Departed_1c5b.html" title="The Departed">The Departed</a></i>. I noticed that there was enough film homage in the trivia section to start a new subtopic, but before I had a chance to even rewrite it, an anon started to expand it tangentialy, in effect trivializing the trivia. I don't want to cry, so I am forcing myself to laugh at this spectacle.

<p>So while I think it's worth discussing what parts of the essay might be worthy of guideline status, I do not recommend doing a full-out merger until such time as the Trivia essay can be considered elevated to guideline status. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:49, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am wondering about the policies of trivia removal where it applies to films. there is always information that is interesting while not necessarily notable in regards to the article itself (ie, Nick Nolte being an alternative choice for the role of Han Solo in Star Wars, etc.) I would imagine that certain trivia would be equivalent to post-production notes, as is usually seen on Bonus CDs of released DVD movies. I am currently making edits in the Children of Men (film) article, and I have been advised that all the trivia will be purged within 72 hours. Before then, I have seen info simply removed without discussion. Can I get some input on this issue?<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 20:05, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"The album art for the Pink Floyd album Animals is clearly referenced in the "Ark of Arts" scene. The building housing the depository is Battersea Power Station, the same factory pictured on the cover, and an inflatable pig is visible outside the window of the dining room.[28]"<br />
Things like this can go into "References to Pop Culture" , something along those lines. The same thing can be done for pretty much every "trivia" fact, that it can be renamed something else.--<a href="../../../o/s/b/User%7EOsbus_07fa.html" title="User:Osbus">Osbus</a> 22:04, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as how to handle removal, if something is removed without discussion or reason given, and you disagree with the removal, you could probably simply revert the deletion and include a comment on the talk page asking for feedback as to why it was removed. It may turn out there was a legitimate reason for it, or it may turn out that it was just a random shot from the dark and nothing happens.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, behind-the-scenes trivia that has no published reference cited for verification can be safely removed, and readded later if desired once a good source is found. (Note that IMDB trivia sections are not completely reliable, so should probably not be used as the sole source for verification.) And in general it's usually better stylistically to try and incorporate facts into the article itself as opposed to using a bullet point list. Massive bullet point trivia at the end of an article is usually more distracting than useful to a reader. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any truly useful piece of trivia can be added to an article somewhere.

<p>There seems to be a proliferation of "<i>insert topic name here</i> in popular culture" sections, which to me is just another form of trivia. I'm not sure whether this page is an appropriate forum for discussing this, but I'd like to put forward the view that these sections completely lower the academic standard of Wikipedia and should be <b>banned</b>. Frequently, they are filled with geeky "trainspotter" or "uberfan" type observations. Let's take <a href="../../../s/t/y/Styx.html" title="Styx">Styx</a> for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Styx&amp;oldid=105438816#Popular_Culture" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Styx&amp;oldid=105438816#Popular_Culture" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This is a topic on Ancient Greek mythology, and an idea that has permeated society and culture for yonks. Yet it's filled with a list of references in song by minor bands that most people will not have heard of. (Well, it was until I deleted this section in disgust). If it's not a band, it's a computer game or a TV programme. The same goes for "<i>insert topic name here</i> in fiction". The mere fact that something is worthy enough of an article in an encyclopaedia means that it's part of language, and people are going to refer to it. Does WP have to list every instance of these references? Does anyone agree with me or am I just ranting to myself? <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 16:56, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In many cases these references need to be in the opposite article of the reference in my opinion. Ergo in the "album"-article of the song that references <a href="../../../s/t/y/Styx.html" title="Styx">styx</a>, not in the styx article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDJ_515e.html" title="User:TheDJ">TheDJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDJ_8bc8.html" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheDJ_82c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WikiProject Television</a>) 18:09, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would say that while these sections have a tendency to become bloated, they are in principle useful to demonstrate the popular media notability of the subject. It provides a way to in a paragraph or two list some (hopefully) important cultural references to the subject as a means of verifying for the reader its importance and popularity. Thus while I agree as a style point that you probably should limit the scope and size of these sections to a handful of key references, I don't think the sections should be banned entirely. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:10, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I could very easily be convinced to ban the sections entirely.

<dd>I like the gist of that idea, but the cutoffs are a bit arbitrary. How about this rough guideline (not meant to be followed to mathematical precision!) - the percentage of the article devoted to "references in popular culture" should roughly reflect the percentage of the amount of time "popular culture" represents of the total age of the referenced object or concept. So: "Superman in popular culture" is fair game for a bigger section, but "Julius Caesar in popular culture" would not be, and "The Moon in popular culture" would absolutely not be. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 12:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My two cents on the wording of the {{<a href="../../../t/r/i/Template%7ETrivia_9857.html" title="Template:Trivia">trivia</a>}} template and what people are saying on that talk page (and this may be a bit controversial), if indeed, trivia should be avoided in Wikipedia, as worded in the aforementioned template at the moment, it does to me swing to imply that any trivia should not be added to Wikipedia. If this is the case, shouldn't we implement the fact that trivia should not be included in Wikipedia (as unencyclopedic) and more than likely fail <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attribution</a> guidelines through either being unverifiable, original research, likely <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">hoaxes</a> or urban legends. I feel this sort of thing wouldn't be encyclopedic and therefore have no place in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>My suggestion therefore is we should be more aggressive and insist on reliable sources (as per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>) for trivia to be included in the <i>body</i> of an article or insist on its removal from an article, or go further and make it part of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, maybe as <b>avoid organizing articles as lists of isolated facts regarding the topic</b> (to quote from Osbus on an unrelated topic)? --<a href="../../../t/g/h/User%7ETghe-retford_2fb2.html" title="User:Tghe-retford"><b>tghe</b>retford</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/g/h/User_talk%7ETghe-retford_e470.html" title="User talk:Tghe-retford">talk</a>)</small> 23:54, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think so. 1: We avoid trivia SECTIONS, not trivia per se. 2: Much of what usually is marked as trivia in many cases can still be usefull information. 3: For many average editors it can be very hard however to distinguish trivia from important data. As such the sections are usually handy "dump" places for them. And interested editors who cleanup the articles usually know what to do with it. Delete, or rewrite somewhere in prose. You could say that trivia sections have a purpose in developing an article, but don't belong in FA quality articles I guess. We have many types of stylistic issues in wikipedia that are not allowed in articles, yet there is not a downright ban on them. It's one of the problems of a developing encyclopedia with unexperienced editors contributing. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDJ_515e.html" title="User:TheDJ">TheDJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDJ_8bc8.html" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheDJ_82c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WikiProject Television</a>) 00:07, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia articles should not have "dump" sections. If people want to dump random crap somewhere to figure out if it belongs in an article, they should do it in the talk page, not in the body of an article. And as to your statement that editors who clean these up usually know what to do with this crap... unfortuately, that's not true. Look at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, for God's sake.

<p>What we should do however, is merge some of the Trivia Essay sections that we link to now right into this article. Trivia was indeed a very useful essay once, but I think it's clear that much of it's use is now covered by this page and the template. Let's take from it what's useful, and then move the essay page to this page. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDJ_515e.html" title="User:TheDJ">TheDJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDJ_8bc8.html" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheDJ_82c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WikiProject Television</a>) 00:17, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In addition to the above comments, note that <i>all</i> information in Wikipedia is supposed to be referenced. So if information isn't verifiable or isn't referenced within the article itself (after giving sufficient time to produce such references) then it should be removed. That applies to everything, not just "trivia", so there's no need to single out trivia in regards to being "unverifiable". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 15:54, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do believe that we need to be more "aggressive", all to often people use the argument that if trivia can't be integrated (because for example it's non-encyclopaedic) then it should be left there, "forever".

<dd>The "What is trivia?" section in the essay does a much better job of defining trivia than this one, and I would support bringing it over, except that in the guideline as currently written, the definition of trivia is just a confusing digression from a discussion of how to organize information in articles. The "trivia sections" being discussed here are really more like "miscellaneous information" sections, and may contain information that is not trivial at all.</dd>
<dd>I would suggest removing the current "What is trivia?" section and expanding "Guidance" to more fully discuss both integration and removal. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 01:31, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No official policy, IMO: you have to work it out with the other editors and come to a consensus.

<p>As a relative latecomer to this discussion, I'd nevertheless like to add my two cents' worth. First of all, I personally feel that Wikipedia sometimes tries too hard to be a "quality encyclopedia" on par with the likes of the Encyclopedia Britannica. While I understand the motivation, not only is that unrealistic with inexperienced authors (yours truly included) contributing; it is not necessarily the only, or even the best, way to maintain a body of information.</p>
<p>As a reader, part of what I find so addictive about Wikipedia is that the articles are more than just a dry collection of facts. While I fully agree that neutral POV should be maintained, "trivia" that is generally classified as "unencyclopedic" or "unimportant" can still add value to an article. The bottom line, IMHO, should be that if a tidbit of information enriches the user's experience, then that tidbit deserves to be included.</p>
<p>Obviously, that is an impossible criterion to evaluate objectively. To pick an example out of a random trivia section, the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spock.html" title="Spock">Spock</a> article states: "The Vulcan peace sign (the Vulcan salute), employed by Spock, is a modification of the sign used by Kohens, the Jewish priestly class. Actor Leonard Nimoy devised this gesture and the accompanying greeting ("Live long and prosper," "Peace and long life") based on his own Jewish heritage.</p>
<p>This certainly meets my definition of trivia. It is not material information about the character of Spock, yet the first time I came across it, I went "how about that" and ended up delving into several articles about Jewish religion and history. In the end, I learned something I would not otherwise have, I felt enriched, and I got more joy out of reading the article. I feel there would have been a real loss if that piece of trivia were to be removed from the Spock article due to a well-intended, but IMHO misguided Wikipedia guideline. Facts that <b>are</b> encyclopedic, such as Spock's birthdate, may "belong" better, but do not enrich my Wikipedia experience as much.</p>
<p>The above is just one example of a perhaps difficult to define, yet real, reason why I can spend hours jumping from link to link on Wikipedia. I've hardly felt compelled to do the same with any traditional encyclopediae I've come across. --<a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStian_d1bb.html" title="User:Stian">Stian Oksavik</a></p>

<dd>I have to agree but what we should be discouraging is too much trivia and trivia that isnt really that relevant or even factual. For example, speculation of the origin of characters, names, song lyrics, ect, where there is no reliable source backing it up. I consider this fancruft and not worth mentioning in a wikipedia article. Anything that says "may be a reference to..." or "could have significance to..." is generally original research and not really backed up by anything, this should be removed from trivia sections. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParadox_CT_add1.html" title="User:Paradox CT">Paradox CT</a> 07:44, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>But the source of the "Vulcan salute" is *not* a trivial fact in relation to <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spock.html" title="Spock">Spock</a>. Sources of inspiration are an important part of any article about a work of art or fictional character. Your example is covered by this guideline only in the sense that it's currently sitting in a big disorganized "trivia" section and should be better integrated with the article. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 09:47, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, this fact could actually be integrated into an article or section explaining what the salute means. much better than a trivia section. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParadox_CT_add1.html" title="User:Paradox CT">Paradox CT</a> 06:23, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Paradox and Celithemis about this particular item. I will however also point out that the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spock.html" title="Spock">Spock</a> article is shockingly bad. It's badly organized, it goes into digressions (about, for instance, the Mirror spock, which should really be covered at the Mirror, Mirror episode page), it has some integrated useless trivia and some unintegrated useful trivia. In short, the article needs major improving. (Actually, I was so disappointed with it, I've nominated it to be an article improvement drive collaboration at <a href="../../../a/c/i/WP%7EACID_feef.html" title="WP:ACID">WP:ACID</a>. Wikipedia can do so much better than that, especially on that topic.) <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 15:22, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It does occasionally happen that an entire section has nothing worth integrating -- most often when it has just been added and only has a couple of irrelevant items -- so it's not a good idea to categorically forbid deletion of entire sections. The guideline already quite strongly suggests integration rather than deletion of useful material, so there's little to be gained by this change in any case. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 00:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>People aren't getting the message... maybe it can be rewritten for what you mention, but I see people blank entire sections of 5+ items because "Trivia isn't allowed on Wikipedia" and so forth. But if someone's just adding 1 item to a new trivia section, that's pretty easy to integrate it or throw it out as not worth mentioning in the first place. Furthermore my edit didn't "categorically forbid" deletion of trivia, it just said doing so might annoy some editors, which it will. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 00:39, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't really appreciate being Wikistalked... I've had this same dispute many times over people deleting trivia sections, on unrelated articles. The items in that case weren't integrated into the text... some were but the rest were just blanked. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 00:49, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I had no intention of wikistalking; I was curious as to whether a particular issue had led to the change, and whether that might point to a different solution. It seemed instead to point to the change having arisen from a misunderstanding. I'd still be very interested in examples of someone still thinking trivia sections should be indiscriminately blanked <i>even after reading this guideline</i>, because I can't see how it can be read that way at all. It already says "Don't simply remove it, but seek to minimize it", after all.</dd>
<dd>The principle set out here -- basically "integrate anything that is at all useful, throw out material only if that's impossible" -- seems to me to fully cover what needs to be covered. If everything is useful everything should be integrated; if nothing is, nothing should be. Specific language about removing whole sections simply distracts from the basic principle and creates grounds for wikilawyering. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 00:58, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(outdent)OK. I apologize for bringing that up. I'm still left in the same place, though: the guideline seems very clear already. If I saw someone blanking a trivia section that contained stuff that should have been integrated, I would point them at this guideline to explain why that's not the right approach. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 01:28, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think that the "Don't simply remove it, but seek to minimize it" sentence in that paragraph already accomplishes the spirit of W.marsh's change, except for explaining why. Maybe that sentence could be changed instead? But I do think the reason not to just remove a trivia section has more to do with seeing that there may be value in it, rather than the reaction other editors might have. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 03:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
