<p>I'm not sure Kantor's book should be referenced here, at least not without a caveat. Most of the cases he discusses seem to be about what we'd call "commitment-phobic" behaviours rather than the more broad spectrum of AvPD, i.e. general avoidance of social interaction, and the problems this produces.--Eyeresist 01:34, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As I mentioned in the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borderline_Personality_Disorder_b57e.html" title="Borderline Personality Disorder">Borderline Personality Disorder</a> discussion page, I'm doing some research for a novel I'm writing, with a character who I thought had BDP. Having read this article on Avoidant Personality Disorder though, it seems like my character is more of an AvPD than a BPD. Thanks Wikipedia! However, I think those with AvPD share some similarities with BPDs. It's interesting stuff.</p>

<p>Do all Social Phobics have Avoidant Personality Disorder? If not, how do you confidently distinguish the two? This article's discription of APD sounds like things that go on in the mind of a clinically socially anxious person.--<a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Daily_634b.html" title="User:J. Daily">J.

<dd>Yes, this is puzzling me too. What is the difference between Social Anxiety Disorder and AvPD? By the way, does that 'hello baby' belong in the mnemonic section?! <a href="../../../k/h/i/User%7EKhirad_33fd.html" title="User:Khirad">Khirad</a> 05:25, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article says "Research suggests that people with avoidant personality disorder, in common with social phobics, excessively monitor their own internal reactions when they are involved in social interaction. However, unlike social phobics they also excessively monitor the reactions of the people with whom they are interacting." I would appreciate it if anyone could tell me if this is accurate, or if there are any other differences. --DearPrudence 17:57, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was diagnosed with AvPD nearly 6 years ago and I've done a lot research on AvPD and Social Phobia. From what I've learned, the difference is very little, but basically the feeling of anxiety in AvPD is a lot more severe. I had AvPD so bad that I couldn't even apply for a job or have any friends. It was to the point where I had to either ask for help or commit suicide. Fortunately, I sought help. I'm so much better now...have several friends, going to college, and have a job... So, yeah, that's my two cents. Ioxmo 02:43, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think this article should make clear that, contrarily to some other disorders related to social interaction, a person suffering from AvPD is not happy with avoiding social interaction and staying alone, and yearns to somehow find the strength to communicate with other people and let them know her true self and be appreciated just like anybody else. I was diagnosed with AvPD myself and by no means does it mean that I will not attend a party or any social gathering. I actually seek such gatherings, each time hoping that it will be the day when I will really talk to friends who will be there and whom I love.

<dd>I really do like it when the discussion becomes circular and returns to the subject with an insight or formulation of a need to be addressed in the article. However, I also feel the need to stay on task, to be concise, and perhaps limit the personal confessional side a bit. Many of us also have experiences to share but, in my opinion, refraining from overdoing it will help the work of editing this article by staying on task. Personal talk pages might be a better place.<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearpa_6be0.html" title="User:Bearpa">Bearpa</a> 03:19, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It appears that the citations in the article are scholarly but not really very wikiupdated. So I propose that the format of citation in this article be converted to a more "linkful" one. I'm no expert on citation in wikipedia but I've seen other articles with external links which are more convenient to reference. However, I've just looked through the now recommended cite.php footnotes format extension (not the deprecated Footnote3 system), and I understand why there is an almost complete lack of external links cited and referenced. The system is quite a bit more intimidating, and the old Footnote3 format, which I was just getting the hang of, will someday soon be obsolete. So the author here chose to use an alternate method, which is acceptable according to one of the <i>citing</i> wikipages I've read. I propose that interested contributors discuss an appropriate re-citing to allow extensive external links. This could be either finding a willing cite.php adept to re-cite the present references, or one of the presently interested contributors changing over the present cites to Footnote3 so that it can be converted later, via a bot, also wielded by an adept. Interested parties please respond so we can all start thinking about this. Don't forget to use colons to indent your entries and please sign them so we all know who is saying what.</p>
<p>Now I want to add a citation that is marked "needed" in the article. By the way, this entry emphasises the above comments because some of the sources cited themselves offer a wealth of information as well as numerous corroborations and bibliographies, which enriches understanding. I had better create a new heading here so future editors can easily find this.<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearpa_6be0.html" title="User:Bearpa">Bearpa</a> 18:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Found good article online with expansive documentation. This could cite to the end of the next sentence instead of where shown. I will try to cite in the APD article like the present author has, and enter the reference as shown in <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?citing_sources" class="extiw" title="wiki:citing_sources">wiki:citing sources</a> and templates:cite web. One problem is the length of the article on one text page, so in <i>notes</i>, I will give a location in the article. Might be helpful, might be overkill. Please offer suggestions.<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearpa_6be0.html" title="User:Bearpa">Bearpa</a> 18:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, a couple of things came up for me during the edit:
<ul>
<li>there is no notes section to indicate the location of the specific passage in the cited article that supports the entry in wiki article. I will enter it here for any one who might like to refer to it: the first paragraph under the third heading <i>(Treatment Provider Guidlines)</i> in the second section <i>(Treating the AvPD)</i> of the article (link in references section of wiki article).</li>
<li>should we have a notes section? I noticed in the archives some comments added to another cited reference in the reference section (later removed for other reasons). That didn't seem so bad though - they were there with the source involved which connects the comments immediately. Anyway, thoughts?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Also, two new issues for me:
<ul>
<li>ABBREVIATION CORRECTION - I've done it myself. It's in the article intro. I'm becoming aware that APD is also the general abbreviation for Anti-social Personality Disorder and the clinical and academic sources seem to be using AvPD for Avoidant Personality Disorder. I think this is what should be used to avoid confusion.</li>
<li>I added a "citation needed" for the rest of the paragraph after my citation. I'm not sure, but this is almost OR insofar as, otherwise, an actual, reliable survey of websites would have to have been done, and rather thanspeaking for "the psychological community", this would have to become a verifiable fact. The conclusion, though, is probably obvious about the websites, since they repeat the treatment issue already referred to, though this seems somewhat redundant. A rewrite could reframe the thought, perhaps.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>A greater issue though, perhaps, is the lack of complete attribution in the first two sections of the article. Does DSM-IV need to be cited if referred to in the article? What about the mnemonic? Certainly the first half of the <i>Link with other disorders</i> section is not cited. Probably deepening and broadening the entire article should be contemplated too (though I do appreciate how concise it is now). Anywho, more grist for the mill. Long-winded, I know.

<p>I wish to comment but there's a problem w/ your post that led me on a wild goose edit where I had to learn about reverts and undoing revert revisions (if that makes any sense at all). Anyway let me just copy an entry that was part of that ill-fated effort that might explain:</p>
<p>Sorry, I was not signed on when first appending the above unsigned signature (the posting was by Portillo on 30 September 2006). I'm getting an "editing a prior version" warning so that I'm worried I will unintentionally revert all later version (and entries?); if I do I will try to undo (not to sure of myself when it comes to the intricacies). If you'll notice, though, there are two equal sign (==) on only one side of the entry and there is no edit link (edit) in this post's section so there seems to have been a prob. w/the post, but I want to comment on this post. I hope I haven't flubbed things too much; not my intention. Live and learn. (Much chaos ensued when saved, but I'm OK now) What got me started here was that I really wanted to comment, to Portillo or any others, that this is a good question and I am curious as well, also about personality or anxiety disorders affecting those with long-term intrusive disease or medical conditions and/or long-term, chronic, or severe recurring pain. Anyone with experiences? Bearpa 04:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
