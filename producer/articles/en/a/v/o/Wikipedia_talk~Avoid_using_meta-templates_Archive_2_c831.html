<h2><span class="mw-headline">Logic templates</span></h2>
<p>I intend to author a new section for this page dealing with the specific problems related to the so-called "logical" templates being created and used (see Category:If Templates and Category:Boolean Templates). A few "clever" individuals have found a way to hack the template mechanism into doing things it was not intended for. Rather than petition the MediaWiki developers (or write code themselves), they've put this kludge into effect and it is unfortunately growing rapidly. The problems I see with this are:</p>
<ol>
<li>As described on <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>, templates within templates have a direct effect on the performance of the wiki, just like templates used for meta-formatting.</li>
<li>The developers may make future changes to the template mechanism which would make these logical templates fail. The amount of rework if we need to fix the related templates and pages could be incredibly extensive.</li>
<li>New and old users alike have a hard time understanding how these all work. This discourages participation in the entire authoring process.</li>
<li>Templates in general should be used sparingly. Certain tasks, like inserting <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">book references</a>, are not being better served by using a template.</li>
</ol>

<dd>Re: "Rather than petition the MediaWiki developers (or write code themselves)" we can still do that. "and it is unfortunately growing rapidly"&#160;:-) If this is true, this means that it gained some popularity as it seems to be grounded on some editors real needs. If this is enough evident, there will be enough drive to do "petition the MediaWiki developers (or write code themselves)". Which might be a good thing (if that should prove needed). – <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Talk</a> 15:38, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't say it's "almost impossible to use". I would rather say it's almost impossible to implement. Usage is not affected by how it is implemented (as long as it can be implemented, of course). – <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Talk</a> 18:58, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I agree. Book templates help keep our articles referenced in a standard way.

<p>Re: "New and old users alike have a hard time understanding how these all work. This discourages participation in the entire authoring process". Not every user of book reference needs to understand how it was implemented. Those who do not take part in the development of book reference and the like never need to have a look at if &amp; co. at all. The logic templates are mostly needed in more complicated templates like book reference, but there, they are essential. There is generally no need to use the logic templates on article pages. – <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Talk</a> 18:50, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Re "Templates in general should be used sparingly". No. To the contrary. If we have an abstraction mechanism, then we should use it. This increases dependency but this is a good thing. Complicated things should be built up by using less complicated and tested building blocks. This is a well known engineering principle. – <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Talk</a> 19:07, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Re "A few "clever" individuals have found a way to hack the template mechanism into doing things it was not intended for". This is something very normal. If you have some powerful successfull tools, they sooner or later get used in ways you never dreamt of. I understand that this can be seen as threat. But it isn't. Just start thinking how to anticipate that new usage, if it's really needed and helps to solve real problems. – <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Talk</a> 19:12, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This sounds like functionality to do this kind of thing should be implemented within the template syntax, where it would be cleaner, less taxing on the server, not use meta-templates, etc etc. Some of the functionality being implemented in this way is proving to be very useful for the average template <i>user</i> - such as making Template:Book reference not need a dozen different variations to handle different sets of provided information.</dd>

<p>This page (in the version I restored and will happily lock) is a guideline not because of a consensus vote on a talk page, but because of sound technical reasons to avoid using the damn things. Just because you really want to do 'l33t Mediawiki hacks doesn't mean you can build consensus to make it not technically the case, any more than 2+2 equalling 4 is up for a vote. The only reason templates in templates aren't switched off entirely is because they're needed for a few specific purposes.

<dd>I do not understand what you want to say. Can you tell us what to do with {{<a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">book reference</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../w/e/b/Template%7EWeb_reference_4011.html" title="Template:Web reference">web reference</a>}}? You are also invited to write on the respective talk pages of those templates. That would fit much better than writing to people on their user talk pages.

<p>Wikimedia's server capacity has gone up a few orders of magnitude this year. I'm not convinced that templates represent anything like the proportion of the total load they used to, and are therefore no longer a problem ("with enough power, a brick can fly"). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan100_803a.html" title="User talk:Dan100">Talk</a>) 12:13, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can confim that there are several others which are able to understand this form of template. It's not that complicated as it might look at first sight. It takes a moment to accustom oneself with that <tt>if</tt> stuff. And you don't have to understand at the first step how <tt>if</tt> is implemented. But even that is not as complicated as it might look. <tt>qif</tt> is the easier to start with. Yes it is a trick, but a straightforward one, not even a dirty one. And yes, we are interested to keep a close eye on server load, that's why <tt>qif</tt> as a replacement for <tt>if</tt> was created (by using <tt>qif</tt>, one call level is eliminated compared to <tt>if</tt>). And if developers and server maintainers flock in to report that we blow off the servers, believe me, we will kill if/qif immediately. But not due to a guideline that should be carfully reviewed for this special case. And please note that I do not intend to put up a fight. You and we, all of us care about the future of wikipedia. Nobody is interested to "press in" tricky stuff just for it's own sake. We care about building new solutions to existing problems.

<dd>Well, seeing as I have been mentioned above, I'll let you know the history of {{<a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELanguage_39a6.html" title="Template:Language">language</a>}}. The flexibility that the use of {{<a href="../../../i/f/_/Template%7EIf_c88e.html" title="Template:If">if</a>}} allows was discussed long before that template was available. We had tried a number of ways of creating a modular template that could fit the great diversity of all language articles, but these hadn't worked. The other users of the template have appreciated the new flexibility that these templates have provided. I have tried to explain what I am doing as I go along, and, as I know nothing about computer programming, I am not being obscure for the sake of it. We weigh up the options of whether we want the template to do all we want it to do, or whether we want it to be easy to edit. I would love it, if there were a possibility of incorporating both options, but there isn't, and we have chosen flexibility above ease of editing. In the meantime, there are a few editors around who have acquainted themselves with the template, and feel able to make changes whan they are needed. In summary, the present state of {{<a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELanguage_39a6.html" title="Template:Language">language</a>}} is the work of a linguist rather than a computer programmer, cobbling together the scraps of possibilities of template construction to make an infobox as good as possible.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another view</span></h2>
<p>I did some check in the source code to see how mediawiki uses templates. When a page is using a template, that particular template is cached for actual page, so multiple uses of an template on a particular page uses only one fetch for this template. For an example, a book reference, is would then better to use an generic reference that have separate templates for different styles. (If the generic reference template only use for example {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} then there will only be one fetch for actual page) <sub>→<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaToth_9bb9.html" title="User:AzaToth"><font style="color:#975612">Aza</font></a><a href="../../../a/z/a/User_talk%7EAzaToth_5ca3.html" title="User talk:AzaToth"><font style="color:#325596">Toth</font></a></sub> 21:53, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can try to explain it a bit further:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have the template <i>Generic</i> that utilize the "logic" template <i>logic</i> multiple times, and it replaces the usage of template <i>Specific-1</i> to <i>Specific-n</i>, which does not use any aditional templates.</li>
<li>If <i>Article</i> only uses <i>Specific-1</i> it's faster than using <i>Generic</i>.</li>
<li>If <i>Article</i> uses both <i>Specific-1</i> and <i>Specific-2</i> there is no difference.</li>
<li>If <i>Article</i> uses more than two <i>Specific</i> templates, it's faster to use the <i>Generic</i> version.</li>
<li>If another template used by <i>Article</i> utilizes template <i>logic</i>, then the cost of <i>Generic</i> is reduced one step etc...</li>

<dd>Interesting. This would suggest, for a start, that all of the various infobox templates should be moved away from using the logic templates if possible (since those are, by definition, used only once in an article). —<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 01:46, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>That might be correct, but personally I think it's cheaper to do <b>one</b> extra meta-call (to the template <i>logic</i> in this case), than to hide a lot of text using class <i>hiddenContent</i>, also, if there are other templates on the page using the template <i>logic</i> (for example a reference template), then there would be no saving going from logical templates. <sub>→<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaToth_9bb9.html" title="User:AzaToth"><font style="color:#975612">Aza</font></a><a href="../../../a/z/a/User_talk%7EAzaToth_5ca3.html" title="User talk:AzaToth"><font style="color:#325596">Toth</font></a></sub> 02:00, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think it's exactly the opposite. Because the call to <tt>if</tt> (et al.) is cached per article, it does not matter whether we have 500 if calls rooted directly (does not apply now) or indirectly on the page. We can have 100 instances of let's say book reference on a page. Even if <tt>qif</tt> appears several times in book reference (22 times to be exact, at the moment), as per the findings of Carl (=AzaToth) it is loaded exactly *once* per page (not 100 x 22 - ok would possibly not be 22 because not all branches are evaluated, it depends on the parameters fed into each specific template call). I hope I got that right (please correct me if I'm wrong).

<dd>Don't worry too much about there being several types of citation templates, they are being consolidated. It probably is more important for this discussion that citations have to deal with the fact that including or omitting information requires various formatting details be included or omitted. The logic templates are at present the only tool for doing that formatting, and infoboxes have similar formatting needs If wiki adds some builtin logic it will be trivial to change the few templates. However, that is not the only possibility, as another possible solution is some sort of tool similar to a "report generator" which would allow specification of the format of data display. For citations there have been various proposals for information handling, and it is possible someone will come up with tools with other solutions (whether specific to citations such as a publication-name-selector or a more general tool such as Jimbo's data retriever ("name of capitol city of country X").

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal for "lazy templates"</span></h2>
<p>As we have noticed, there is some concern that meta-templates which are defined as templates that include calls to other templates have some drawbacks which are described in the associated article.</p>
<p>Recent development around the templates <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/Template%7EWeb_reference_4011.html" title="Template:Web reference">template:web reference</a> which include calls to so-called "logic templates" like <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">template:qif</a> have triggered some partly hefty reactions among some wikifolks. These logic templates haven been deemed by some as beeing a "kludge" or just "ridiculous" and for beeing a violation of this guideline here.</p>
<p>Some wikifolks insist that templates like <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> do add real value to wikipedia and its development, as they increase the quality of articles and do help non-wiki experts to write correct citations. What's also clear is that calls of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> can easily be converted to anything else by a fairly simple bot. This includes possible future extensions. It is also relatively simple to convert those calls back to the old style low-level kind of citations that have been done by using wiki syntax only (without the use of templates). But the other direction is far less easy to do. So articles that today contain calls to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> are - from an entropy standpoint - more valueable than those who do citations the old-style way (if we look at the wiki source).</p>
<p>Today, there are about 3000+ articles that already use <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a>. If we come to the conclusion, that this guideline here rules, we can see that <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> has qualities of a "meta-template" as it uses <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">template:qif</a>. Some wikifolks have come to the conclusion that <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> cannot be implemented without using <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">template:qif</a>. So if this guideline here rules, this would mean the shutdown of <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">template:qif</a> and in turn the shutdown of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a>. The consequense of this would be that all calls to book reference would need to be downgraded to pure old-style wiki source.</p>
<p>One of the mentioned problem areas of the so called "meta-templates" is that - as it seems to be implemented now in the Wiki-software - if a template T is changed, all article pages that contain calls to T get their cache invalidated. As Jamesday describes in the article here, this can be a resource consuming task. This can also result in operations enduring in the order of several tenths of seconds.</p>
<p>A well known mechanism to circumvent this is "subst", where a template is instantiated at the moment the editor clicks on save. The problem with subst is, that it cannot be applied to book reference, as the result is just a bunch of qif expressions that nobody can manage by hand.</p>
<p>It must be noted that reckless editing of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> is not desired anyway. So it is expected that book reference stabilizes more and more and there should be the longer the more less reasons to change it. This is even more true for <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">template:qif</a>, which is even more stable. So rippling changes originating from <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">template:qif</a> today already are a rare case. So beeing dependent on stable stuff is not that bad.</p>
<p>What remains are changes in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a>.</p>
<p>I would like to present the following idea: Why not ignore changes in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> at first for some time and leave that cache invalidating step away completely. It does not hurt if articles referencing <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> use an old version of it. This can wait until somebody edits an article or until a slow bot comes by and invalidates that article's cache (within 24 hours or so). That bot could run at off-peak hours. I would call this feature a "lazy template". Maybe <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> (and <a href="../../../w/e/b/Template%7EWeb_reference_4011.html" title="Template:Web reference">template:web reference</a>) could be marked in some way as "lazy templates". This could also be seen as a more luxory form of "subst" that preserves the entropy of the wiki-source of an article. – <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Talk</a> 17:03, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

The correct approach would be to respect their previous input UNTIL you hear differently. Meta-templates should be avoided - I doubt there will ever be a time where that guideline will change. What seems to be the point of contention is <i>how</i> they should be avoided (subst:ing, multiple similar templates, CSS tricks).

<dd>That's because this proposed guideline makes the job of Wikipedia template editors significantly harder, and therefore it should be subject to severe scrutiny to ensure that it is absolutely necessary. Simply saying that something might increase the server load isn't enough to mean it shouldn't be done. After all, we could dramatically reduce the server load by turning off images completely, but I don't recall anyone making a page called Wikipedia:Avoid using images. Being able to nest code is a elementary programming feature, and if the MediaWiki software can't handle it without a performance hit, that should be treated as a serious bug that needs to be addressed, not something that users should have to continually work around. I am not at all convinced that the server situation remains unchanged in the past 10 months. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 03:48, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. All of this violates basic programming principles. Every programmer knows that hard coding is a ugly, godawful thing to do, but you're urging that it be made Wikipedia policy. (And subst is a form of hard coding - since changes from the template don't automatically propagate.) What we should be talking about is how to add new features like inheritance and polymorphism to the MediaWiki engine - not getting rid of the most basic functionality that was taken for granted in the 1980s. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 03:48, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will admit I was being a bit deliberately provocative with my comment about polymorphism. But that's not the point. In many cases, nesting templates can make template code <i>easier</i>, not harder, to read. We should not have a policy that encourages editors to write unmaintainable spaghetti templates and hard-coded shit. And using subst: is a hack because it makes further editing more difficult and prevents template changes from propagating, as with transclusions. Even a markup language should be able to handle basic nesting of calls.

<dd>Well, it does handle them; obviously, this has associated costs (just as nested function calls in code do). In this case, at least at the time this page was written, the resource cost wasn't worth the benefits of using nested calls; it remains to be seen, based on developer input, whether this is still the case.</dd>
<dd>As an aside, most templates are merely blocks of markup: tables, frames, etc. Only a few templates—the citation ones, for instance—truly benefit from nested calls as opposed to some other method of hiding undesired markup; and some of them would likely be better off as MediaWiki features rather than templates. The citation templates, for instance, are basically a wizard to produce a proper citation based on some parameters; once the citation is inserted into the page, we generally don't want it to change appearance. —<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 04:33, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To Netoholic's point about asking for developer input - I'm reasonably certain the basics for how pages are constructed has not changed in the last year. My understanding is that if the page is not cached, some Apache server makes a database fetch for its contents and database fetches for each template that must be interpreted in order to build the page contents. I think doing any less work than this is likely to be very difficult. There's ultimately a single database behind all wikipedia pages, and for pages that aren't cached, the database is almost certainly the true bottleneck (since we can add a relatively arbitrary number of Apache servers). A page that references no templates requires one DB fetch. A page that references a template that references a template requires three. We can buy all the Apache servers we want, but if they all have to connect to the same database the limiting factor is going to be the database. It was a year ago. I'm actually a bit surprised we're doing as well as we are. In any event, the point of all of this is that I'm not a MediaWiki developer and I suspect Netoholic isn't either. Certainly some things have changed in the past year. I think it's distinctly unlikely, but it's possible things have changed so that database fetches are not even close to the current bottleneck. The folks wanting to use templates in programmatic ways seem to want to optimistically believe this isn't an issue anymore. Developers know for sure. Asserting it isn't an issue without developer input seems ludicrous. Asserting nothing's changed in the last year that might help this issue without developer input also seems ludicrous. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 05:15, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About the Guideline discussion: For this subject, it seems the community of Developers (particularly of DB) are the ones who should decide on the Guideline status. I view many of the meta-templates as tools to achieve needed results using the current technology. If an application such as infoboxes with optional fields become popular, it is likely that an efficient Wiki tool will be created to replace it. However, limits have to be drawn someplace; AUM should prevent extremes such as a fad of everyone creating complex signature templates and then those also being accepted on article pages. We all want to avoid dealing with the ultimate authority on where the limits are: reaching the maximum capacity of the hardware.

<dd>First of all, as stated previously, let's see some evidence of developer consensus. I've heard about ONE developer (Jamesday) who has complained about meta-templates. And that was ten months ago. Are there any others? How serious (if at all) do they think the problem is at this time? What (if anything) are they doing about it? Until we know the answer to this, we can't proceed. Furthermore, doing away with nested templates altogether is utterly unacceptable. It's like proposing we do away with images. <b>IF</b> the developers need template use reduced as a <b>TEMPORARY</b> hack to reduce server usage, then we can start with templates that can easily be rewritten to avoid metafication. Breaking existing functionality should be an absolute last resort, yet you go about it with an unseemly glee. You should be banned from ever having anything to do with templates on Wikipedia ever again. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 04:36, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>BTW, on Aug 6 of this year, Jamesday wrote (from the main article): "<i>There are changes in 1.5 which will help. How much is currently not known.</i>" Are we running that now? Did it fix the issue?

<dd>Well, no. When the developers said a couple months ago that the new software update would fix the problem, and when the only person who is openly complaining about the use of these templates isn't even a developer at all, I'd like to get some sort of statement from the developers regarding the issues raised above. I don't need personal notification, but I think the Wikicommunity as a whole should get updates on this. When was the last time the developers were asked about the impact of nested templates? Has MediaWiki 1.5 been rolled out yet?

Yes, we'll use some meta-templates. If we can avoid both of these, we'll need to buy fewer servers. The guideline says "avoid". It doesn't say "seek out and destroy all".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why Templates in templates not switched off?</span></h2>
<p>David Gerard wrote <i>"The only reason templates in templates aren't switched off entirely is because they're needed for a few specific purposes."'</i> Can somebody please list these? Which meta-templates qualify for these "few specific purposes"? What are the requirements to qualify for "few specific purposes"?</p>
<p>I'm just asking this because I wonder why we got into all this trouble if meta-templates are that bad? Why haven't they been switched off? Why is this article here not a policy with a list of exceptions?</p>
<p>Sorry for asking, I'm relatively new to Wikipedia. I came to all this because I wondered how to add a book reference to an article. After some search I found <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> and just used that. Then I wondered why it's not used in more articles and just started slowly to use it on a few articles. After receiving no objections, I just continued a bit. Then some smaller problems around book reference occured and I suddenly was in the middle of template wonderland.</p>
<p>What I cannot understand, as a newbie, is that how is it possible that a technique which seems to be that dangerous can "slip" into thousands of articles without noticing by any of the proponents of the "don't use meta-templates group"? Why did Wikipedia not make this a policy at first hand and list the allowed exceptions or even shut down templates in templates completely? I simply do not understand.</p>
<p>Why do you attract people and do not take more care that they cannot do that harmful things to the servers. Why does wikipedia attract people by saying be bold and beat them afterwards. I think there must be something wrong. I just do not understand that. What I also not understand is, that I haven't seen any of the "don't use meta-templates group" appearing on the talk page of book reference. It's been there quite some time already.</p>
<p>Sorry for my silly questions. Sorry for the long post. I'm just a newbie trying to understand the wonders of wiki-land. Please note that it is not my intention to put a fight. And my ego does not care whether Wikipedia uses meta-templates or not. I'm just puzzeling. And I just stayed here because I found some really great articles and some bright people. – <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Talk</a> 12:09, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia and the MediaWiki software and the hardware complex that runs it grow organically, based on strictly volunteer contributions (cash in the case of the hardware). The template mechanism was introduced in the software to address the need for a way to include similar (identical) content in multiple places without reentering it. The way it was implemented allowed template references to be nested. Contributors, being clever, have figured this out and have defined lots of templates that use other templates. Meanwhile, Wikipedia's popularity has been increasing exponentially. It is now one of the most highly viewed sites in the world (Alexa says more than 1000M page views per day <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=p&amp;url=www.wikipedia.org#top" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=p&amp;url=www.wikipedia.org#top" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). The software and hardware architecture have evolved in response to increasing load (see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers" class="extiw" title="m:Wikimedia_servers">m:Wikimedia servers</a>) to the point that I would assert wikipedia.org is one of the most sophisticated web sites in the world (note the basic problem - anyone, anywhere, can edit any page and their changes are immediately visible, combined with tremendous "view only" traffic - is much more difficult than high traffic "view only" sites like microsoft.com). The developers don't get paid. The server admins don't get paid. I believe there's one person who is paid who is in charge of the IT infrastructure. To keep the site running reasonably responsively there's an ongoing effort (again volunteer) to add more servers and analyze and improve the software efficiency. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">user:Jamesday</a> is one of a handful of people (volunteers) who do this. He noticed templates including templates can cause bad performance effects, which resulted in this guideline. In general, the things done to improve performance are done without affecting user operation (turning search off being a notable exception). Turning off template inclusion of templates at this point would break lots of articles, so is clearly not a desirable solution. Is template inclusion of templates a significant performance issue at this point? I don't know. I do know that general performance is, and almost certainly always will be, a BIG issue. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 16:45, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's really impressive. And shocking too. I feel the point of no return in re <tt>if</tt> has already passed. And to handle that by consensus does not work. Maybe it would be best to face the situation and put all efforts in implementing that in code instead of argumenting about how to throw it out. But I don't know how long that would take. However, this discussion here is just academic. By yelling at newbies Netoholic just pisses them off. Maybe he also hits that one who could implemement it. They just do not understand him. And the rate he does this is clearly insuffient to solve the problem.

<dd>In other words, we may need to keep {{<a href="../../../i/f/_/Template%7EIf_c88e.html" title="Template:If">if</a>}} in order to maintain the various reference templates; but that's no reason to thoughtlessly insert it into every template we can find.

<dd>Since the queastion about whether the AUM guideline applis to the spolier templates, and indeed to the IF logic templates has been raised there, it seems that it is a courtesy to let intersted and possibly knowlegable people here know about the discussion there. This was more in the line of posting a notice of a relevant ongoing discussion in another plce, such as is often done on the pump, or via RFC. I fail to see how that is ignigting a "forest fire" (and given the size of wikipedia, i don't see that discussion on several pages has the kind of problems that MeatBall was complaining about anyway. My only experince with a case where someone cited that "guideline" was in what I continue to regard as an improper attempt to stifle valid discussion, so I do not react positively to the reference.) I might add that you are the person who raised the issue of AUM on <a href="../../../s/p/o/Template_talk%7ESpoiler_f222.html" title="Template talk:Spoiler">Template talk:Spoiler</a>, and used it as the basis of a revert, to boot. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:04, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A small point</span></h2>
<p>Templates are needed for consistency. Compare the situation where we have templates A and B. If they call a template C implementing the common denominator, and it gets edited, then, true enough, all pages containing A and B will need to be re-rendered. But if they don't call C, and A is changed then B must be changed as well. In case of several similar templates this is prone to error (I'm sure you can imagine what can go wrong). All pages containing A and C still need to be re-rendered. Fortunately most of the templates like C will not need changing frequently. That templates are a vandal-magnet is a problem all by itself. Suppose someone would put something nasty on disamb? Perhaps it would be better if we only allowed high-frequency templates to be changed only by registered users who have been around for a while. But that's probably to unwiki of me. Another thing: might it be possible to make only that part of a page affected by a template re-render if that template changes? That would solve a lot. Also if an article is edited and only stuff outside template calls changes, they wouldn't need to be called again, would they? I know, our develepors are busy enough as it is, but hey, one can dream (or have a wishlist). <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerbrant_7d11.html" title="User:Gerbrant">Shinobu</a> 19:55, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, if A and B have a commonality that is changed without a template the net number of articles to be re-rendered is the same, BUT if it's done by modifying a common template C the software immediately marks cached versions of all of the articles as being out of date. With templates using templates, this can result in a tremendous burst of activity that is smoothed out somewhat if instead several templates are modified each affecting only a subset of the total number of articles. The software could keep a queue of cache invalidation requests and meter them to a reasonable rate (even do them asynchronously to the change of the template), but I'm guessing this would be a fairly tricky change to get right. Re-rendering only part of a page is not possible given the current hardware/software architecture (the squid servers, which are the primary caching mechanism, work by caching entire page contents). This could potentially be done using features fairly recently added to the squid software, but again it wouldn't be easy. I think the bottom line is that the developers know there's interest in this, they would like to do something if they could, they aren't stupid, and it hasn't been done - my take-away is that it must be VERY hard. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 23:57, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Incorrect example</span></h2>
<p>Neither {{<a href="../../../m/e/t/Template%7EMetastub_4f25.html" title="Template:Metastub">Metastub</a>}} nor the stub tempaltes (not categories) created using it, nor stub types in general, are or use meta-tempaltes in any way, so they are not appropriate for mention here. Furhtermore, new stub types are normally subject to a proposal and approval process, precisely to avoid "scope creep" and "spur-of-the-moment" creation of new stub types, see <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_P_67de.html" title="WP:WSS/P">WP:WSS/P</a>. As a result i think the entire "scope creep" section is invalid, as the removal of this clearly incorrect example leaves it without any example at all, and deprices it of what the project page says is currntly the principle example. If that is the principle example of meta-tempalte involvement in scope creep, there is none. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:42, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Maintainability and liability</span></h2>
<p>There is a saying in the computer programming world: “Premature optimisation is the root of all evil”. While a reasonable degree of responsiveness (which Netoholic’s revert warring does nothing to promote) is worthwhile, aggressively attempting to optimise the servers at the expense of maintainabilty ties up the time and work of editors. Even for editors such as myself who prefer to work on editing other people’s work, it is busywork and a distraction from checking core quality. Some people underestimate the importance of useful back-editing in handling the rubbish (and libel; the John Siegenthaler incident isn’t a worst case) that Wikipedia absolutely must keep under control if it is to survive. <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusvolans_0bbe.html" title="User:Susvolans">Susvolans</a> <a href="../../../s/u/s/User_talk%7ESusvolans_e16e.html" title="User talk:Susvolans">⇔</a> 16:27, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">So do we simply stop cleaning up?</span></h3>
<p>So I was going to try to replace stuff like {{if defined call3}} with {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}}: should I simply not bother? Does the transclusion system cache templates? So if a given article uses five templates, all of which use {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}}, does the system fetch {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} five times, or just the once? If the answer is "yes, it caches them", and if those five templates currently use various different things all of which are more complicated, like {{<a href="../../../i/f/_/Template%7EIf_c88e.html" title="Template:If">if</a>}} or {{if defined call3}}, would it not be better to consolidate them so that they all use {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}}, which is apparently the most efficient and server-friendly of all the options at present?

<li>To my best knowledge, templates are cached, but if a template is used five times with <i>different parameters</i> each time, then it counts as five different templates as far as the server is concerned - hence requiring five fetches. What you've been doing is an improvement, but a further improvement would be not using QIF either.

<li>By definition, edits made in good faith are <i>not</i> vandalism. Removing a policy tag from an undisputed policy page (in an attempt to stir trouble) would be vandalism, but removing a policy tag from a page that one genuinely believes does not contain a policy is <i>not</i> an act of vandalism; it's a content dispute.

<li>Removing that policy tag shows a lack of understanding of what Wikipedia policy actually is and how it works. Repeatedly removing it after being told not to by people more knowledgeable on the matter is, to put it mildly, misguided.

<li>I agree that the removal of the policy tag was misguided, but it was <i><b>not</b></i> vandalism (simple or otherwise). There are plenty of revert wars in which one side is flagrantly wrong, but that doesn't mean that their edits are made in bad faith. I understand why David protected the page, but I believe that this decision was hasty and premature. Rather than taking the time to solve the problem (by politely explaining why the policy tag was applicable), he took the shortcut of blocking all non-sysop edits (including legitimate ones), and threw in a mention of how "foolish" his opponents were. —<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 00:51, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes it would be possible by defining classes and using javascript, but it have some problems, one is that redundant information will be transmitted and increase the bandwidth (dont know how much this will affect on the total), and two if using javascript, all templates will be evaluated even if they are not to be shown (My implementation is ment to be run before any other parsing of the wiki code is performed), third is that if using javascript, it's problematic to access parameters (you could include all paramters, but how would you then decide what paramter belongs to what part of the document) <sub>→<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaToth_9bb9.html" title="User:AzaToth"><font style="color:#975612">Aza</font></a><a href="../../../a/z/a/User_talk%7EAzaToth_5ca3.html" title="User talk:AzaToth"><font style="color:#325596">Toth</font></a></sub> 22:15, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In terms of convenience, server load issues entirely trump the need for meta-templates.

<li>I'm not attempting to downplay the importance of this issue, but some of these applications would be a <b>huge</b> pain in the neck to remove (without a suitable replacement for the meta-templates). This would require countless article edits, and would force users to alter the manner in which familiar templates are used. I see little harm in at least waiting until we've learned whether AzaToth's code could be implemented in the near future. In the meantime, let's concentrate on killing the flagrantly frivolous uses of meta-templates. —<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 22:47, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I realize that it would be a pain to remove certain things, and that certain editors may have to change their behavior with those templates. However, this problem is going to get worse the longer we wait. Given the fact that the Devs are extremely busy, it sounds unlikely that they will implement AzaToth's (excellent) suggestion any time soon. In general, unless you have explicit word from a Dev that they <i>will</i> implement a thing like this reasonably soon, it is safe to assume that they won't. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 00:34, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My concerns</span></h2>
<p>I take this issue very seriously. If the use of meta-templates is harming Wikipedia, something must be done to stop this.</p>
<p>I am, however, curious as to why the guideline wasn't elevated to the level of policy sooner, and why this was done only when a dispute regarding the guideline's validity began. I'm not arguing that the "policy" status is illegitimate, but I can understand why someone might suspect that this sudden change was made purely as a means of justifying controversial edits (the removal of meta-templates). Comments on the part of Jimbo have been referenced, and I would sincerely appreciate a link.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's highly irresponsible to deliberately break (and protect) a template, thereby forcing others to clean up the resultant mess "by dinner." When a reader is simply attempting to obtain information from the encyclopedia, a message asking him/her to "fix the page to exclude this template" is not helpful, especially considering the fact that the template in question usually doesn't even appear directly on the page (which is likely to confuse people in such a manner that they remove useful templates from articles, instead of removing the meta-templates contained therein). —<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 22:07, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To be clear, it wasn't a matter of "Clean up these templates before dinner or no dessert." I had faith - faith that appears to be well-founded - that the templates would get tidied in about six hours, and that this would be the most effective way to kick-start the process. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 22:09, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understood your logic, but I believe that this may have resulted in more harm than good. How many people responded to the request to "exclude this template" by removing the only templates that they saw in the articles that they were reading (when in actuality, the meta-templates were contained therein)? Is there even a way to check?</dd>

Unfortunately, this distinction was (a) too subtle, and (b) more-or-less ignored by people who went about creating the abominations we have today. Obviously the subtle approach has failed, misreably.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Take a step back and analyze the situation.</span></h2>
<p>Much of this acrimony is simply finger-pointing (on ALL sides) about technical problems. No, they can't be voted away. But they <b>can</b> and <b>should</b> be fixed. There are two underlying problems here that I see:</p>
<ol>
<li>MediaWiki doesn't have native support for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conditional.html" title="Conditional">conditionals</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean.html" title="Boolean">Boolean</a> operations, so templates must be used to obtain such functionality, which is inefficient of server resources.</li>
<li>MediaWiki has a broken transclusion feature that causes nested templates to use far more server resources than they should.</li>
</ol>
<p>Expecting users to forever constrain their functionality for the sake of software limitations is foolish and fundamentally un-wiki. The underlying bugs have to be fixed; there is no other alternative. Conditional and Boolean operations must be added to the engine so that they don't have to be invoked through templates, and the transclusion code must be altered so that it doesn't choke on nested templates. I think we have a right to ask <strike>why the developers haven't fixed the issue yet, despite complaining</strike>&#160;&#160;<b>when a permanent fix will be implemented, given that we have known</b> about the resulting problems for nearly a year. No doubt it's easier to ask users to alter their behavior than to fix the software's shortcomings, but it's also <strike>lazy and stupid</strike>&#160;&#160;<b>not a viable long-term solution</b>. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 00:30, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding finger-pointing, you have just called the Devs "lazy and stupid" for asking Wikipedia users to not abuse a certain feature. Please don't do that. You have every right to ask the Devs anything; I'd estimate that their answer to this particular issue would be that it's a good idea, but that they have other priorities. If they ask that we not abuse this feature until and unless it is fixed, that is entirely within reason. It would also be entirely within reason if they were to disable it entirely for the time being. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 00:39, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right, my original comment was intemperate. Mea culpa. See revised version above. If the developers think that there are more important issues to fix, I would be interested in knowing what those issues are. If nested templates are such a server problem (and apparently the if template locked the database today) then it would seem like it should be a high priority issue. Furthermore, the amount of bile being generated over this issue (and I admit I am not entirely innocent here) is harmful and poisonous to Wikipedia. This whole issue is an open sore, and it needs to be healed. And the only way to permanently do that is to fix the underlying technical issues - not to tell users to change their behavior in ways that are inconvenient and distract from our goal of encyclopedia-building. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 00:46, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>We had no problems conveniently building the encyclopedia before the logical templates existed (which has only been for a couple of months, after all). IIRC, the Devs are busy with the fact that Wikipedia traffic has roughly <i>doubled</i> since September. It would be great if they could implement a better system for WikiProgramming, and that is indeed the ideal solution. But it would require thought, implementation and testing - so in the meantime we should pay them heed. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 00:52, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Templates help keep references thorough and content consistent.

<li>Templates and "meta-templates" make maintenance much more efficient, from a human standpoint.
<ul>
<li>If the same text needs to be updated on many pages, it is quicker to edit a single template than to edit all of those pages by hand (the "busywork" referred to on this talk page). This frees up editors to contribute content instead of being janitors.</li>

<dd>I can definitely see both sides of this, and I suspect the problem is the interpretation of <i>unless we have to</i>. Since anything that can be done with a template (any template) can be done in straight wiki-code, in a strict since "unless we have to" means never. I genuinely don't think it's necessary to never use templates. Similarly, I genuinely don't think it's necessary to never use meta-templates. Like most issues, I suspect this one is not simply black or white. A meta-template used by 4 other templates which are in turn used on a total of 10 articles is not a problem. A meta-template used by 100 templates which are in turn each used by 100 other templates used on a total of 50,000 articles is a problem. The question from the "I'd like to use these things, they're damn convenient" side is where is the line? From the other side, I think the recommendation is to start with an assumption that "never" would be good, and anything more than that should have a VERY good justification - always try to find a reasonable alternative. This says don't do the meta-template used by 4 other templates that way - just duplicate the code. Sure, it's probably not a problem, but for something used that little who cares? However, how about {{<a href="../../../u/2E/s/Template%7EU.S.A._State_Congressional_Delegation_aedd.html" title="Template:U.S.A. State Congressional Delegation">U.S.A. State Congressional Delegation</a>}} (50 derived templates, total of 535 articles including it)? Is there some rule of thumb we could develop as a guideline, perhaps with more variables than number of templates and total articles (like frequency of changes to the articles)? Should we inline (subst) infoboxes? Are there high runner templates we can work on getting rid of (or duplicating in code)? People <b>want</b> ways to increase consistency between articles (it adds to the professional look) and to avoid duplicating wikicode. Just a guess, but I suspect many contributors are programmers and used to using macro languages. Having one here, but being discouraged from using it (the more widely used, the worse it becomes) seems kind of perverse. Hard rules would help. Avoid if possible (when it's always possible to avoid) just isn't that clear. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 04:39, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Specific example: {{<a href="../../../s/u/c/Template%7ESuccession_box_83db.html" title="Template:Succession box">succession box</a>}}. Using this template makes any article using it use 7 templates. Any change to any such article requires at least 8 database fetches (one to fetch the article contents, 7 more to fetch the contents of the templates). From a DB perspective, using this template makes the article 8 times more expensive to regenerate (than if no templates were used at all). I got tired of counting references at 10,000. I'd venture a guess that most of the references could be replaced with a similar version defined in a single template reducing the DB cost of regenerating these articles by a factor of 4. We could create a family of such templates.

<li>Exactly. That would also make the templates easier to use; if a newbie wants to write a sucbox, he has to read through several pages of manual to figure out how it works, so it's hardly more convenient to all - and to a non-editor, the end result looks the same both ways.

<dd>If 'Succession box' can be redone as a single template... <b>please do so</b>. Or give me some pointers on how to replace the QIFs in s-ttl and I'll do it. I can see a way to just have the descriptive text there passed in as a parameter, but since no such parameter exists in the current calls any which use it would have to be rewritten. Is there another way to handle it? It'd be nice to stop kvetching about the problem and start fixing it. I'd identified 'Succession box' as a fairly small item which has QIF calls and gets used extensively (there are even templates which call 'Succession box' like 'template:Pope')... a logical candidate for fixing. However, when I started looking around for pointers on <i>HOW</i> to fix it all I found was this monstrous argument. Maybe we could identify the most heavily used simple nested templates and find ways to clean those up. Logically it isn't the templates that make two internal calls and get used on five pages which are causing server load problems. Fixing the five biggest resource hog templates is likely to do more good than doing fifty at random. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 13:47, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ed - This template seems harmless enough on its own, but it gets called by every other template under the Sun to add those little 'edit' links in the upper righthand corner of the template box. Is there any reason it can't be bot replaced with something like '&lt;span style="float:right;"&gt;''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Portal:Middle-earth/Featured_article&amp;action=edit edit]''&lt;/span &gt;'? I used that to do the same task at <a href="../../../m/i/d/Portal%7EMiddle-earth_8b9a.html" title="Portal:Middle-earth">Portal:Middle-earth</a> (not to avoid server load... I didn't know about this problem... or the 'ed' template... we won't talk about my user page). This template is generally only 'two levels' deep... does 'depth' of meta templating have a more significant impact than frequency of doing so?
<ul>
<li>As I understand it, the relevant factors are how many articles ultimately include the template regardless of depth (this affects how much cache invalidation has to happen when the template is changed) and how many templates must be fetched when regenerating an article when the article is changed (depth is related to this, but not the only factor). IMO Ed should be subst'ed where its used. Note that leaving a comment on what was subst'd might be useful. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 17:05, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Edit, Ed2, Ed right, Ed div - Minor variations on the above. Again, any reason not to bot replace them? Shouldn't impact 'Joe User' either way... the source template still comes out the same way. These seem to have no purpose except making it quicker for template builders to set things up.
<ul>
<li>Yup, seems like bot-replace is in order. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 17:05, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Country - Simple template which gets called by every country specific template. Again, seems to make it easier for template BUILDERS rather than template USERS. Any reason not to bot replace all calls to this one with the equivalent logic in the calling template?
<ul>
<li>Agree, more bot-replacing. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 17:05, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test &amp; Welcome - These aren't Meta, but they are everywhere. Do single level transclusions significantly drain server resources? If so, running a bot to convert these into 'subst:' would have a big impact.
<ul>
<li>IMO welcome should always be subst'd, however I wouldn't expect pages including these to be regenerated often enough to be a significant resource issue. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 17:05, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taxobox (group) - These have a separate template for each portion of the box, which (theoretically) is to be used on the page of every type/class of living creature. Are multiple template calls in one article better or worse than a single call which then calls each of the sub levels? Couldn't this be converted into a single call WITHOUT sublevels? Could that be bot driven or would it need to be manually updated?
<ul>
<li>Per above, I believe total templates per article is one issue. Taxobox is done the way it is because at the time there was no way to do conditional table entries. This exists now, and taxobox could (and should) be redone as a single template. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 17:05, 20 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>is total num of templates the issue, and thus calling {{{qif}}} 10 times is the same as calling it one time? By turning taxobox into one temp you will need lots of {{{qif}}} <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 15:25, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Et cetera... just those few cover the most heavily called 'shallow' templates. Are templates with greater nesting a bigger problem? If so we should look at whether they can be unnested (like 'Succession box' and related progeny). That one seems to be both deeply nested and extensively used, so fixing it should probably be a priority. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 14:26, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Regardless, the issue of how to resolve the present situation should be discussed. I'm of the opinion that the affected templates should be reconfigured in a manner that allows them to transition as smoothly as possible, not broken en masse as a means of lighting a fire under the editors. —<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 22:49, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Summing up this "debate"</span></h2>
<p>If this can be called a debate...</p>
<p>The devs have, point blank, said to use meta-templates less. This is clearly their intent, and this is the intent that will be enforced. Deliberately putting meta-templates into use when you are aware of this page is a bad thing - expect to make a lot of people very angry, including those with administrator powers. Putting meta-templates into use when you're not aware of this page is a slightly less bad thing, and will result in your being made aware of this page. No amount of trying to say that you want more developers to tell you to stop or that the developers didn't tell you to stop clearly enough changes this fact. The developers were perfectly clear, and it is, at this point, time to listen to them. And that's really all the discussion that is necessary on the matter. If you put a meta-template into practice after this point, as far as I'm concerned, you're committing grevious vandalism with an intent to DOS attack the Wiki, and I, at least, am going to respond accordingly. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 23:42, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Frankly, the developers (and those privy to their wishes) <i>didn't</i> tell the community to stop clearly enough.

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EConference_reference_4989.html" title="Template:Conference reference">Conference reference</a></span></h2>
<p>I'm not agree with the changes made to {{<a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EConference_reference_4989.html" title="Template:Conference reference">Conference reference</a>}} to follow this guideline. As this guideline says, "<i>Meta-templates that are not essential should be avoided</i>", and the use of {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} in this template and others like {{<a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">Book reference</a>}}, {{Journal reference}},… are essential to have optional paramenters, and this isn't a decorative feature.</p>
<p>I'm agree that the server load must be minimized, but optional template parameters are very useful if not completely neccesary. The problem is not the existence of these "advanced" templates but that the MediaWiki doesn't support optional parameters. The software must be changed, I don't know what's the best technical solution, but I can can propose for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>to have a <i>very</i> special <tt>qif</tt> template that is directly handled by the MediaWiki (not really a entry in the database but implemented directly by the software to achieve that funcionality efficiently), or</li>
<li>developing a new template syntax that allow optional parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>However, until the software is changed, current edits cannot be disrupted by this guideline, i.e. {{<a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">Book reference</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../w/e/b/Template%7EWeb_reference_4011.html" title="Template:Web reference">Web reference</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EConference_reference_4989.html" title="Template:Conference reference">Conference reference</a>}}… shouldn't be forbided, and when the new MediaWiki is implemented change them to be more efficient.

<dd>The use of meta-templates is "essential" to the inclusion of optional parameters, but that isn't the context in which the policy was written. (Otherwise, <i>all</i> such meta-templates would be "essential.") The policy refers to cases in which the ultimate application is essential.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I realize that what constitutes "essential" is a matter of opinion, but it's better to err on the side of caution. Unless a large segment of the community depends upon a particular setup in its current form (rendering it very difficult to change), any embedded meta-templates probably should be removed. And unless there's one heck of a special reason, new applications should be avoided entirely (until the issue is resolved in the software). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 13:25, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're mixing up two different issues here, though:
<ol>
<li>Cost of using meta-templates: this <i>cannot</i> be removed entirely, only decreased. Any non-plain-text markup operation in MediaWiki has associated performance costs; any improvements that the developers can make in software are still bounded by the ability of the servers to keep up. As you can see at the top of the page, the availability of hardware is not a problem we can expect to go away.</li>
<li>Adding native support for conditionals to MediaWiki: this is somewhat more complicated than it seems. For instance, we <i>don't</i> want support for loops (inadvertently) added, no matter how much the community wants them—the security hole that would open up is far too significant. Trying to add a strictly limited set of functionality is somewhat challenging, and it's unreasonable to expect that the developers would be able to do so as soon as you ask them. —<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 03:48, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi Firebug. I deeply understand your point. But I would not do any edit that presses the developers to do something. We do not know what the priorities of the developers are as we are just editors. We must assume that they have bigger fires than our meta-templates. But I agree with Firebug that the template implementation has a design bug that should be fixed. But we should not press the developers to do this by increasing the pressure on the servers. We should now calm down and see what happens. In the mean time do not increase the pressure on the servers. <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 09:56, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This one is quite explicit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AAvoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=31881003&amp;oldid=31876792" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AAvoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=31881003&amp;oldid=31876792" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> .

<dd>I agree that Jameday has clearly stated that the use of <s>meta-</s> conditional templates can result in server strain. He has <i><b>not</b></i>, however, indicated that they should be eliminated entirely (at least, not that I've seen). Perhaps they should be, in which case I would like to hear that from him (or another developer). I have absolutely no intention of using such templates, but I firmly believe that others are entitled to a first-hand confirmation of the interpretation that "reducing the use" = "banning all use." This is <i><b>not</b></i> "wikilawyering"; it's honest communication. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 12:13, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And no one is saying they should be banned entirely. As David Gerard has pointed out time and time again, they are enabled because they are vital for a very few things.

<dd>Part of the confusion stems from the fact that the term "meta-templates" is being used to describe two different things. You're referring to the correct connotation (a template within a template), but the controversy relates primarily to "conditional templates" (templates with optional/variable parameters). I meant to use the latter term.</dd>

<dd>That's exactly what happens in every field. Look, for example there are people that thought about how to streamline book and web references, something which <i>I</i> find essential to an encyclopedia. Book references is also the field I came from to here. In several such fields many wikipedian-hours were invested into improving their templates. Take for example masterpiece <a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELanguage_39a6.html" title="Template:Language">template:language</a>. It <i>is</i> just very hard to remove such a template and throw that work away. I understand that this might be hard to understand for outsiders - I mean those that were not taking part in the creation process of any of these complicated templates. I also agree that the servers do not care about theses communities. But it is very hard for them to accept that their template hits the servers badly. That's why this whole matter is so delicate. If someone finds qif and he sees it solves his problem he just gets excited and says - that's exactly what I needed! I could swear this happend on the fundriser team. (Switching to rhetorical mode) Oh my! do we really have to shoot all these beautiful templates? <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 18:14, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It most certainly is feasible - if a bunch of people implement a system that is a server drain despite a policy saying not to, those people can and should expect to have to clean it up. It is perfectly easy to create manually (Or by bot, or even, frankly, by substing the existing meta-templates into new templates) a set of Babel templates of the form of Template:Babel-en1 and so on, and these should be created. An announced changeover should take place, and a week after that we should shoot the meta-template version. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 18:10, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Babel project doesn't need meta-templates. It can be done just as well with individual templates for each language and proficiency. Nor does there need to be a bot substitution - just an announced deprecation, asking everyone to please change their userpages as the Babel templates are to be deleted at a certain date, and pointing them towards the new system. The bot would be useful mostly for generating the individual templates. This is the major problem with meta-templates - they're created as elegant solutions to problems, and are in fact only elegant on the user-level, and infact manifestly unelegant in practice. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 19:21, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Section "Alternatives": Problem with CSS</span></h2>
<p>The section "Alternatives" of the project page lists under point 3 the use of CSS. Netoholic is doing this and was quite successful for optional fields of infoboxes. Sadly this technique does not work for special browsers which do not support CSS, one of which is the text based lynx. Maybe there are also problems with screen readers. This was brought up by Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason on <a href="../../../t/a/x/Template_talk%7ETaxobox_51f0.html#Eliminating_meta-templates" title="Template talk:Taxobox">Template talk:Taxobox#Eliminating meta-templates</a>. The CSS trick can be seen for example in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ATaxobox&amp;diff=32617274&amp;oldid=32612063" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ATaxobox&amp;diff=32617274&amp;oldid=32612063" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>. Ævar kindly posted an example user view of that trick as viewed on lynx at <a href="http://www.simnet.is/velfag/tmp/lynx.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.simnet.is/velfag/tmp/lynx.png" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 23:02, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>How about adding an infobox primitive to the MediaWiki engine, similar to the inherent support for tables? This would solve the consistency problems while reducing server load and could include support for optional parameters that would work in all browsers. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 00:20, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
A helluva lot of this website sucks when viewed using lynx. At least, if we keep working to avoid meta-templates, the website will continue to function. <a href="../../../b/r/o/Wikipedia%7EBrowsers_0139.html" title="Wikipedia:Browsers">Wikipedia:Browsers</a> is out-of-date, but lynx/links software makes up 0.03% of the browsers used here in Feb 2004. I'm OK with a few tables not looking amazing without CSS as long as the site works well for the rest of us. Perhaps the taxobox should be split up into 3-5 more specific usages (Infobox Bacteria, Infobox Animal, ...), such that the optional parameters are cut to a minimum on each occurence. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 00:24, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Look, it's one thing to say that as a <b>temporary hack</b> we should avoid using these levels of abstraction in cases where there is another equivalent alternative, and quite another to say that we should go around breaking widely used templates - especially when there is NO alternative that works on all browsers - and let someone else fix the resulting mess. Netoholic is running around Wikipedia with a hammer breaking things, and rather than being treated like the vandal he is, everyone is patting him on the head and saying "good boy", an attitude I find utterly incomprehensible. But, then, I thought that we were trying to write an encylopedia, not genuflect before the genius of the developers that must not be questioned. Obviously, I was mistaken. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 01:07, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>If (or should I write qif?&#160;:-) I have to choose between (A) "no conditional logic in templates" and (B) "0.03% of the browsers display taxoboxes or other wp stuff badly" I must say that the second evil is the lesser one at the moment. The reason why I brought this here is that I wanted to know whether we could go further with this CSS trick or not. I think we all agree that that trick is not the best solution for all times (which qif also isn't, though it works with lynx), but at least the CSS trick works for now <i>without violating WP:AUM</i> (please, no start-over about this - we've been there enough). And at least we have a good reason to break lynx and possibly screen readers. If developers find time to implement something in WikiMedia that they see fit to solve our pain in the arse dilemma, they can look here. If somebody decides that lynx or screenreaders are prime then they can read here that we either need conditionals in WikiMedia code or a license to use qif in order to do that (or a lot more will break). <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 09:00, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One side-benefit of my template conversions is that I am actually making them <i>more</i> friendly to screen readers. One of the biggest issues for accessibility related to tables has to do with using the the proper table cells. A sad lot of Infoboxs just use plain cells, but the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Tables" class="extiw" title="meta:Help:Tables">wikitable format</a> includes codes for specifying a caption and TH (table headers). People using screen readers can "skim" a page by having it read only the caption of a table. To get more information, they can then navigate the row/column headers, to find the information they want to know. When you fail to use those features, there is no useful way for them to navigate the tables. As I'm going through removing meta-templates, I spend a good deal of time doing this formatting, and I encourage those others who work on templates to make full use of the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Tables" class="extiw" title="meta:Help:Tables">wikitable</a> formatting. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 10:01, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for this. I have actually read this entire page and posted this question because that does not actually answer my question. Obviously including qif as a subtemplate is depreciated, however is using the logic containted within it permissable <i>if</i> it is contained inline i.e. if it is effectively subst-ed rather than included as a template? – <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble"><span style="color:#008040;">Mr</span><span style="color:#007FBF;font-weight:bold">Weeble</span></a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/w/User_talk%7EMrWeeble_bf1b.html" title="User talk:MrWeeble">Talk</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Brit tv</a></small> 15:00, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Indeed, through trial and error I have discovered this to be so. However it is possible to hardcode using techniques <i>similar</i> to what qif uses, though avoiding using meta-templates. My question is, are these techniques permissible? (I know the code would looks awful and make it harder to debug/recode, but that is the inevitable drawback of removing meta-templates is that things can no longer be abstracted out). <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble"><span style="color:#008040;">Mr</span><span style="color:#007FBF;font-weight:bold">Weeble</span></a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/w/User_talk%7EMrWeeble_bf1b.html" title="User talk:MrWeeble">Talk</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Brit tv</a></small> 16:27, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, dunno why we didn't it didn't show an edit conflict. I was seeing the dreaded error screen around that time - might be something to do with that. Anyway, the problem I see with that code, neat though it is, is that it will still add a row (though with no content to the cells) for each left out parameter. This would cause huge amounts of empty space on some templates. My version of the code has the table row definition within the optional content section. Unfortunately, because templates also use pipes, we can't use pipe based wiki tables, hence the HTML table elements. – <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble"><span style="color:#008040;">Mr</span><span style="color:#007FBF;font-weight:bold">Weeble</span></a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/w/User_talk%7EMrWeeble_bf1b.html" title="User talk:MrWeeble">Talk</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Brit tv</a></small> 17:47, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've already been working on removing <a href="../../../t/l/_/Template%7ETl_75f5.html" title="Template:Tl">template:tl</a> from templates. For example it was used in <a href="../../../w/e/b/Template%7EWeb_reference_4011.html" title="Template:Web reference">template:web reference</a> so that made some 5000 articles dependent on <a href="../../../t/l/_/Template%7ETl_75f5.html" title="Template:Tl">template:tl</a>. It was removed per my request. I was touching articles with my bot to update the used templates list but was stopped by Netoholic because he does not trust my bot. However: please note that if <a href="../../../t/l/_/Template%7ETl_75f5.html" title="Template:Tl">template:tl</a> is only used inside the <code>&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;</code> section of a template, then articles transcluding that template do not depend on <a href="../../../t/l/_/Template%7ETl_75f5.html" title="Template:Tl">template:tl</a>.

<dd>Let's back up. Turning a template reference like <a href="../../../t/l/_/Template%7ETl_75f5.html" title="Template:Tl">template:tl</a> into an invocation of a template by using {{<a href="../../../t/l/_/Template%7ETl_75f5.html" title="Template:Tl">tl</a>}} anywhere (without subst'ing it) adds a database lookup to the cost of regenerating the page containing the reference. The only point to its use is to change the format of the reference from <a href="../../../t/l/_/Template%7ETl_75f5.html" title="Template:Tl">template:tl</a> to {{<a href="../../../t/l/_/Template%7ETl_75f5.html" title="Template:Tl">tl</a>}}, which sure seems to fall into the category of "unnecessary". If you subst it, it's exactly the same number of characters to type (so no advantage there), and if you subst it you leave a horrible looking mess in the raw page source. Perhaps the software should be changed to recognize links to templates and format them in some special way, but IMO using a template for formatting purposes is pretty close to just plain stupid. Maybe there's an argument that <a href="../../../t/l/_/Template%7ETl_75f5.html" title="Template:Tl">template:tl</a> should exist for showing the syntax of template invocations, but I'd bet 99% of its references are folks using it to simply link to a template being discussed and find its appearance more pleasing than a vanilla wikilink. STOP IT! Just as we should avoid using metatemplates, we should avoid unnecessary use of <i>any</i> templates. Markup templates are particularly bad because they tend to become like jargon and their usage spreads uncontrollably among folks thinking they're demonstrating their expertise.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Abomination?</span></h2>
<p>Ok, I've come up with something that I haven't seen before and I'd like to get some opinions on its viability before it spreads. Take a look at the way <a href="../../../m/i/d/Portal%7EMiddle-earth_Featured_article_39c3.html" title="Portal:Middle-earth/Featured article">Portal:Middle-earth/Featured article</a> is transcluded into <a href="../../../m/i/d/Portal%7EMiddle-earth_8b9a.html" title="Portal:Middle-earth">Portal:Middle-earth</a>. Basically, it is set up to define a parameter named for the day of the week and then only print content if that parameter exists... causing the content printed to change each day. The same could be done for days of the month, months of the year, and other situations (possibly even a 'random' generation which changes each time the page is viewed). It currently uses a simplified version of 'WeebleCode', but doesn't need to... it can be implemented based entirely on exceedinly basic functionality of defaulting a parameter to blank - so long as every possible parameter name is set up. There is no 'meta-templating' involved, but would this kind of 'floating content' cause extra server drain? I can see this being copied into other portals (the ability to keep them 'fresh' without needing to constantly update them is incredibly valuable to the portal concept), user spaces, common templates ('this AfD will close in <b>3</b> days', '<b>2</b> days', et cetera), and possibly even articles (ack!). If the 'random' concept is possible (I'm thinking I may be able to do something with the time or article count) and starts getting used to produce hundreds of random results... would this be a 'bad thing' &lt;tm&gt;? Basically, do we need to kill this now, set some sort of sane limits on it, or just let it go on without worries. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 00:52, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, ok. The one that really came up with the heart of that solution is MrWeeble, kindly asking first on this talk here before doing it on Template:Infobox_TV_channel. I was the one who wrote to him that I do not see that this would violate <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> which drove him to do that hard work, which then was rejected by Phil Boswell (and Netoholic).

<dd><i>Please do not use this technique. The empty parameter requirement is enough to make this impractical. hiddenStructure really is a good strategy for the time being, and is only marginally bad for less than 0.03% of our visitors. The best idea would be to limit the optional parameters used on any one template to those most important to its function and those least likely to be blank. In other words, adding a new optional field which would only be used on a handful of articles is probably not the best option. -- Netoholic @ 22:42, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>So he is against using that, at least for <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_TV_channel_bb2a.html" title="Template:Infobox TV channel">Template:Infobox_TV_channel</a> I suppose. I do not know whether that applies to your <a href="../../../m/i/d/Portal%7EMiddle-earth_8b9a.html" title="Portal:Middle-earth">Portal:Middle-earth</a> case too. Phil Boswell was, well, frankly said shocked when he saw the wiki code (see above). His most recent statement was "should be canned fortwith". But he has not seen my "upgrade" with the added newlines on User:Ligulem/work/Infobox TV channel/2006-01-02 yet. But I think there must be something with this default parameter which upsets people. I do not yet know why. What can be said from a technical standpoint is that it is calculated server side and as such makes more load on the servers. Jamesday also indicated that the parameter default might break in the future, so there is a risk in using this (see <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template_talk%7EQif_6b13.html" title="Template talk:Qif">Template_talk:Qif</a>). Otherwise I see not why it should not be used besides that it smaks like the not so beloved <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">template:qif</a>. Please do not assume that I am stonewalling against the removal of metatemplates. I just want that all parties know all available options and then decide based on the facts without emotions. I also absolutely do not want to pile a truckload of expressions onto the server just to press the developers to do something. If anybody thinks this, he is plain wrong. <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 14:43, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, as stated, the 'scheduled content' trick I came up with doesn't require an empty parameter... it is using one, but only because I didn't have all the days filled out at first and wanted to suppress undefined days. I could now remove the empty '|if=' with no loss in functionality, but left it in place for now in case others want to explore this concept. Even if the empty parameter <i>were</i> required I disagree that it is impractical... we've been running bots to completely rewrite template calls (or doing so manually). Adding an '|if=' to the top of each existing template call would be <i>much</i> simpler. The other issues you mention are more what I am curious about... this isn't a meta-template. Does that mean it is hunky-dory and should be used extensively or is it 'just as bad' for some reason. I'm looking for concrete reasons not to do this <b>now</b> so we don't have another 'You used a meta-templage! Sinner! Outcast! Unclean!' situation later. The possibility of parameter defaults 'breaking' is obviously a concern... but would destroy the CSS trick as well. I'm not sure about the 'calculated server side' issue. That's the kind of detail I'm looking for. Would a template that causes different text to be displayed each day (or each pageview if I can make a 'random number generator' - which is proving tricky) via this method cause significantly/slightly/any more load than a template which displays the same text on each pageview? If parsing empty default parameters slows things down then it would, otherwise I'd think it shouldn't... but I haven't studied the page building documentation. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 15:02, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
