<h2><span class="mw-headline">What is meant by "self-reference"?</span></h2>
<p>So, by self-reference, you mean the word "Wikipedia"? That does seem like a good policy. What about links to Wikipedia subjects? Seems like those would break under forking, too.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this is just commonsense that nobody ever thought of. B-)</p>
<p>-- <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 05:55 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What kind of links do you mean? Links into the Wikipedia namespace? Yes, many of our policies are "common sense", but you wouldn't believe how useful it can be to point to common sense rule X and say "Look, this is one of our policies/guidelines. Please don't do that." --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 05:58 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So I assume this policy does not apply to disambiguation and the disambiguation pages boilerplate text?</p>
<p>Also how does it apply to stub boilerplate text? Are they still allowed because eventually the reference to Wikipedia will be removed? -- <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPopsracer_cec6.html" title="User:Popsracer">Popsracer</a> 05:59 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>These kind of boilerplate texts will hopefully be transcluded dynamically when an article is assigned to one of the relevant categories. A category system is already in the works, where you will be able to say [[Category:Stub]] in an article, and it would only be natural to insert the respective notice when certain categories are selected. That would also make it much easier to update the texts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the meantime, we should change the existing boilerplate text to avoid at least using the Wikipedia name, although links into the Wikipedia: namespace should be OK. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 06:02 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, just because I'm a big booster, I want to give a devil's advocate question. To wit: the stated reason for avoiding self-references is to make it easier to fork Wikipedia. I ask: how important is it to make it _easy_ to fork Wikipedia? The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_namespace_daf6.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia namespace">Wikipedia:Wikipedia namespace</a> links, standard boilerplate, etc., makes our work on the project easier. How much pain do we have to go to to make downstream modifiers' lives easier? -- <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 06:11 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While it is true that forks are not always desirable, these kind of self-references are problematic for all types of redistribution. Say you print out an article about <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse_Now_a6a5.html" title="Apocalypse Now">Apocalypse Now</a></i> for your school class -- now what exactly are your students supposed to do with a notice like "Wikipedia contains spoilers"? Of course we like to stick our name onto our work, but requiring credit, linking to the FDL etc. should be enough to accomplish this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do agree that we should not make our work more difficult, though. That's why I think links into the Wikipedia namespace in boilerplace text are OK. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 06:14 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough! -- <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 06:22 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Another question: what about the legal disclaimers, like not giving medical advice or legal advice? Do those fall under the boilerplate extension? Lastly, is there a technical solution for marking up "meta" information? For example, editorial comments, disclaimers, stub notices? -- <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 06:22 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it is debatable whether we should have such disclaimers (some users have strong aversions to them), but if we do want them, they are certainly similar in type to spoiler warnings etc., so linking to a page in the Wikipedia namespace that describes our position should be OK. No, there is no solution to markup such information, and what we really want is <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transclusion.html" title="Transclusion">transclusion</a> -- retrieve the text from another page, so that only a single page has to be updated. If we had this, we could even have self-references in these notices, as others could change them easily. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 06:32 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p><br />
And another other question: what about references to the Talk: and User: namespaces? -- <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 06:22 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Avoid if possible. Redirects to the user namespace are generally considered OK, but linking to the talk page should usually not be done -- that's what "Discuss this page" is for. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 06:32 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. Links to "Talk" and "User" namespaces from the article namespace are almost always inappropriate. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 11:44 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>This is a very misconceived rule IMO. It encourages the duplication of content in multiple articles, when a self-reference would refer people to the appropriate place. In practice, at worst this may mean that for some articles that forkers would have to edit them slightly to make them suitable as standalone pieces. Our first priority should be to build the best encyclopedia we can, and compromising that to make it marginally easier to fork seems a bad tradeoff. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 11:39 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I should however add that it is not all that common for self-references to be the best way to handle things and that other methods of providing links to other articles are often a better idea. I just don't want to remove them from the quiver for the times when they are necessary. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 11:43 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, are we talking about the same kind of "self-references"? I fail to see how avoiding unnecessary references to the Wikipedia project within articles encourages "duplication of content". --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 11:46 20 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now that I have a clue what I'm talking about (I hope)...Purely from a stylistic point of view, I think continually talking about yourself (on in this case your project) is offputting, so in practice I guess this rule makes sense.</dd>

</dl>
<p>Actually, I think the VfD page is a good example were the self reference should stay. It is an important term here that needs explanation. Wikipedia would not be any harder to duplicate, if <a href="../../../v/f/d/Vfd.html" title="Vfd">vfd</a> explained that there is a certain on-line encyclopedia were these letters have a special meaning.</p>
<p>In the page <a href="../../../v/f/d/Talk%7EVFD_f2de.html" title="Talk:VFD">Talk:VFD</a> I have written more fully why this one should stay.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESander123_7c7c.html" title="User:Sander123">Sander123</a> 11:06, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>As long as the link is an external link, rather than a link to another namespace, it doesn't violate this policy. If you use a direct link there is a problem with duplication, because many duplicates exclude the Wikipedia namespace. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning)</p>

<p>When I translate an article from a foreign-language Wikipedia (which I do a lot of) I routinely add a note in the references section such as, in the case of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel-General_28ba.html" title="Colonel-General">Colonel-General</a> "This article draws heavily on the <a href="../../../../de/g/e/n/Generaloberst.html" class="extiw" title="de:Generaloberst">corresponding article</a> in the German-language Wikipedia." In that particular case, the person who originally requested the translation on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslation_into_English_e83f.html" title="Wikipedia:Translation into English">Wikipedia:Translation into English</a> proceeded to comment out this acknowledgment describing it as "self-reference". I do not think it is self-reference in any disparaging sense, and I suspect it is <i>necessary</i> in order to properly comply with GFDL (and certainly with reasonable scholarly standards of acknowledgement) but perhaps I have misunderstood, so I am bringing the question here. As I see it:</p>
<ol>
<li>The different-language Wikipedias do not constitute a single work. Therefore, my English-language article is a derivative work of the German-language article. I believe this is precisely the acknowledgment of authorship required under GFDL.</li>
<li>Separate from a legal matter, from a scholarly point of view these are two distinct works. I haven't bothered with strict formal citation of a particular version of the German-language article (perhaps I should) and I suppose that it is a little strange that as the two works evolve over time they could have acknowledgments to each other (not unknown in the academic world, either, but relatively unusual).</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, I'd be very interested to hear from others on this: on the legal matter, I'd like in particular to hear from someone who better understands the legalities of complying with GFDL, not just someone with an opinion about how they'd like things to be. I'd also like to an explanation of how, if at all, this violates our rules on self-reference. I think it would be absurd if everyone in the world can cite the German-language Wikipedia... except other Wikipedias. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 22:45, Oct 15, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a self-reference because you refer to "the corresponding article" on the German Wikipedia, implying that this article is on the English Wikipedia, which in redistributions may not be the case. Also consider article evolution over time. A better message would be to simply say "A previous version of this article was based on the German Wikipedia article <i>whatever</i>." Possibly, even include a full-URL link in your references section, so that redistributions that discard interlanguage links retain a link. Neither of these is self-reference, because you are citing Wikipedia in precisely the same manner as any other source. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Derrick Coetzee</a> 03:35, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>To say it's "Wikipedia's" is misleading. Neither Wikipedia nor the Wikimedia Foundation owns any copyright on the work. It is not "Wikipedia's" in any sense other than Wikipedia hosts it (which doesn't grant any ownership: 'mirrors' host articles, too). All content I write is still mine.

When these links are either put into templates, or changed into external links (for example, the user page link on <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a>) it's much easier to remove irrelevant and misleading content. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKate_3866.html" title="User:Kate"></a>— Kate Turner | <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKate_90f8.html" title="User talk:Kate">Talk</a> 02:30, 2004 Oct 21 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I don't think there's much difference. "This Wikipedia article is a stub" and "This article is a [[Wikipedia:Stub|stub]]" aren't very much different - both complicate forking and both are self-references.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This policy is misconceived</span></h2>
<p>"Forking," given above as the basic justification for the ban on self-reference, is a term taken from the computer field. Normally, it refers to reuse of software code. In open-source software, self-reference (for example, to details of particular machines or installations) is a hindrance to legitimate reuse.</p>
<p>Scholarly content differs from software because its value consists of accuracy, not functionality. To help establish accuracy, scholars cite their sources. Any Web site that uses Wikipedia material without saying where it is from (and this practice is pervasive) is engaged in rotten scholarship--in fact, in plagiarism.</p>
<p>It follows that any passage in a Wikipedia article that says it <i>is</i> a Wikipedia article can only be to the good, since it helps reveal bad scholarship on the part of others. If others won't cite the Wikipedia as source, let us in effect do it for them.</p>
<p>In conclusion: the software analogy is a <i>false</i> analogy. Software can be anonymously reused because it is self-verifying--you just check if the program works. Scholarship cannot be anonymously reused, because that breaks the chain of citation on which its quality depends.</p>

When a lawyer uses a segment from a Wikipedia article in a court case, or a company uses a few pages of a wikipedia seires in a business plan, or a travel guide uses a few passages from a Wikibook to illustrate a specialized point, they should be able to do so without worrying about subtle notes which will make no sense to someone who is not browsing the WP website. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a><a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj"><font color="#FF6996">+</font></a> 21:15, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<p>I was recently browsing the category of <a href="../../../n/p/o/Category%7ENPOV_disputes_9fc4.html" title="Category:NPOV disputes">NPOV disputes</a> and I found it quite funny that the Talk Page for Fascism and Communism was listed on the category (talk pages shouldn't be subject to NPOV, should they? =P). Apparently, the template for NPOV dispute was moved by someone citing Avoid self-references to the talk page. According to this page, yeah, that technically would be correct. But it breaks the automatic generation of the NPOV disputes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many of these templates are being put on the main articles, not the talk pages. The de-facto policy is to, actually, put the stub mark on the actual article, not the talk page. When people start arguing about whether or not the controversial tag should be put on the talk or the main article page, it's a needless argument (I saw this in <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_4580.html" title="Talk:Atheism">Talk:Atheism</a>. In short, this policy about templates is bloated and is near impossible to pull off, because of people's perceptions about these tags.</p>
<p>In that case, perhaps this page causes more problems than it causes when it starts talking about templates. Obviously you shouldn't say "This Wikipedia article discusses" inside an article, but if you consider the templates, I think this policy should be amended. But due to the self-referential nature of most templates, I think the only possible solution is to delete those clauses. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a> 21:20, Jan 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It says "many fields", and an introductory textbook in any of those fields can be hundreds of pages long, so of course what it says remains true even if that Wikipedia article grows to the equivalent of 100 pages long.

<dd>This is not a self-reference at all, in the sense of this rule. It is perfectly okay for the material to refer to the fact that it is in <i>an</i> encyclopedia having articles. The important thing is that it does not assume it is in <i>Wikipedia</i>, or make assumptions that the user is reading it on our website. A rule of thumb is, if it still makes sense if it's printed out and given to someone who's never heard of Wikipedia, it's fine.</dd>
<dd>An entirely separate issue is how well a fact ages. For example, to say "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> has 8 million people" is not only lacking a clear source but unlikely to remain accurate indefinitely. Better is to say, "according to the 2000 U.S. census, New York City has over 8 million people". On the other hand, such context is sometimes elided in the interest of brevity. In your case, I would first attempt to edit out the source of conflict with something like "Many fields use trigonometry in advanced ways not discussed in this article."

<dd>A quick question: would you consider it appropriate for, say, the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Britannica_0925.html" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> to refer to its own editorial board in the middle of an article, or to use itself as an example in topics like <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html" title="Book">book</a>, <a href="../../../c/d/-/CD-ROM_f9c9.html" title="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a>, or <a href="../../../w/e/b/Website.html" title="Website">website</a>; or perhaps if <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encarta.html" title="Encarta">Encarta</a> always referenced the most relevant Microsoft product on every page - wouldn't that seem a bit unprofessional and unnecessarily biased? One reason to care how content will seem when copied is to take "Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" out of the context of "Wikipedia, the online project" and concentrate on what an encyclopedia should actually contain; who knows, one day we might be our own mirror - in print, on official CD-ROMs, or who knows what else. While the policy can be frustrating, I think in most situations it does encourage practice which improves the policy of the encyclopedic content - which is what we're all here for, after all. - <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 12:11, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That question has little to do with establishing what is or isn't a self-reference: rather, it would tell us what's meta-content of various kinds. In most cases that's implied by the namespace, but in the case of categories, obviously there's a single namespace, used equally for articles, user pages, etc. One could add a tag saying "this is a category of wikipedia project pages": but equally, that's pretty evident simply by looking at what's <i>in</i> the category.</dd>
<dd>If there really has to be a template for this, it should avoid the terminology of "self-references", and it should <i>not</i> be subst'd -- otherwise we simply end up with another piece of freeform text which is made more difficult to update, and is less convenient for the cited purpose of automatic non-mirroring.

<p>Also note that verifiability involves verification by reference to published sources, not verification by repeating the original research. If the only way to verify that someone edited xyr own article is to laboriously trudge through the edit history to check that the relevant edit exists, then that is original research that does not belong in Wikipedia. If, however, that fact has been reported and discussed by a reliable source independent of Wikipedia, then it is fair game for inclusion.</p>
<p>The point of the sentence fragment that you quote is that this guideline is nothing at all to do with the concerns of autobiography, but rather to do with the concerns of mirroring Wikipedia, and that therefore this discussion belongs on another talk page. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:09, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Some of the more specific Wikipedia-related topics may not, but VfD is the Court of Notability, and hopefully they'll decide in an objective manner.

<p>If anyone is familiar with the <a href="../../../j/t/_/JT_LeRoy_935d.html" title="JT LeRoy">JT LeRoy</a> hoax, that will help understand the background of my question.</p>
<p>The issue is this:</p>
<p>A few weeks ago a New York Times story pretty much settled a debate regarding the true identity of an author named JT LeRoy by offering strong evidence to suggest that the author is indeed another author, <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laura_Albert_3946.html" title="Laura Albert">Laura Albert</a>.</p>
<p>Before this story broke, there was some doubt but nothing conclusive. A lot going on in the LeRoy article's Talk page and one of the editors made the claim that he or she was, in fact, LeRoy's assistant and claimed to have spoken with him in person and at length on the phone. When the Times article broke, it became pretty clear that the claims this editor made about the author's identity could not have been accurate, and in all probability this person was either an agent of the author, or even the author herself (given her penchant for using false identity).</p>
<p>I believe this to be both noteworthy and encylopedic because it outlines what I think will become a bigger issue, down the road, and that is the issue of Wikipedia itself becoming an occasional front, by interested parties, in the battle over public opinion.</p>
<p>So I added a section about this (and would like to expand), however I am caught at the rule of avoiding self-reference.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Let's put more emphasis on acceptable cases</span></h2>
<p>Currently, if one reads this guideline carefully, one can understand that it is acceptable to write about Wikipedia in a variety of circumstances. I think this should be made more clear to the casual reader. I propose adding a list of positive examples after the second full paragraph, which currently reads, "Wikipedia can, of course, write <i>about</i> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, but context is important..., use external link style to allow the link to work also in a site with a copy of the main namespace content." <b>Examples:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Articles where Wikipedia played a major role in the subject of the article, for example: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a></li>
<li>Articles about prominent people involved in Wikipedia, for example: <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a></li>
<li>Articles about <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a></li>
<li>Articles where Wikipedia is illustrative of the subject, for example: <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_community.html" title="Online community">online community</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a></li>
<li>Articles where it is likely the reader actually wants a Wikipedia policy article or similar, such as <a href="../../../u/s/e/Userbox.html" title="Userbox">userbox</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think this would make this guideline more beneficial to the project. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 04:17, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no rule against this. I don't think there should be. Often, self-referential content is a more effective way of conveying information.

<dd>I just think they are better set apart from the text.</dd>
<dd>For instance, instead of demonstrating two different styles of typography in a single sentence of the article text itself, demonstrate it with some floating framed passages of text. One would have a passage of text with one typography style, and another would have the same passage of text with the other typography style. Then you have two copies and you can compare them to each other.</dd>
<dd>Instead of saying "This whole article is, in fact, a simple program that can be run using the example literate interpreter," set aside that section of the text inside a box, and don't refer to the article that contains it. Use an example that people might actually use. "This is an example of a simple program in a literate programming language". No one is going to write a literate program with the area of a circle and the area of a rectangle, but put the rest of an encyclopedia article in the comments. The program is out of place for an encyclopedia article and the rest of the article would be out of place in a real-life program.

It would seem natural to link to a category/list of Wikipedians in a polity from an article about that polity.

More input on this matter would be appreciated. ~ <a href="../../../p/s/e/User%7EPseudoSudo_e48d.html" title="User:PseudoSudo">PseudoSudo</a> 08:03, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that's a useful point. CLS does indicate we should these as encyclopedic content, in a different way to Portals, for instance. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 17:31, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Basically categories should not mix links to different namespaces. So there should be no articles in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_stubs_3c22.html" title="Category:Wikipedia stubs">Category:Wikipedia stubs</a> but those should be sorted as outlined in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_72d7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting">Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting</a>. Since there is no other functionality like categories for other namespaces, the best we can do is make sure that links don't cross namespaces. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 21:42, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The further question is whether the text on a Category: page should cross-link. Keeping the contents of a category split between namespaces is clearly a good idea, but should a wikiproject notice be placed on the Category: or Category talk: page? I'd suggest the latter but the former seems more common. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 22:49, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think that the introduction text of a category (that references articles) should not have any cross-links - and any advertisement of a wikiproject related to that category should go on the talk page - but I don't know if there is any documented standard. That seems in keeping with the general goals of ASR. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 04:39, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>For the purpose of ASR, I would consider categories to be just like articles. This makes sense to me because they're a navigation aid used to travel between articles, not unlike a list or disambiguation page. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 23:00, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Are links to categories self-references?</span></h2>
<p>It is sometimes appropriate to link to a category in a see also, like "<a href="../../../w/o/r/Category%7EWorks_by_Albert_Camus_ea1d.html" title="Category:Works by Albert Camus">Category:Works by Albert Camus</a>". However, this seems to be a borderline self-reference, especially if accompanied by text like "See all Camus' works by browsing the category <a href="../../../w/o/r/Category%7EWorks_by_Albert_Camus_ea1d.html" title="Category:Works by Albert Camus">Category:Works by Albert Camus</a>".

<dd>Hrmmm, unsure. I would say it's okay to link it, but don't refer to "browsing the category" and don't imply that it's a comprehensive list. For example, a better link might read <a href="../../../w/o/r/Category%7EWorks_by_Albert_Camus_ea1d.html" title="Category:Works by Albert Camus">Articles about works by Albert Camus</a>, or something like that. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 11:25, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To clarify my comment: there is no guarantee that somebody who is reproducing an article is reproducing all of WP's content, so a "see also" link to an article is effectively self-referential to an extent. (Having said that, I've seen "see also" red links before! But this is no guarantee that a reuser will want them!) The particular problem here is that not all reusers also copy across the category system. My suggestion, as a compromise in the spirit of ASR, would be: put it in the see also section so the link can be trimmed without any harm being done, rather than putting it in the main article text where it would change things significantly if it were removed. Does that sound sensible? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 21:34, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think we should worry about the repusers. They can take any portion of WP and there is no guarantee they will even take the whole article space. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 22:45, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As long as the category contains a list of articles - it is not a self reference. However, a link to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_94a6.html" title="Category:Wikipedians">Category:Wikipedians</a> is since it contains links to non-article space pages. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 22:11, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>It is, in some knowledge domains, quite dysfunctional. Consider complex, advanced technology. People who write about this for a living -- I used to, long ago -- will tell you that you have to go from the known to the unknown. OK? So what's known to 100% of your audience in Wikipedia? Answer: Some of the technical details of the way Wikipedia works. And this knowledge can fruitfully serve as a bridge to deeper understanding.</p>
<p>Case in point: Please visit <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudonymity.html" title="Pseudonymity">Pseudonymity</a>, which I personally think is one of the finest articles to be found in our project. The language is unusually crisp and precise. A Wikipedia example is used to introduce what would undoubtedly be, for most readers, an unfamiliar concept.</p>
<p>And a user who's read this policy statement proposes to delete half the article! (See the talk page.)</p>
<p>OK, if you must, change "Wikipedia" to "a public Wiki site." Fine. You're introducing a small but undeniable barrier to understanding, but if it is really so important, do it. Just don't delete half the page. Please? <a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfaff9_358a.html" title="User:Pfaff9">Bryan</a> 03:30, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
