	    <p><b>Avoozl</b> is a fictional being from the computer game <a href="../../../s/h/a/Quest_for_Glory_IV%7E_Shadows_of_Darkness_cb3b.html" title="Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness">Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness</a>, which is part of the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quest_for_Glory_b73d.html" title="Quest for Glory">Quest for Glory</a> computer game series.</p>
<p>Avoozl is also referred to as the 'Dark One', although the character <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baba_Yaga_4ef1.html" title="Baba Yaga">Baba Yaga</a> refers to it in plural form, saying that "Dark Ones are from another plane of existence". This seems to suggest that more than one of these beings exist, although the one named Avoozl is the only such being to actually have any presence in the story. This remark also shows that they are not native to the reality in which the world of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glorianna.html" title="Glorianna">Glorianna</a> exists, and must be summoned in to that reality. It is implied that they are intrinsically evil, and Avoozl is blamed for the proliferation of monsters in the valley of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mordavia.html" title="Mordavia">Mordavia</a>. It is also said that Avoozl "sweats" dark magic. In a subsequent game, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Quest_for_Glory_V%7E_Dragon_Fire_4fb5.html" title="Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire">Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire</a>, Rakeesh makes the remark that if Avoozl had been summoned "the entire world would have been in danger", implying that Dark Ones may also be apocalyptic beings.</p>
<p>It is revealed during the game that Avoozl's body in this reality is actually the cave in which the summoning rituals are performed. In a vision of the Dark One rising (and if the Hero fails and the Dark One actually does rise) it is shown that Avoozl is as large as a mountain, and has a somewhat human-shaped torso and arms, although the torso tapers and ends at the waist and as such it lacks any legs. Avoozl also has two huge, bat-like wings. Its head is reminiscent of an alien from the Hollywood film <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_%28film%29.html" title="Alien (film)">Alien</a>, although its elongation is not quite as profound. Avoozl's entire body is black. The nature and appearance of Avoozl are reminiscent of the <a href="../../../l/o/v/Lovecraft_Mythos_c9f1.html" title="Lovecraft Mythos">Lovecraft Mythos</a> and the macabre and evil gods within it. Avoozl was obviously inspired by Lovecraft's work.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/o/Avoozl.html" title="Edit section: The Cult of Avoozl">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Cult of Avoozl</span></h2>
<p>Avoozl was worshipped by a cult which resided in Mordavia around fifty years before <i>Shadows of Darkness</i> takes place. The cult did not originate in Mordavia, having arrived from somewhere else. It is never revealed where the cult originally came from or why they chose Mordavia as the place where they would attempt to summon Avoozl. The cultists constructed a monastery in the town of Mordavia where they worshipped Avoozl and presumably prepared to summon it in to this reality. The cultists seemed to think that there actions would not only bring in to existence Avoozl, but would also grant them immortality (see below).</p>
<p>The summoning of Avoozl was to be achieved by the performing of rituals, apparently magical in nature, that were designed to prepare the summoning cave for Avoozl's spirit. There were six rituals, the first five of which were preparing the Avoozl's 'body' and the last of which called his soul or essence into the cave. In the order in which they were to be performed, the rituals were: Mouth Ritual, Bone Ritual, Blood Ritual, Sense Ritual, Heart Ritual and Essence Ritual.</p>
<p><a name="History" id="History"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/o/Avoozl.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The cultists nearly succeeded in summoning Avoozl fifty years prior to <i>Shadows of Darkness</i>, and were only thwarted by Mordavian citizens led by the Paladin <a href="../../../p/i/o/Piotyr.html" title="Piotyr">Piotyr</a> and the Archmage <a href="../../../e/r/a/Erana.html" title="Erana">Erana</a>. During the battle at the Dark One's cave, the cultists underwent a transformation which gave them partial immortality (in that while they could be killed they did not die of natural causes) but also horribly disfigured them. Their physical appearance became reminiscent of insects and squid. In those forms they were know as Chernovy Wizards and were powerful spellcasters.</p>
<p>Despite facing the crazed and transformed cultists, the Mordavians were able to drive them away from the cave. However the summoning ritual had been performed and Avoozl's incarnation was imminent. To stop Avoozl from entering the world, Erana engaged Avoozl's soul in a battle. Although she succeeded in stopping Avoozl from fully entering the world, she was killed in the process and her soul was trapped inside the Dark One's cave in a large crystalline structure. Avoozl was also trapped, but it was trapped between dimensions, not fully in one world or the other, which is what caused the leakage of dark magic into the valley. Thus, a stalemate was reached between Erana and Avoozl, both trapped by the other. All that Piotyr found of Erana was her staff which he placed in a natural rock formation near the gates of the town of Mordavia, and which from that time magically protected the town.</p>
