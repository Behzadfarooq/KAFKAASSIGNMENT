<h2><span class="mw-headline">Accessiblty concerns with css class hiddenStructure</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">User:Netoholic</a> is advocating that lines in tables be hidden with class="hiddenstructure{{parameter|}}", rather than using more complicated parameter hacks. I wish to raise a number of concerns I have over the accessibilty of this technique.</p>
<p>Firstly, and most easily fixed, this uses visual styles only. The style rule <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/aural.html#speaking-props" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/aural.html#speaking-props" rel="nofollow">speak:none</a> should be added as well display:none so that it remains "hidden" for screen readers.</p>
<p>The second is this does not work for users on non-css browsers or for users who have CSS enabled. I know some do not feel that it is worth taking these users into consderation, but noting the accessibily features coded into wikipedia (if you turn off style sheets you get headings over the various navigation menus, such as "Views" and "Personal Options") I know that I am not the only one who thinks that they should in some way be catered to.</p>
<p>The third is similar to the second in that it fails when the stylesheet is not present, for instance on mirrors. <a href="http://www.1bx.com/en/ARY_Digital.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.1bx.com/en/ARY_Digital.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.1bx.com/en/ARY_Digital.htm</a> is a mirror of <a href="../../../a/r/y/ARY_Digital_52c2.html" title="ARY Digital">ARY Digital</a>, a page that uses the hiddenStructure css hack and the "hidden structure" is clearly visible as that site does not use our stylesheets. I am concerned that reliance on such a style rule is tantamount to being a <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">self-reference</a> (unless there is instructions linked off <a href="http://download.wikimedia.org/" class="external free" title="http://download.wikimedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://download.wikimedia.org/</a> or somewhere to indicate that it is necesary to use these stylesheets) – <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble"><span style="color:#008040;">Mr</span><span style="color:#007FBF;font-weight:bold">Weeble</span></a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/w/User_talk%7EMrWeeble_bf1b.html" title="User talk:MrWeeble">Talk</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Brit tv</a></small> 14:06, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For what it's worth, this concerns me as well, but it seems to be getting lost in the "Great Meta Template Purge of 2005/2006". I know Ævar had concerns about Lynx users and screen readers as well, which he expressed <a href="../../../t/a/x/Template_talk%7ETaxobox_51f0.html#Eliminating_meta-templates" title="Template talk:Taxobox">here</a>. A screenshot (also provided by him) pretty well showed how horrible the CSS hack was: <a href="http://www.simnet.is/velfag/tmp/lynx.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.simnet.is/velfag/tmp/lynx.png" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 14:18, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Content control is not what CSS is designed for: the hiding of document content is more than a 'style' issue. We cannot expect mirrors of Wikipedia content to adopt Wikipedia style sheets: the content should remain independent of style. The CSS kludge could be reworked into inline CSS, but that would look really horrible. I tink it's fair to say that we do not yet possess a viable alternative to 'meta-templates'. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 14:33, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we <b>do</b> have a viable alternative. 'WeebleCode'. Yes, it requires an '|if=' statement or other blank parameter to be added to the template call. I don't consider that a big deal compared to the complete rewrite of many template calls which is going on. And, as per the example I just added to <a href="#Comparison_CSS_trick.2FWeeble_code" title="">#Comparison CSS trick/Weeble code</a> above, I think it is at least as simple to write this in templates as the CSS hiddenStructure trick. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 16:14, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not sure it could be done inline except as style="display:none{{parameter|}};speak:none{{parameter|}}". unfortunately, setting a style property to a non-existant value results in invalid CSS, whereas calling an non-exisiting class is not invalid. – <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble"><span style="color:#008040;">Mr</span><span style="color:#007FBF;font-weight:bold">Weeble</span></a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/w/User_talk%7EMrWeeble_bf1b.html" title="User talk:MrWeeble">Talk</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Brit tv</a></small> 14:44, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a very good point about using the CSS trick inline: it creates invalid CSS. Your code is good. but has the draw back of requiring the dummy parameter to be defined in every calling article, and of not allowing table pipe syntax. I'm not so sure that this is such a viable alternative. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 18:45, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Indeed, I am not specifically advocating the dummy parameter hack over any other option, there seems to be real disadvantages with them all. Just hoping that we can either find a decent alternative (preferable) or at least reach a consensus as to which <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesser_of_two_evils.html" title="Lesser of two evils">evil is the lesser</a>. I suppose it comes down to which is deemed more important by the community, accessibilty of output or usability of input. – <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble"><span style="color:#008040;">Mr</span><span style="color:#007FBF;font-weight:bold">Weeble</span></a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/w/User_talk%7EMrWeeble_bf1b.html" title="User talk:MrWeeble">Talk</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Brit tv</a></small> 20:00, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the very high use templates we'll need a bot to add the dummy parameter to all the template calls. This would make this hack a little less 'evil'! --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 23:23, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did a complete conversion of {{<a href="../../../t/a/x/Template%7ETaxobox_3269.html" title="Template:Taxobox">taxobox</a>}} to dummy parameter format (no hiddenStructure) at <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_Sandbox3_8f49.html" title="User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox3">User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox3</a>. A few different calls to this can be seen (along with some other ongoing projects) at <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_Sandbox_a017.html" title="User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox">User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox</a>. It would be interesting to see whether the browsers which had trouble with CSS can handle this better. The calls to the template were left unchanged from the current format <b>except</b> for requiring the extra '|if=' parameter. Note that I used wiki-table markup <i>except</i> I used &lt;td&gt; for the newlines... which could then be included inside the default parameter to prevent blank lines. I don't think this format is particularly more complicated than hiddenStructure style. The need to add the extra parameter is the biggest issue. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 00:31, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This thread is nothing more than more stonewalling against this policy. The hiddenStructure tricke is not perfect, but we <i>must</i> do everything we can to eliminate meta-templates. Lacking anything better, and "Weeble" is definitely not better), we must implement what we have. In a couple months, if the syntax changes or someone discovers something better, I'll be back at it, updating all the templates I'm working on right now. I don't care. What cannot happen is for people to delay or impede these conversations on the grounds that CSS isn't perfect. Let's get to work. If you don't want to do the work, then at least don't iuterrupt those that do. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 01:04, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, this thread is <i>discussion</i> on the best ways to implement this policy. Compared to hiddenStructure, the 'MrWeeble' method offers greater accessibility and greater portability with only the cost of having to add '|if=' to each call to the templates. For many templates that seems like a reasonable tradeoff to me. There are over a thousand 'taxobox' template calls, so that's a little daunting to add all those 'ifs', but most templates don't get called that many times. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 01:34, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Netoholic, I am not "stonewalling against this policy". Indeed I agree with this policy. If something harms the servers and contributes to downtime then I say "kill it; kill it with a big stick". However, now we've accepted this policy, we need to determine what to do next to replace templates that use meta-templates for the hiding of lines that show. While there is some merit in <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">going ahead and making unilateral changes</a>, for something as important as this, I believe there should be <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a>. At the moment there is not consensus, hence I thought I should raise my concerns about the hiddenStructure method in the hope that these can be resolved. In the interests of fairness and objectveness here are some <b>Usability concerns with dummy parameter method</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires a dummy parameter in each call of the template. This could be laborious to do manually, but should be relatively trivial to do with a bot.</li>
<li>The code does not look pretty making it very hard for a newbie to edit.</li>
<li>Due to both wikitables and templates using pipes, table structures need to be done in html, again this reduces options and thus reduces usability for editing it. – <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble"><span style="color:#008040;">Mr</span><span style="color:#007FBF;font-weight:bold">Weeble</span></a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/w/User_talk%7EMrWeeble_bf1b.html" title="User talk:MrWeeble">Talk</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Brit tv</a></small> 12:07, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think any one of those reasons is enough to shelf "WeebleCode" in favor of the CSS solution. CSS does work well, and really only <i>marginally</i> looks bad on lynx, which is less than 0.03% of our hits. The solution for lynx is to limit the number of optional fields.

<dd>Actually, I think the major problem with <i>hiddenStructure</i> is that it doesn't work on Wikipedia mirrors unless each and every mirror individually includes <i>hiddenStructure</i> in its stylesheets.

<dd>Mirrors have always had to adapt, so I'm unconcerned about them too much. But really, what do you think a mirror can do with WeebleCode anyway? It's based of a function that's built into the pre-alpha version of MediaWiki that Wikipedia runs. Moreover, it's entirely reliant on the way the MediaWiki software handles those default parameters. Mirrors get copies of the page and template sources, but most don't even use MediaWiki. You're telling me that adding a CSS class to their implementation is harder than rewriting their parser code?</dd>
<dd>I'd be more worried about people who want to use content containing WeebleCode on the older (stable) 1.5.x and below versions of MediaWiki. Default parameters have not been activated on those releases and so WeebleCode has no chance of working. There is a chance it will never work, since 1.6.x isn't even in alpha state yet. hiddenStructure <i>does</i> work on the current stable/public version of MediaWiki. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 17:38, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An alternative CSS trick that doesn't depend on a specific stylesheet is to use <code>&lt;span style{{{parameter|}}}="display:none;speak:none;"&gt;</code>. I've recently used it in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Template%7EStarsx_9bf2.html" title="Template:Starsx">Template:Starsx</a>, and it appears to work fine (even in lynx, though that's a bit of a special case). —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 19:12, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That solution doesn't produce valid HTML, since styleFoo isn't an allowed attribute. It's OK to call undefined class names, as in the hiddenStructure method.

<dd>True, but it seems Tidy strips the bogus attribute away — and even if it didn't, user agents are supposed to ignore unrecognized attributes. As for lynx, it works in the sense that it displays a meaningful alt. text. As I said, though, this template is a special case since its main purpose is to show images; it may or may not be possible to make other templates using such tricks work in lynx. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 21:15, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I belive the portability and validity criteria really do turn us away from the <i>hiddenStructure</i> technique, and there seems to be gathering consensus that it not be used.

<p>I can not see how CBD's code works. I have tried to implement it, but it does not remove the lines, mereley removes the label from the line, leaving blank lines.

<p>The code at User:Adrian_Buehlmann/work/Infobox TV channel/2006-01-02 is a whole lot neater than my original version, and hopefully should be easier to edit.</p>
<p>As an additional comment, I feel that any templates that we hack in either of these ways should be tagged with a category (in noinclude of course), so that when a better method is implemented we can go through and re-reimplement them all. – <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble"><span style="color:#008040;">Mr</span><span style="color:#007FBF;font-weight:bold">Weeble</span></a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/w/User_talk%7EMrWeeble_bf1b.html" title="User talk:MrWeeble">Talk</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Brit tv</a></small> 13:55, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I segmented this out from the previous pros/cons section as both are getting large.<br />
MrWeeble - definitely agree on the categorization. Both of these methods are kludges and we ought to keep track of them for later repair if a better methodology becomes available.<br />
Take a look at the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_Infobox_8474.html" title="Template:User Infobox">template:User Infobox</a> which I just cobbled together and it's use on my <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">User:CBDunkerson</a> page. It makes extensive use of WeebleCode along with tables within tables. Still needs alot of polishing / expansion, but shows that the methodology is viable. As noted before, there's also <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_Sandbox3_8f49.html" title="User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox3">User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox3</a> for a translation of {{<a href="../../../t/a/x/Template%7ETaxobox_3269.html" title="Template:Taxobox">taxobox</a>}}... compare the coding on those two. They produce essentially identical output and have nearly the same coding, except that taxobox uses hiddenStructure and my Sandbox3 uses WeebleCode. Examples of Sandbox3 in use can be seen at <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_Sandbox_a017.html" title="User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox">User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox</a>.<br />
There <b>is</b> a blank line issue with this method, but you can usually work around it. The '!' symbol and &lt;td&gt; can be used inside a parameter default section to create horizontal and vertical cells... '!' being a header indicator means that it's use isn't always appropos, but I've been able to kludge something through for each situation I've encountered so far. I'll try to take a look at your latest 'Infobox TV channel' to see if I can figure out how to adjust it to this format. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 14:35, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That looks good. It's obviously not a straight substitution, and some thought is needed to convert existing templates to WeebleCode. As no real solution seems to be on the horizon, it seems that this is the best kludge we have. To focus minds, the way forward seems to be:
<ol>
<li>Develop draft versions of existing meta-template templates rewritten with WeebleCode.</li>
<li>Ask others to cross-check and test them.</li>
<li>Get a few bots to carry out the insertion of dummy parameters into articles (offers please!).</li>
<li>Switch the template to the draft version, and tweak if necessary.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Random</span></h2>
<p>I've come up with two (related) ways of building a 'random number' generator in Wiki-markup. However, one method would require thousands of parameters to be evaluated (with all but one being unpassed). The other method could cut that to hundreds of parameters, but would require the template to be manually updated every few days. Is evaluating hundreds (or thousands) of unset parameters in a template resource intensive? That is, if I had a template which lists parameters 1 to 1000, returning a different number for each, but I only passed in parameter 732 would the template take significantly longer to evaluate than if 732 were the only parameter it was anticipating? Assuming that parameter switching <b>isn't</b> a computational drain... do I dare go there? Once something like this is developed it could easily be converted to a generic {{random}} template which might then be called by other templates (meta-templating) or fed into other templates as a parameter (multi-templating). Is this too much of a 'genie out of the bottle' issue or can it be implemented in a limited fashion without hurting anything? And yes... I know I'm evil. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 15:33, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If only identified exceptions are 'allowed' then what you are talking about is a significant, and in my opinion unwise, policy change. Is there really any reason to go after all the users who have 'Babel' templates (which are meta-templates after all) on their user-pages? All those who put Babel and other template calls on a sub-page and then transclude that into their user page? Meta-templates... but absolutely insignficant in terms of server load. The policy is "Avoid"... there are uses of meta-templates which can cause unspecified but significant strain on the servers. We should be tracking those down and eliminating them. Not changing the policy to "Don't" and hassling a much larger population for no good reason. The problem is that 'Joe user' doesn't know which meta-templates are likely to cause significant drain and which aren't. Right now a bunch of people (mostly on this page) are figuring that out for them.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Transitioning and alternatives</span></h2>
<p>OK, now that this has escalated to an official policy then what are the plans for transitioning and converting existing meta-templates? One alternative to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Array" class="extiw" title="m:Help:Array">m:Help:Array</a> may be the data storage tool which Jimbo mentioned last year; what is the implementation status of that?

<dd>There are a couple of 'in the works' changes which might allow meta-templates to be replaced with a built-in implementation. However, no clue when/if those will happen. In the mean-time two methods of replacing meta-template functionality have been developed. However, neither is perfect and both have benefits/drawbacks the other does not. Unfortunately, they might both break if the default handling for unset parameters changes. Extensive commentary on the 'CSS trick' and 'WeebleCode / parameter default trick' can be found on this page. There are also a number of more flexible variations on each (inline CSS, doing 'or/and/not' parameter checks, et cetera) which probably ought to be collected somewhere for reference. Several major meta-templates have already been transitioned over to these methods. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 12:13, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Conversion Template</span></h2>
<p>Currently there are some discussions about Conversion Templates [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion#January_9" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion#January_9" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] . In particular the following convertions template have been ruled as "disallowed by policy" in WP:AUM.</p>
<ul>
<li>Template: {{Born|1919|7|20|region=NZ}} that correctly puts <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Hillary_e493.html" title="Edmund Hillary">Edmund Hillary</a> into the Category:New Zealand people and Category:1919 births. And correctly formats the dates as per wiki standard.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Template: {{Locale length|1000}} that Converts meters to feet eg. {{Locale length|10}} gives <b>10 m (33 ft)</b> and {{Locale length|1000}} gives gives <b>1000 m (3281 ft)</b>, useful when globalising metric measurments (without imperial feet) are encountered in some pages. Also can be used to insert no-line-break space after the between number and unit. eg 1000&#160;m, this is commonly missed and leads to messy pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am thinking that we need more of these kind of template, not less. Can someone point me to some stats on how these kind of template effect the performance of mediawiki (I don't have mediawiki installed on any of my machines).</p>

<dd>(triple edit conflict)Sorry, my fault. I was converting the template, but hadn't updated the call yet. I changed this from a meta-template which calls one of 10,000 other templates to a single template which triggers one of 10,000 parameters. To do so the call has to change from {{Locale length|7}} to {{Locale length|7=m}}. The 'm' isn't really relevant, you can set it equal to anything... just need to define one parameter as the only one being set. This now begs the question... is this massive parameter switch as bad (or worse) than the massive meta-template in terms of server load? I'm assuming they're both ugly, but worth exploration. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 12:26, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You heard (ok, read) me. That's how the conversion works. It calls a template P1, P2, P3... P10000. There are no mathematical functions in Wiki so each instance (1-10000 meters) must be identified and responded to independantly. BTW, it takes so long to sort out the parameters that if you have three of these calls on the same page it just gives up. I'm reverting to the other version and think we should definitely kill this thing. However, it makes me wonder if the parameter switching we are using to replace meta-templates isn't actually worse. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 12:36, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just a possibility. This is a pretty unusual case. It's really only 'double transclusion', but the second layer can be one of any 10000 templates... but that's set with a single parameter.

<p>NevilleDNZ, I like the concepts but the way these templates work is problematic. The country one might be convertable to a non-meta format. Take a look at what I did at <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_Sandbox_a017.html" title="User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox">User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox</a> for the distance conversion templates. It can all be done in a single template call... the problem is that the distance conversion has <b>so</b> many possible parameters that it just takes forever to evaluate. Countries shouldn't be as bad. Also, if these are subst'd in rather than pasted as templates they wouldn't cause much disruption, but that would have to be watched carefully. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 12:48, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

In fact, using the Babel-<i>N</i> metatemplates even saves one template call compared to using {{<a href="../../../b/o/x/Template%7EBoxboxtop_8af7.html" title="Template:Boxboxtop">Boxboxtop</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../b/o/x/Template%7EBoxboxbottom_08fe.html" title="Template:Boxboxbottom">Boxboxbottom</a>}} and directly including the Babel boxes in between. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 13:20, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That said, an underlying problem is that Babel boxes on the English Wikipedia have their styles hardcoded into the templates. On some other Wikipedias (such as <a href="../../../../it/b/a/b/Wikipedia%7EBabel_d383.html" class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Babel">Italian</a>) the styling is done with CSS classes, which makes the boxes much more cleanly <i>subst</i>able. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 13:31, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Ilmari Karonen explains, this is an example of a situation where something <b>is</b> a 'meta' (nested) template, but it really doesn't cause any notably greater strain to the servers than a non-meta template would. The difference between {{Babel-3 |en-4|de-1|qu-2}} and {{Babel-N |1={{User en-4}}{{User de-1}}{{User qu-2}}}} (or the 'boxtop' / 'boxbottom' method) in terms of server load is infintessimal. I'd like to see the numerous 'Babel-#' templates cut down to just a few, but in terms of server load I really don't see a significant problem with them. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 13:57, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Complete rewrite</span></h2>
<p>I think this policy needs to be re-written. The way it is currently written and applied are completely different and the issues are not spelled out properly. For instance, the policy defines meta-templates as "those that are created and used to keep other templates in a standard format". The 'meta' acutally makes sense for that definition, but it has since become common to call virtually <i>any</i> 'nested' template a 'meta-template'. The original true "meta" templates were generally just double transclusions like those on the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main_page.html" title="Main page">Main page</a> to keep templates being called in a standard size/format. At that time this was just a 'guideline' because there were some concerns that excessive use of such might cause problems if some standard formatting template were changed. Since then <b>much</b> bigger issues have been introduced by templates which don't 'format' anything, but instead handle conditional logic. Technically, these aren't even covered under the policy as currently worded... though they were actually the reason for upgrading it to a policy in the first place.</p>
<p>Further, the root problems driving the policy really have nothing to do with 'meta' or 'nested' templates per se... it is only the utility of those applications which makes them somewhat more likely to run afoul of the server issues. A 'simple' template can cause 'update' and 'rendering' problems every bit as great as any 'nested' template. As such, I'd suggest redoing this policy as something like <b>Use templates wisely</b> and specifically explaining the problems caused by updating templates which are linked from numerous pages and rendering templates which contain alot of template calls and/or parameter conditions. We should be working towards making <i>less server intensive</i> templates in general rather than trying to eliminate a certain (incorrectly defined) class of templates which are often, but not always, the biggest problems. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 12:47, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alright, why don't we cut a comprimise? Create a keyword like __FORCE_SUBST__, and whenever a template including that keyword is used, it is automatically substituted. Then someone who vandalizes, say, <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_wikipedia_fbde.html" title="Template:User wikipedia">Template:User wikipedia</a>, will not cause any damage whatsoever to existing pages nor cause additional server load by invalidating the cache. To make editing easier, templates could offset their content with comments, like &lt;&#160;!-- Begin/End Template:Babel -- &gt; (comment deliberately broken, for obvious reasons). We get to keep one of the most powerful features of Templates while eliminating most of their risk -- a fair tradeoff in my book. --<i><a href="../../../d/c/r/User%7EDCrazy_776f.html" title="User:DCrazy">DCrazy</a></i> <span style="font-size: 8pt"><a href="../../../d/c/r/User_talk%7EDCrazy_1571.html" title="User talk:DCrazy">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DCrazy_4983.html" title="Special:Contributions/DCrazy">contrib</a></span> 14:20, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've seen suggestions for this before and it would absolutely be a good thing to have - particularly for templates which are intended as once-offs ('welcome', 'test1', et cetera). As such... yeah it would be <b>great</b> if someone were to develop such a thing. It would probably do more to reduce server load than all of the 'meta-template removal' work going on now. However, there is another aspect of templates which this wouldn't address. Many, possibly even <i>most</i>, templates are used to create a common format for certain types of information. If those templates are subst'd then any future change to the format has to be made individually in <i>each</i> instance... rather just than the template being adjusted and all existing uses automatically updating. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 14:32, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes but in one of the cases mentioned above the Welcome template for example... even if it changes in the future there is no need to update it on previous talk pages.

<dd>That's a great idea. Some templates are just fine subst'd, or should be in every case, but many should not be. The long-term damage done by subst'ing all those templates and removing their auto-updatability is worse than the short-term damage caused by server load. If we can offset the server load by always substing templates that should always be substed, we can relax about the others. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 15:09, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Using templates mainly for formatting suggests to me that there needs to be better usage of CSS classes for formatting and styling, as mentioned <a href="#On_Babel" title="">above</a> by <a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a>. At present it is easier to create a template to do the formatting than to get anything added to one of the stylesheets as they are protected and the template namespace is not. Looking at common.css, changes are proposed at Wikipedia:Village Pump rather than any specific policy or discussion area. Maybe there should be a specific method whereby rules can be proposed by users, checked by admins to ensure that nothing breaks, that they degrade well and comply with accessible rules and added as per the request. just my €0.02 worth. – <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble"><span style="color:#008040;">Mr</span><span style="color:#007FBF;font-weight:bold">Weeble</span></a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/w/User_talk%7EMrWeeble_bf1b.html" title="User talk:MrWeeble">Talk</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Brit tv</a></small> 15:17, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, a lot of "formatting" issues aren't really formatting issues... {{Locale length}} is kind of both, in that it standardizes the style used for measurements but also provides content above beautification. {{Locale length) is an <b>incredibly</b> easy and obvious candidate for something along the lines of __FORCE_SUBST__. The more complicated a template gets, the less of a candidate it is for forcing substitution. But the great thing is that a lot of templates are complicated on the inside, but their output is not. Take, for example, {{Wikipedia:Babel}}. The source for that is <i>hideous</i>, but its output is a standard wikitable. This brings the question, does subst'ing a template insert its source or its output given its parameters? I really hope it's the former, because that makes all of our problems go away if we force subst'ing on numerous templates. --<i><a href="../../../d/c/r/User%7EDCrazy_776f.html" title="User:DCrazy">DCrazy</a></i> <span style="font-size: 8pt"><a href="../../../d/c/r/User_talk%7EDCrazy_1571.html" title="User talk:DCrazy">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DCrazy_4983.html" title="Special:Contributions/DCrazy">contrib</a></span> 16:56, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A "__FORCE_SUBST__" option has been proposed a few times in the past. The problem seems to be that you can't control where it gets inserted, and the vast majority of templates are on very few watchlists. If someone say added "__FORCE_SUBST__" to a highly-used but rarely-edited/low-watchlisted template, every time a downstream page was edited after that point, the template would be subst'd in. Editors may not notice for hours or days, at which point many articles would no longer be linked to that template. There's not much chance of recovery if that happens. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 18:45, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the proper solution in this case would be to lock the Template namespace from editing by anons, but that's a WHOLE other can of worms. From a strictly technical point of view I think that __FORCE_SUBST__ is a good idea.

<dd>Hrmm. Well, in that case maybe forcing substitution would be an admin-only privilege. That seems to work well with protection/semi-protection. And actually this is where the two problems merge: the technical issue is that meta-templates cause additional server load whenever one of the contributing templates is modified. Plain-old subst won't help since that creates a mess in the page's source and doesn't actually remove the conditions and other things associated with the template, offering zero benefit. The problem increases with the popularity of the meta-template. This catches the attention of admins.</dd>
<dd>But since the only real problem is posed by popular templates, and admins will be more aware of those (meta-)templates than the more obscure ones, giving admins control over forcing substitution (actually pre-rendering, as determined below) would offer a solution for the templates that cause the biggest problem.</dd>
<dd>The only remaining issue is what to do if page X includes force-subst'd template Y, someone vandalizes template Y, and then someone edits page X. This is an unrecoverable situation, which can only be mitigated (preventing anons from editing in the Template namespace, for example) but never eliminated. Proper guidelines would help immensely; templates that are extremely unlikely to change, such as {{Locale length}}, would be great candidates for force-substitution, and would need little to no debate before being implemented as such. --<i><a href="../../../d/c/r/User%7EDCrazy_776f.html" title="User:DCrazy">DCrazy</a></i> <span style="font-size: 8pt"><a href="../../../d/c/r/User_talk%7EDCrazy_1571.html" title="User talk:DCrazy">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DCrazy_4983.html" title="Special:Contributions/DCrazy">contrib</a></span> 19:34, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>BLAST!</b> Apparently subst: copies the template's source, not its output (just tried it on the <a href="../../../s/a/n/WP%7ESandbox_e5a9.html" title="WP:Sandbox">sandbox</a> using {{<a href="../../../x/1/_/Template%7EX1_6cb5.html" title="Template:X1">X1</a>}} which included {{<a href="../../../x/2/_/Template%7EX2_2fe8.html" title="Template:X2">X2</a>}} -- net result was {{X2}} in the source of the sandbox).

<li>I think what you're suggesting is that doing <code>{{X}}</code> would copy the end result of X into the document in all instances, and any changes to X would cause the software to spider through the encyclopedia and update the text. This is a few major problems: it would involve a full-text search of <b>every page of Wikipedia</b>, in <b>all namespaces</b>. Obviously this is not a good idea. Also, if someone changes a template to consist of the word "the", and then changes it to something else, the software will wind up altering every instance of the word "the".

<dd>That's only a little bit crazier than the things people are doing right now.</dd>
<dd>But that's not what I meant anyway. I meant that when a template is updated, the instances in each article's rendered version aren't updated instantaneously, or only updated when the page is edited, or <i>something</i>. Jamesday once suggested that a "feature" could be added to Mediawiki to turn off template transclusion completely during periods of intense server load (like search is turned off sometimes):
<dl>
<dd><i>The short-term technical expedient which is likely to work is adding a switch to turn off template expansion and flipping that switch, causing template text values to be displayed instead of template contents.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So it doesn't seem unlikely to make an intermediate emergency switch that only turns off or staggers the template <i>updating</i> instead. The problem isn't the fact that templates exist, it's that the cache updating, in Jamesday's words, is "all grouped together in one big lump".</dd>
<dd>Any technical kludge that saves the dependencies and structure of the templates while reducing server load would be better than these css-hack/weeblecode/subst'ing-everything-in-sight crocks. If the intermediate "switch" couldn't be written, I'd rather have the template expansion switch written, honestly. Turn off templates completely for short periods of time rather than go through all this fighting, revert warring, horrible kludges, and hostility. I wouldn't be surprised if the revert warring of templates over this page contributes more to the server load than the original problem. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 02:33, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>So basically all that does is replace wikitext with a different language. Users would edit in 'wiki++', which would be compiled to wikitext, which upon first page request would be converted to HTML and cached. That buys us nothing at all. --<i><a href="../../../d/c/r/User%7EDCrazy_776f.html" title="User:DCrazy">DCrazy</a></i> <span style="font-size: 8pt"><a href="../../../d/c/r/User_talk%7EDCrazy_1571.html" title="User talk:DCrazy">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DCrazy_4983.html" title="Special:Contributions/DCrazy">contrib</a></span> 23:15, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My idea would be along the line: Have wiki source to edit (includes template calls). Save expands all templates, store result and build html from that. So templates would only be updated to an article per editor request. Hyper luxory substing.--<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 23:21, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>That seems ridiculously complicated. It would become far too difficult for newbies to edit pages. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 23:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why? The wiki source could be the same as today (with template calls). But we could use meta-templates because they would no longer hurt the servers. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 23:29, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you ban editing X directly, and instead make users edit X/src, and compile that to HTML on demand, how is that different from merely editing X? Currently users edit X, the wikitext gets stored in the DB, and gets compiled to HTML on first access (which is usually right after clicking the Save Changes button). So in effect, all you are doing is adding meta-templates and other good stuff to wikitext directly (whether the resulting set of features is called something else is irrelevant). To tell you the truth that would be the best idea, as the PHP engine would do ifs and stuff far better and faster than the wikitext parser. But barring addition of new tags to wikitext (&lt;if condition=""&gt; and the like -- would be nice and neat and lovely and fast and so on), forcing-static is the best soluition I can see. Wikitext would continue to function exactly as is right now, but the potential damages would be mitigated.
<ul>
<li>Forget about that ugly X/src. That was just a crap solution I used to show my idea. I think it would be worth to spin our ideas to more detail. I also fear we might to some degree misunderstand each other and based on that reject an idea prematurely. What about working together on a page under my user space. For example: User:Ligulem/Lazy templates? I invite you (and anyone interested) to edit with me there. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 23:48, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First of all, this <b>is not</b> policy. No consensus of Wikipedians agreed upon it, and clearly not even a consensus of developers agree upon it. Second of all, the sub-sub-sub templates you speak of (such as {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} should never (or only rarely) be modified). If the issue is only with sub-sub-sub templates, then it's a non-issue as far as I'm concerned.

How can ordinary Wikipedians who nothing about the software deign to talk about making drastic changes to solve performance problems?

Brion also does not comment on Jamesday's main complaint, about page caches becoming invalidated. There is also one other reason, that deeply-nested templates are rarely on more than a couple watchlists, making vandalism harder to watch for. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 02:54, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That's a circular argument. AFAIK the deletion of nested templates at TFD hit full swing when you unilaterally (and without community consensus) promoted this to policy (under the guise of "developer approval"). Clearly not all developers (let alone Brion!) agree this is an issue. Note Brion's response: <i>If someone's advising against "metatemplates" because they're ugly, fragile, and likely to break, listen to them. If someone's advising against them because they "increase server load", ask them for their benchmarks. I'd love to see them.</i>. And I agree, if the argument is that they're ugly/fragile/likely to break, I'd give it some consideration. However, as Brion says, if the argument is that they "increase server load", it's a non-starter right now. If this is so slam-dunk obvious, it's bothersome that someone like Brion wouldn't want to endorse AUM. (But at the same time, he seems willing to consider it if someone will show him benchmarks proving the claims made).</dd>
<dd>Until these issues are resolved, and given the lack of community consensus in making this "policy", I strongly suggest keeping the policy tag off this page. I also suggest, as before, not "enforcing" this until the technical issues have been argued out. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 03:13, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your statements here. Though they have clarified some things, I think a lot of things are still heavily unclear. I have been forced by this policy and important wikipedians to work implement it (which I did working quite hard). I have started doing that by using the proposal of Netoholic, which has had his ArbCom ban lifted to push this to the "misguided masses". Now, could you please guide us? Abstract statements do not help here. We have ben said to be "wanna be" coders because we put up <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">template:qif</a>. Now we use the trick most favored by Netoholic as described in my doc. I agree that qif is ugly and I also agree that the CSS is ugly and I also agree that the weeble code trick is ugly.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">General comments</span></h2>
<p>It is worth noting that Brion continues to condemn meta-templates for being ugly and fragile - which they are - and falls miles short of endorsing them. It is questionable whether "should policy be crafted to reduce server strain" is something that falls within the realm of things the developers get to set automatically for us. It remains the case that Jamesday has said what he has said, and he did say to depricate qif, not start using more meta-templates, and that meta-templates cause noticable server load.</p>
<p>Since depricating the meta-templates we have has been COMPLETELY HELLISH, until this actually gets sorted out so that the developers are on the same page, since meta-templates do not add any functionality that can't be achieved other ways, since they are messy, since they are fragile, and since there remains a fair chance that they're a significant server problem, we still should not be using them, because we are sensible people who like playing it safe when it comes to asking if we should make big messes that take days to clean up. And when Brion and Jamesday present a unified answer, we can deal with that. But until then, we have clear comments from the lead database admin, and questions about whether that's the best reason to kill meta-templates, or whether they should just be killed for more superficial reasons from Brion. This is not grounds to add a giant box to the top of the page, and it is especially not grounds to start using meta-templates actively again. In fact, doing so would be SUPREMELY stupid, since there are clear alternatives. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:53, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Those 'clear alternatives' are equally 'ugly and fragile'... and not all that clear. Which is a good portion of why the efforts to force them through have been 'completely hellish'.

<dd>In my opinion, it's the most important reason. It's the main reason I cite when I ask for meta-templates to be removed. Where they're unnecessary ({{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">Main</a>}} is an obvious example), they shouldn't be used because their effect can be achieved so much more easily in another way. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 19:53, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Several things, off the top of my head. First, it's using a CSS hack to hide structure elements, which can fail for text browsers, plaintext renderings of articles, and any HTML display of the article that doesn't use the stylesheet on this site. This harms both the primary site's accessibility and offsite reuse of material. Second, as you can see its source is simply very ugly; it would benefit from a conditional or array construct. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 20:28, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>What Brion said. Apart from that, it's really an unnecessary template. How hard is it to write a one line message to get the point across? It will almost always be more useful to the reader. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 20:30, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Um... let me just see if I understand this right Sam. You agree with what Brion said? That the current <b>non</b> meta version of <a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">Template:Main</a> is very ugly, that it is harmful to accessibility and reuse due to the CSS hack method, and that it would benefit from a 'conditional or array construct'... which traditionally has been accomplished using meta-templating. So, would it be better to go back to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Main&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=31504421" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Main&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=31504421" rel="nofollow">meta</a> version?

<dd>Once again, thank you for pointing this out. This is actually a bad example, because it shouldn't really be a template at all.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What I need from you</span></h2>
<p>What I'm going to need from you guys is some feedback on what is and isn't needed/wanted. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditional "if"-like constructs can be very easily done in the software, and should be more reliable than wacky template tricks. What other constructs are needed that don't boil down to a conditional include?</li>
<li>Are there any genuinely useful constructs that would break if we limited the depth of includes to, say, two levels of templates? (Article -&gt; Template1 -&gt; Template2)</li>
<li>We're never going to turn templating into a full-fledged programming language, but template constructs can sometimes benefit from array-like data where each item is processed identically. What are some examples of attempts to do this, and how could we more cleanly replace them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that clean, legible use at the article source text level should be paramount. Scary complex templates can be quite intimidating for non-technical editors -- and even for highly technical editors who aren't familiar with a given 'extreme' template.

<dd>Brion, that's really great. I think the minimum set we need is:
<ul>
<li>A string expression function "if". It takes two string parameters S1 and S2. The resulting value should be S2 if S1 is non-empty, the empty string otherwise. I do not care about syntax and name of the function.</li>
<li>An expression function "not" with one parameter S. Returns a non-empty string if S is empty, the empty string otherwise.</li>
<li>An expression function "or" with two parameters S1 and S2. Returns a non-empty string if S1 or S2 are non-empty.</li>
<li>An expression function "and" with two parameters S1 and S2. Returns a non-empty string if S1 and S2 are non-empty.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The functions should be able to be nested. If needed we can limit the levels of if's. I have not seen more than an if inside an if. So I would set a limit to four levels (if needed).</dd>

<dd>Well, yes and no. We already <b>have</b> a 'simple if' feature based on the 'blank parameter' trick. An example of this can be seen at <a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELanguage_familycolor_3ded.html" title="Template:Language/familycolor">Template:Language/familycolor</a>. Because an empty parameter ('|if=') is passed in we can evaluate to see which other parameter exists and only display results for that one... a switch built on a simple 'if exists'. That <i>can</i> be used to replace pretty much every meta-template we have currently... but people have been very resistant to doing so. Largely because it involves changing existing template calls (as any new conditional implementation presumably would as well). However, it is also just a long way to go to get some results... for instance, you can do a 'not' condition if you have some parameter which is always passed by using {{{if{{{requ{{{optional|}}}ired|}}}|Text to display if 'required' parameter exists and 'optional' parameter does not}}}... but if you don't have any parameters which are always required for that template there's no way to do a 'not'. Likewise, the 'switch' example above has to perform the 'if' logic over and over again. You <i>can</i> do most things with a 'simple if', but we've already got that and while <i>possible</i> it isn't always easy/pretty. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 23:36, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made an example implementation for some extended syntax at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:AzaToth/Logic" class="extiw" title="m:User:AzaToth/Logic">m:User:AzaToth/Logic</a>. My primary objective was to make a fast parser with monomal overhead. If none of the extended constructs are used the only overhead is a simple strpos. Othervise is rather simple in it's parsing, it just split the string and run it throught a switch statement. My reason to use a different syntax than ordinary wiki syntax is becaus then I can ignore the semantic of the wikicode and use the extended syntax as a preparser.

<dd>I think AzaToth's implementation ideas above would make it possible to do virtually anything we currently do (and some things we don't) with a single template level (Article &gt; Template). That said, even if it were possible to do everything with one level of transclusion (and no CSS hack or blank parameter trick) I'd think we would want to keep at least a few deeper levels available... even if they are not 'needed' they are still 'useful'. Without deeper transclusion levels the template functionality would have to be 'cloned' for each new template rather than just calling an existing template. Things like <a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7EClear_a0ad.html" title="Template:Clear">Template:clear</a> could be used in articles, but not in other templates. That's a simplistic (and largely unneccessary) example, but the concept extends to all sorts of formatting/utility templates. The contents of <a href="../../../o/h/_/Template%7EOh_My_Goddess_Infobox-Generic_Text_2cb4.html" title="Template:Oh My Goddess Infobox-Generic/Text">Template:Oh My Goddess Infobox-Generic/Text</a> could just be written out each time, but making it a template allows it to be called multiple times by two different templates... simplifying the template instruction code considerably while keeping the format consistent. Et cetera. Not required. Same capabilities can be done without the second/third/et cetera template layers, but it is often 'easier' / 'prettier' if you use sub-templates. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 21:28, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. It's good to use a simple formatting/heavy markup/functionality template inside another to keep all the related templates consistent and easy to edit. Just like you would use include statements to put standard libraries in a bit of source code instead of typing all the standard functions in by hand, or use functions to perform the same operation over and over instead of retyping it manually each time.</dd>
<dd>It removes the "maintenance nightmare" of editing each template manually to change their style or fix a browser-specific problem with the markup, for instance.</dd>

<dd>This is a very good proposal which I fully support. Thank you Phil. As for the simplicity and ease of reading of template code I would propose, if possible, to add logical functions as "not" "or" and "and" at least. These can be mimicked if we have that qif (but needs the "else" capability with empty "then" part, which is not supported by the actual qif hack template), but that leads again to unreadable template code. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELigulem_df3a.html" title="User talk:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 08:47, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can imagine <i>plenty</i> of uses for more flexible logic, but understand the 'Turing complete' concerns and would be willing to settle for something like the above. That said, more 'intelligent' templates could actually <b>reduce</b> server load and template complexity. For instance, the mathematical functions AzaToth suggested could do things like the 'meters to feet' conversion template as a simple one step calculation rather than a massive template nesting or huge parameter switch. Essentially, the simpler the codeset the more complex the templates need to be to produce the same functionality... and the more likely (some) people are to say that templates are <i>too</i> complex and launch crusades against them. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 12:34, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From my point of view the main thing that I think is most urgently needed is a conditional in the MediaWiki template language. I managed to implement that using ordinary templates midway through last year, and the result was hard to maintain (any subtractions or additions broke the template on multiple pages) and also very hard to input things into without precisely following instructions. The version with QIF functionality looks a little daunting at first when the template source code is viewed, but that is why {{esoteric}} is on the template page as a warning against editing the source without understanding what is going on. The implementation on the main namespace pages is clean, consistent and easy to understand. The QIF version is easier to maintain, since additions do not automatically break the template.</p>
<p>I would say that main thing that we are look for here is ease of use in the main namespace. That is where most newbies will edit and if we can get rid of table markup there and replace it with easy to understand template markup then it will actually be a boon to newbies. I would doubt that many newbies particularly know or care about the template namespace, and by the time that they do know and care they have generally acquired enough of an understanding of MediaWiki syntax and markup to have a decent shot at editing things without breaking even complicated templates.</p>
<p>Netoholic seems to be engaged on a crusade about this matter. Since the main pillar of support for the crusade has been significantly undermined Netoholic has even started to claim "ownership" over pages, which is against Wikipedia policy in and of itself. That is a serious problem.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if IF functionality was incorporated at a language level in MediaWiki template markup asap, and I look forward to the day that it is implemented (since Netoholic aside there seems to be a consensus that it is a needed feature). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 13:31, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The good point that David has just brought up is that conditionals often allow us to make the in-article template call a lot cleaner. Of course, the price is paid in the wikitext of the template. However, people are more likely to view and edit the wikitext of the template call rather than the template itself. For example, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELanguage_39a6.html" title="Template:Language">template:language</a> has a box to display the language's <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_families.html" title="Language families">genetic classification</a>. Before the use of conditionals, the entire family tree was plugged into a single parameter with lots of <tt>&amp;nbsp;</tt> in the template call to provide formatting. Conditionals allowed us to move all of the formatting into the template and provide each line of the family tree with a separate parameter. Conditionals were needed because the number of lines in the family tree differs from language to language. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 13:54, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Surprise, surprise, Netoholic has reverted my reintroduction of QIF to Ship table claiming in the edit summary comments that, "developer comments still ask us to avoid meta-templates - they are ugly and fragile". I have posted to Netoholic's talk page pointing a version of Ship table from before QIF came along. THAT was ugly and fragile. The current conditionals, within the syntax of the MediaWiki template language and table code, are elegant in their implementation. I would not want to touch the conditional templates themselves, but once they are feature complete (and at the moment that is pretty much the case for those that remain), they should be protected until those that are appropriate can be hardcoded into the system. I agree with those who say that we don't want to be Turing-complete, but it is a tribute to those who originally conceived the template syntax that we can even talk in those terms!</dd>

<dd>Think Babel boxes. There are a few different ways to construct them which map directly to this scenario;
<ol>
<li>{{<a href="../../../b/o/x/Template%7EBoxboxtop_8af7.html" title="Template:Boxboxtop">boxboxtop</a>}}{{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_en-1_1d89.html" title="Template:User en-1">User en-1</a>}}{{<a href="../../../b/o/x/Template%7EBoxboxbottom_08fe.html" title="Template:Boxboxbottom">boxboxbottom</a>}} - Same structure as the above; separate templates for top, bottom, and rows. The rows then just get called however many times are needed. Requires multiple template calls.</li>
<li>{{<a href="../../../b/a/b/Template%7EBabel-1_092c.html" title="Template:Babel-1">Babel-1</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../b/a/b/Template%7EBabel-2_6e19.html" title="Template:Babel-2">Babel-2</a>}}, et cetera - Separate templates for each variable number of rows. By setting a 'count' type parameter you could set up a call to {{Babel-{{{count}}} |parameters}} which would always call the correct sub-template. However, the count and the number of parameters passed need to be kept in synch or you get rows being ignored or blank rows being displayed.</li>
<li>{{<a href="../../../b/a/b/Template%7EBabel-N_ba4a.html" title="Template:Babel-N">Babel-N</a>}} - Similar to item 1 above except that the rows are passed as a parameter to a template which then builds the top and bottom around them. Just as long as option one, but all the template calls are in one long stream.</li>
<li>{{<a href="../../../b/a/b/Template%7EBabel-X_c830.html" title="Template:Babel-X">Babel-X</a>}} - Similar to item 2 above except that it adds conditional logic to suppress any unused rows. Requires use of 'qif', '|if=', 'display: none', or other conditional logic to suppress the extra rows.</li>
</ol>

<dd>Netoholic, the CSS hack is not a viable option. It is causing problems for people with Lynx browsers, people with screen-readers, people on other language Wikipedias who copy over templates but haven't updated the common.css, et cetera. It is a complete mess. That leaves 'qif' style meta-templates or the '|if=' blank parameter trick... and you've ranted about both of those often enough for it to be clear you aren't advocating them here. So the only other options are built-in conditionals or scrapping hundreds of templates which make life much easier for the users in favor of doing everything manually. The latter is a non-starter... so get behind built-in conditional logic, 'qif', or '|if=', because one (or more) of those <b>is</b> going to be used extensively going forward. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 12:26, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Solution: Has already been solved. Blank (hiddenStructure) classification rows are presently used and are perfect for that template. Looks only mildly large on lynx, but that has been improved lately. The rate at which that is being accepted by editors is amazing, and I anticipate one day that a bot will make a run against the articles and convert them all to it.

<dd>Note also my comment on reverting it back to the meta-template version which worked fine long before you came along, and rendered wonderfully in Lynx without CSS. Also note that the person copying it to the Turkish Wikipedia had to have the deal with CSS hacks explained to him before he could get the template to work there... expect to meet a lot of resistance with these CSS hacks, let alone any attempts at running a bot to mass convert anything. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 13:35, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, you start out claiming that conditional logic is not needed and then, when faced with proof that it is, claim that the 'hiddenStructure' CSS hack solves the issue... despite the numerous problems with it. Yes, after adjustments were made to get the CSS version of taxobox working right in CSS compatible browsers it has been widely used... which doesn't mean anything. The 'qif' template is widely used too... anything which works for most people will be widely used. The 'qif' approach has the advantage of being easier to follow and working for <b>more</b> people than 'hiddenStructure'. People have used 'hiddenStructure' <i>only</i> because it has been claimed that they <i>have</i> to. Now that they don't... there is <b>no</b> good reason to use something which doesn't <i>work</i> right. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 13:51, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you use the more recent "clever" method where you trash the HTML tag attribute, you get rid of some of the crap being output, but you place a burden on Tidy (or alternately risk outputting non-standard XHTML).

<dd>I think we should stop fiddle around with this page until we know more from Brion. Ugliness and fragility is not that helpful as a guideline. The policy tag is gone and I'm also happy with the removal of the guideline tag. I think that's it for the moment. If we edit here too much we just end in another useless content dispute. The comments about meta-templates from Brion and his expression to implementent conditionals in MediaWiki speek for itself.

<dd>I'm not comfortable with that. Brion is a paid developer. He's paid to make Wikimedia work well. <i>Of course</i> he is going to defend how well Wikimedia is working because anything else reflects on him. Jamesday is a database developer and knows full well how "costly" database reads are over other operations. Both agree that we should reduce template calls where necessary. The developers are not disagreeing - Jamesday describes the theory behind it all, and he's right. Brion wants to be shown proof that Wikipedia is <i>actually</i> being affected, and he's right. Both are in total agreement that complex code should be avoided for the editor's sake.

<dd>Brion has <i>specifically</i> stated that editorial decisions should not be driven by speculative technical considerations. If you think that a specific nested template is ugly, badly written, etc., then that is a perfectly reasonable ground to oppose it. But, given the new clarification, it is no longer reasonable to say to get rid of all nested templates simply on the ground that they are nested. It is simply an editorial decision at this point, not policy. There was a community consensus that we would do what was necessary to protect the servers; there was never a consensus that nested templates were bad in and of themselves. The only justification for banning them as a policy was that database dev <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">James Day</a> asked us to stop, and this has since been seriously questioned by the lead developer. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 21:24, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Unfortunately getting changes into the source is a damn hostile process.

<dd>I seem to recall that not so long ago you were defining "meta-templates" to include any conditional template, however implemented. Perhaps I misunderstood. In any case the arguments in favor or agaist both nested tempaltes and conditional templates seem reasonably to belong here as much as anywhere. I note that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConditional_expressions_6259.html" title="Wikipedia:Conditional expressions">Wikipedia:Conditional expressions</a> is at the moment simply a how-to page on implemeting the CSS Hiden structure method of implemtign limited conditional functionality. This makes it IMO a poor place to discuss the merits and costs of conditional structures in general, and of implementing such in the mediawiki software, unless the current content is moved to some other location (which might be a good idea, as it currently gives the incorrect impression that Hidden Structure is the only way to achieve such effects).

<dd>(<i>after edit conflict</i>): Actually i thought at the time that it was being interpreted as more final and definate than the wording of Jamesday's coment justified. Others also thought so and said so. But the reason I used "misunderstanding" is that that interpetation seems to have been incorrect, which may have been casued by unclear communication on the part of Jamesday, or a disagreement on this subject betweem Jameday and Brion, or some other failure of communication or intrepretation. I presume that Netholic and others who took Jamesday's statement as a basis for applying apolicy tag were acting in perfect good faith, accodign to their best understanding of the evidence at hand. Whether that was fully justified by the evidence then at hand is now moot, since we have Brion's later statemetn, which contradicts the previosu interpretation on which a policy of "all conditional and most nested templates must be removed" was based. IMO this page should now be used to give ourt current guideleines and sugestions on when and how to use conditional and nested templates, adn when and why to avoid their use. As such it ought to reflect consensus, or if there is no consensus, all significant points of view.

All we had to go on were his statements, which he didn't follow up on, and which did not mandate any policy or claim the support of all the developers or set out a clear statement of what should be done. Most were of the "I think we should avoid things as a temporary expedient"/"using excess resources is bad" flavor. Netoholic made up his own interpretation of those statements, and ArbCom members apparently interpreted this as a clear absolute mandate from <i>all</i> of the developers and gave him license to do whatever he wants.</dd>

<dd>Netoholic, if you want this page to remain a straightforward argument against meta-templates, I see one clear way to do this. We can mark it with a {{rejected}} tag, given its lack of community consensus, and you may express your opinions there. (Alternatively, we could userfy it to your user space.) Then, after that, we could create a more general page, maybe <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_guidelines_08e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Template guidelines">Wikipedia:Template guidelines</a> or something of that nature, where the meta-template issue would be handled in a more reasonable manner in accordance with community consensus. My concern with your above statements is that you seem to be attempting to force a rule against meta-templates into guideline or policy status despite the lack of any community consensus to this effect. I realize that you had a <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">good-faith</a> reason to believe that this was what the developers wanted, but that now appears highly questionable and has been explicitly denied by the lead developer.

<dd>I don't want to own this page... trust me, it's been full of grief. What I do want is for people who <i>like</i> meta-templates to document their reasons elsewhere to prevent conflict. It is perfectly reasonable for pages that document differing views to be in Wikipedia: space. Jamesday, Brion, and several other editors have expressed the view that meta-templates should be avoided (whether for server-related reasons or "ugliness and fragility"), so this isn't a personal essay - it is now a guideline proposal. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 21:51, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I had a thought, and while I'm sure I'll regret sharing it:</p>
<p>&lt;span style="display: no{{{subst:test|}}}ne; speak: no{{{subst:test|}}}ne;"&gt;Text to be displayed if 'test' is not blank.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p>How does this stack up in terms of accesibility? No wacky class names and/or stripping out of wacky classes, doesn't require changes to the 'common.css' (or whatever) of each place it is ported to, et cetera... but still sending stuff and then retroactively saying 'ignore that text behind the curtain'. It's not the prettiest code, but it works. Can be presented slightly nicer with the form display: {{{subst:test|none}}};, but then it doesn't work if test is set blank ('|test=') or if it is actually set to the word 'none'. Thoughts? Feelings? Rotten vegetables? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 21:03, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't understand—is that the actual code generated? Will it be "display:none" for hiding the text and "display:no{{{subst:test|}}}ne" or "display:notestne" otherwise? Neither is a valid value for a CSS display or speak property, so the page's CSS will not validate; results in any particular browser are unpredictable. In terms of accessibility: hiding text with CSS is <i>still</i> not the same as removing it. This is the same technique as the other CSS hack, which has been shown to fail in older versions of Jaws and in Lynx, and that's without doing any formal testing at all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Folks: the page's content is in the HTML. Anything done with CSS is just styling, and it is completely optional.

<dd>Sorry, I should have explained better. The information above is an example line of code for making text conditional. If the 'test' parameter is not set or is set blank then the span tag evaluates to: &lt;span style="display: none; speak:none;"&gt; and everything between that and the &lt;/span&gt; tag is suppressed. If the 'test' parameter is set to 'frogs' or anything else then it gets inserted like so: &lt;span style="display: nofrogsne; speak: nofrogsne;"&gt;... which is not a valid style and thus does nothing - allowing the text to appear/be spoken. An example of this in use can be seen at <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_Sandbox_a017.html" title="User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox">User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox</a>... there I have set up a test1 parameter which is set and a test 2 parameter which is not. Each parameter is checked by the method above and text generated if the parameter is set. Only the Test1 text should be displayed... the Test2 text and all of the logic suppressing it should be 'invisible'. This differs from the earlier 'CSS hack' in that it doesn't require an update to the stylesheet for special classnames or need 'Tidy' to strip out the bad classnames. Obviously the goal was to see if this option would <i>work</i> with the browsers/screen-readers which 'hiddenStructure' breaks on... the <span>tag has been incorporated into HTML 4, but I don't know if that is recognized by these browsers or not. As for a code implementation of conditionals... when it exists I'll use it. In the meantime the 'hiddenStructure' CSS hack has <b>already</b> been implemented on <i>dozens</i> of templates and I think we ought to be replacing it as quickly as possible. Efforts to do so by restoring the meta-template versions and/or using '|if=' have led to revert wars and other nastiness. Hence my questions about whether this option meets accessibility criteria. It clearly makes less of a mess than 'hiddenStructure', but I don't know if it would still fail in some circumstances. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 12:34, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</span>

<dd>Right, there's nothing inherently wrong with styles, it's just the principle that they don't change the content of a page, merely style it. Local styles in a style attribute override an imported style sheet, but are still not guaranteed to be applied. HTML should be authored with its semantics in mind. For example, a table has structure, a table header (th) labels table contents, but span and div tags in particular are meant to be semantically meaningless and used for subdivision and styling only.</dd>

<dd>True, it can work acceptably when the revealed text is obviously a list of empty fields, and may be acceptable as an <i>interim</i> solution for a technical problem <i>which we know will be solved</i>. But there are two different aspects in which this is still poor practice:
<ol>
<li>The principle of adding a layer of HTML and CSS code to hide inadequate template output: unnecessary complexity, fragility, bloat, misuse of standards.</li>
<li>The principle of fixing it for the majority of sighted visual browser users, but saying it's "good enough" for the disabled or users of alternative browsers: not real accessibility, could be interpreted as disrespectful, easily extended to cases where it really matters.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>If having a list of empty fields in an infobox really is good enough, then why don't we skip the hack, and just show those fields in visual browsers? This would put everyone on as equal a footing as possible, and helps remind us that something still needs to be fixed properly. The answer, of course, is that it really <i>isn't</i> good enough, but we choose to ignore it because it only makes the experience worse for a minority. This is especially sad, because the only affect on us is that it would look kind of ugly, but for some disabled users who already have to overcome difficulties using the Internet, it makes it even harder. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a> <a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a> <small>2006-01-25 17:29 Z</small></i></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Conditionals in codeset</span></h2>
<p>I was reviewing the different ideas for implementing conditional logic in the codeset and noticed a common issue which should be considered. They all put the conditional identifier in the template <b>call</b>. This is similar to the current '|if=' parameter method and will have the same issues. Namely, it is increasing the complexity (granted by a relatively small amount) on the <b>article</b> side and it would require all existing template calls to be updated. If possible it would be better to implement the conditionals on the <b>template</b> side to avoid these two issues. For instance, we could make {{{if|{{{A}}}}}}, {{{ifnot|{{{A}}}}}}, {{{and|{{{A}}}|{{{B}}}}}} 'magic word parameters' available to every template to evaluate (respectively) whether parameter 'A' exists, whether 'A' does not exist, and whether both 'A' and 'B' exist. Et cetera. Same concepts, but I think it would be <i>much</i> better to have all the logic on the template side to avoid needing to teach general users how to set up conditionals <b>and</b> having to update all the existing calls. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 12:41, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The format really doesn't matter, but keeping with the idea of basing it on a 'magic parameter' setup it would actually be something like: {{{if{{{A|}}}|Text to show if 'A' exists}}}, {{{ifnot{{{A|}}}|Text to show if 'A' does not exist}}}, {{{and{{{A|}}}{{{B|}}}|Text to show if 'A' and 'B' exist}}}. However, the markup could be done any which way ({{{if|{{{A}}}|Text to show if 'A' exists}}} or ##purple#A#Text to show if 'A' exists)... I wasn't trying to show a complete markup system here.

<dd>I still feel I haven't synced my slow stupid brain onto your idea (which does not mean your idea is bad or should be changed - I just can't say anything about it if I haven't understood it completely). I have especially problems with your <i>"They all put the conditional identifier in the template call"</i> (scratching my head). Very strange. If we take Phil's proposal for a qif function in MediaWiki: I think this <i>is</i> intended to be used in, for example, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> (my beloved example :-) instead of calls to that much debated qif. So as soon as we have a MediaWiki-built-in qif we just need to change template book reference, <i>not</i> the calls to book reference. I do not think that a single <i>article</i> that includes book reference would need to be changed.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reverted again</span></h2>
<p>I really don't understand what it takes in order to make an edit here. I am really feeling like shit because I spent a long time on a rewrite, which removed Jamesday's comments about how a pages are handled, reorganized the page, concentrated several ideas down, and added a section describing problems with all three conditional methods. I feel like shit because it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=37420660&amp;oldid=37419101" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=37420660&amp;oldid=37419101" rel="nofollow">reverted</a> within 10 minutes. It is very hard to assume good faith when people snap-revert like that. I doubt there was even enough time for him to read it, let alone see what had changed. Nobody else has worked on this in six days, and if there were specific objections, the article is editable by anyone or you could bring those objections here.

<dd>Obviously the problem is that we disagree on what the page should say. You decreased the 'slant' of the page, but is still very much present. Note that 'qif' and '|if=' are listed as 'not useable with subst:'... but 'hiddenStructure' <i>isn't</i>... when in reality it has exactly the same problem with evaluated parameters. Or that '|if=' is described as "often <i>very</i> hard to understand". For comparison:</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
|if= version
|- valign=top {{{if{{{superphylum|}}}|
! Superphylum:
&lt;td&gt; {{{superphylum|}}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;{{{superphylum_authority|}}}&lt;/small&gt;}}}

CSS version
|- valign=top class{{{superphylum|}}}="hiddenStructure"
! Superphylum:
| {{{superphylum|}}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;{{{superphylum_authority|}}}&lt;/small&gt;
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>Seems like a vanishingly small difference to me... and that's using table structure, where '|if=' is weakest. Make it conditional formatting styles instead and hiddenStructure gets <i>very</i> messy in comparison. The page should mention that there is already discussion of a built-in Wiki conditional method to solve these problems. Also the 'vandalism' and 'page update' issues really have little to do with meta-templates per se... single templates linked to the same number of pages are equally vulnerable to either issue. That ought to be explained so people don't do alot of work to 'de-meta' templates for no real gain.</dd>
<dd>However, ultimately the issue here is whether we listen to Brion when he says that we shouldn't be making policy (or 'guideline') decisions based on hypothetical server load. He has said that if/when it becomes an issue it would be dealt with on the software side. This page inherently attempts to deal with it (presuming that it <i>exists</i>) on the user side. I'd rather see a page which describes the potential issues around templates in general and the pros/cons of various methods than this repackaged 'meta-templates are evil' presentation. I've seen ways to bring Wikipedia as a whole to a grinding halt with templates that wouldn't require a single 'meta' (nested) layer. In some cases removing meta-templates could actually be 'harmful'. It should be about understanding how templates work so informed decisions can be made. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 23:22, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you read my rewrite, I dramatically reduced the scary "server load" text.

<dd>This is an editorial decision, however, and it is one that the community consensus appears to be against.

I look at each situation as it comes up and decide what I think is the best course of action. I also ask that everyone refrain from speaking on behalf of the "community consensus".

<dd>For the sake of our non-template-geeky editors... life without conditionals is preferable in my opinion. I do not want to see the template namespace gain some "elite" status where only the privileged few can make a template or even make a change. It's already happening on some pages. Templates should be very simple contructs. This "consensus" you're so fond of citing is the result of several very clever folks converging on this talk page. The only thing <i>I</i> think about is how many people out there will stop creating, maintaining, correcting, and improving templates because they've become too complex. If I could convince the developers to even remove the default parameter function, I would. It's led to no ending of headaches in this namespace, which was already a maintenance nightmare. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 07:48, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"<i>For the sake of our non-template-geeky editors</i>". Ah. And no doubt <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">the lurkers support you in email</a>, too. Look - article editors outnumber template editors by a significant margin. And, ultimately, the articles are what Wikipedia is all about. Using conditionals, we can make articles easier to edit (by increasing the flexibility and ease of use for infoboxes, etc.), at the cost of making some templates (arguably) more difficult to edit. This is a tradeoff we should make without hesitation. If someone wants to edit the formatting of a complicated template and doesn't feel comfortable wrestling with the code, then they can ask on the Talk page for assistance from someone more technically minded. The alternative is to put the burden on article editors, which is far more onerous. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 07:57, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neto, your public position has in various places and at various times been that we should "avoid using <b>templates</b>", particularly in the context of citing sources and references (and IIRC infoboxes). It is therefore difficult to imagine that this is not part of your apparent crusade against the use of templates, given that the templates against which you have railed most strongly just happen to be those which use condition syntax most heavily.

<dd>In fact, this is not true. Brion did <i>not</i> say "avoid using meta-templates". He said "try to avoid ugly and fragile templates, and let me worry about the server load issues." (Not an exact quote, but this is the essence of what he said in several places, including <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>.) The question, now, is whether it's more "ugly or fragile" to (A) use a conditional template like {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}}, (B) use CSS hacks for optional data hiding, or (C) fork templates into two or more versions and get rid of the conditionals entirely. You favor approach C. However, this is not the community consensus. The consensus for now appears to be that we should use (A) for now, and that hopefully we will soon have real conditionals embedded in the MediaWiki engine so that no hacks have to be used to get them. Approach C seems to me, as a programmer, to be horrible coding practice, and I know of few coders who would disagree with this. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 04:08, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(C) defeats the whole purpose of templates (especially with the amount of forking that would probably need to be done to cover all the possibilities). It also adds complexities for regular editors (keeping track of the various forks). And when it's time to update the appearance or functionality of a group of forked templates? Further complexity because you need to update all the forks as well.

<dd>First of all, Sam Korn and Snowspinner are not developers at all (AFAIK), so their opinions should be given the same respect as those of any other editor - no more, no less. Citing them as authorities holds little meaning. We're already aware of Jamesday's statements, but Brion's claims appear to run counter to his, and Brion is, after all, the lead developer. Furthermore, even taking Jamesday's statements at face value, "reducing" does not mean "eliminating", and if there is no other effective way to get the effect we need, it's not an "unnecessary" use of server resources. I agree we shouldn't use nested templates just for the hell of it. But we already <i>have</i> "thought twice" - and three, and four, and five times - about them. For some things, you need conditionals. This can be done with CSS hacks, but that creates accessibility problems for some users, and generates ugly code. It can be done via {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}}, which is probably the least bad option we have open to us now. Ultimately, it will be done via server-side implementation of conditional functions, and this is the optimal solution. In the meantime, we'll muddle through with what we have, and there's no point in trying to limit the use of our most effective current tool. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 07:32, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If I were to use your rationale, that the opinions of these editors somehow weighs less than the developers, when we're talking strictly about usability vs. server issues. You joined WP in May 2005, so how exactly should I rank your opinion on this matter? Where does my opinion rank, since I've got a couple thousand edits just in the Template space? On your other point... it is a fallacy to think that there is any "need" for conditionals or meta-templates. Wikipedia managed just fine before last October (?) when the parameter default function was first put in, leading to things like Template:Qif. The truth is that it's only <i>because</i> that function now exists that we're <i>inventing</i> new ways to use it. Some of those ways are good, and some are very bad. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 07:48, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The way the community "managed" it before that was to create multiple templates. That caused an even <i>bigger</i> maintainence problem when something had to be changed, since redundant changes had to be made to a bunch of different boxes one at a time. Now that we have a better way, we ought to use it. And, again, none of this increases complexity for article editors in any way. Wiki-syntax is not rocket science, with or without conditionals. And of course people are going to invent new ways to use the functionality we have. I can't think of a single programming platform where that wasn't the case. Was the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_64_demos.html" title="Commodore 64 demos">C-64 demo scene</a> evil?

Your grand examples don't apply because, as Wikipedians, we are not computer programmers for Wikipedia. Several of us may be in real life, but that only means we have to understand and plan for the significant majority that are historians, linguists, biologists, etc. Yes, we ought to use templates in simple ways for the benefit of those non-technical editors among us. Using conditionals goes against that premise - wikitext is not a programming language, it is <a href="../../../m/a/r/Markup_language.html" title="Markup language">markup</a>. Let's get creative, and actually talk about solutions to specific templates and decide on a strategy for each one on it's own accord. Sometimes, two templates instead of one is a fine option. Sometimes, using <i>no</i>template is the right way to go. The community has not expressed a desire for conditionals... as far as I see, only about five people on this talk page have -- five people that are probably excellent programmers, but are missing perspective on how such template monstrosities are completely unintellible to the average Wikipedian. I fault myself for making things more complex than necessary, just as much as I fault you all. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 17:14, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I've commented before: 99% of "conditionals" and "nested templates" and who knows what else is essentially doing the same thing "hiddenStructure" is. In fact, we can probably narrow it even more: the overwhelming majority of conditional use is in place to hide empty rows in infoboxes.</dd>
<dd>Therefore, the vast majority of users—particularly non-programmer ones—don't really care what the underlying implementation is; they just want their infoboxes to work properly. The hiddenStructure method has some flaws (discussed at great length all over the 'pedia now); these could be easily solved by introducing a server-side version of it. —<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lok</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">s</font></a><a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">hin</a> 17:51, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely disagree. Conditional logic is <b>most</b> important for those who are not programmers. In the past they would have to learn table markup and attempt the impossible task of maintaining consistency across dozens or even hundreds of pages. Now they just need to know how to fill out the template call with the right parameters. All of the table rows and CSS formatting is handled by the templates... thanks in large part to conditional logic. Two templates is <b>not</b> better than one for the users... because then they have to know the names and parameters of the two different templates and when to use each rather than always being able to use one. The more different templates they have to call the <b>more</b> like a programming language it is for the <b>users</b>. Greater 'programming flexibility' <i>in</i> the templates leads <b>directly</b> to less 'programming' being required to <i>use</i> the features. The extreme of your position would be to eliminate templates entirely... at which point all those general users have to learn table markup and HTML/CSS formatting code... all of which is in the article itself as a big mess. Adding templates removed the need for general users to learn that stuff. Adding conditional logic to templates removed the need for general users to understand an array of closely related template forks. Yes, the general users have a hard time understanding the code itself of complex templates... but that's no different than when they had a hard time understanding tables and formats directly in the articles. Templates have removed the complexity from the article space and consolidated it into fewer locations for easier management. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 17:57, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Behind the people that take care to work on <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> and its implications are a whole bunch of wikipedians that actually do like to use simple templates like those that actually contain conditionals. The use of qif makes these templates actually much simpler as any set of sub-templates that need to be put together to get something useful. It is also amazing how fast people understand how to use qif and those that are interested also are fast in understanding how qif is implemented, though <i>that is not needed</i> in order to use any template that uses qif. You simply waste a lot of time of editors with your WP:AUM pushing, especially now that Brion has it downgraded to an essay. I see people going willy nilly all around on wikipedia and doing stupid downgrades of templates rooted in your silly <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>. Brion has stated that we will get conditionals in code and as far as I and others can see you are the <i>only person opposing that</i>. Please stop your pushing of WP:AUM now and your crusade against templates and your pushing of that ridiculous CSS against Brion and consensus. You are clearly disruptive to Wikipedia with this of your stampedes. I acknowledge that you are very intelligent and that you nearly got your message through with that WP:AUM. But now is the time to stop. If you don't do this now I must assume that you act in bad faith. This is about writing an encyclopedia not about pushing one's own technical POV, which is not based by developer or community consensus. Stop it now. You are simply wasting our time. Finally accept that Brion has vaporized your "beloved" WP:AUM and stop hurting the servers by revert warring on the templates. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 17:58, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd still like to get some basic conditionals into the software, along with hopefully some better definitions on _how_ things like templates expand so we can start nailing down the syntax for future versions and software compatibility. Hopefully we can get that done sooner rather than later. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 02:01, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Provided conditional logic is built into the system some time soon this will all be largely irrelevant. I'd prefer to get rid of the 'hiddenStructure' method in the interim because we <i>know</i> it is bad for accessibility (as opposed to 'qif' which is only hypothetically a 'server load' issue), but if the change is going to be "sooner rather than later" as Brion says the short-term disenfranchisement of users shouldn't do <i>too</i> much damage. If/when conditionals are built in, most 'meta' templates will simply go away as they are replaced by single level 'conditional' templates and even the <i>hypothetical</i> need for this page will end. So, based on the hope that we <b>will</b> get built-in conditional logic <i>soon</i>, I agree with Adrian that we should just ignore it.

<dd>Your understanding is a <strike>deliberate</strike> misinterpretation <strike>pushed</strike>advocated by Netoholic. The crux of Brion's statements (which actually were initially about image use on userpages; WP:AUM came up later in that conversation) was that <b>editorial considerations should not be driven by speculation on server load or other technical issues</b>. Brion said (paraphrasing) "Let me worry about the servers, and you worry about creating a great encyclopedia."

He read the page, and directly said he had no strong objections, so it's not appropriate to say Brion has done anything to "vaporize" this proposal. For example, you interpret "they're fragile" as "can break easily if vandalized". I read his comments and it seemed to me he means "very likely to break if template syntax changes".

<dd><strike>Sigh. You just don't want to hear anything that contradicts your fixed views. The most important part of Brion's statement, IMO, is that editorial considerations shouldn't be driven by speculation about server loads, that this was the job of the developers and that our job is to create an encyclopedia. If nested templates help us do that, then we should use them. It should be possible to reduce their use soon when we get conditionals in the software, but until then, {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} is the best solution we have. <b>The community does not want this as either a policy or a guideline</b>.

<p>As someone who develops production server applications for a living and routinely performs 'live' stress tests this seems <i>very</i> strange to me, but it also appears to be the common reaction so... oh well, we will continue 'reading tea leaves' on whether nested-templates cause significant server load issues or not, hypothetically 'unsafe' numbers of transclusions, et cetera.

<dd>I disagree. The only problem I see with complex templates is their complexity (and the imaginary server load problem, which Brion has said is not our responsibility anyway).

Each template use must be examined on its own, and the options weighed based on some general good practices.

<dd>Even Brion didn't ask to remove all of the server load section. He's confirmed that certainly two templates use more database reads than one, and that any edit of a high-use template could cause short-term problems. Jamesday, who is a database developer and really shouldn't be ignored, also expressed this. Brion hasn't seen proof of a problem, and he wants to own the problem if it presents itself. The question is one of scale and it is still not answered fully, so still has a (tasteful) place on this page. It is no longer #1 reason to AUM, but it's in there as a concern. Templates aren't vandalised too terribly often either, but the <i>concept</i> is one to be wary of... the same goes for server load. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 05:31, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I barely touched the 'weeble' section of the page and, at that, <i>added</i> information about it's most significant drawback. Your statement that it is "in opposition to the premise" of 'avoid using meta-templates' is incomprehensible to me, as you are well aware that the '|if=' parameter (aka 'weeble') method can vastly reduce or completely eliminate meta-template usage.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of conditionals in infoboxes</span></h2>
<p><i>Note: This has been posted both to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_90da.html" title="Template talk:Infobox">Template talk:Infobox</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/m/WT%7EAUM_1fff.html" title="WT:AUM">WT:AUM</a>. I've done several reverts on <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_a3dd.html" title="Template:Infobox">Template:Infobox</a>, and I want to make my own position on the matter clear, rather than just blindly reverting without an explanation.</i> Most of the general talk about "meta-templates" obscures a simple fact. The overwhelming majority of meta-template usages are conditional templates, chiefly {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}}, and the overwhelming majority of conditional usages are for one single purpose: to hide empty sections in infoboxes. According to Brion, there is currently work underway to add native support for conditionals into the MediaWiki software; when this is done, it will clearly be the preferred way to do this, and {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} can then be deprecated. Until that happens, though, we need to have a backup plan. There are currently three primary options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use qif.</li>
<li>Use the hiddenStructure hack.</li>
<li>Fork a single infobox into multiple templates.</li>
</ol>
<p>(2) is unacceptable because it generates horrendous HTML and breaks some client software, including screen readers. (3) is even more unacceptable because it results in a maintainence nightmare (whenever someone wants to change the base infobox design, they have to remember to do so across multiple pages). Furthermore, (3) places more of a burden on <i>article</i> editors. With a well-designed conditional infobox, empty fields will simply be ignored, so users of the infobox need only omit the parameters that are unused; this is quite intutive. In contrast, forking means that editors must remember multiple template titles and spend time figuring out which one to use. By optimizing for ease of editing on the templates themselves (and, as pointed out above, it doesn't even do that very well) we are hurting ease of editing on articles, which affects far more editors.</p>

This eassay here is just a masterpiece of techno-<a href="../../../f/u/d/FUD_f18b.html" title="FUD">FUD</a>, desinged to be used to win edit wars on templates with edit summaries like "rm meta-templates per <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>. Don't revert! This is a policy!". Make some unproven FUD claims ("meta-templates are evil"), hack them up on an WP page, slap "proposal for guideline on it", let the fools fight and demonstrate how they are unable to prove that your claims are wrong, wait until some admin slaps "policy" on it and then you have the perfect sledge hammer. Neto, I must say you are a genious, honestly. But you fail on one important point: the duty of prove is on your side that this essay here is needed. Until then it is pure instruction creep.

<dd>I apologize for the tone. But not for the content. The leniency that has been shown in the past on tonality was indeed remarkable. One might even argue that tonality does not count when enforcing policy. Thank you for reminding me that this is not the "house" style. I'm confident that you will keep an eye on this aspect on all involved parties equally well. Per the evidence, I could say that in fact there was none. The whole crusade was based on hearsay like "the devs have said: beat qif with a stick", which seems not to be much of a convincing evidence. Deriving policy from ugliness on a technical matter is not such a good idea. But that would be rather something for the wiki-forensic departement, given the willingness of Brion to incorporate a conditional function into MediaWiki. I think we have enough fuel for this perpetuum immobile here even when restricting our views to the future only. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 19:15, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And what did I do <i>after</i> he had said this? And as per Jamesday: what is the harm caused by qif? It is not the fact that it is a meta-template as Brion said <i>we shall not care about server load and templates</i>. And as per the tonality: thank you for your "kick in the face" (I dispense with further evidences from my talk page as I do not waste my time with this kind of kindergarten). As per "Dredging up an incorrect version of the past in order to fuel current disagreements is unwelcome": besides the "incorrect" I agree with you. May I ask you to stop taking this thing here personally? I have saveral times explicitly agreed with you on technical claims that you brought up. I'm looking forward to having conditionals in MediaWiki as Brion has announced (and which you oppose). In the mean time, please do what ever you think is needed for the well-going of Wikipedia.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Feb 11 changes by CBD</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=39230630&amp;oldid=39227350" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=39230630&amp;oldid=39227350" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, CBD removed a section describing a problem which has not been fixed. While recently improvements were made to how Whatlinkshere works, in general, with templates, this does not change when speaking strictly about meta-templates. Please read the section carefully, and do your own experiment.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=39231205&amp;oldid=39230630" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=39231205&amp;oldid=39230630" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, he removed several bits about server load. The processing that is required on the back-end is completely supported by dev comments -- what is unclear is to what degree that extra processing actually affects things, please don't confuse the two ideas. The current page already touches very lightly on the server load subject, without going overboard.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39231205" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39231205" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, CBD changed the "POV" of the section. NPOV rules only apply to articles, not this page which is describing a specific position. The difficulty "to implement in conjunction with Wiki table markup" is tangential at best. In the "Blank parameter (aka "Weeble")" section, CBD changed this from being critical of that practice to one describing how easy it is to implement. That is the wrong perspective for this page, since we are seeking to keep both article source and template source as simple as possible. I've ask CBD many times to create a descriptive page (like <a href="../../../h/i/d/Wikipedia%7EHiddenStructure_c11c.html" title="Wikipedia:HiddenStructure">Wikipedia:hiddenStructure</a>), which we could then link from here. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 05:00, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see no point in creating another page for the '|if=' method. That, like the 'hiddenStructure' writeup and this page itself, would eventually be made obsolete by true conditionals. In the meantime I was simply correcting inaccuracies and biases in how information was presented on <i>this</i> page. Even if another (redundant) page <i>were</i> created there would still be no reason to show false or slanted information here. You say 'NPOV' doesn't apply because this is a 'position' document... how can a biased position be made policy? If it isn't balanced/accurate there is no point. If you want this page to simply reflect your opinion rather than facts or consensus then don't list it as a proposed policy... it is an essay and really belongs in your user-space. On 'Whatlinkshere' the remaining issues seem fairly trivial. The continued insistence on including (and exaggerating) the 'server load' issues seems wholly contrary in the face of your prior claim to no longer be concerned with those in regards to <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>... if you no longer think they are a reason driving this proposed policy then why are they such a major, and inflated, part of the write-up? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 09:28, 16 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's really impractical to reply to multiple things at once. How about picking one issue at a time and discussing it? One general point that I want to reply to is your idea of "bias". While I agree a policy page should be accurate, I disagree that policy must be balanced. Take <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, some people, I'm sure, have different opinions on what constitutes a personal attack and what is tolerable (from rudeness to swearing to threats). Should a policy page describe <i>all</i> the opinions? I think that would make any policy page's message most confusing. This page's assertion is focused on saying solidly "Don't use confusing and fragile meta-template schemes. Here's why. There are other methods, but they all have problems too. Consider carefully." I do not ultimately care whay "status" (guideline/policy/nothing) people will eventually assign this ... all I care is that its position is clearly presented. Your "balanced" ideas might be better on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETransclusion_costs_and_benefits_110f.html" title="Wikipedia:Transclusion costs and benefits">Wikipedia:Transclusion costs and benefits</a> - a page that is descriptive and takes no position. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 09:44, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Policy is too extreme</span></h2>
<p>This policy is too extreme. Crazy even. I agree with using meta-templates as little as is practical - but sometimes it is much better to use them than not. For instance, {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} is in templates necessary because it so much better than the alternatives. Any CSS-hack like <a href="../../../h/i/d/Wikipedia%7EHiddenStructure_c11c.html" title="Wikipedia:HiddenStructure">Wikipedia:hiddenStructure</a> is not an option, since it breaks the site for many browsers. Every other alternative makes templates even harder to maintain. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracefool_5e64.html" title="User:Gracefool">··gracefool</a> |<a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracefool_8942.html" title="User talk:Gracefool">☺</a> 12:28, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're working off a broad assumption that conditionals are "necessary" and that the only alternative is the CSS hack.

<dd>I agree with David. Just how long, Netoholic, do you plan on keeping the "proposed" tag in place? It can't be indefinitely; that's unacceptable. Ultimately it will either have to be accepted as {{<a href="../../../p/o/l/Template%7EPolicy_c4c2.html" title="Template:Policy">policy</a>}}, which is very unlikely to happen given the lack of community consensus or developer mandate, or it will have to be {{<a href="../../../r/e/j/Template%7ERejected_0a64.html" title="Template:Rejected">rejected</a>}}. Alternatively, it could be branded an essay, and in that case it should probably be userfied, especially given Netoholic's desire to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> the page.

<p>I object to the rejected tag - there is still some important content to this page. The CSS hacks are not good either, but the fact that we ought avoid meta-templates, CSS hacks, and other non-transparent things does remain true and important.

<dd>That's your <i>opinion</i>. However, many others disagree with you on this, and since there is no longer a mandate from the developers (nor does this relate to any core Foundation issues), community consensus must control. And there's no evidence that the community consensus is, or ever will be, in favor of this proposal. There seem to be about half a dozen staunch supporters, maybe a dozen strong opponents, and the rest of Wikipedia really doesn't much care. This amounts to no consensus. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 20:27, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The forthcoming native support for conditional templates will render this entire issue moot.

<li><b>Accept</b> as guideline <b>only</b>. The harmful effects cited are reasons to be careful about meta-templates and to be reasonably certain that the benefits of a particular meta-template are justified by its risks. These do not justify (as I have seen done) the speedying or automatic vote to delete of any possible metatemplate.

<ul>
<li>There are metatemplates that will never be very widely used.</li>
<li>Some widely used templates are not metas.

<ul>
<li>Why is vandalism of widely-used templates a valid concern? As pointed out before, anything can be vandalized, and any vandalism can be reverted. Why should we restrict an extremely beneficial feature for the sake of vandalism? We allow anyone to edit any page without even logging in. If vandalism were that much of a concern, wouldn't we turn off anonymous editing? Please explain how vandalism of templates is any different than vandalism of articles. How many times have templates been vandalized, and how much long-term damage has it caused?
<ul>
<li>"Very widely used" means something like a majority of non-stub articles. Vandalism of such a template, especially when used indirectly, so it's hard to fix, will vandalize <i>all</i> those articles simultaneously. To say something is a valid concern is not to say that it is the only valid concern, or should always be deferred to. Guidelines are overridden daily for good reason. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 18:01, 4 March 2006 (UTC)
<ol>
<li>It is not "hard to fix" a vandalized template. Not even a meta-meta-sub-meta-template. It might take a minute longer to navigate to, but that's it. A few people are bound to have it directly on their watchlist anyway. Likewise, the reversion happens on <i>all</i> those articles simultaneously, too. It's not worth the revert wars, fighting, and crippling of functionality.</li>
<li>The templates that are as "<a href="../../../h/i/g/Wikipedia%7EHigh-risk_templates_dce7.html" title="Wikipedia:High-risk templates">very widely used</a>" as you suggest are already <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_permanently_protected_pages_21e9.html#High_use_templates" title="Wikipedia:List of permanently protected pages">protected from editing</a>.

As long as these sub or meta-templates are documented somewhere, I don't really see the problem with using them when and where they make sense to make the template code easier to understand. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 16:50, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If this here means going willy nilly extincting every qif at all cost despite knowing we will get a MediaWiki built-in conditional function, then I reject it. I also reject it if it has "Generally accepted by editors" or guideline/policy tag. I also reject it if this means replace qif on the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Category%7EInfobox_templates_421c.html" title="Category:Infobox templates">Infobox templates</a> with <a href="../../../h/i/d/Wikipedia%7EHiddenStructure_c11c.html" title="Wikipedia:HiddenStructure">Wikipedia:hiddenStructure</a> or nothing at all. But that doesn't mean we should pile up layers of templates without good reason. And we actually <i>do</i> have some damn good reasons for at least two layers. That's where we disagree here. If you shoot qif, I will do weeble. It is not a meta template technique, and thus compliant with <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>.

<dd>It's not a matter if there are other alternatives for every use of meta-temples, but are they less "ugly" then using meta-templates. So far, the only mandate we have received from a developer on this issue was to avoid ugly implementations of meta-templates. Unfortunately, "ugly" is in the eye of the beholder. But that doesn't give anyone license to remove one form of ugliness with a solution that is just as ugly if not uglier.</dd>
<dd>Take for example the use of optional fields in an infobox. One could use a series of subpages, using the meta-template<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a> or the <a href="../../../h/i/d/Wikipedia%7EHiddenStructure_c11c.html" title="Wikipedia:HiddenStructure">hiddenStructure</a> CSS class. <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubpages_22af.html" title="Wikipedia:Subpages">Wikipedia:Subpages</a> advises us not to using subpages except for a few <i>specific</i> exceptions--none which involve optional fields in an infobox. So with that option ruled out, that leaves qif and hiddenStructure. Both of the two remaining options have their ugliness which has been gone over a thousand times — qif is a meta-template, hiddenStructure produces ugly HTML and has accessibility issues. But to which of these methods is uglier is left entirely to an editor's point of view. In my opinion, the hiddenStructure method is uglier. You, on the other hand, clearly disagree. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a> 18:49, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd suggest continuing with past practice. This page was previously 'Policy <b>*</b>'. That is, it had a special unique 'policy' tag to indicate the questionable nature of the policy classification. Then when that classification was found to be incorrect efforts were made to classify this as a 'guideline' or 'proposal'... but again a special tag had to be used because there were disagreements about the status of the page. So, in reference to the debate over 'rejected' vs 'historical' - just make another unique tag. To be precise, the page was rejected, forced into policy status based on (false) claims of developer mandate, removed from policy status by the lead developer, and now rejected again. Personally, I think 'rejected' is all that needs to be said about that, but if it helps people to move on then we can put in a special box with a bit of the background. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 20:20, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The portions of this that are relevent are not a matter for voting - we do avoid opaque pages, we do avoid pages that make high-speed vandalism a trivial effort, we do avoid permanantly protected pages. Therefore we avoid meta-templates where we can.

<dd>Two of those three arguments could be applied to <i>any</i> template. (Should we "avoid using" all of them?) Also, there is no consensus that we shouldn't permanently protect high-use templates; many have suggested that we <i>should</i> do just that. Finally, the above is based upon the assumption that meta-templates' drawbacks outweigh their benefits—purely an opinion. Again, templates themselves have drawbacks, but no one is proposing that we do away with them. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 21:58, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

This one is not, and no matter how many people you get to insist that it is, it will not magically become a good idea to load pages with uneditable vandalism magnets. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 00:53, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And who decides whether a policy is "wrong", and on what basis? With a very few exceptions (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, developer issues, etc.) the community does. What you're arguing here is that you can make up whatever policy you want regardless of community consensus and that just isn't true no matter how much you might wish it. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 01:05, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, we can all agree that a) article opacity is bad; b) enabling high-speed vandalism is bad; and c) permanent page protection is bad. These are all valid principles that help make Wikipedia what it is. What is left for the community to decide, however, is whether a, b, and c add up to "Avoid using meta-templates", and just how strong that admonition is. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color:#072764">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color:#c6011f">79</span></a> 01:23, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Meta-templates are no more 'vandalism magnets' than any frequently used template. Insulting the majority who recognize that fact does not make your position stronger. There are plenty of templates which are <i>hypothetical</i> vandalism targets that don't have any nesting involved. The only added 'vandalism danger' of meta-templates is that on heavily nested templates it might require an extra thirty seconds to sort through the nested layers (which are listed right on the page) to find which linked template was actually vandalized. That's hardly cause for concern. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 17:27, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any 'server load' issues with this are generally insignificant, but for templates which vary on a single parameter I like the '/' method. The 'User wikipedia' templates are a good example. These used to be 'User Wikipedia|RCP', 'User Wikipedia|NPA', et cetera. They were replaced with 'User Wikipedia/RC Patrol' and the like. This allowed some minor reduction in server load, but also made the templates easier to update/maintain... users can just create a new template with the right name rather than having to work it into the switching logic at the single 'User Wikipedia' template. On the other hand, for templates with multiple parameters like <a href="../../../t/a/x/Template%7ETaxobox_3269.html" title="Template:Taxobox">Template:Taxobox</a> multiple sub-templates is messy and conditionals work better. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 01:16, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I favor whatever is easiest for the <i>article</i> editors, as they vastly outnumber template editors and the articles is what this project is all about anyway. In many cases, using {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} to hide empty parts of boxes or structures makes things far easier for article editors since all they then have to do is omit the unused fields, not juggle around different templates for different purposes. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 06:55, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Despite the noise about the server load, that does not appear to be the current concern of this policy, which has changed to other issues. Per CBDunkerson on the rest, good question.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Example</span></h2>
<p>Netoholic has been asking above for an example for which meta-templates are <i>necessary</i>. This is an extreme demand; <i>any</i> functionality can in principle be done in other ways. A computer is a Turing machine, after all.</p>
<p>The following example (and I choose a fictitious, but quite plausible, one intentionally) is of an example of a reasonable and natural use of a meta-template, which does not involve a high percentage of our million articles:</p>
<p>Suppose the following consensus:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Canadian navigation templates should have a base marking them as Canadian</li>
<li>This base should be identical in all the templates, and contain some minimal symbols and data on Canada.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, the base will be changed from time to time, either to reflect evoloving WP consensus on Canadian issues, or political changes ouside WP.</li>
</ul>
<p>One way to implement this is to have the Canadian templates call a common subtemplate Template:Canada template base. Let us consider the harmful effects of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any editor who can edit a template at all should be able to understand this. It is rather easier to edit and maintain than (e.g.) the templates that would result by transcluding the common area into the individual nav templates.</li>
<li>"What links here" will be only slightly worse than usual. Any confusion could be managed by, for example, keeping a list of Canada nav templates on Template talk: Canada template base</li>
<li>This is not a target for vandalism. This whole structure would only affect those pages which are so strongly involved with Canada to have nav templates. This may well be a thousand pages, but not ten thousand.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 18:03, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To use your example... making a change to a series of related templates is no more difficult than making a changes to a series of pages using any one template. If whatever common text needs to be changed, it can be done fairly quickly. The question is first - how often is "Template:Canada template base" to be changed? Are those changes important or frivolous? Is the template base important or frivolous? Should we be using lists ot categories instead of navigation boxes? .... and a dozen more questions that need to be thought about. Using a meta-template scheme is often a lazy shortcut to avoid a good design discussion. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 04:58, 6 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How many Canadian nav templates are there? <i>Of course</i> having to alter all of them is more difficult and time-consuming than altering one common text; and making sure that they are <i>all</i> altered the same way would be another and yet more troublesome step.
<ul>
<li>If this logic were valid, it would lead to having no templates at all, for altering each article separately would be no more trouble that altering the template.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lists and categories are useless in this example; we are considering common elements in already existing templates.</li>
<li>I chose Canada because I have seen three Wikipedia controversies which would cause changes in such a base template:
<ul>
<li>Quebec v. the rest of Canada</li>
<li>Clear representation of the Canadian provincial flags, which are heraldic and quartered.</li>
<li>The nature and status of the Crown in Canada.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outside WP, such a template might well change at
<ul>
<li>The fall of a Canadian government.</li>
<li>The prospect of a Canadian election.</li>
<li>The death of Queen Elizabeth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No change which averts a revert war is frivolous; and all of these have the potential to involve one. A revert war involving most of the Canadian templates would be at least as damaging to WP as, and a greater load on the servers than, changing the base template (which might well be protected). <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 16:07, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
