<h2><span class="mw-headline">Archived poll</span></h2>
<p>This was a poll to discuss adopting [[Wikipedia::Avoid trivia sections in articles]]. I found a consensus to exist for the adoption of the proposal. The voting saw 43 votes cast, 27 in favour, offering a 62% majority. Although at the weak end of establishing consensus, I note <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> appears to have amended his vote, which would alter the result. It also appears a number of objections are grounded on the idea that people will continue to add trivia sections. I think those opinions can be somewhat discounted, since they don't address the proposal itself, which offers advice on how to deal with such circumstances. We don't abolish <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> because people continuously add articles which require deletion. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 12:57, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I very much agree with eliminating trivia sections. This does <b>not</b> mean eliminating the information within them. The problem is, a section entitled Trivia looks extremely amateurish, and strongly implies that the information within it is irrelevant. Sometimes it is irrelevant; then it should be removed. Often, though, it's perfectly relevant information, and then it should be incorporated into the text rather than placed in a section which marks it as irrelevant. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 10:58, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>PS 'Avoid trivia in articles' is a bit of a misnomer, and 'Avoid trivia sections' would be more accurate. I think that Deco's suggested guideline below is ideal; I'd support its inclusion into the appropriate 'How to write great articles' pages. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 11:02, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b> the guideline as rephrased by Deco. Encouraging to bring structure to a loose list of trivia will improve the quality of the concerned articles. âˆ’<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoodstone_16af.html" title="User:Woodstone">Woodstone</a> 12:09, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> Per Worldtraveller. The information can be good sometimes, but a trivia thing makes it look, well, trivial, and that's where you get a lot of IPs putting in information that either shouldn't be there or is written poorly. I guess it could work as a net of sorts, but I've a feeling it will be reduced if the section just isn't there. --<a href="../../../n/i/r/User%7ENiroht_1118.html" title="User:Niroht">Niroht</a> 12:19, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>PS I forgot to mention explicitly that this support is for Deco's suggested guideline.<a href="../../../n/i/r/User%7ENiroht_1118.html" title="User:Niroht">Niroht</a> 18:06, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><b>Support</b> as above. If there's interesting information, it should be merged into the article, not just thrown in a random list at the end. It makes Wikipedia look like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. I largely agree with Deco's suggested guideline on this page, but I am in favour of removing the section whenever possible (not deleting it and removing the information, but merging it in, then removing). -- Mithent 14:10, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> Very unencyclopedic section, which should be included in the main article. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudgesurreal777_ae43.html" title="User:Judgesurreal777">Judgesurreal777</a> 19:00, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> Even though some of the people against the topic say the Wikipedia should not be a "stuffy encyclopedia", the fact remains that it <b>is</b> an encyclopedia and we need to make sure it stays one. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalso_Snell_62ac.html" title="User:Balso Snell">Balso Snell</a> 02:15, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> Trivia suggests virtually irrelevant or a comic sidebar related to (say) objects of cult of personality. If it's irrelevant it should be omitted. Humorous sidelights can be included as part of a perspective. Statistics should be included in body. User:frostfree 20:21 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b>. Trivia sections make articles look so amateur. We're an encyclopedia folks, not an indescriminate repository of facts. Material in trivia sections should either be incorporated into the rest of the article smoothly where important, and deleted where unimportant. That has been extremely long standing practice on <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>.

<li><b>Support</b> - This is an encyclopedia, not a trivia book. Trivia sections are good to start, but ideally should be replaced with real prose.

<li><b>Support</b>. Absolutely. Trivia = trivial = unencyclopedic. The content of many trivia (or similarly named sections) is crufty and offers nothing substantial in understanding the subject at hand. Wikipedia should not be a repository for every random fact about every subject, and information should be included because it's relevant, not just because the fact exists. If the information illuminates the subject it should be incorporated into the article text (and the more relevant the information, the easier it is to incorporate it) and if not, deleted. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 13:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Support</b>. The addition of endless amounts of trivia is the single biggest reason why good articles in Wikipedia become mediocre or even poor articles. This guideline is definitely needed. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 06:47, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Oppose</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Weak oppose.</b> Often part of what makes an article engaging and more tasty than dry toast is the inclusion of "did you know" type facts, especially in biographical pages. The observation that such facts can (and should) be incorporated into the main text undercuts the proposal on its face. Not sure such a guideline is required.--<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradPatrick_8f2f.html" title="User:BradPatrick">BradPatrick</a> 02:43, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose.</b> I rather enjoy the trivia sections of many articles. They may not be encyclopedic like we're used to, but they add something a more stuffy encyclopedia can't. But Wikipedia shouldn't be a <i>stuffy</i> encyclopedia, it should be an <i>interesting</i> and <i>engaging</i> one. <a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETiroDeAethra_eba7.html" title="User:TiroDeAethra">Tiro de Aethra</a> 06:58, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak oppose</b> per <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradPatrick_8f2f.html" title="User:BradPatrick">BradPatrick</a>, although perhaps a better name than "Trivia" can be thought of for these sections â€“ <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 08:24, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>.

<li><b>Oppose</b>. I am not sure that having a trivia section actually hurts us or our articles. As has been mentioned above, it can be a useful place for some editors to "dump" information they do not know how to incorporate. What seperate Wikipedia from other encyclopedias is the very fact that we are able to include extra bits of trivia as we are not limited by space. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 10:29, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I really like Deco's suggested changes to the proposal, I think this is far more in the spirit of Wikipedia. I would certainly support these alterations being made. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 11:06, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><s><b>Oppose</b>. Have you read the past discussion on the Pump regarding these? The proposal is not at all well thought-out, in that it attempts to make silly concrete restrictions that are easy to get around and don't drive to the essential point. I believe trivia sections are useful for organizing an article or in progress or for collecting small miscellaneous facts that don't belong anywhere else, but would sure attempt to minimize them. I've drawn up a guideline below that I think gets more at the root of the issue. We do <i>not</i> need a policy on this. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 10:43, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</s> (moved to support)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b> There's nothing unencyclopaedic about having a "trivia" section, titled accordingly. Reshuffling a whole article to incorporate a single miscellaneous fact is foolhardy. A trivia section adds completeness to an article, whilst ensuring that trivial or miscellaneous factoids are not mixed up with the more weighty and noteworthy matters dealt with in the rest of the article. <a href="../../../w/a/g/User%7EWaggers_8e5b.html" title="User:Waggers">Waggers</a> 11:12, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> Allowing editors to put miscellaneous facts at the end of the article allows future editors to incorporate what useful tidbits there are into the article when appropriate sections are created. Removing trivia sections will slow down the pace at which interesting bits of information can be assimilated, thus limiting the pace at which any given article can grow. That and trivia sections can be interesting by themselves. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 13:08, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> per above, trivia sections can make the article more interesting, and while they often could use cleanup and better integration (we should <i>never</i> need to split trivia sections into seperate articles like the ones currently on AfD), I see no reason to avoid them altogether. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/y/User_talk%7EBryanG_f39b.html" title="User talk:BryanG">(talk)</a></sup> 20:29, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. Trivia can occasionally be interesting, but even if it's not, it's a productive way to get people involved in the project if don't know anything much of actual use. It should be in its own section because, well, it's trivial. If it gets too long, make it a subpage and only keep a few notable tidbits (if there are any) on the main article page. â€”<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;â€¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 21:57, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Oppose</b>. Amusing little factlets are fun to read, and should be preserved. Yes, they are unencyclopedic, and that's exactly why they should be isolated into the trivia section so that they do not disturb the serious text.<a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunainen_N%C3%B6rtti_4c72.html" title="User:Punainen NÃ¶rtti">Punainen NÃ¶rtti</a> 12:37, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, the trivia itself is encyclopedic, but the header Trivia is. Sorry if the title of the guideline is misleading. --<a href="../../../o/s/b/User%7EOsbus_07fa.html" title="User:Osbus">Osbus</a> 13:58, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>A basic fact about wikipedia is that it's an encyclopaedia. All else is secondary. Therefore, unencyclopaedic information cannot be included, no matter how fun to read it is. That's simply not negotiable. The problem here is that encyclopaedic information is being put into a section whose title screams 'unencyclopaedic!'. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 15:27, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly...this guideline seeks to eliminate the title of Trivia or Did you know. --<a href="../../../o/s/b/User%7EOsbus_07fa.html" title="User:Osbus">Osbus</a> 16:29, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note to all oppose:This is intended to be a guideline for editing, defintely not a policy. Even if a Trivia section is renamed to Did you know..., I feel that is better.

<li><b>Strong Oppose</b>. theres no need for this, the trivia section is fun to read especially to someone who doesn't want to read 10 pages of text and just has a glancing interest in someone. the trivia part could then make the reader read the rest of the article.</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. People add this stuff any way so it's better that trivia gets isolated into its own section.</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. It would be weird to be reading an article about a movie and then suddenly talk about a continuity error in the scene described in the plot section. Just one example. <a href="../../../a/p/h/User%7EAphoenixnamedBOB_a938.html" title="User:AphoenixnamedBOB"><font color="#CC0000">Bob</font></a> <a href="../../../a/p/h/User_talk%7EAphoenixnamedBOB_3eba.html" title="User talk:AphoenixnamedBOB"><font color="#FF6600">the</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AphoenixnamedBOB_3539.html" title="Special:Contributions/AphoenixnamedBOB"><font color="#FFCC00">Phoenix</font></a> 00:29, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Undecided</b> for the simple reason that while I see good reasons for this, I also see good reasons against it. Sorry I can't break the current tie. Here is how I see it, after reading an article that is so loaded with information and impecable grammar and words that require me to open a dictionary, a trivia section is a nice place for my mind to unwind. The grammar may be a bit looser with the wording a little less formal. Sure, there may be few who care that a politician owns a dozen cats, that a city's underground has a reputation for some small little local thing that may only be known in that city's county, or that a game was redesigned in the home of one of the programmer's grandmother. Those tidbits are not really significant, but they are a way to unwind after reading the details of that politician's political career, the city's rich history, and the game's myriad of features. Who knows, one day that politician may vote on a pet bill that is important and the vote cast was for the cats, the city's underground may produce a notable band, and the programmer's grandmother (well who knows about that lady's past). These tidbits might then come to the fore and be very important. Leave them in for now, but make sure to keep the trivia section clean.<br />
